<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) asked me a question, which he had first raised on 21 November, concerning an incident involving the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) which occurred during a division on 19 November. In raising the matter on 21 November, the honourable member asked if I would instruct the member for Cowper to apologise to the House for moving from one side of the House to the other after tellers were appointed for a division. The honourable member for Cowper on his own initiative unreservedly apologised to the House on the same day and I considered the matter closed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday, the honourable member for Hotham asked me if the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Votes and Proceedings</EMPHASIS> need to be altered. It is not unusual for members to be still moving around the chamber when tellers are appointed. Indeed, yesterday, when a division was called on an amendment moved by the honourable member for Hotham, many members were still moving to seats after the chair had appointed the tellers. Whilst this is undesirable, it is not an infrequent occurrence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Cowper has unreservedly apologised to the House for moving late in the piece. As far as I am concerned, the matter is closed and I do not propose to make any alterations to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Votes and Proceedings</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></INTERJECT></PROCTEXT>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I can respond to yet another intemperate interjection from the leader of government business, the commitment that the Speaker made was to come back and report to the House on this matter. It is not sufficient, in my view, for the member for Cowper to simply come in here, make an apology and then for it to be assumed that the matter is closed. There is an obligation to come back and report to this House on what has been a clear movement by not just any member of the House but the person who is the Deputy Speaker of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all very well to say that people move around the place and that people are slow, but this is a circumstance on which I took a point of order on the night. It was a very tense evening because we were being denied the opportunity to move amendments on which there had been previous agreement that we should be allowed to move. I was attempting to get the call to suspend standing orders to put what we believed we had an undertaking to enable us to put.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I took the point of order in the division. I took it immediately. Therefore, I make the distinction between this and the point you made to me yesterday in relation to the Costello incident that I should have raised it at the time. I might say on that point that I was conscious of the fact that I was being held away from the dispatch box, but I viewed the video after I left the place that night&mdash;and you might recall that we did not sit on the Wednesday because the President of the United States was here. But I took the opportunity at the first available instance to draw your attention to the video because I think it demonstrates what was a clear attempt to prevent me from getting to the dispatch box.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Tuesday night was a very difficult period. All I am saying is that we believe that agreements were breached. It is in those circumstances that we are entitled to pursue every tactic and every interest that we are capable of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the point was made to the Deputy Speaker of the House, he said on the night that he was not in breach. Not only did I take a point of order that night in relation to this, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the member for Chifley (Mr Price) did too. Standing order 202 is quite specific. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the tellers being appointed, every Member within the seats allotted to Members shall vote and no Member may move from his or her place until the result of the division is announced.</PARA>
<PARA>On the night when you asked the member for Cowper to reflect, he effectively said he was in the place at the right time. I accept that you were entitled on that night to accept his word, but I invited you to view the video. What is clear from the video is that, once the tellers were appointed, the angle shot of this chamber shows the member for Cowper moving from his seat in complete contravention of standing order 202.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may be that others who are new to this place and others who have been in this place and do not read the standing orders because they are difficult to comprehend&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="REITH" NAMEID="WI4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr Reith</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You have trouble with them.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All of us have difficulty with them, but my point is not the Deputy Speaker, not the person who aspires to office in this place, not the second most important presiding officer in the chamber, not that person. So let us not have any silly quips from your side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people put themselves up for office to uphold the standing orders of this place, to enforce the procedures. The simple fact of the matter is that what the member for Cowper did was in contravention of standing order 202. I do not believe that there is any question about that. I do not believe that a simple apology is sufficient, although I accept that that is important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He gave you wrong advice, in my view, on the night. Had he given you the correct advice on the night, the issue could have been corrected at the time in accordance with standing order 208. You could have recommitted the division or asked the member to return to his seat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that that time has passed; the vote has been taken. What now needs to be done, in my view, is have the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Votes and Proceedings</EMPHASIS> corrected to reflect the fact that the member for Cowper moved from where he was sitting and he should not have been able to do it. I argue this very strongly, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7616"> because I think we have had difficult circumstances in this place over the last few weeks. I know that tensions have run high, but I think that we have an obligation, if in fact anything is to be taken by the lifting of the standards, the independence of rulings and all of those sorts of things, to enforce standing orders where there have been clear breaches of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, because the time has passed for correction under standing order 208, I would suggest to you that what needs to be reflected in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Votes and Proceedings</EMPHASIS> is where the member for Cowper was sitting when the tellers were appointed. I would urge you to reflect on that point. It is all very well to say that we are not going to enter into video replays and all those sorts of things. The simple fact of the matter is these are matters of record now. There are times when everyone can have different interpretations. In the heat of the moment people say things and then, after they have reflected on them, realise they were wrong and come back into the House and say so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge the fact that the member for Cowper did the right thing at an early opportunity, but at the time when we could have corrected this under 208, either because of wrong information to you or because there was uncertainty about precisely what had been involved, we accepted what had been said. I know of in what detailed form you have gone through what was at issue yesterday in relation to the correction of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record for the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) and the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). I say you have to go through the same level of detail here and you have to, as a consequence of that, correct the record in terms of the vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Cowper was not entitled to move. You know he was not entitled to move. The standing orders say he was not entitled to move. But, most importantly, the member for Cowper knew he should not have moved. He is the Deputy Speaker of this House. He, second to you only, has the responsibility to uphold the standing orders in this place. The fact that he did not do it I think is a sad reflection, but he has apologised. What is now <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> needed is for the votes to reflect where he sat and be therefore altered accordingly.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(9.41 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On indulgence, Mr Speaker, just to briefly respond to the remarks made by the Manager of Opposition Business, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), and to add to the comments which you have made on this matter. I must say that I do think that the Manager of Opposition Business is attempting to make a mountain out of a molehill. The member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) acted entirely reasonably. The point was put that he apologised without reservation to the House. He could not have acted in a more appropriate way in accordance with the spirit of the forms and procedures of this House&mdash;unlike, I must say, one previous occasion when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) withdrew but failed to apologise, which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) reminded us of yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I do think just taking a commonsense approach to this matter would lead us to the conclusion that the intent of the standing orders is that, when we have a division, a division is called, the bells are rung, people come into the chamber and everybody, as the standing orders basically say, has to take their seat so the tellers can work out who is on which side. Obviously, in that process we have people coming in late, they are not sure which side they are going to sit on and they are not sure what the division is about. Many a time we have seen people work out what is actually happening and finally take their seat in a proper way. This is human nature. This is a sort of practical, commonsense outcome of the system we have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you said, Mr Speaker, in your short statement&mdash;and a short statement, quite frankly, is all that is necessary to dispose of this matter, despite the long speech we have had from the member for Hotham:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . yesterday, when a division was called on an amendment moved by the honourable member for Hotham, many members were still moving to seats after the chair had appointed the tellers.</PARA>
<PARA>What you say is perfectly right, a fair reflection. Even only yesterday we had such an example. It is not a big thing. In fact, there is nothing in this. To make a song and dance <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7617"> about it as the Manager of Opposition Business does just makes me wonder why he should do so.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Okay; why didn't you get up yesterday and say that it is dreadful that all these experienced members on your side had not taken their seats at the time the tellers were appointed? Why didn't you say so? Because it would be an absolute absurdity for you to do so. Your claim that the member for Cowper is an experienced member, which he is&mdash;he is highly respected in the chamber for his experience, competence and the like&mdash;is not a strong point in support of your argument, because the reality is that the same could be said of a whole lot of people yesterday who were not seated at the point in time when the tellers were appointed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I am on about is the most you could say is that there was an inadvertent delayed move for which an apology has been made and the Speaker has ruled on the matter. That is basically it. That is the end of the game. I do not need to delay the House but to simply reinforce our view of the matter: the Speaker's statement is a sensible, commonsense approach to the issue. On that basis, we would expect that the commonsense approach to the standing order will continue to be applied by the chair.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On indulgence, Mr Speaker, if I can just make a small contribution from an independent perspective. I agree with the Leader of the House (Mr Reith). If I may say so, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> , on my reading of it, entirely supports your statement. In fact, the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), having apologised, probably was doing so in deference to the interests of the House. He perhaps has overreacted, in a sense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> gives not only the precedent but also, in my view, the theme of how a division should be counted or how divisions should be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> conducted, to the extent where on a couple of occasions the House has accepted members crossing after the appointment of tellers. As we all know, when there are errors in the counting of divisions, the errors are often corrected by agreement between, for instance, the whips of the respective parties or other interested parties to ensure that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Votes and Proceedings</EMPHASIS> are in fact an accurate record of what took place in the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to reflect on one aspect of this. Obviously the configuration of the House and the way in which divisions are conducted give rise often to difficulties in movement. Mr Speaker, you have obviously reflected on the point raised by not only the member for Hotham but also, I think, another member who felt that he was physically prevented from moving freely in the chamber. That is something of concern to me as a member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, you were not present last night&mdash;the Deputy Speaker was&mdash;when I brought attention to the fact that the Chief Government Whip and the Leader of the House were moving around and speaking to members during a debate. I feel strongly that, in divisions in particular&mdash;given the size of the House and the fact that sometimes members come into the chamber at the very last minute, having arrived perhaps from the furthest point in the House, often the library or elsewhere&mdash;at times it is difficult to be able to ascertain how one ought to vote and to which side of the House one ought to go. I know that members of parties often walk in, look for their nearest friends or allies and join them.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QT4">Mr FILING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was just going to make that observation. The Chief Government Whip has assisted me by making the observation that, if you are exercising your conscience on every single motion that is before the House, then quite clearly&mdash;if you have just marched into the chamber at the very last instance before the bells have stopped ringing, having arrived from, say, the library committee, which is conducted right at the other end of the building&mdash;you need to be able to be in a position to ascertain exactly what the motion <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7618"> is that you are voting on. Sometimes that is impossible to ascertain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, if you are in the library committee or somewhere else, it is very difficult to know exactly what is being conducted in the chamber at that particular time. When I come into the chamber, I will often ask the clerks or whoever is at the clerks bench what exactly is the question before the House. That obviously takes some time, particularly if there are amendments available on the table for a member to make their mind up on and to exercise their vote according to their conscience.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QT4">Mr FILING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Sturt, in interjecting, betrays unfortunately an aspect of the partisan system that we have, where in fact many members unfortunately&mdash;and of course their constituents probably do not know this&mdash;walk in, look for their mate and do not have a clue what they are voting on. The worst case offenders unfortunately are on this side of the House&mdash;the members of the Labor Party. They are in fact committed in writing to doing that each and every time. I know the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) has most recently exercised his conscience to cross the floor and vote according to his conscience and the interests of his constituents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I agree with the Leader of the House: this is a mountain being made out of a molehill. I cannot for the life of me understand why the Manager of Opposition Business is interested in somehow persecuting Deputy Speaker Nehl for what quite clearly is provided for in the standing orders and in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS>&mdash;that is, obviously for him to be able to move to the position which he wants to be in to represent the interests of his constituents and to vote freely in this chamber.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raised a point of order at the time. There are a few points that I would like <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to make. Firstly, it is  important that one recognises that the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) has apologised to the House, and I thank him for that, and I am sure is interested in ensuring the good conduct of the House. Secondly, it is important that all members, no matter what rank in this place, at all times should assist you, Mr Speaker, with regard to fulfilling the standing orders or in the way we report our actions so that you can adequately rule on them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot has been said about how the events occurred and I just want to take up the remark by the Leader of the House, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), that this was similar to members of parliament meandering into the House and assuming a seat. Of course the reality is, and I understand the video would show, that the issue arose in relation to the member for Cowper occupying one seat and then moving to another, which is a completely different issue from people arriving or meandering in late.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last but not least, the Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), has raised the issue of how the vote should be recorded in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Votes and Proceedings</EMPHASIS>. I, too, think that, whilst accepting unreservedly the apology of the member for Cowper, the vote should be altered to reflect what physically happened.</PARA></SPEECH>

However, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), when he was speaking earlier, indicated that he believed that I had misled you, Mr Speaker, when you questioned me following the points of order on that night. Mr Speaker, I felt that it was incorrect for the member for Hotham to do that and I remind you that you said:</PARA></TALK.START>

The video, which I have seen since I made my apology, clearly shows that at the start of the division and when the division was called I was sitting in that seat.

<PARA>The government announced the termination of the FHS scheme in the 1996-97 budget. The effect of the bill will be to prevent people who are not entitled to receive FHS payments on the cut-off date from obtaining FHS support. The cut-off date will be 28 days after this bill receives royal assent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those people who are entitled to receive farm household support payments on the cut-off date, transitional provisions will permit them to continue to receive support until such time as they are no longer eligible. Permitting continued access to farm household support payments will require that the access be unbroken. Once a person becomes ineligible to receive farm household support payments, that person cannot be paid farm household support payments at a later date. Other aspects of the farm household support scheme remain unchanged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The operation of the drought relief payment, the DRP, administered under the Farm Household Support Act 1992, is unchanged by the termination of the farm household support scheme in all but one regard. Those former farm household support recipients who have transferred to the DRP and who are still receiving DRP support on the farm household <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7622"> support cut-off date will not be able to transfer back to farm household support after the cut-off date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment should be considered in the context of the government's announcement on 4 November 1996 of an additional $81.5 million package of drought recovery assistance to help thousands of farmers to recover from drought. A major element of the package is the extension of drought relief payment support to 12 months for eligible farmers. Farmers in regions where drought exceptional circumstances were revoked in June 1996 will be able to apply for DRP support to help meet their day-to-day living expenses for a further six months to June 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Special assessment for Austudy by the exclusion of on-farm assets from the assets test will also continue, as will special access to health care cards, family payments and parenting allowance. Support also continues for farm families still in drought exceptional circumstances areas in Queensland and New South Wales. I am expecting a report soon from the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council on these areas. Farm families will be eligible for continued DRP support for a further 12 months after the date of revocation for their areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, my colleague the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman, has convened a special rural task force to investigate the impact of the social security assets test on farmers. The task force will look at how the assets test affects farmers who cannot sell their property due to market conditions, who stay on small or non-viable land holdings which cannot generate income beyond the age pension limit or who cannot subdivide and sell their land due to government restrictions.

<PARA>This bill proposes an amendment to the Public Service Act 1922 (the act) to deal with a procedural flaw in the discipline provisions of the act. Currently, because of a procedural flaw, the act does not enable the bringing of valid discipline charges against officers of the Australian Public Service who have resumed duties in a department of the service after a period of unattachment where the misconduct alleged took place when the officer was an `unattached officer' as defined in the act.</PARA>

Because of differences in the nature of the employment relationship, the procedure for disciplining unattached officers differs from that for disciplining officers occupying substantive positions.</PARA>

<PARA>The Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Bill introduces a historic innovation to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7623"> public administration in Australia with the establishment of the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency, which was announced as part of the 1996 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The establishment of the agency will be a major change in service delivery arrangements for the Commonwealth. Although it will initially encompass the full suite of income security payments and services currently provided by the Department of Social Security, together with a number of employment and child&hyphen;care services, it will have the potential to add to these over time. It will provide an administrative framework for integrating access to Commonwealth services by consolidating services so that, where possible, people can get the help they need in one place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's objectives in creating the agency are to provide a much better standard of service delivery to the community and to individuals; and to increase service delivery efficiency and effectiveness. The government wishes to shift the focus and direction of customer service from the mechanics of transaction and process to one which is centred on individuals and their needs. The scope of the agency's activities will cover services to the retired, families, the unemployed, carers and widows, the short&hyphen;term incapacitated and people with disabilities. It will be the public presence for some of the most sensitive social responsibilities of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> It makes sense to consolidate services so that, where possible, people can access them in one place. For example, unemployed people will only have to go to one agency office to seek income support rather than having to go to both DSS and CES offices respectively as at present. In this way the agency will be a significant step to reducing the complexity of government for individuals and the community. The agency will deliver services for a number of portfolios and integrate these into a common point of customer contact. The clear principle underlying the concept of the agency is the government's commitment to put the needs of people for high quality service delivery above the boun daries of Commonwealth departments and agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agency will be an organisation focused on, and specialising in, customer service. It will do this by simplifying and streamlining service delivery through an integrated and national network of offices. It will have a charter, including a guarantee to customers of certain standards of service. The current DSS network of regional offices, together with its teleservice centres, family service centres and retirement service centres, will go to the agency and form the core of its service outlets. It will also take on some offices that are now part of the CES network along with the student assistance centres. The agency will also provide a means for integrating the existing services for some groups needing specialist assistance and continue to recognise that the arrangements for these groups of clients require sensitive and careful consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agency will be located in the social security portfolio, given that the largest component of its activities will be the administration of entitlements under social security legislation. In designing the framework for the agency, the government has taken into account the need for ministerial involvement to ensure accountability, sufficient flexibility to allow greater capacity for innovation and improved customer service and the need to ensure a strong partnership between policy and process design and service delivery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agency is a core part of government operations. All the mainstream legislation for the operation of Commonwealth departments and agencies will apply to this agency. It will be subject to the Audit Act, finance regulations and finance directions. This reflects the fact that the agency will not be a separate entity from the Commonwealth. The government considers that these scrutiny and accountability arrangements are central to the management structures for the agency given that it will be responsible for the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day administration of large sums of public moneys.</PARA>

The principal aim of mutual recognition is to remove impediments to trans&hyphen;Tasman trade in goods and the mobility of labour caused by regulatory differences among Australian jurisdictions and New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill implements the trans&hyphen;Tasman mutual recognition arrangement, which was signed by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), premiers and chief ministers at the meeting of the Council of Australian Governments held on 14 June 1996. The arrangement was subsequently signed by the Prime Minister of New Zealand on 9 July 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The arrangement is consistent with the government's election commitment to reduce the regulatory burden and compliance costs faced by business and to establish a protocol for the reciprocal recognition of professionals' standing in order to promote the objectives of the closer economic relations trade agreement with New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The scheme is a fine example of what can be achieved cooperatively by the Australian federation. The states and territories were equal partners in the development of the trans&hyphen;Tasman mutual recognition arrangement and the related Australian legislation has been drafted by New South Wales. The government would like to acknowledge the positive contribution made by Australian heads of govern ment in fostering and promoting this important development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed scheme is based on the framework of the existing Australian mutual recognition agreement, signed by Australian heads of government in May 1992. Legislation implementing the agreement has been proclaimed by the Commonwealth and all states and territories. The Commonwealth legislation, the Mutual Recognition Act 1992, commenced in 1993. The practical benefits of the Australian mutual recognition scheme have included:</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> greater choice for consumers;</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> reduced compliance costs for manufacturers;</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> economies of scale in production, leading to lower product costs;</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> greater cooperation between regulatory authorities and the accelerated development of national standards where appropriate;</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> greater discipline on individual jurisdictions contemplating the introduction of new standards and regulations; and</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> increased movement of service providers and freedom for service providers to practise in jurisdictions in which they are not resident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time of signing the domestic Australian mutual recognition agreement, Australian heads of government agreed to review in due course with New Zealand the potential benefits of participation by New Zealand in a scheme implementing mutual recognition principles. Australian and New Zealand ministers subsequently agreed that the framework for mutual recognition reflected in the Australian Mutual Recognition Act 1992 should be the basis for a scheme implementing mutual recognition principles in New Zealand and Australian jurisdictions, with necessary changes to reflect the trans&hyphen;Tasman nature of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trans&hyphen;Tasman mutual recognition arrangement was finalised after the release of a discussion paper in April 1995 by the Council of Australian Governments and the government of New Zealand. Input was sought from industry, standards setting bodies <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7625"> and the professions, and approximately 142 written submissions were received. The comments received during the consultation process have been taken into account in deciding upon the final lists of exemptions and exclusions from the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principles</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trans&hyphen;Tasman mutual recognition arrangement is a non&hyphen;treaty instrument which requests and empowers the Commonwealth to pass an act to give effect to two simple principles of mutual recognition. The first is that a person registered to practise an occupation in Australia can seek automatic registration to practise an equivalent occupation in New Zealand and vice versa. A person will only need to give notice, including evidence of home registration, to the relevant registration authority in the other jurisdiction to be entitled immediately to commence practice in an equivalent occupation in that jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I stress that a person will only be entitled to practise an equivalent occupation. Equivalence means that the activities carried out by practitioners registered in each country must be substantially the same. This will be the case in most instances. However, if significant differences do exist between occupations, a registration authority may impose conditions on a person's registration in order to achieve equivalence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, the scheme creates a situation similar to the regime in Australia for drivers licences, whereby individuals do not have to re&hyphen;sit a driving test when they move from one state to another. It will apply to all registered occupations in Australia and New Zealand with the exception of medical practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second principle is that a good that can be legally sold in a participating Australian jurisdiction can be sold in New Zealand and vice versa, as long as it meets the regulatory requirements for sale in the jurisdiction in which it was manufactured or first imported. This means that goods which can be sold lawfully in one jurisdiction may be sold freely in another, even though the goods may not comply with all the details of regulatory standards in the second jurisdiction.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under mutual recognition, producers in Australia will have to ensure that their products comply with the laws only in the place of production. If they do so, they will then be free to distribute and sell their products in New Zealand without being subjected to further testing or assessment of their product.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Implementation mechanism</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth bill forms part of a larger legislative scheme that involves the enactment of bills by the states, the Commonwealth and New Zealand. The larger legislative scheme has an Australian component and a New Zealand component. The Trans&hyphen;Tasman Mutual Recognition Bill 1996 of New Zealand is concerned with the New Zealand component of the legislative scheme. That bill was introduced into the parliament of New Zealand on 18 July 1996. However, passage has been delayed by the New Zealand election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In drafting the New Zealand bill, every effort has been made to closely reflect the Australian legislation, whilst also recognising New Zealand's different legislative conventions. This approach is intended to minimise the potential for disputes to arise from differences in the interpretation of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mechanism for implementing the Australian component of the scheme is similar to that used to implement the Australian mutual recognition scheme. To come into effect, the scheme requires at least one state to enact legislation referring the enactment of a Mutual Recognition Act to the Commonwealth parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New South Wales has agreed to do so, and the Trans&hyphen;Tasman Mutual Recognition (New South Wales) Bill 1996 was passed by the New South Wales Parliament on 19 November 1996. The New South Wales Bill refers to the Commonwealth parliament, using the mechanism provided by Section 51 (xxxvii) of the Commonwealth constitution, the power to enact an act in the terms, or substantially in the terms, set out in the schedule to that bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The additional powers of the Commonwealth will be limited. The states and territories are not granting extensive new powers to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7626"> the Commonwealth to regulate goods and occupations. Rather, the Commonwealth is being empowered, to the extent to which such powers are not otherwise included in its legislative powers, to pass a single piece of legislation that will prevail over inconsistent state and territory legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments to the Commonwealth act will require the unanimous agreement of participating Australian jurisdictions. The Commonwealth act will provide a comprehensive scheme for mutual recognition which will operate independently of other state laws and, therefore, will not require modification of those laws to enable its implementation. This is achieved through section 109 of the Commonwealth constitution, which provides that a Commonwealth act prevails over a state act to the extent of any inconsistency. The legislation will apply to all states that refer power to enact the Commonwealth act or request enactment of it, or adopt the Commonwealth act afterwards under section 51 (xxxvii) of the Commonwealth constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Operation of the scheme</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The focus of mutual recognition is on the regulation of goods at the point of sale and on entry by registered persons into equivalent occupations in another participating jurisdiction. Mutual recognition will not affect the ability of jurisdictions to regulate the operation of businesses or the conduct of persons registered in an occupation. It is also important to note that laws that regulate the manner in which goods are sold, such as laws restricting the sale of certain goods to minors, or the manner in which sellers conduct their businesses are explicitly exempted from mutual recognition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, the scheme will not affect laws relating to quarantine, endangered species, firearms and other prohibited or offensive weapons, fireworks, indecent material, ozone protection, agricultural and veterinary chemicals, and gaming machines. Nor will the scheme affect Australia's or New Zealand's international obligations, intellectual property laws, customs laws, taxation laws or tariffs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme incorporates a temporary exemption mechanism, giving participating <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> jurisdictions the right to ban unilaterally, for a total of 12 months, the sale of goods in their jurisdiction in the interests of protecting the health and safety of persons or preventing, minimising or regulating environmental pollution. Before the temporary exemption expires, the ministerial council responsible for the affected good is required to determine whether a particular standard should apply to the good and, if so, the appropriate standard. A ministerial council determination can include whether to prohibit the sale of the good in question and requires the endorsement of heads of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme will also set in train so&hyphen;called cooperation programs in a number of industry sectors. These will relate to therapeutic goods; hazardous substances, industrial chemicals and dangerous goods; road vehicles; electromagnetic compatibility and radio communications equipment; and gas appliance standards. Regulatory authorities in these areas will consider whether existing regulatory differences would be best addressed by either applying the mutual recognition principle to the affected goods, permanently exempting the goods from the operation of the scheme, or introducing harmonised standards for such goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For occupations, the legislation is expressed to apply to individuals and occupations carried on by them. Registered practitioners wishing to practise in another jurisdiction will be able to notify the local registration authority of their intention to seek registration in an equivalent occupation there and provide the required evidence. The local registration authority then has one month to process the application and to make a decision on whether or not to grant registration. Pending registration, the practitioner is entitled, once the notice is made and all necessary information provided, to commence practice immediately in that occupation, subject to the payment of fees and compliance with various indemnity or insurance requirements in relation to that occupation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7627"> To avoid costly and lengthy appeals processes in the courts, the Commonwealth Administrative Appeals Tribunal will hear appeals against decisions of Australian regis tration authorities, and a newly&hyphen;created New Zealand tribunal will hear appeals against decisions of New Zealand registration authorities. The tribunals are required to cooperate to the maximum extent possible so as to ensure consistency in their determinations.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trans&hyphen;Tasman mutual recognition scheme builds on the mutually beneficial economic and trade framework which has developed under the Australia-New Zealand closer economic relations trade agreement and is a logical extension of that agreement. It is also expected that the scheme will contribute to the development of the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region by providing a possible model of cooperation with other economies in respect of product standards, including those in the South Pacific and APEC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme reflects the high degree of confidence which exists between Australia and New Zealand in respect of each other's regulations, regulatory systems and decision&hyphen;making processes. It is expected to remove regulatory barriers to the movement of goods and service providers across the Tasman and to enhance the international competitiveness of Australian and New Zealand enterprises by encouraging innovation and reducing compliance costs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill amends the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act 1991 to implement provisions which will enable the Australia New Zealand Food Authority to focus its <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> resources on issues which are of critical importance to its Australian and New Zealand stakeholders. Legislation which was before this House last December created the Australia New Zealand Food Authority and a joint food standards setting system for Australia and New Zealand. This authority and the unique system of Commonwealth, state, territory and New Zealand cooperation it supports will continue to protect the public health and safety of Australian and New Zealand consumers through:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> the development, establishment and management of the Australia New Zealand Food standards code;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> the development and implementation of the new hygiene standards for food processing, manufacturing and handling; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> the development of improved and consistent national arrangements for surveillance and compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will enhance the authority's ability to undertake these important tasks. The final report of the policy review published in May 1993 committed the authority to undertake a review of the food standards code in recognition that, before the creation of the authority, food standards had not been developed according to the objectives set out in section 10 of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act 1991. The need for this review was supported by all stakeholders, and a timetable indicated that the review would be completed in March 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, this time frame cannot be met because of a provision in the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act 1991 which requires the authority to accept all applications (which meet certain basic criteria). The authority is then obliged to commit resources to completing the assessments associated with each of these applications within 12 months, irrespective of the relative public or commercial importance of these applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are three main deficiencies within the current legislation which prevent the authority having the capacity to plan, manage or prioritise its workload:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> Firstly, the authority has no control over the number of applications which it is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7628"> legally bound to handle at any one time. As resources must be provided for the processing of each of those applications, the authority is placed in the invidious situation of either compromising the quality of the assessment of each application or breaching its statutory obligation to finalise applications within 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> Secondly, the authority is obliged to utilise available resources on a `first come, first served' basis so preventing it from taking into account the relative importance or value of each application, according to the objectives set out under section 10 of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> Thirdly, the authority's obligation to assess each application individually means that the authority is required to make variations to the code on a fragmented one by one basis in response to individual applications which generally only benefit a particular sector of the industry. This in turn prevents the authority from undertaking more comprehensive and thorough reviews of groupings of standards. These reviews of groupings of standards are urgently needed to make the code less prescriptive, easier to use and more consistent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth wishes to give an undertaking to the states and territories and to New Zealand that the authority will develop a joint Australia&hyphen;New Zealand food standards code by 1 January 2000. The development of this joint code is a continuation of the review of the code begun in 1993, and it will result in a revised, simplified and much more effective set of food standards. This joint code is absolutely essential to the efficiency and international competitiveness of Australia's food industry. A failure to provide the joint code within the three-year time frame will erode the food industry's international reputation and could jeopardise its market opportunities in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To ensure that the joint code is in place by the year 2000, the authority is establishing a three-year standards review work program. This work program will set priorities for food standards review over the next three years and will be agreed to and supported by the food <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industry, the states, territories and New Zealand. Development of this work program will involve agreement from stakeholders as to which health and safety, consumer protection, industry and international harmonisation issues require priority over the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A specific number of applications will be included in the work program, commensurate with the level of resources available to the authority. It is anticipated that these resources will be drawn from Commonwealth, New Zealand and industry sources. The applications will be selected for inclusion in the work program in consultation with the stakeholders. Criteria for selection will be based on the objectives set out in section 10 of the act. All applications accepted as part of this work program will be finalised within 12 months and there will be no charge to the applicant. Applications which cannot be accommodated within the work program because of resource limitations will still be accepted and processed within the 12&hyphen;month time frame, but will be assessed on a cost recovery basis, that is, applicants will need to provide the authority with the resources required to process the application. Alternatively, assessment of the application will be delayed until the charges have been paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Successful development of the joint Australia&hyphen;New Zealand code hinges upon the amendments contained in this bill. In summary, this legislation will enable the authority to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> ensure that the authority's resources are spent on assessing applications within the work program by allowing it to delay processing applications which are outside the work program until such time as any prescribed charges have been paid;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> assess applications which are within the work program at no charge to the applicant;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> enable the authority to prioritise and direct resources to its agreed work program and to the food standards matters which are of major public interest and commercial importance; and</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7629">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> charge for its expertise by marketing its goods and services and to retain any fees and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> permits regulations to set the amount of these charges and to waive, remit and refund charges in whole or in part; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> specifically limits the level of the charge to recovering the authority's expenses in assessing an application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will protect the authority's open and accountable processes which are admired around the world. The authority will still be required to assess applications within the 12&hyphen;month time limit provided that, for applications outside the work program, the prescribed charge is paid. Any person or body will still be able to apply to the authority for a variation or addition to the food standards code. This bill will enable the authority to develop, establish and manage a quality food standards code for Australia and New Zealand which will protect public health and safety and strengthen our food industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the third report of the committee for 1996 relating to the development of operational facilities at RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that the report be printed.</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The report which I have tabled deals with the proposal sponsored by the Department of Defence for the construction of new facilities at RAAF Base Tindal to improve the operational effectiveness of the base.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By way of background, RAAF Base Tindal forms part of a chain of defensive airfields across northern Australia and is vital to the air defence of the region. During the past decade, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Commonwealth has invested substantial funds on the base, which has produced a modern, well&hyphen;designed operational facility. Tindal is the home base for a fighter squadron and supporting RAAF elements. Together with RAAF Base Darwin, it is used for operational training of elements of the Australian Defence Force, often in conjunction with regional air elements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The works examined by the committee included explosive ordnance aprons for maritime patrol and transport aircraft, alert facilities for fighter aircraft, operational and technical support facilities, and living accommodation for personnel during exercises and contingencies. When referred to the committee, the estimated outturn cost of the proposed work was $31.4 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has recommended that the work should proceed, subject to one qualification which I will address later. The committee found that a need exists to rectify a number of deficiencies which have impacted on the ability of the base to perform its assigned roles in a safe and flexible manner. In specific terms, there is a need to provide  dispersed parking for four maritime patrol aircraft on individual explosive ordnance aprons and a secure facility from which aircraft operations can be managed; dispersed explosive ordnance loading and unloading aprons for C130 transport aircraft; quick reaction alert facilities at the end of the primary runway, including the provision of sun protection, engineering and communication services; the general purpose movements apron to be enlarged to permit dedicated parking of wide&hyphen;bodied aircraft and improved manoeuvring of aircraft; a new base command post from which the base commander can exercise command and control of base personnel during exercises and contingencies; and new accommodation for use by personnel deployed to RAAF Base Tindal during exercises and contingencies. The proposed works which the committee examined will rectify the deficiencies identified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee concluded that the extent of the proposed ordnance loading aprons can be justified on the basis of operational requirements, improved security and operational <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7630"> health and safety. The proposed squadron operations and technical support facility will considerably enhance the management of deployed maritime patrol aircraft, or other deployed aircraft, to RAAF Base Tindal. The siting and design of the quick reaction alert facilities enhance operational effectiveness by enabling fighter aircraft to remain ready for prolonged periods and for personnel to sustain longer duty periods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Extensions to the air movements apron will facilitate the parking and movement of wide&hyphen;bodied aircraft. The proposed base command post will enable base command to direct defence of the airfield and facilities during exercises and contingencies. In relation to the proposed deployment accommodation, the committee has some concerns about the necessity for major expenditure on earth covering of deployment accommodation for noise attenuation at the sites identified in the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the committee accepts the need for new deployment accommodation at RAAF Base Tindal, the significantly large proportion of the project budget allocated for this purpose and the, as yet, untested conditions under which the facilities would operate, require some caution to be exercised in approving the facilities as proposed. Therefore, the committee has recommended that a further evaluation of the cost and benefits of soil covered accommodation be undertaken and resubmitted to the committee before this component of the project is commenced. I commend the report to the House.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB2></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<TITLE>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL 1996</TITLE>
<DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7630">
<TITLE>Second Reading</TITLE>
<PROCTEXT>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Debate resumed from 11 September, on motion by <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr Williams</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr MELHAM</EMPHASIS> (Banks) 10.36 a.m.)&mdash;The Family Law Amendment Bill 1996 implements yet another broken promise by the Howard government. In the budget, the government said that it would implement a $40 per hour fee for voluntary mediation and counselling provided by the Family Court. This fee, due to commence on 1 January <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1997, is estimated to raise $0.835 million in 1996&hyphen;97, rising to $1.9 million by 1998&hyphen;99. This bill provides the mechanisms to implement that measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note that this bill does not of itself introduce this fee. Rather, it amends the Family Law Act 1975 to permit the making of regulations that will allow the Family Court to charge the fees. It also allows for the making of regulations to provide exemptions from those fees. I understand that the proposed regulations will contain exemption provisions similar to those that apply to other fees in Commonwealth courts and tribunals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concern that the Australian Labor Party has about the introduction of these fees is twofold. First, there are the access to justice implications of slugging families in crisis with a $40 fee for the provision of a service which, in fact, ultimately saves the government money because it helps to reduce the rate of divorce. Secondly, we are concerned at the longer term objectives underlying this bill. The 1995&hyphen;96 annual report of the Family Court shows that the court's counselling and mediation service dealt with 31,147 counselling and 416 mediation cases last year. Almost 60 per cent of clients of the counselling service and 83 per cent of the mediation clients approached the service on a voluntary basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Senate estimates, it was revealed that 75 per cent of those cases were successfully resolved by the counselling and mediation service. Were it not for the provision of these services, one can only wonder how many more divorces we might have had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By comparison&mdash;and quite regrettably, might I say&mdash;there were 49,700 divorces in the last year alone. I do not want to suggest that any number of divorces is desirable, but clearly that number is too high. We need to find ways of reducing the number of divorces in this country. It is in this context that the imposing of cost recovery on this service is simply bad policy. Despite the fee waiver and refund provisions which will protect the poorest in our society, most Australians who access these services will have to incur this fee. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7631">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government prides themselves on representing mainstream Australia, ordinary Australians. They are going down the same path that the Fraser government did with the Australian Legal Aid Office. When they first came into office and by the time they left office, they had introduced so many hurdles that ordinary Australians did not qualify for legal aid. They turned the Australian Legal Aid Office into a referral service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What they are now doing with their attacks on the legal aid system in this country is basically withdrawing the opportunity of a vast number of ordinary mainstream Australians to access our court system. You now have to be either filthy rich in this country or terribly poor and, even if you are terribly poor, they are introducing hurdles all over the place. It is an absolute disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They carry on with their rhetoric. You have to be a mind&hyphen;reader now because you cannot believe what they say: their actions are in complete contradiction and complete opposition to their rhetoric. You have to be a mind&hyphen;reader now with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) of this country&mdash;someone who prides himself on honesty and integrity in public office. You now have core promises and non&hyphen;core promises. And that is what is happening here&mdash;this banner of access to justice. It is a denial of access to justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To place a barrier on accessing a service that helps keep families together and reduces the number of cases in the Family Court is simply not good policy. Not only is there the very real personal pain and financial cost of divorce; our entire society suffers when families come asunder. This is the Prime Minister who prides himself on family values. This bill today does nothing to enhance family values.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), the Chairman of the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, has suggested that all new couples should be given a voucher that would provide free marriage and relationship education. Why? Because, as he rightly notes, this will build and strengthen more successful relationships. Surely the process of helping keep families together is just as worthy of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> such a sentiment. Or does the government suggest that families in crisis should be treated any differently, that they should be punished in some way for the failings of their relationships? I suggest that they should not be punished in the way that this government proposes to punish them by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The move to introduce these fees is also a clear breach of the government's election commitment to the Australian people. In its law and justice policy, the coalition promised to `support and implement moves to increase counselling, conciliation and mediation options for the resolution of disputes'. A measure such as this one, which makes it harder for people to access mediation and counselling services hardly supports or increases the options that are available to Australian families in crisis. This is a government without compassion. This is a government that time will show is mean spirited and nasty. This is a mean&hyphen;spirited and nasty bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his second reading speech on this bill, the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) sought to defend the government's introduction of these fees on three bases. The first was by a reference to the need for fiscal consolidation&mdash;a problem that exists largely in this government's mind alone. The second was by claiming that the previous Labor government had foreshadowed that it might consider such a proposal in the 1995&hyphen;96 budget statements. Indeed, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Portfolio Budget Statements</EMPHASIS> for that year did state that the review of court and tribunal fees initiated by the previous government would examine the suitability of fee regimes for voluntary or optional services which a court might provide. However, what the Attorney&hyphen;General failed to say was that the previous government, in light of that review, rejected the introduction of fees for these services. Finally, he argued that failing to impose these fees was a form of discrimination for people living in rural and regional Australia. This argument ignores the fact that the Family Court provides extensive mediation and counselling services in rural and regional centres either through permanent offices or via circuits. Upon closer examination the Attorney&hyphen;General's rhetoric is not only hollow; it is hypocritical.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7632">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government really cared about providing services to people in rural and regional centres, it would not have cut funding to the Family Court by $3.5 million in the last year. These cuts have led to the closure of the Mackay and Bendigo registries, the downgrading of the Launceston registry, the reduction of judicial circuits by 30 per cent and the reduction of registrar and counselling circuits by 50 per cent. Nor would the government have cut the provision of family skills training services that were to be opened under Labor's Justice Statement this financial year in the Richmond&hyphen;Tweed area, central Murrumbidgee, Shepparton&hyphen;Mooroopna, Bendigo, Ballarat, the Gold Coast, Wide Bay&hyphen;Burnett or the Grenough River region. Where are the conservative members of the government representing those regions in this debate? They are on the other side basically supporting measures that have meant the end of what I just read out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A Labor government would not have cut the adolescent and family mediation services that were to be provided this year and the next in Newcastle, the Clarence, Geelong, Whyalla and Preston. Where is the Lyons Forum in relation to this debate? Where are those sanctimonious members of this House who pride themselves on, and who go out and wear as a badge of honour, their concern for the family and family values? Where are they in this debate? Where do they stand on this bill?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They support this bill which is against all the values that they espouse, which is against all the values that they say they represent. That is where I say to the electorate, `Judge them not on their words but on their deeds, on their actions.' Over time, this government will unravel. It says one thing; it does another. Nor would a Labor government have cut the family mediation services which were to be opened in Gosford, Newcastle, Wollongong, the northern outer suburbs of Melbourne, Geelong, Bendigo, Ipswich, Wide Bay&hyphen;Burnett, or Perth's south-eastern metropolitan area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For this government to call for fairer access to justice when it has cut $320 million from access to justice programs over the next four <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> years is the height of hypocrisy. The introduction of these fees is the first step in a campaign to remove from the Family Court its ability to provide mediation and counselling services altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney-General has said that he would like to see mediation and counselling become the primary means of dispute resolution in Australia. The truth is that well before this government came along, Labor was well on its way to establishing that ideal as a reality. Only five per cent of Family Court cases are resolved by way of court imposed resolution. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the parties either reach an amicable solution or one or other loses either the desire or the means to continue putting up a fight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality of modern family law is that the court imposed solution is now the alternative dispute resolution mechanism. But in the last few weeks, public attention has been focused by the action of this Attorney-General on the role of mediation in our court system. The Attorney-General indicated his view on 2 October 1996 when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would like to see a reduction in the volume of mediation and counselling services provided in the court and the transfer of those to the community.</PARA>
<PARA>This was a view he did not derogate from in his more substantive speech to the National Press Club on 15 October 1996. I recognise that, in that speech, the Attorney-General backed down somewhat from his previous comments by committing himself to extensive consultations on this issue. Nonetheless, he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is much to be said for the view that the Family Court should be freed up to concentrate on its primary function, that is to hear and determine legal disputes in family law matters.</PARA>
<PARA>This approach is at odds with the well recognised need to further integrate mediation into the court process. In his speech to the Australian Institute of Judicial Administration to 24 September 1996, Chief Justice Brennan said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mediation and arbitration will continue to be familiar and prominent features of the system of dispute resolution in the future. There is no reason why, in the vast majority of cases, mediation should not be compulsory in the sense of being a condition of the right of any party to have the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7633"> dispute brought to trial. But let it be court attached mediation. Either the mediator should be a court officer or a private mediator selected by the parties, by lot or by rotation. In either case, the fees should be a charge on public revenue.</PARA>
<PARA>That was Chief Justice Brennan on 24 September 1996. It is worth repeating the last line, `In either case, the fees should be a charge on public revenue.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In direct response to the Attorney-General's comments and in support of the approach suggested by the Chief Justice, Jenny Boland, Chair of the Family Law Council, said that the council had already advised the Attorney-General that the court should retain its counselling services. Indeed, in a letter of advice to the Attorney-General, dated 30 June 1996, and annexed to the council's 1995-96 annual report, Ms Boland advised the Attorney-General of the council's view on recommendation 7.26 of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Funding and administration of the Family Court of Australia</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is this recommendation upon which the Attorney-General has based his view of the appropriateness of retaining counselling and mediation services within the Family Court. Ms Boland said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If implemented, this recommendation would destroy the successful conciliation aspects of the court's operation, it would hamper the settlement of matters particularly those involving children and result in the loss of a significant degree of expertise within the court which has benefited the interests of children, as the legislation requires.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendation ignores the important role played by court counsellors, mediators and registrars, and omits any reference to the extent to which the conciliation services are integrated with the litigation process. It fails to differentiate between voluntary and court related counselling, each of which requires particular skills and knowledge which the court counsellors have acquired and built over the two decades of their operation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council believes that what is required is the provision of appropriate primary dispute resolution processes at both the community and court levels, rather than the either/or approach adopted by the JSC.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Even Helen Disney, National Director of Relationships Australia, an organisation likely to benefit if the court's counselling and mediation services were to be privatised, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> recognised the fundamental flaw with the Attorney-General's suggested approach. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The best option is for the court to continue to have counselling and mediation services because of the need for those processes to be linked with the court's case management approach.</PARA>
<PARA>The Family Court has also made similar criticisms in appendix 5 of its 1995-96 annual report and concluded its remarks by making an interesting point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We often talk in this place about the need to establish world best practice in the administration of our Public Service. It should be no different for our courts. Interestingly, the government of Singapore recently decided to review the use of alternative dispute resolution services attached to its courts. After studying alternative models in the United States, Europe and New Zealand, Singapore decided to adopt conciliation, counselling and mediation services based on those provided by the Family Court of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely, if these services are good enough to export or are thought by others to be worthy of imitation, then we should retain them here in Australia. Instead, the government prefers to disregard the plethora of expert advice warning against its current approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The primary object of any dispute resolution service must be to resolve disputes. We should put in place the best mechanisms available to enable ordinary Australians to sort their problems out for themselves. Counselling and mediation are an integral part of the Family Court and that service must be accessible to all. The opposition will be opposing the bill before the House.</PARA></PROCTEXT>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I commence my speech on this Family Law Amendment Bill, I will make a few remarks on some aspects of the contribution of my honourable and learned friend the member for Banks (Mr Melham). It is fair to say&mdash;and I think the member will concede this&mdash;that problems in legal aid did not occur in the last nine months. They are problems that have been endemic and getting worse over a substantial number of years, particularly the last five years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7634">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A practical example of that is a case I was involved in last year for a woman who is now a constituent of mine. She had absolutely no money at all. She had been basically defrauded by her ex-husband on a property settlement in the Family Court on a consent order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She tried to get legal aid to bring the matter on when she found out about 12 months later that he had not disclosed a substantial benefit by way of a redundancy payment. Unable to get legal aid, she approached a firm of solicitors in my electorate. The solicitors acted in that matter free of charge. More than that, they actually paid her outlays in order to get to the court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the decision was given, which was not a favourable one, the solicitors applied again for legal aid to appeal to the full court of the Family Court. That also was rejected. When the solicitor said to the person from legal aid, `Five years ago aid would have been granted for something like this,' the comment he got was interesting. He was told, `Five years ago? Even three years ago.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the situation has become very serious. Ultimately, a favourable settlement was reached outside the court in that case, but again by dint of the fact that the solicitors were prepared to undertake the case free of charge, subject to the outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to recognise that access to justice, as my friend has said, has become difficult because of a failure to discriminate properly in relation to cases. We have all seen examples of legal aid being granted in some cases and mysteriously not being granted in other cases, without any rational explanation for those distinctions being made. It is that area of the legal aid system which could be cleaned up, at least to some degree, to enable a more equitable distribution of funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem of funding distribution is very relevant here because the opposition takes the attitude that this is not a good measure, notwithstanding the fact that the measure is trying to discriminate between those who can afford and those who cannot afford. Those who cannot afford to pay the fee will not have to pay a fee, but those who can afford to pay will have to pay. That reflects what is already going on outside of the court in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> private consultation, relationships advice, assistance and counselling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1994&hyphen;95 annual report of the Family Court tells us that people who had not even filed proceedings in the Family Court were coming to the court and using its free system. Fifty per cent of court counselling services&mdash;these are provided free of charge and on a non&hyphen;discriminatory basis by way of income&mdash;were utilised by people who did not even go to court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a tight budgetary situation where we have to provide for those in most need, that is quite inequitable. To expect people to use outside services and pay the fees for those&mdash;as long as they can afford them&mdash;and, at the same time, to ignore an abuse of the free system of the Family Court is not a proper way to arrange the distribution of limited funds in an area like that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what it gets back to and why I align it very much to what has happened in legal aid, because of the case I mentioned and many other cases I have seen where inequitable grants of legal aid have been made. The role of the legal profession in this area also needs to be looked at because it is true that over the years many very unmeritorious cases were funded by legal aid in circumstances where one would question, very seriously, whether the practitioner recommending grants of legal aid had a conflict of duty and interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, this is an area that, overall, the government must look at in the context of providing a regime for better access to justice. I believe that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs may, in time, look at that. A Senate committee is looking at legal aid but, ultimately, there are other avenues that could well be tapped into to provide greater equity in apportioning the legal aid cake through a different and more realistic system and in conjunction with the legal profession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will effectively amend the Family Law Act to provide for regulations to be made by the Governor&hyphen;in&hyphen;Council for people using the counselling and mediation services of the Family Court. It has been said, and I think this is in the report, that the annual cost <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7635"> of running the Family Court is $100 million a year. That is an extraordinarily large amount of money. As I have said, the bill amounts to charging a fee for people who can afford it and clears up that anachronism whereby the community based sector provides services for a fee on a user&hyphen;pays according to income basis but the Family Court does not provide that degree of quite reasonable discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I emphasise this again because it will be stressed that we are taking away from people in a situation of great trauma&mdash;as has been said by the member for Banks&mdash;an opportunity for them to try to repair their lives. That is not correct in the case of people who cannot afford to pay. They will still have that opportunity for recourse through the system as it stands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be remembered that on 15 October 1996 the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) made these statements to the National Press Club:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most people would prefer to deal with the whole process of separation and associated agreements over children and property outside of the court environment.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is much to be said for the view that the Family Court should be enabled to focus its expertise on its primary functions; that is, to hear and determine legal disputes in family law matters.</PARA>
<PARA>There have been a number of responses to that statement. Indeed, the Family Court submission, dated November 1996, to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which is inquiring into aspects of family services, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Family Court is and should be much more than a courtroom.</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The court, on the other hand, sees its role as attempting to divert people away from its courtrooms.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The court would be most concerned if it came to be seen only as a place of last resort, as the Attorney-General suggests. This would create an atmosphere of fear and confrontation among Family Court clients redolent of the divorce lists of the Supreme Court of pre-Family Law Act days. This was the very thing that the Family Law Act and the Family Court were set up to overcome. To see the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> primary function of the court as the hearing and determination of legal disputes in family law matters is to look at such disputes through an extremely narrow prism which fails to recognise the interaction of that function with the court's conciliation and mediation activities.</PARA>
<PARA>The Chief Justice of the Family Court also made some comments which, with the greatest respect to him, were somewhat extravagant. In relation to those comments, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  of 15 October 1996 reported: </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposals of the Attorney to revamp family law would `literally tear the heart out of the court' having regard to the fact that it could lose control of mediation and counselling.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me, with respect, that those sorts of criticisms are quite unhelpful in the debate. In my view, to suggest that the Family Court is and should be much more than a courtroom is to risk the court being pilloried as everything but a court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Primarily the Family Court is set up with a jurisdiction to hear and determine&mdash;`hear and determine' being very important words in a legal sense. With the greatest respect to those who think otherwise: for the court to be getting away from that primary function, as it has done, misconceives its function. It is very important for the Family Court to hold the respect of the community, and particularly of the litigants and the practitioners whom the court hears from time to time. So, as part of that particular process, it is important for the court to be seen as judicially active&mdash;that is, acting judicially, hearing and determining cases of disputed facts, making decisions and not being afraid to make hard decisions when the necessity arises. In that whole process the role of the legal profession is also paramount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that the court will risk losing the respect of the community if the court gets into these wider esoteric areas of, `Let's feel good; let's not be seen to be imposing decisions that are hard,' and all of these areas. I say that because there is a perception amongst some legal practitioners that the Family Court does not have the same degree of respect as some of the other courts in the structure, such as the Supreme Court and the Federal Court. So, in my view, that respect must be re-engendered not only in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7636"> wider community but also amongst the profession by the court sticking to its tasks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must not, by words or actions, thereby force settlements on people. This is something that we have to be very careful of in talking about mediation and even arbitration. The court is there to perform a function and there are people who, no matter what you say to them, will not settle cases; they want a decision from the court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the court reminds litigants at the start of a hearing in some cases about considering the matter carefully, having regard for costs and so forth&mdash;as it frequently does, and rightly so&mdash;nobody really objects, as I have said. But if the court fails to hear a case, by delay or otherwise, forcing litigants to get into a corner and rough out a settlement that is going to make everybody unhappy, then the standing of the court is reduced. I am concerned that these other functions that the court talks about trying to attribute to itself are diminishing that standing overall and taking away that notion of being in court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, you would remember that only a few years ago, when the Family Court started, there were no robes&mdash;there were no wigs and gowns. But three or four years ago the Family Court took back the wigs and gowns. That was not something that the government imposed; it was something that the Family Court wanted to give it a status, to make it look more like a court in many respects so that the people who appeared before that court would give it the due respect that it deserved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So in that atmosphere, which was something that was promulgated by practitioners and judges of that court, it is important that we do not get away to this esoteric suggestion of, `It's more than a court; its role is something wider,' and so forth. It really gets down to the fact that people must have respect for the court. It will have that respect by making reasonable decisions in a timely fashion&mdash;not having inordinate delays in judgments&mdash;and, from time to time, by imposing orders for costs for frivolous and vexatious applications, that are frequently made before it. There has been a real reluctance for the Family Court to exercise that power. I think that is a shame <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> because, overall, that is a very important power in determining the progress of litigation through the courts. For example, if people are never going to be visited with the sanction of an order for costs, the court is open to be greatly abused. But that order for costs is always a factor that can be used to stop that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, in the context of this particular bill, in relation to the time that is being spent in the Family Court and the expenditure of resources on things other than hearing and determining cases, it is important for the situation to be re&hyphen;evaluated so that we get back to the court focusing more on judicial problems rather than on the non-judicial ones to which I have referred. I wish to give a very quick example. A constituent came to see me recently. His son had separated from his wife and there was a young child involved. The child was about 18 months old. They went to the court seeking interim custody. The case they made out was that the child was not being well looked after. An independent witness saw the child crawling around the floor and eating dirty crusts of bread.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You would think that case would be a very important one for a court to hear and determine, even on an interim basis. But those people could not get before a judge to have that credit issue heard and determined. It was decided on the papers. The judicial registrar decided that case on the papers and found that, on the papers, there was a dispute. On the papers, he or she was not prepared to make a ruling on interim custody and that was the end of the matter. I am informed that people cannot get to the court in all but exceptional circumstances on interim custody. Likewise, I was told recently that you cannot get to court for access over Christmas. So those matters are of great concern. People must be able to access the court, because the interests of children are paramount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, I support this particular measure. I say to the Family Court people who are saying that this will cause a tearing out of the system that it will not. In reality, it will make the court focus more on what it is there to do, and that is to decide matters on a hearing and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7637"> determined basis and to decide the issues of credit, as it was set up to do.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 23 February this year, which was roughly eight days before the election, the then shadow minister for justice and the shadow Attorney-General, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), released a press release which trumpeted as its headline `Law and justice for us all'. How very thoughtful of her.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In what passes now for entertaining reading, the senator portrayed herself as the harbinger of a brave new world of justice for Australians, a world which would magically materialise under a Howard government. She spoke of people's alienation from the legal system due to the high costs associated with justice and the inability of Australians to access the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition, according to the senator, was going to redress the inequities of the Australian legal system which had supposedly piled up under Labor. The senator then spoke of the coalition offering support for families under the law. She waxed lyrical about strengthening, streamlining and stocktaking the legal system&mdash;buzz words indicating reforms which were supposedly to benefit us all. Finally, the senator promised that a coalition when it came into government would act speedily on its commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition has acted speedily, all right. Since coming to power on 2 March, the member for Tangney (Mr Williams)&mdash;quickly crowned Attorney-General and Minister for Justice in place of Senator Vanstone; as we all know, she has moved on to bigger and better things&mdash;has attacked the Australian legal system on behalf of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) with a speed and ferocity that I would not have expected from a man who appears, on face value, to be such a very languid type of soul.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aware as we are of the commitments given by Senator Vanstone, on behalf of the coalition before the election, towards improving Australia's legal system, the actions of the Attorney-General&mdash;the member for Tangney&mdash;and the Prime Minister are hypocritical in the extreme. In just nine months they have challenged the concept of free and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> accessible legal aid in this country for the financially disadvantaged, and as such have plunged the country's legal fraternity into a justifiable panic. The Attorney-General's budget measures will reduce access to justice even further by raising charges and cutting funding across his entire portfolio, in particular by increasing fees for the use of federal courts and tribunals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">None of these actions will improve Australians' access to the legal system, nor will they make the system fairer as the coalition had promised in the lead-up to the election. They are, in fact, a ferocious attack on the justice system in this country, an attack which will have dire consequences for all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen from the coalition as it has tinkered with our legal system since coming to power in March is indicative of what we have seen from the coalition across the board in its approach to government. To say it is all over the place is to put it very mildly. To say it is handling things with all the elan and effortless grace of a bunch of rabbits dosed high on myxomatosis is to come closer to the mark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shopping list of fees which the government intends to hike, or impose for the first time on our federal courts and tribunals, will drastically alter the shape of our delicately balanced legal system. They will act as a significant barrier for ordinary Australians to access our justice system. The Howard election catchcry was `For all of us'; but from these and other measures that have now appeared before this House it is now clear that it should have been `For all of us who can afford to pay'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately for Australians, the opposition has only one opportunity to oppose the increase and imposition of fees for federal courts and tribunals which were brought about by this year's budget, and this is it. It relates to the imposition of fees for voluntary counselling and mediation in the Family Court. These fees cannot be implemented without amendment to the Family Law Act, hence our presence here today in debating the Family Law Amendment Bill. Most of the other increases will be carried out through the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7638"> amendment of regulations to the High Court act, to the Federal Court act, to the Family Court act and to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Family Law Act 1975 has always provided for counselling, either on a voluntary basis or as ordered by the court. It is a free service aimed at assisting parties to resolve disputes and to adjust to separation. As to those cases where children are involved, counselling aims to focus on the best interests of the child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mediation&mdash;which, unlike the counselling services offered by the Family Court, is always exercised on a voluntary basis&mdash;does not directly suggest solutions to parties, but it works towards an agreed settlement. For parties who have to maintain a level of contact after divorce, who have to preserve some semblance of a relationship&mdash;for example, when children are involved&mdash;counselling and mediation offer a far less destructive option than progressing towards unnecessary and often bruising litigation. Litigation, of course, almost always worsens relations between parties. If children are involved, it almost certainly has a detrimental effect on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the court's annual report of 1995-96, the counselling service dealt with over 32,000 cases, an increase of 7,800 cases from the previous year. Obviously it is popular and it does its job. Now this government is happy to challenge the effectiveness of the service, to challenge its accessibility, by sponsoring this bill today. If it is passed in its present form, it will allow for a change of regulations to impose fees of $40 an hour for the privilege of receiving the voluntary counselling and mediation services offered by the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Access to Justice Advisory Committee&mdash;chaired by the eminent QC Mr Ronald Sackville&mdash;found in its report to the former government in 1993, `Clearly, the level of court and tribunal fees is an access to justice issue.' As Sir Anthony Mason, the former Chief Justice of Australia, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . equality of access to the courts is vital to a democracy that takes pride in its system of justice and in the ordered settlement of disputes. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>The combined message from both of these honourable gentlemen is quite clear: once you restrict access to justice&mdash;in this case through fees&mdash;you are threatening one of the very tenets of our democracy. With a $40&hyphen;an&hyphen;hour charge, the government is effectively robbing the financially disadvantaged in our community of the opportunity to receive what we know is an extremely valuable counselling service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me illustrate this point further. Senator Vanstone, when speaking on these fee increases in the Senate on 9 October this year, said most individual litigants come from middle income groups; therefore, I assume in the uncomplicated logic of the good senator, making exorbitant charges somehow excusable. If just for the sake of argument we assume the senator is right and that it is okay for middle income earners to pay these fee hikes, the fact is that when you are dealing with as many divorce cases as Australia experiences every year you are still looking at a very large minority of people who come from financially disadvantaged backgrounds who will find the Family Court fees beyond them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995, 43,471 cases were granted by the Family Court. Of these cases, the court granted 14,369 a remission of fees. Remission is based on the fact that the applicants are either on means tested legal aid or have demonstrated to the court their economic hardship. So, even with those figures, in nearly a third of all divorce cases&mdash;close to 15,000 in 1995&mdash;at least one of the parties is on a low income. At the very least, you are looking at approximately 15,000 financially underprivileged people a year who will have to pay $40 an hour for voluntary counselling and mediation in the Family Court, along with all the other fees. Here are 15,000 people who stand to have their basic right of unimpeded access to justice prevented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Be it 15,000 people or a single person, it does not matter. If this right to justice is attacked, then that is an attack upon the very foundations of our society, an attack upon one of the very tenets which we believe is necessary for our society to function fairly and freely. The fact that the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General are willing to endanger <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7639"> access to justice in Australia and, in turn, part of the very fabric of our nation, all in the cause of narrow-minded financial gain, beggars the imagination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not wanting to think the worst of the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General, the only conclusion that I can come to is that they have failed to address themselves to some very fundamental questions in their desire to fill the government's coffers. What social costs are they willing to pay to bring about their version of economic prosperity? How much of a social gamble are they ready to take to achieve their economic goals? What good is their making savings, often of a very negligible nature, when a person's basic rights to justice are cut adrift at the same time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the questions which they have quite obviously failed to ask themselves. The alternative is too awful to contemplate. I would hate to believe that the results of their actions were considered by both of them and yet judged to be insufficient as to significantly alter the direction in which they were intent on heading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order for the Family Court or for any federal court or tribunal to work effectively, there are instances where the imposition of fees is necessary. Fees for federal courts and tribunals were increased by the former government on 1 January 1996 in line with the then CPI. The problem we had to face was getting the right balance so that the community's access to justice remained unimpeded by exorbitant legal costs and court fees&mdash;a balance, I am proud to say, that I think we maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The notion of installing an uneven user&hyphen;pays system across the board was as abhorrent to us as it should have been to the present government. What did the present Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, Sir Gerard Brennan, have to say about the practice of user pays as applied to our nation's judicial system? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect, that profoundly mistakes the constitutional function of the judicial power of the state which, as I have said, is to apply the rule of law in resolving disputes and thereby preserving the peace, order and good government of society. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to turn to the Access to Justice Advisory Committee report where it reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We consider that there should be some court fees, even if simply in recognition of the need to fund an expensive social service and the difficulty of doing so with one less source of revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, we strongly believe that even though it is only particular individuals who are engaged in litigation, the whole community may be classified as users of the court system. This is because everyone benefits from having disputes resolved in an orderly manner . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is the balance that Labor aimed at reaching. In turn, we were negligent neither in our financial responsibilities towards the courts nor in delivering to the Australian people the level of justice that they expected to receive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what we have here now is a situation where the fees to be imposed reach such heights, despite the Attorney-General's recent backdowns, that the access to  justice mentioned by Mr Sackville and Sir Anthony Mason, as I described earlier, will be gravely threatened. When considered with all the other cutbacks to the justice budget, I think the situation becomes even more serious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the Family Court we have a two per cent reduction in running costs of the court, worth $1.2 million, thanks to the two per cent increase in savings demanded through the efficiency dividend. We have another cut to the court's running costs of $2 million in order to meet the government's election commitments. The court has also seen $1.65 million worth of programs disappear&mdash;programs that were promised by the previous Labor government's Justice Statement and which the coalition promised to maintain. Obviously, that was not a core promise. The court has also had to bear its share of the Attorney-General's portfolio savings imposts of over half a million dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now let us look at the charges. There is a new $150 fee&mdash;revised down, thankfully, from $250&mdash;for applications for matters other than divorce in the Family Court. But, if you want to file for divorce, you will have to pay almost $150 extra for the privilege, the costs now having risen from $368 to $500. Then there is the new fee for setting down a matter for a full hearing in the Family Court&mdash;$300 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7640"> to be exact, revised down from the government's original target of $400.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were 56,052 Family Court files opened in the period between July 1994 and June 1995. Each file would deal with a minimum of two people. So you are looking easily at over 100,000 people becoming directly involved with the court over this period. That is an awful lot of Australians. More importantly, that is an awful lot of Australian families, many of whom we know will be far from having the finances and who come from very disadvantaged backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How ironic is it that the court which impacts upon the lives of such an enormous number of Australians has been hit so hard by the Howard government's first budget? It makes a mockery of the Prime Minister's repeated assertions about the importance of Australian families to him and his government. On the one hand, we had the Prime Minister and his platitudes about the family providing the best welfare support system yet devised and how `protecting the family is the key to maintaining social cohesion and economic stability in the future'. But then he is not against placing the Family Court&mdash;an institution which, hopefully, helps families during periods of breakdown and great stress&mdash;out of the reach of thousands upon thousands of people who would benefit from its services via this outrageous increase of fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another problem with the introduction of an unbalanced fee system in the Family Court is that, because of the proposed fees that will apply to each application sought in the court, it would more than likely have the effect of encouraging people to apply for everything at once rather than pausing and giving further consideration and perhaps coming back later to make a separate application. So instead of, for example, simply applying for a property settlement, parties to the marriage may be tempted to include all issues, such as spousal maintenance, custody, guardianship and access, in one application. Quite obviously, if that happens, the opportunity for problems to be created where previously there were none is going to be enormous.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition inherited a legal system which worked better than just all right. To use the phrase made popular by the Prime Minister, it was `better than the curate's egg, better than just good in part'. Where there were errors, where the system was inadequate, we had in place $160 million in the shape of Labor's Justice Statement&mdash;money which the Liberal Party, in its law and justice policy, promised to match and extend to improve the situation even further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the government's failing to meet their commitments is one thing but to deliberately go out of the way to make the system most unfair, taking justice even further from the grasp of ordinary Australians, is another thing altogether. The government have shown a capacity to rethink their decisions on this issue. I would hope that they would revisit this question once again. Hopefully, they will realise then that fee increases of this magnitude will be introduced to the detriment of us all&mdash;not just the legal system, but our whole society. If the government continue in this direction, they will justifiably wear our condemnation and bear the full consequences of their actions. I certainly oppose this bill before the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7641">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support this Family Law Amendment Bill 1996, as this issue is one of the most pressing concerns for a number of constituents in Bowman. What has evolved over a vast number of years is a bureaucratic system that vainly attempts to administer family breakdown and attempts to redress financial concerns for, in many cases, warring family units.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of all the issues confronting me as a new member, this single issue is a continual weeping sore. Month after month the list grows longer of fathers and mothers who come to me in an effort to resolve the difficulties they face daily, weekly and monthly with an idea of resolution of their conflict with either their ex-partner, their solicitor, the CSA or the Family Court. No other issue creates the kind of emotional and financial turmoil that, at this point, seems to have no end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Family breakdown is a critical point in, unfortunately, all too many families in all areas across Australia today. People going through family breakdown currently have access to either the Family Court Counselling Service and the Family Court mediation section, private counsellors and mediators or a wide range of community agencies&mdash;many of which are funded by the government. The purpose of these services is to act as the first port of call in the early process of negotiating a breakdown in relationships. What this bill puts in place is a recovery of fees for services rendered. It brings into line cost recovery for services currently provided or accessed at the Family Law Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Family Law Amendment Bill will serve two functions. Firstly, it has been designed to remove an inequity in the provision of voluntary counselling and mediation services. Secondly, funds raised from the imposition of a fee for this service will both help to reduce the horrendous budget deficit this government inherited upon coming to power in March and provide much needed additional funds for the Family Court counselling and mediation services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an effort to reduce the $8 billion deficit, this government has taken steps to ensure that the burden is spread evenly across the community. We have done this with sensible <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reductions in outlays and modest increases in user charges where those who can pay do so. The government introduced a number of measures in the budget which are designed to reduce the budget deficit and to provide a much more efficient court system. Some of these changes include a reduction of $2 million to running costs. Increased fees for filing of divorce and cuts to programs initiated by the former government in its poorly devised Justice Statement will amount to a saving of over $1.5 million. In the case of counselling and mediation services, the government is saying that those who seek the service from the Family Court should pay the same as those who use the community sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I delve too deeply into the whys and wherefores of this measure, let me give a brief background of the Family Court. The Family Court of Australia was set up under the Family Law Act 1975. This act was responsible for the concept of no&hyphen;fault divorce, which emphasised the preference for resolving disputes with conciliation rather than litigation. From all reports, this was a sound concept. The court's 1994-95 annual report stated that only five per cent of all divorce cases for that year were litigated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report also appeared to justify the fact that the service provided by the Family Court is free to all those who utilise it. In fact, the service has become so popular and successful that, in the 1994-95 financial year, the number of cases dealt with by the counselling service rose by 7,800 to a total of 32,378 cases. Almost 50 per cent of the counselling was voluntary and held before either party had filed for divorce. It is also interesting to note that the majority of this counselling was used for the settlement of property and maintenance disputes rather than for reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would seem timely to remind those present that the cost of keeping the Family Court running is now well in excess of $100 million per year. It is also worth pointing out that none of the 64,000-odd people who access the court service contributed to the running costs of the court. Does this seem fair?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government funds both the Family Court and the community sector to provide <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7642"> the counselling and mediation service, but only those accessing the community sector have to pay. I would point out, however, that those who cannot afford to pay are exempt from the fees. The demand for counselling has been so great that it is not possible for all to have access to the Family Court's free service. More often than not, it is those in rural and remote locations who are forced to pay for the service due to this demand. This is a most inequitable system, affecting the sector of the community which seems to be asked to pay time and time again. Why should one sector have an advantage over another purely on the basis of geography?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the members opposite start bleating about how the government is placing more burdens on the already overtaxed public, I would remind them that these changes had been flagged by the former administration. This was indicated in the former Attorney-General's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Portfolio Budget Statements</EMPHASIS> for 1995-96. Also, when the previous government commissioned a review of fees and charges in Commonwealth courts, charges for counselling and mediation services as provided by the Family Court were part of those proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In introducing this bill, the government has set in place a number of provisions that ensure that, when imposed, the fee will be paid only by those who seek voluntary counselling and mediation. This means that, if a couple has not sought any form of counselling prior to going to court and the judge subsequently orders them to do so, they cannot be charged for that service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The bill also allows regulations to be made that exempt certain people from paying fees and services. How fair can you get? These include people who hold health care entitlement cards from the Department of Social Security and the Department of Veterans' Affairs, those on legal aid, prisoners, those in receipt of Austudy or Abstudy and those who, in the view of the court, would suffer financial hardship as a result of having to pay a fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1">  Not only the Family Court will provide a free service under these guidelines. Community based services will also provide free coun selling and mediation services for those who are unable to pay. As with anything, there will always be those who think they can beat the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In the case of voluntary counselling and mediation, it has been suggested that couples will elect to postpone counselling until after the initial paperwork is done. They would then rely on the judge or registrar to order the couple to seek counselling. The court may order a couple to seek counselling if issues between the couple could impact on the care, welfare or development of a child under the age of 18. With almost 60 per cent of all divorces in 1995-96 involving children, this could leave open the way for half of all divorce parties to avoid paying a fee. This would be an extreme measure for a couple to take to save what would be a rather paltry fee. It also relies on the judge or registrar to order the counselling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Also, if people seek counselling and mediation as a valuable process, they will seek it prior to filing an application with the courts. This is most important in this whole process. There are obviously a large number of people who see counselling and mediation services as worth while; otherwise, no-one would choose to go to community based services for which they always pay. It should be pointed out that section 19B(1) of the act provides that the court can, with the consent of the parties, order mediation. I repeat that it would be with the consent of the parties. This means that, if both parties consent to mediation, they are in effect choosing voluntary counselling or mediation and would therefore be required to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Again, I stress that this bill has been proposed to redress the current inequities, not to discourage couples from seeking counselling services; it is quite the contrary. The government is totally committed to encouraging the use of conciliation and mediation rather than litigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Section 14 of the act sets out the objectives in relation to dispute resolution. The object of this part is to encourage people to use primary dispute resolution mechanisms, such as counselling, mediation, arbitration or any other means of conciliation or reconciliation. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7643"> This is to resolve matters in which a court order might otherwise be made under this act, provided the mechanisms are appropriate in the circumstances and proper procedures are followed. It is also to ensure that people have access to counselling to improve relationships covered by this act and to help them adjust to court orders made under it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The government also believes that there should be greater reliance on the prevention of disputes and alternative methods of dispute resolution rather than on court actions. The government is providing more money for marriage education to try to give people the necessary skills to better deal with conflicts in the marriage situation. While not actually part of this bill, it is nonetheless an important initiative of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since being elected, I have been amazed by the number of people in child support cases that have presented in my electorate office of Bowman. During the campaign, I had many such people come to me in frustration and with a lack of support from the former member and a lack of commitment by the former government to sort out the Child Support Agency. Since March, I have had a constant stream of both men and women coming through the door. The men are almost exclusively upset with the way that they have been treated by the system either in relation to payments or access, while the women are upset over non-payment by former partners. In almost all cases, it is the system that is at fault and not the individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot help thinking that, had these people had access to better counselling prior to getting married, these problems may never have arisen. Once problems surface in a marriage, it would be ideal if reconciliation were possible. However, for those who are unable to resolve their differences, it is vital that they seek immediate counselling and mediation to ensure that these problems are not compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The breakdown of marriage is possibly the most emotionally draining and depressing period of a person's life. Being able to access professional counselling and mediation services can sometimes mean the difference between an amicable separation and one in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which all those concerned suffer. As I mentioned earlier, almost 60 per cent of divorces involve children under the age of 18. These people in particular require early intervention. With the increasing demands on the system, many of these people will either miss out on counselling altogether or receive counselling too late.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of this bill will reduce pressure on the Family Court by providing additional funds for the service. It is important to remember that this amendment does not impose any charges. Any charges would have to be made by regulation. The bill provides power for the Governor-General in Council to make regulations, which would then provide for fees to be charged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney-General (Mr Williams), in his second reading speech, said that if a fee equivalent to the one charged by the community based sector were imposed it would be a fee of about $40 per hour. On current figures, this would amount to $835,000 in revenue in the 1996-97 financial year. This would increase to almost $2 million in the full financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, these funds will have a twofold  purpose. Firstly, they will provide a much needed boost to the current system and reduce some of the pressure. Secondly, they will help overall budget deficit reduction. Why the former government was set to impose the fee is unclear. This government's motives are crystal clear. We inherited a massive deficit. Without wishing to repeat myself, we have set about reducing the deficit in the fairest possible way. It is never a desirable task imposing a fee on the already overburdened taxpayer. However, it is equally undesirable to have one section of the community pay for a service that others are getting for free.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has put in place a number of strategies to assist families, pensioners, businesses and many others. We have dismantled a virtual plethora of inefficient programs put in place by the former government and replaced them with more workable and efficient models. This amendment is simply another initiative of the Howard coalition government to provide a more equitable <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7644"> system for all Australians. It is for these reasons that I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened with great interest to the member for Bowman (Mrs West). I noted her attack on the former member for Bowman, and the allegation that he did nothing about the child support scheme. Let me just place on the record that, when the former member for Bowman was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, he was responsible for introducing the review office. It is true that there are criticisms of that function. However, it is infinitely better than taking a dispute about an assessment by the Child Support Agency to the Family Court. In fact, that proved to be an impossibility. So I can't agree with the honourable member for Bowman that Con Sciacca, the former member, was indifferent. He was responsible for a very important reform; a reform that one would hope would go further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is true that in family law issues&mdash;including the Family Court and issues surrounding child support&mdash;there is a great deal of common concern between members on different sides of the House. That is why I found the member for Bowman's contribution a little pathetic. I want to acknowledge and recognise that concern. I really do believe that we have got a long way to go in reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last parliament it was my privilege to chair the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, which reviewed the child support scheme. I have always been critical of the fact that there remain 110 recommendations by the committee unresponded to by the former government. Having said that, there has not been a scintilla of progress by the present government in responding to that report. All members on both sides of the House have much to gain by the government putting the bit between its teeth and making a meaningful and purposeful response to that report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also need to place on the record that it is matter of history that the Chief Justice of the Family Court and I had a noteable disagreement. All but one of the members of the opposition who were on the committee asked me to bow down to the pressure exerted on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> me by the Chief Justice and resign my position as chairman of that committee. It is something that I declined to do. I have to ask: why was it that the Chief Justice took such umbrage to a speech that I made? I said that I believed that the Family Court was failing Australians. I said it was a litigation superhighway; it remains so today. I find it pathetic when people in this House get up and say, `Only five per cent of cases end up actually going through the court process.' It takes no account of the money that both sides to the argument are spending on their legal fees. It takes no account of the fact that they get financially exhausted by the process. They use all their available money. They use bankcard. They will go into debt. It is only then that they drop out of the process. The five per cent represents those who are not financially exhausted. It is not a success rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say a couple of things about mediation. Last week I went to the opening of Unifam in the electorate of the honourable member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly). I thank her for that, and for the way she graciously acknowledged my presence there. I am a great supporter of other methods of dispute resolution&mdash;mediation, counselling, arbitration. But, if we want to see how successful we are being in family law, there are some simple tests that we need to apply. At the moment this government&mdash;and, historically, governments&mdash;is content to throw $100 million at dead marriages and relationships. I can't understand why. I believe profoundly in the benefit of counselling. The simple test is this: we ought to have a system of family law that allows the overwhelming majority of people to separate with dignity, with a concern for their children, and to get on with their new lives. That is a simple test. That is what the original Murphy reforms were all about. It is about time that we, on both sides of the House, admitted that is not happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I talked about $100 million. It costs $100 million a year to run the Family Court. In terms of counselling, we need to spend money further up the relationship tree. The more money we can spend while people are still in a marriage, still in a relationship, the better the prospects are that we will strengthen that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7645"> relationship. But, should it fail, there is a higher probability that that failure will not be accompanied by so much trauma, anguish and anger&mdash;however you would like to describe it. That is not happening. I would welcome a lot of things: pre&hyphen;marriage education&mdash;I think it is great, but it is not the total solution&mdash;and marriage contracts, which I think are great. They actually ought to have a time line so that parties revisit them to reassess their needs, what they are getting out of the relationship and what they are looking for in the future&mdash;anything that gets the couples talking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said on a number of occasions that I think we have some real male taboos to overcome in society, that is, that we will talk about everything in our relationship other than its failure. To be seen to be going to counselling while still in a marriage or a relationship is still a male taboo. I regret that. We need to be encouraging processes that overcome that&mdash;anything that allows us to understand that a relationship is a dynamic thing that changes over time. People need to meet that change and, above all, to be communicating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am horrified that we are now talking about insisting on fees for service, for example, in mediation. There are going to be a lot of people in my constituency who, having a service at Penrith designed to cover people from Auburn to over the mountains&mdash;Lithgow, Orange, Bathurst&mdash;will find it really an impossible mission. The fee for service is going to stop them. Of course, mediation is not an appropriate mechanism for everyone to resolve their differences. In fact, it is probably a very good middle&hyphen;class approach to resolving differences because the role of the mediator is to facilitate a decision amongst people with equal power or an equal opportunity to contribute, to come to grips with the problems that they are having.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate, people would like to see a service that is stillborn as far as the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department is concerned&mdash;and may they hang their heads in shame&mdash;and that is, arbitration. They want to be able to take their concerns, the areas of their dispute, to a neutral person and have them decide. Some will want mediation, but overwhelmingly they will want arbitration. It is for that reason, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> when we were looking at the funding and administration of the Family Court, that there were some suggestions of a no&hyphen;frills family tribunal, much like the Consumer Complaints Tribunal in the states where people can take the issues that are dividing them to such a tribunal and have a decision arbitrated and there is not a problem of access or a problem of equity. The honourable member for Bowman is making a virtue of the fact that we are charging for this service. I would be interested to hear from the department, in the summing up process on this bill, whether they could tell me how many people they estimate will not be able to take advantage of the service because they are putting a fee on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We talked about a no&hyphen;frills family tribunal. Indeed, it was the current Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) who coined the phrase `the commission of the family'. Underlining both things was that we want to return the Family Court to a proper court where those who want to slug it out&mdash;those who have the family silver to pay for it&mdash;can actually slug it out, solicitor to solicitor, barrister to barrister, QC to QC. There will always be those cases that need to go to the court. But, as much as possible, we need to take the other services out of the court. I am not one who says that the Family Court should not have access to counselling services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I invite the advisers at the table to go to New Zealand, as I did, and have a look at the family court there. They do not have one counsellor as an officer of the court. You might be impressed by their court houses, by the way, because they operate out of district courts, not these mausoleums, these hugely expensive buildings that we put up in capital cities, believing that it is somehow appropriate for families to settle their differences in these things. They do it out of district courts, but they have the money to requisition whatever counselling services they require. They requisition it and they are very happy with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New Zealand government believes that it is worth while spending taxpayers' money on reconciliation counselling&mdash;that is, counselling is available not only to these dead corpses of marriages and relationships but when there is still some hope of reconciling <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7646"> the parties. A goodly percentage of their counselling money goes on reconciliation counselling. What does the Attorney&hyphen;General have to say about that? Aren't we interested in keeping families together? Sure, we have to deal with the instances where they break down, but why can't we be spending some of our money on reconciliation counselling? Indeed, ever since the Family Court was established, it has had a responsibility to provide reconciliation counselling. Will the Attorney&hyphen;General tell the House and tell the people of Australia just how much reconciliation counselling the Family Court has done? If he does not bother to respond, let me tell you it is zero. People wander around this place and in this place talking about greater efficiency in the court and how successful and wonderful it is. I do not think it is wonderful. I think it is an area that requires a great deal of reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the honourable member for Bowman said a lot of things to test the patience of members on this side. But saying that the government went to the last election seeking to distinguish itself from parties on this side of the House, as the real champion of families, and then to come into this House and say, `We're happy with the situation; we're providing you with a bill which will for the first time allow the Family Court to charge for voluntary counselling and mediation because of the budget deficit'&mdash;that this is somehow good for Australia&mdash;beggars the imagination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have no idea what individuals pay to the legal profession on their legal costs. I have gone around Australia and been staggered at the amounts of money ordinary people pay for these services. But what is the outcome for those who have the courage to take the step themselves to seek voluntary counselling and voluntary mediation and are told, `You have to pay a fee, estimated at $40 per hour'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Will we here in this House in 12 months time be able to report a significant drop off in the percentage of those who are seeking voluntary counselling and voluntary mediation? I think it behoves the Attorney&hyphen;General and his department to at least give us some <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> indication about whether or not they believe the percentage of people seeking voluntary counselling and voluntary mediation will change for the balance of this year, next year and each year hereafter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that it will, that people will be turned off at the very time that we should be trying to encourage people in the marriage, in the relationship&mdash;when the relationship has collapsed&mdash;to voluntarily seek assistance. The more they do things on a voluntary basis, the less likely it will be that things get out of hand. We should be encouraging it: it is the role of the government to be facilitating it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have asked the Attorney&hyphen;General some questions on notice, and I have had some very bland responses. I say to the Attorney&hyphen;General that there ought to be greater accountability for this $100 million. If you want to save $2 million, why don't you look at the $100 million that you are throwing each and every year at the Family Court? Why can't we be taking more of that money and putting it into mediation, counselling and arbitration? That is where the savings will come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment, we do not give people a choice. The more people are given a choice about whether they go with their daggers drawn with their solicitors and barristers or whether they resolve their differences amicably with dignity and in an uncostly way, I think people will automatically make the latter choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will quickly say something about legal aid. I am appalled at what the department and the Attorney are doing to legal aid. They have said that the Commonwealth money that is in the system must now be spent on exclusively federal matters. It is no longer the case that people will be able to be represented for some of the most serious criminal offences. I find that appalling. Most of the money, of course, is going to go into family law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, if I return to the no&hyphen;frills tribunal, commission of the family approach, you will find that, rather than cases having to be represented in the Family Court and legal aid being spent, in fact legal aid would be saved. There would be significant savings to the legal aid budget if we provided people with a real choice. In other words, people could get <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7647"> off the litigation superhighway, get into their cars, make a left&hyphen;hand or right&hyphen;hand turn and try another approach&mdash;whether it is a combination of counselling, mediation or arbitration. That is why I am a supporter of the commission of the family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last but not least, I refer to a remark made by my good friend the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio). She said that Australians today&mdash;although I believe that it was true of yesterday&mdash;do not believe that they have access to the justice system. They are being priced out of it. Whether it is in family law or any other aspect of the law, ordinary men and women are being priced out of it. It is no good talking about legal rights. A right is only a meaningful right if you are able to exercise it. In this day and age, if you do not have the financial wherewithal, you cannot exercise it. Therefore, you do not have the right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a lot of issues of human rights in Australia that I am concerned about. My second greatest concern is people's inability to exercise their rights before the law&mdash;none more so than in family law, I regret to say. I do not agree with the proposition that fees should be charged.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to follow the member for Chifley (Mr Price) in this debate. I found his contribution to be one from the heart, if not one from the head and, I suspect, based on his last few comments, one also from the hip pocket. As the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) has already advised the House, the purpose of the Family Law Amendment Bill 1996 is to enable the Family Court to charge fees for the use of its voluntary counselling and mediation services. This will even up the current situation where Commonwealth funded, community based organisations charge a fee for their counselling services while the Family Court services are free of charge. It does not make sense; it is an imbalance; it is certainly not a fair arrangement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not fair geography should be the deciding factor as to whether or not a person pays for counselling either. This clearly discriminates against people living in rural or <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> isolated areas. While I would not describe anyone who has to use these particular services as lucky, it is certainly the case people able to access the Family Court services have an advantage over those who cannot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one considers the cost of running the Family Court is now over $100 million per year&mdash;as the member for Chifley said, `$100 million per year thrown at family breakdowns'&mdash;I do not see how anyone can argue against the introduction of some modest fees for its voluntary counselling services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a responsible measure. It is based on the user&hyphen;pays principle and on this basis it is quite fair. I am also sure general taxpayers will support this measure because it will reduce expenditure of their taxation dollars in an area which not all taxpayers access. It is estimated the fee will generate approximately $1.7 million in revenue in a full year. So it is a modest part of the overall budget; nevertheless, it is a contribution from the individuals who access the services of the Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will be amending the Family Law Act 1975 to authorise the Governor&hyphen;General in Council to make appropriate regulations for the introduction of these fees for these particular services provided by the Family Court. Of course, as is the case with community based counselling services, if a person cannot afford to pay, they will not be charged for counselling. I think this is an important point to emphasise because it seems to have been glossed over by several of the contributions on the other side. Essentially, if you cannot afford to pay for the fee, if you can produce what would have to be very obvious proof of your inability to afford these fees, then there are measures contained within this bill to ensure you will not pay those fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this adds a deal of the equity, which the member for Chifley was talking about in his contribution, back into the equation. It is also important to note fees will not be payable should the court itself order or direct counselling&mdash;which means, quite simply, if in the opinion of the hearing process and the deliberation of the Family Court counselling is ordered, the participants involved in counselling are not going to pay. So here is another equity measure&mdash;another, if you like, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7648"> boosting of the proposition against what the member for Chifley and some others have had to say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am speaking on this bill because, quite simply, marriage breakdowns and the consequences of it would have to be, by my estimate and the estimate of staff in my electoral office, the single largest pressing social issue in my electorate. When one considers matters such as unemployment, the general economy, the economic wellbeing of the nation and other factors which seem to hog the headlines in the newspapers&mdash;and perhaps would create the perception they are far more pressing&mdash;it is the consequences of marriage breakdowns which have preoccupied, in a category sense, perhaps the biggest amount of time in my short time as the member for Moreton.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is one of the reasons, I submit, the previous government lost the 2 March election. I make this bold claim&mdash;perhaps in some people's minds it is bold&mdash;simply based on getting around and talking and listening to victims of the system prior to the 2 March election. I talked to people who were from blended families, where a partner from a broken marriage had got together with someone else from a broken marriage. The male, invariably being the non-custodial parent from the previous marriage and, quite rightly, financing the ongoing activities of the children from his first marriage often are unable to necessarily support fully the new relationship. I do not like to suggest it is always males but invariably, as you would imagine, it generally is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hurt generated by this particular situation cannot be underestimated. It is not a case of typecasting males out of a broken relationship as those who begrudgingly contribute to the wellbeing of their children from the broken relationship. It is certainly not fair at all. It is not fair to suggest they are the only ones who carry the burden. Their broader family and their friends also carry the burden of the stress and the strain. To have grown men&mdash;men who have been miners, successful salesmen, labourers, men from all walks of life&mdash;come to you and in some cases cry to you and to members of my staff about the particular hurt they are carrying on a daily <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> basis is a very sobering experience and one I will not forget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note, in Queensland alone, 200 families a week separate&mdash;10,000 families a year; not necessarily always marriages, but certainly significant relationships. This is an amazing figure estimated and compiled by groups who are in the business of trying to hold together the lives of some of the people involved in marriage breakdowns. There is no doubt, as you know, the children suffer through all of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Whilst the subject of the Child Support Agency will be a matter to come before the House later on in this parliament, it is certainly worth noting in my contribution today, from what I can see, the Child Support Agency has fast become in a lot of ways the custodial parent's revenge agency where, essentially, males are put through the wringer by the system. I know the honourable member for Bowman (Mrs West), in her contribution, made similar observations and I certainly endorse those comments, those observations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite telling to see grown people being put through all sorts of hell by a system set up by legislation we pass in this place. It is very important, when matters such as this bill come before the House, there is free and wide-ranging debate and discussion on the issue. The member for Chifley endorsed many of the comments I have just made by his observations as someone who was in charge of the review of the Child Support Agency in the 37th Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the member for Chiefly's observations, 110 recommendations were unresponded to by the former government which in itself endorses my observation: a lot of what happened on 2 March comes back to the underground word which was out about how bad matters were in relation to marriage breakdowns and the handling of the debris by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Chifley suggested there has not been a scintilla of change since 2 March. I do not dispute the fact: on the surface there has not been the change so many of my constituents would like to see. I know for a fact I have urged the former minister in charge of this particular area, Senator Short, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7649"> and most recently, Senator Rod Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, to work on this matter&mdash;and I know they are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not the only one pressuring them. A few of us have pinned them down on a couple of occasions and told them very bluntly about what we are seeing and hearing in our own electorate. It is our job to do so. These ministers have worked on this matter and I know Senator Kemp will continue to work on this matter. Results of their work will come before this place in the form of legislation which has already been forecast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not 100 per cent sure whether the legislation will address the real hurt in the short term. When the matter does come before this place, it is important for us to all look seriously at it. We need to put human faces and human situations to the matters we discuss in order to emphasise the matters which may need improving, to highlight the matters which may not be fully disclosed and to work on getting a good and sensible outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of raising children does not necessarily rise in accordance with a rise in income, which is essentially the CSA's formula. We need to know exactly what it does cost to raise children. I make this important submission partly because a lot of non&hyphen;custodial parents are robbed of the opportunity to be generous. I am not talking about people who have white&hyphen;collar jobs; I am talking about people who work down the mines. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Marek) will be making a contribution on this bill later. As a former miner, no doubt he will be able to speak about some of those matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I have spoken with people who work in the coalmines out beyond Ipswich, to the west of my electorate. They are on $80,000 to $90,000 a year. They are being forced by the system to contribute large chunks of money because of the Child Support Agency formula and, if they want to save up and buy something additional for their children from the former marriage, they find themselves unable to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The resulting frustration leads them to start to retreat from the work force. In this country today we are finding people withdrawing from <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the workplace, although they have the capacity to contribute to their own personal wellbeing and the wellbeing of society. As figures suggest, the proportion of unemployed amongst non&hyphen;custodial parents is roughly twice the national average.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a wide&hyphen;ranging number of reasons, the bill before us today is very important, even though it creates additional costs for some participants involved in family law matters. Whilst both people in a relationship which dissolves carry a great burden, the burdens added through this bill are really very small compared with their overall burdens. It is a form of user&hyphen;pays which, from my observations, seems fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the greatest burdens are being carried by non&hyphen;custodial parents, particularly men who find they are not very good at sharing their problems. The honourable member for Chifley put it rather well when he said there are those who find it very difficult to expose themselves to their society when their relationships fail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When things are going well, they are okay; when things are not going well, they are not okay. We have seen some fairly horrible examples of how, when pressures have built up, silent retreat has changed into anger and depression. Unfortunately, on occasions, we have seen violence and other activities coming out of non&hyphen;custodial parents' frustrations. None of us want to see more of such things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sensitive as these matters are and horrible as they are, in a purer sense, we must be very cognisant of the very real hurt out there in the community&mdash;the suffering of children and the suffering of society in general&mdash;and of the pressure on a wide range of community groups which are in the business of trying to pick up the pieces. Nevertheless, they are charging for some of their activities, while at the same time&mdash;until this legislation is passed&mdash;the Family Court is not. Through this legislation we are asking for a small contribution to the cost of counselling services of the Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Chifley commented on the member for Bowman's quite fair contribution on the need to prevent rather than cure marriage breakdowns. This government is doing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7650"> something positive about helping people entering relationships. It is very good to understand some of the responsibilities they have in a relationship and not just simply to look through rose&hyphen;coloured glasses at the benefits which may come. I went through pre&hyphen;marital training prior to my marriage 13 years ago and I believe it helped my wife and I understand a little bit about some of the pressures to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But circumstances can change. Tougher financial pressures, hopes and dreams dashed, aspirations unrealised&mdash;they all place pressures on any relationship. While I gladly support this government's initiative in doing something positive about assisting and encouraging people to find out a little bit about themselves, their contributions and their responsibilities in any relationship&mdash;as a form of prevention rather than cure&mdash;I am also realistic enough to acknowledge things can change. Prevention, unless there is ready and constant inoculation, may actually do nothing to cure the possible consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess one of the other consequences is the advent of children. Many people married in the last 10 or 15 years are having children far later. Children are a pleasure, but they can also be a pressure on any relationship. They can signal a change to working arrangements. Generally, it is the woman in the relationship who will retire from the paid work force, only to work longer and harder hours for far smaller amounts of remuneration. Others of course try to struggle through the nightmare of child&hyphen;care arrangements to maintain career paths and to help keep ends meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a lot of pressures out there. I praise the church and community groups which are attempting to make the difference by assisting marriages before they start, maintaining marriages whilst they are going and preventing marriages from ending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the bill on the basis it is quite fair and reasonable we should ask those who want to access counselling services through the Family Court to make a contribution. The bill will amend the regulation making power set out in section 125(1)(c) to allow regulations to be made to impose fees for voluntary <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> counselling and mediation services provided by the court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, those matters which are referred by the court&mdash;counselling which is directed&mdash;will not be subject to these fees. Those who are unable to pay the fees because of financial difficulties will have a mechanism to get out of paying those fees. But I think it is quite fair and reasonable those who can afford counselling in the community based sector but choose not to use it and voluntarily seek access to counselling through the Family Court should be prepared to pay for it. The $100 million plus a year allocated to the Family Court can be offset in a small way which is fair and equitable for all those who are accessing the services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, this bill extends the power to grant proposed mediation counselling services exemptions from fees. The exemption provisions which currently apply to other fees payable in the court will apply to any fees imposed in relation to these voluntary counselling and mediation services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All up, this bill is well thought through, modest in its application and fair in its effect. In the overall scheme of things, given the real pain, the real pressure, the real hurt and the real cost felt by people involved in the horrible experience of marital breakdown, it is quite modest indeed. A few dollars here will make a big difference as far as the budget is concerned. For those reasons, I support this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been a member of this House for a long time. Successive governments have brought legislation into this House when they have wanted to appear to be doing something but really did not have the courage to do what had to be done. This is such a piece of legislation. I further note that the most sanctimonious contributions have predictably come from the lawyers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Family Court is an abomination in Australia. It has become a burden on the people of Australia and with it, of course, the Child Support Agency, which is contingent upon the Family Court. It is a very expensive court&mdash;the most expensive in Australia. It is a court that encourages litigation. I heard one <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7651"> of the previous speakers say that only five per cent of cases finally end up in the court system. That is because people are driven financially bankrupt; they are totally broken by the actions of their lawyers. This, I believe, must be attended to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Child Support Agency is wreaking havoc in the community. The previous speaker, the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave), did touch on some very true points. Had they not been garnished with so much sanctimony, they would have had more credibility. I know of cases in my own electorate where people have been driven out of very well paid employment and onto the dole simply because they were better off financially than they were by meeting the commitments imposed on them by legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me some things ought to be very readily done. Custodial parents must be made accountable; there is no accountability at the moment whatsoever. I believe the percentages paid should be based on circumstances at the time of the breakdown of the marriage. I also believe that payments should be related to the real costs of raising children. Quite clearly, caring for a young child does not cost anything near what an older child costs. I think there is room for staggering the costs or putting the money in trust so that the custodial parent must spend it on the child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The custodial parent's own financial position should be taken into account because, in many cases, they are doing very well through other income. The non&hyphen;custodial parent, particularly if remarried and trying to raise another family, is under enormous economic pressure. There is simply no equity in the system. I also think we have to look very carefully at access because I know this causes enormous angst in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the government's response to this? The government's response is to raise a charge for conciliation by the court. People in country areas have had to pay this anyway. Free court services have not been available to country people in most cases, so this is not going to be anything new to them. Frankly, I do not think the courts are well equipped to provide conciliation. Some of the private <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> agencies that are funded by the government do it better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we should be looking at is improving the situation. That could best be done, in my view, by the total abolition of the Family Court. But, if we insist on maintaining it, it should be maintained as a branch of the Supreme Court&mdash;in fact, as a branch of the District Court with the Supreme Court as an appeal mechanism. Magistrates should be able to act as registrars. Magistrates should be able to make orders nisi and they should be compelled to take evidence so that, if there is litigation&mdash;and people wanting to litigate should be given 28 days&mdash;the evidence would be there in documented form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These things should be sorted out much more in the community, where the breakdowns occur. In particular, the burdens should be lifted from people in country areas, where there are often no lawyers. These people must seek legal advice in a nearby town which may be miles from where the court is held. In turn, town agents and barristers are briefed and, by the time the matter goes to court, it bears very little relevance to the real issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let's face it: magistrates today are enormously underworked, yet they are as qualified as anyone in the Family Court and they should be able to attend to the problems where they occur. Under this system, we would get quick and fair resolution. The only people who would be using litigation would be the very rich. If they were to spend their money in that way, I would have no objection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let's face it: Australia is the third most litigious country in the world. In fact we are third after the states of California and Texas and higher than the average of the United States, which we are often told has an appalling record in this area. It is a growing problem in Australia and it must be tackled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To suggest that this small amount is going to make a difference to the government's budgetary problems is absurd nonsense when the government is not prepared to tackle the very high cost of the Family Court. I would be prepared to accept the very high cost if the court were working, but clearly it is not. If one looks at the incidence of suicide, I think <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7652"> one will find a very close relationship between actions in the Family Court and suicides&mdash;often murder-suicides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly the court is not considered by the great majority of people to be providing any form of justice. It seems to me that, since one can get married without a battery of lawyers or a judge, one should be able to get divorced the same way. If there is amicable agreement in the break&hyphen;up, it seems to me that there does not need to be any more than a registration of the agreement. In most states, certainly in Queensland, clerks of the courts are all as equally qualified as magistrates or judges. They should be perfectly capable of registering those decisions, which should then of course be binding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The arbitration act specifically excludes lawyers for a very good reason. Arbitration should be in respect of property rights. If you have arbitration in these areas, there is absolutely no need for the presence of lawyers. If these matters are heard in a local court, the magistrate should be able to call the accountants or perhaps the school teachers of the parties. For instance, if there have been suggestions of child abuse, the magistrate should get out there and talk to the children. Magistrates should be made to earn their substantial money. You would get a substantial increase in real benefit to the community if this course were followed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In New South Wales there is a longstanding organisation which actually pre-dates local government in New South Wales. I think it is called the lands board. It deals with arguments relating to land and land tenure, and it seems to work extremely well indeed. In relation to marriage, it seems to me that an organisation such as this could be emulated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The contribution in this House by the member for Chifley (Mr Price) is significant. He is an excellent member and in this particular debate he brings unparalleled insight and knowledge. I believe his contribution to this debate is significant and, while I would perhaps go further than what the member for Chifley said, this House should acknowledge the always responsible contribution that he makes to debate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I joined in the debate only because of the strong views that I have on the clear failure of the Family Court. When Justice Murphy set up this court, he was looking for a way to simplify things. I believe that was his agenda. It has been sadly perverted. It has been turned into a monstrosity which is a millstone around the neck of Australia and it is going to become an even bigger burden. Nothing that the government has done in this bill will alter that fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When people eventually go to court, they want a real court. They do not want to sit around in a very expensive forum with people lounging around. When people talk to the court, they should stand. The Family Court should observe all the forms of other courts. I therefore think we should give serious consideration to abandoning the Family Court altogether and making it merely a branch of the District Court, with appeals going to the Supreme Court. There is no need for the edifice. It is growing and it will continue to grow. The government talks about a two per cent efficiency contribution from the court. It would make much more sense to abolish the system and save far more money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we are talking about family breakdown, it does seem rather parsimonious of the government, to say the least&mdash;I was looking for a more offensive word, but it has eluded me&mdash;to talk about saving the very small amount of money that we are talking about here when it clearly is going to put additional pressure on people already under a lot of stress. It must be remembered that one of the great problems in a marriage break&hyphen;up is that there is never enough money to go around. Why should we therefore be in a situation where that money which is available is gobbled up by the legal fraternity? There is absolutely no doubt in my view that in many cases there should not be the need for legal representation, unless both parties agree or unless the court thinks that it would lead to a shortening of proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The case I have outlined obviously needs some refinement, but it does offer a way back for the government if it wants to get back to a system where the courts really do provide justice for the community. In the present <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7653"> system, justice is clearly becoming something available for either the very rich or the very poor.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly today to speak on the Family Law Amendment Bill 1996, which relates to raising the fees for some counselling and mediation services. Apparently the community based sector does charge fees, and this legislation would be bringing the Family Court into line with that process. It is an all too rare occasion when we in this place fundamentally agree on the basic points concerning the Family Court. The child support scheme, of course, becomes part of that discussion very quickly afterwards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will touch on the comments of the member for Chifley (Mr Price). The member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) has really given a great plaudit to that gentleman and his effort, and I fully endorse that. His contribution in the 37th Parliament, and again in this parliament, on this issue is in that leadership role which we need to have on an issue such as this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any member of parliament who has been touched by the tragedy of murder or suicide will never forget the look in a mother's face or a grandfather's face and the despair that is felt. It is something that certainly will stay with me all of my life. I will be as careful as I possibly can be on this issue because these matters that I am thinking of are still before the courts. It is an overwhelming sense of frustration. It is not for me to stand here today and blame one party or the other or one institution or the other. It is simply to provide the personal evidence that these events do occur and indicate the abysmal failure of our system to cope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> We know the general statistics in these matters. We know of the rate of family breakdown and marriage breakdown. We know the record of the child support scheme and the Child Support Agency, which is well documented. We know the debate so well brought into this place again by the member for Chifley about the Family Court and the expenditure of $100 million worth of taxpayers' money. I do not intend to revisit that but just say that the matter that com pelled me to rise in my place today is that overwhelming sense which arises from dealing with a constituent who has been so severely touched by these very traumatic issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will highlight issues relating to the child support scheme. The member for Chifley rightly said that it is for government to facilitate this scheme. I do not agree with the member for Chifley about $40 an hour being a particular issue when you consider the huge costs&mdash;touched on by the member for Kalgoorlie and the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave)&mdash;in the overall legal process, and particularly when you consider the ongoing costs of the Child Support Agency programs that are compulsorily acquired from people's incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the House that, at the time of the parliamentary inquiry into the Child Support Agency, the agency's case load&mdash;these statistics are somewhat old now&mdash;had risen from 23,000 to 275,218 in May 1994. It was increasing at that point at the rate of 7,000 per month. We have heard the member for Moreton talk about the statistics in Queensland alone. The Ombudsman has been consistently critical since 1989-90. On 5 December 1994, the amount outstanding to the Australian Tax Office was $481 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am saying is that the $100 million, and up to $200 million, that this bill directly deals with pales into insignificance when you look at those sorts of numbers and that sort of impact. As the member for Kalgoorlie rightly said, it does not take into account the huge legal fees which are part of the cost that people become drawn in to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will put on the record, in the opportunity that I have here today, some of the things that might help the situation. The member for Chifley quite rightly said that we have to move much further up the relationship tree to be able to address this situation over the longer term, particularly when we recognise that up to a half of marriages will break down and that, on the evidence currently available, that number may well increase up to the turn of the century. So we are really getting to a situation where I think just about everybody <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7654"> would agree that prevention is far better than cure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that we can start at the pre&hyphen;marriage stage, and the member for Chifley has covered that point. When we come to the adversarial nature of the child support scheme, we should be able to set in train some processes which enable that process to be less adversarial. This compulsory requirement to just access someone's income&mdash;leading many people, as has been well stated before, onto the unemployment queue&mdash;surely will not produce the best outcome for everybody.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most interesting thing to me in the evolution of this child support scheme has been that it is the women of the second relationship, or the subsequent relationship, who are the ones who see it as the most unjust. The children of some of these prior relationships, subsequently becoming the responsibility of subsequent relationships, can fall completely between the child support scheme and DSS. In actual fact, under our current system there are children who do not get help from either the child support scheme or DSS. That is how appalling this situation has become.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To move to the child support scheme and the administration of the act itself, the child support scheme is in the Australian Taxation Office, whose role is essentially to line up once a year and get people's money from them&mdash;or once a week or once a month. To be collecting money from people at one of the most difficult times in their lives, I think, only adds to the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coupled with that is an issue that has shown the fallibility of government and administration of these institutions. I have one constituent who was assured that she would be paid back&hyphen;payment on the child support scheme, guaranteed by the child support scheme it would be 30 days, on a process known as a tax block on her ex's tax return, and 12 months later we are still getting legal opinion about the capacity of that agency, whether it has acted appropriately. That is how the systems are letting us down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I endorse most of the comments made by the member for Chifley, the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> member for Kalgoorlie and the member for Moreton. I have taken this opportunity under the Family Law Amendment Bill 1996 to air some of my grievances, my concerns, because this thing is far bigger than any partisan argument. I believe the time has come for this country to address these issues in a fundamental way. We have to start at the beginning of the relationship, pre&hyphen;marriage, the administration of our institutions, of the act itself, and the fundamental addressing by the whole community of an issue which is one of the most important matters in this country, that is, the raising of the family and the institution of marriage, which, I still believe, is the foundation of civilised life as we know it in Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (Jagajaga)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(1.03 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am opposing the amendments proposed in the Family Law Amendment Bill 1996, which give effect to the budget decision to levy fees for counselling and mediation services provided in the Family Court. I am opposing this bill on four main grounds: firstly, because it represents yet another threat to vulnerable people, as the previous speaker, the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin), said, people who are at a very vulnerable stage in their lives. It imposes fees for voluntary counselling and mediation services previously provided free of charge by the Family Court. This may well mean that people in greatest need of counselling and those who would most benefit will not seek it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are told that the fee will be $40 an hour. Many of those opposite are saying this is not such a great sum. I know for many of my constituents it is a very considerable sum, especially as counselling may extend over several sessions and the people involved will already be facing many expenses that come with the end of a marriage. They will also be facing a considerable range of new fees for other services provided through the Family Court, and I will touch on those a bit later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are advised that the fees will be waived for those who cannot afford to pay. But, as far as I can see, the bill provides no details of how this group is to be defined. The Australian Council of Social Service claims that the hardship provisions in fact are very restricted. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7655"> In my own electorate of Jagajaga, for example, these changes are expected to have a significant adverse effect on low income people who are seeking counselling or mediation. I have an excellent service in the West Heidelberg Community Legal Service, which at the moment refers many of its low income clients to services provided by the Family Court. They expect that fewer people will now avail themselves of this service and that as a result many people will be left with much more unsatisfactory maintenance or property settlements than might otherwise have been the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's sole purpose in levying these fees is to raise revenue, and not very much at that. It is going to have a significant impact on some people who are in pretty desperate circumstances while the government expects to raise about $2 million from these charges over the first full year of operation. This $2 million will have a very long&hyphen;term impact and have much more significant costs as far as individuals are concerned. In fact, it will be the case that the long&hyphen;term costs of these policies in terms of pressures on families and individuals will far outweigh these meagre short&hyphen;term savings. I would have to say, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this is a typical example of this government's short&hyphen;term approach to policy development, which does not go beyond this year's budget bottom line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also oppose this bill because I think that the premises on which it is based are false. The Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) has said in a recent press release that one aim of the charges is to encourage people to use counselling and mediation services that are provided in the community. These services are already oversubscribed, so the end result, of course, will be that fewer people in total will gain access to services, regardless of where they are provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This point has been well made by Liz Curran from the Federation of Community Legal Centres, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The mooted changes to the court's counselling and mediation roles will eventually lead to greater expense and greater family breakdown. Why reduce court based services when the community support network isn't there to be able to cope with the increased demand. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>The Attorney&hyphen;General went on to say that the government's approach to family law `will encourage people to resolve their disputes through mediation and counselling rather than embarking on costly court proceedings'. In fact, Mr Deputy Speaker, the reverse will be the case because most voluntary counselling through the Family Court is aimed at property and maintenance settlement rather than reconciliation. That being the case, the amendments cannot fulfil the government's objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third reason for opposing the bill is that I see this as part of a concerted attempt to continue to weaken and undermine the Family Court. The last budget outlined a number of cost&hyphen;cutting, revenue raising measures which the government intends to impose upon the Family Court, besides those charges that are referred to in this bill. Let us have a look at all of those charges: a two per cent efficiency dividend, a cut in running costs, a share of portfolio savings and cuts to programs initiated by the Labor government through its Justice Statement. Then come the real costs for people seeking divorce: a $250 fee for applications other than divorce such as maintenance, property or custody; a $400 fee for setting down a matter for full hearing in the Family Court; and an increase of $92 in the fee for filing for divorce, that is, up from $368 to $460. Some counselling registries have already been closed as a result of these cost&hyphen;cutting measures and others are expected to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My final ground for opposing this bill is that, in my view, it is unworkable. Lawyers may well be able to bypass the charges by postponing counselling until after a divorce is filed and relying on judges or registrars to order counselling, in which case the charge will not apply. Where a child is involved, a court may also order counselling to discuss the care, welfare and development of the child. In these cases, charges will also be waived. If judges believe that free counselling services are essential to fulfilling one of the court's basic aims, that is, solving disputes by conciliation and mediation rather than litigation, they can be expected to order counselling in each of the circumstances outlined above and possibly in others. This would <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7656"> effectively ensure that all counselling is directed rather than voluntary, and therefore not subject to charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recent comments by Justice Alistair Nicholson, the Chief Justice of the Family Court, provide some indication of judges' thinking on all of these changes. In an interview, he commented on these proposed changes in the following way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For 20 years we have been engaged in a particular type of crisis counselling in this Court in which we have a lot of expertise . . . The reality is that they&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, community based legal centres&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">have quite different services . . . Ours is a particularly specialised form of counselling.</PARA>
<PARA>The court's success in reducing the trauma of separation has been severely undervalued. Proposed changes would see divorce in Australia become a more confrontational and legalistic process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of the speakers on this bill have sought to make sure that divorce in this country does not become a more confrontational and legalistic process. I do not think there is anybody in this chamber who would think that such a thing would be a good change for Australia. Nevertheless, these charges will, in fact, lead to more confrontation and more legalism because, of course, the services in the community are not available and people just do not have $40 a pop to pay for counselling services that might assist them before things become more confrontational.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is punitive in intention and, in my view, flawed in concept. It will not achieve its objectives and the Labor Party will oppose it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate on the Family Law Amendment Bill 1996 provides a great opportunity not only to talk about the unfair financial burden cast onto Australian taxpayers that has contributed to the massive $8 billion deficit but also to look at the draconian Child Support Act that continues to drive parents into extreme poverty, ill&hyphen;health and sometimes violence, murder and suicide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The way the system operates is that it gives no compassion to those hurting and in this time of need. This bill will allow regulations <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to be made prescribing fees to be charged only for the voluntary counselling and mediation services provided by the Family Law Court. At present those using the services often make no contribution to the running costs of the court. The running costs, at present, of the Family Law Court are in excess of $100 million per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of making those who can afford to pay for the provision of these services do so was actively considered by the previous Labor government, as indicated in the Attorney&hyphen;General's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Portfolio Budget Statements</EMPHASIS> of 1995&hyphen;96. With that in mind, it seems absolutely ludicrous that the Australian Labor Party should come out against this when they were the ones who were originally looking at it in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of taking a case to the Family Law Court is enormous and well out of the reach of everyday Australians. Costs of $15,000&hyphen;plus are crippling, and place undue pressure on all parties where there is enough tension already. Money is a constant problem throughout separation and divorce. It is a total menace and it seems to cause the greatest amount of problem and heartache.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the introduction of fees and charges for voluntary counselling and mediation services provided by the Family Law Court will be a cheaper and a more effective way to solve most of the issues rather than have them go through the court. But, if we are to introduce fees and charges, I would like to see the level and quality of service improve relative to the costs. The main reason why community based services charge fees as opposed to the current free service provided by the Family Law Court is that they offer a far superior service. If we are going to charge the same as the community based sector, let us ensure that we provide the same quality service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment the Family Court advises people to sort out their problems between themselves and come to an agreement but it fails to support the completion of these forms. To make the process smoother for everyone the Family Court representative must be a trained counsellor and must have adequate legal knowledge. The representative must be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7657"> able to decide on custody and other related matters if both parties cannot come to an agreement. Also, the representative must remain the couple's contact should any further dispute arise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Family Law Act does not recognise the child support system unless it is incorporated in the Family Court decision. The family law and child support systems should be restructured into one department. This would assist both the custodial and the non&hyphen;custodial parent, especially in relation to access. It is unfair for someone who loves their child or children to be refused access, especially when he or she pays to bring up the children. The non-custodial parent must have the right to see his or her children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I am aware that a considerable number of non-custodial parents cannot see their children because the custodial parent will not inform them of where they live and the department will not provide that information to the non-custodial parent. By the same token the act allows a non-custodial parent to have access to their child despite the parent making no effort to maintain the child. This is laughable. A direct link between departments would stop many of the problems that are currently tearing families apart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, at the National Party federal conference, I put forward a motion that was moved, seconded and carried. The motion was to the effect that `recognising the current social and financial circumstances affecting both rural and suburban families, the conference calls on the federal National Party to explore the needs of men and women and their dependants regarding access to the use of support and information services with a view to establishing a men's referral and information centre similar to the women's health centres that currently operate throughout the country'. The government has a minister who reports to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on the status of women. Therefore I ask: why don't we have a man to report to the Prime Minister on the status of men? Who is looking after the status or the interests of men? The answer is no&hyphen;one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Child Support Act is in need of major changes and it is my intention to move a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> private member's bill in the early part of next year aimed at bringing about some of these most necessary changes. Many people in my electorate have made representations to me about this matter as I have been striving for these changes since approximately September 1995. I believe there needs to be a change to the Child Support Act by having the child support deductions calculated from the net income instead of the gross income of an individual's salary or wage, no change to the percentage, no lowering of the cut-off point and a varying of the pension component.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, with the child support system approximately $8,700 is taken out of the wage before the percentage is applied. If you are in the wage range of $0 to $25,000 then the $8,700 would probably be okay. Between $25,000 and $35,000 we could lift that pension amount, the $8,700, to between $12,000 and $15,000 and then apply the percentage. Between $35,000 and $50,000 we could have a different pension amount that might be in the vicinity of $15,000 to $18,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are ideas that have been passed on by other members and people out there who are genuinely concerned about the system. I look forward to seeing what will eventuate in the coming years.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill, the Family Law Amendment Bill 1996, is a most interesting one. The main purpose of the bill is to ensure that people who are using legal services pay an appropriate amount of money for the services which are provided to them. It is very important that people do not take services for granted. Obviously it is very important that we give people what they are entitled to as citizens, but it is also important that we have a proper and appropriate regime of cost recovery, and that is exactly what this bill is designed to achieve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, this government is very determined to ensure that costs are recovered as appropriate from the users of various government services. This bill is part of that general approach. As you know, we in Australia have taken too much <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7658"> for granted in times past. We have been inclined to think that money grew on trees; we have been inclined to think that we could endlessly go on providing ourselves with Rolls Royce services even though we could only afford Holden motor cars. So this very important bill is a crucial part of the government's general philosophical approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose what we really need to focus on is the cost of running the Family Court, which has increased in recent years and now exceeds $100 million a year. These fee increases under the bill must be seen in the context of the deficit crisis which we inherited from the previous government. The public purse can no longer continue to shoulder such an extensive burden, and that is why we have brought this bill in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal to charge a fee equivalent to that charged by the community based counselling services for services provided by the Family Court is justifiable on equity grounds. There are currently fees for these services in the community based sector. There are services provided by such groups as Relationships Australia, Centacare and the like which have traditionally charged fees for very similar services to those offered by the Family Court. It is not equitable that some can get a service for free while others have to pay. Let me say that the services provided by people like Centacare, Relationships Australia and others are very much appreciated. That, I suppose, is why we do not want the Family Court to be driving them out, as it were, and that is why we are putting them all on a level playing field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who cannot afford it will, of course, as is right and proper, be exempt. The current provisions relating to waiver of fees for people in possession of cards entitling them to Commonwealth health benefits, those in receipt of legal aid and those who will otherwise suffer hardship will continue to apply. At the moment some 40 per cent of all fees are waived by the Family Court and there is no reason why that should not continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The demand for counselling mediation is such that it is not possible for all to have access to the Family Court services. In these circumstances, it is inequitable that a service <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is provided for a fee to some, often residents of rural and remote locations, but others, purely on the basis of geography, receive a similar service for free.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been listening to this debate on the Family Law Amendment Bill 1996 very carefully and very closely, and I must say that as always I am absolutely shocked by the hypocrisy of those opposite. I have listened to the contribution made by the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) and, indeed, that made by the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), and it is really amazing to hear them make the statements that they have, particularly in view of the fact that there were proposals to consider charging fees for counselling and mediation services in the Family Court in the portfolio budget papers of the former government for 1995&hyphen;96. The proposal was also considered as part of the review of fees and charges in Commonwealth courts and tribunals commissioned by the former Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These proposals were included as possibilities under the former government, so it is amazing to hear the honourable member for Prospect say that this is a ferocious attack on the justice system of Australia, that the increase in fees will drastically alter the finely balanced legal system in this country, and so on. She and her colleagues would have us forget that they left us with an inheritance of a budget deficit of $10.3 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor speaker after Labor speaker has come into the House and said, in relation to this bill and to so many other bills, that the government must somehow continue to fund services that the economy can no longer afford. It is obvious that members opposite have not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7659"> learned one lesson from the events of 2 March which saw them tossed from office when the Howard government was elected to be the most effective government this country has seen in a very long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of the Family Law Amendment Bill 1996, as stated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS>, is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To allow the Governor&hyphen;General to make regulations imposing fees for voluntary counselling and mediation services provided by the Family Court of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a budget measure, and no doubt the Labor Party is seeking to continue to gut the budget by opposing this particular legislation. Obviously, the Labor Party will try to dredge up a majority in the other place to knock back this very sensible proposal&mdash;a proposal which was considered by the former government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is entirely reasonable in a democracy that we pay for government services. The user&hyphen;pays approach is a very sensible means of cost recovery. The Family Court was set up in 1975 as part of a proposal to do away with the fault provisions of divorce and to bring in no&hyphen;fault divorce. The Family Court has attracted, quite appropriately, its share of criticism during the 21 years since it was established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ideologically, I am opposed to special courts for special purposes. I believe that, wherever possible, the ordinary courts of the land ought to have the carriage of litigation concerning matters relating to the broad sphere of human activities. It would not really be a bad idea if, as a government, we looked at the future of the Family Court with a view to considering whether it would be better if responsibility for family law matters were returned to the state supreme courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not the subject of this particular legislation, but it is interesting to note that, over the period of existence of the Family Court, the cost of running the Family Court has now increased, with annual costs now exceeding $100 million. It is fair enough that those who use the service should pay for the service, bearing in mind that the government has put in place a safety net so that the people who are not able to afford the charges <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provided for in this bill will be exempted from them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is obvious that we cannot quarantine the area of family law and the Family Court from the need to rein in the $10.3 billion deficit left to us by our predecessors. The public purse simply cannot be expected to put these charges on the bankcard. At present, many people undertaking counselling services already go to private counselling services and pay for those services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some residents in rural and remote parts of Australia do not have access to the counselling services of the Family Court. They have, therefore, found it necessary to resort to private or local counselling services, and they have had to pay fees for those services. However, people in many urban centres have been able to access the Family Court counselling services because they live in areas of high population density.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that it is entirely inappropriate that rural and regional Australians should be disadvantaged because of their remoteness. The services provided by Relationships Australia, Centacare and others have been very similar to those provided by the Family Court, but in many cases they have actually been a better service. They have charged fees. Charges will now be able to be imposed by the Family Court for some counselling services and I believe that is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If people have the choice of going to Family Court counselling services or going to private counselling services, this might encourage more to go to private counselling services. In my experience as a legal practitioner, the quality of counselling given by private counselling services has been infinitely superior to the bureaucratic, cumbersome, unsympathetic way in which clients have been treated by the Family Court of Australia. I have acted for people whose marriages ought to be saved and who needed counselling to prevent a divorce. I have seen them go off to the Family Court, and the attitude of the Family Court seems to be, `Well, you may as well get divorced. There's no future in this relationship.' But I have seen that many of the private counselling services have indeed been able to help people save marriages; and, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7660"> by saving marriages, have helped maintain the social infrastructure of our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Banks said that this bill is a denial of access to justice. Even the honourable member for Banks could not believe that. He has said that families will suffer from this bill. He has said that this government, time will show, is mean spirited and nasty. He has also said that this bill is against all values that we espouse, that is, against our values supporting Australian families. Opposition members have entirely missed the point. They have chosen to avoid the reality of the situation, because our bill provides that those who cannot afford to pay will be exempt. The current provisions relating to waiver of fees for people on income support, in receipt of legal aid and those who will otherwise suffer hardship will continue to apply. At the present time some 40 per cent of all fees are waived by the Family Court, and so it is not unreasonable to expect that there will be a similar percentage of people who will be relieved of fees imposed by Family Court counselling services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The demand for counselling and mediation is such that it is not possible for everyone to have access to these Family Court services. I have pointed out that many people, for geographic reasons, do not have access and it is simply inequitable that a free service should be applicable to some and yet not to others because of where they live. It should also be noted that the power to levy fees only relates to those services used on a voluntary basis. If the Family Court orders or directs that counselling take place, no fee will be payable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite have expelled a great deal of hot air during the debate on this bill. They have ignored the fact that it is their own ineptitude over 13 years of government which has made this belt&hyphen;tightening exercise necessary. They have forgotten that the former Deputy Prime Minister, now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), told us that the budget was in surplus prior to the election, when in reality there was a $10.3 billion deficit. We did not inherit the problem that this country has in relation to debt and the economy, but we do accept the responsibility to fix it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet it is interesting that, despite the fact that we seek to fix the problem, at every opportunity the opposition seeks to prevent our doing so. No doubt in the other place they will endeavour to gather together a majority to blow yet another hole in the budget. We believe that this is not an appropriate way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government supports very strongly the principle that there should be greater reliance on prevention of disputes arising and on alternative dispute resolution rather than on court actions, and we are providing more money for marriage education to try and give people the necessary skills to deal better with conflicts in marriages. In addition, we are maintaining the expansion of the community mediation programs to assist people to resolve disputes at the local level without the need for the courts. I think that that is very important to note as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing that really came across to me as I listened to this debate was the monumental hypocrisy of Labor members. They come forward and they mouth platitudes. They come forward and they criticise us. They come forward and suggest that they have the answers, forgetting that they were in government for most of the last 13 years. They do not admit that, in government, they were proposing to consider charging fees for counselling and mediation services in the Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Minister for Justice, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), is now sitting at the table. He would have to admit that in the portfolio budget papers of his government for 1995&hyphen;96 the proposal incorporated in the Family Law Amendment Bill 1996 was indeed being considered by that government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you listen to them, you would think that they were holier than thou. You would think that they were purer than the driven snow. You would think that they would not entertain charging for counselling services. Yet the fine print of their own portfolio budget papers for the last financial year makes it clear that they were considering a bill very similar to the Family Law Amendment Bill 1996.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7661">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, had the people of Australia not comprehensively rejected the Labor Party on 2 March, it is not unrealistic to assume that we could well have been debating in the parliament today a family law amendment bill 1996 in identical terms to the bill currently before the chamber. The difference, though, would have been that the shadow minister at the table would have been the minister who had given the second reading speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Australians want honesty in politics. We all know how the former Prime Minister was prepared to lie and rob and cheat his way to win the election in 1993. We all know how he was prepared to do anything and say anything to crawl back into office. We find that those same characteristics seem to have survived the election. We find that members like the honourable member for Prospect and the honourable member for Banks are, in fact, coming forward and criticising us for bringing in a bill which their own party would have brought into this place had they been returned on 2 March.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has brought in the Family Law Amendment Bill. We are seeking to impose these charges on the people who can afford them. The honourable member for Banks, the honourable member for Prospect and others have come into the parliament and pilloried us for supporting this legislation when, had they been re&hyphen;elected as the government on 2 March, the shadow minister at the table could well have been sponsoring a similar piece of legislation. We would have been debating a very similar bill, but the shadow minister would have been sitting where the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Andrew Thomson) is now, and he would have been a strong proponent of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7662"> The opposition is being hypocritical. The opposition is playing politics. The opposition is ignoring the fact that this country had a $10.3 billion deficit which this government has to fix. The opposition is irrelevant, and the people of Australia will reject its hypocrisy and will recognise that these people are making statements purely for political pur poses. Clearly they are not interested in the good government of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of running the Family Court has ballooned to an amount in excess of $100 million a year. If we are to be a government running the economy of this country responsibly, then we must rein in costs. Clearly, those who use the services of the Family Court must make some contribution towards the cost of meeting that $100 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It ought to be remembered that there is a safety net and that those who cannot afford those expenses will be exempt. That is a very important safeguard for those disadvantaged Australians who need the benefits of the Family Court services but who cannot afford to pay for them. It ought to be recognised that in many parts of Australia, including in some parts of your own electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker, constituents are simply not able, for geographic reasons, to access the currently free counselling and mediation services of the Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of your constituents and many of my constituents currently have to pay for counselling and mediation services like those provided by excellent bodies such as Relationships Australia and Centacare. People in rural and regional Australia ought not to be disadvantaged. If they are unable to access the free Family Court counselling services, why should people in the urban metropolis be able to do so?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is about good economic management. It is about some cost recovery so that those who use a service pay for it. It is about geographic equity. It is about rejecting the hypocrisy of the honourable member for Banks, the honourable member for Prospect and every speaker who has spoken on this bill on that side of the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw your attention to the government's <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proposal to introduce fees for people who voluntarily seek counselling for the resolution of family law disputes. My concerns with this proposal are many. The proposal appears to be in direct conflict with the government's much flaunted commitment to families and to alternative dispute resolution in family law disputes. The consequences of such a proposal upon the people of my electorate, when combined with the government's cuts to legal aid, the imposition of court fees for ancillary relief, and the increase in hearings fees, are likely to be severe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I fear the impact that this proposal will have on vulnerable groups in Australian society such as women and the children who so often are caught in the middle of family law disputes. In 1995, children were involved in 59 per cent of cases, so we are perhaps talking about 100,000 children who are affected each year. I am concerned about the impact these changes will have upon the lower to middle income earning families of our society who do not qualify for legal aid but for whom the expense of the government's proposal may cause additional pain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned that, instead of keeping family law matters out of the courts and saving money&mdash;as the proposal intends as far as I can see&mdash;the likely result may be that more cases will actually end up in the courts. This could cost the parties and the Australian taxpayers more money and increase the already substantial delays facing parties in the Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned at the government's proposal to outsource the counselling function of the Family Court. This move risks a drop in the expert standard of service that the Family Court provides for its clients. Furthermore, I am alarmed by the prospect of private organisations having to deal with the violent cases which are very much part of family law and which the Family Court is well set up to deal with. I am also concerned about the government's plan to regulate these private counselling bodies through an Attorney&hyphen;General's agency which sounds something like the Child Support Agency.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7663">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this proposal the government hopes to save a mere $2.7 million over the next year and a half. To me, such an amount represents a drop in the ocean when compared to some of the other cost&hyphen;cutting measures the government is undertaking. After extensive discussions with legal practitioners in my electorate, with representatives from the Family Court, the law society, the Law Council of Australia and with legal aid representatives, I am convinced that the impact that this proposal will have on the poor and middle income families in my electorate and Australia generally, on women, on children and ultimately on society as a whole, far outweighs the government's need to save another couple of million dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My words today may well be drowned out by the cacophony of the preoccupation of this House with amendments dealing with proposals involving much more money, but not many of them will impact on as many people's lives as this one. This bill is not just about money, it is about lives and about how  best to help people to get on with their lives after marital breakdowns. Since 1975, 890,000 couples in Australia have been divorced. In 1995, 63,000 couples were divorced, and the numbers are increasing every year. Of these 63,000 couples, some 32,000 couples voluntarily sought the assistance of the counselling arm of the Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These types of figures suggest that increasingly the Family Court is playing a part in the lives of hundreds of thousands of Australians. It is patently clear to me that the field of family law cannot be considered simply in monetary terms. Indeed, the workings of the Family Court cannot be considered in the same light as other courts. The Family Court has a special role in society, dealing as it does with the most delicate relationships&mdash;those between family members. The effectiveness of the Family Court's operation should not, within reason, be judged in monetary terms, as the government is doing, but in terms of outcomes. In 1995, 95 per cent of the disputes with which the Family Court dealt were settled outside the courtroom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From all accounts, the Family Court makes an important contribution to our society. I do <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not argue that its operations are flawless. I do, however, assert that this proposal cannot be justified on the basis of saving a paltry $800,000 this financial year and $1.9 million in the 1996&hyphen;97 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inserted section 125(ca) will allow fees to be payable in respect of the use of the counselling or mediation facilities of the Family Court in situations other than where a court orders a person to attend the counselling or mediation. I welcome section 125(1)(d), exempting certain categories of people from having to pay fees for voluntary counselling: people who hold a health care entitlement, those on legal aid, prisoners, those in receipt of Austudy or Abstudy and those whom the Family Court registrar finds would suffer financial hardship if they had to pay the fee. But this safety net just does not go far enough. There are thousands outside these criteria who will be severely penalised, especially with cuts to legal aid and tighter qualification criteria. For those paying the fee, it will be payable in cash and its administration will be the responsibility of the Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a further move which will deter parties from taking their matters to court, the government has also introduced application fees of $250 for ancillary relief applications and $400 for setting down a matter for a full hearing. Thus, whatever avenue the parties choose to take, they will be forced to pay. The government's ultimate plan appears to be the removal of the counselling function from the Family Court altogether. The counselling and mediation role will be gradually outsourced to private counselling services, which would be managed by an agency, as I have suggested, like the Child Support Agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this amendment the government aims to open the door for counselling fees to be charged at an initial rate of $40 an hour from 1 January next year for all parties who voluntarily seek counselling. Through this measure the government aims to save $800,000 this financial year and $1.9 million in the next. However a partner unable to resolve satisfactorily a spousal maintenance case because of the cost of accessing the Family Court or its revised counselling arrangements may well <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7664"> become a greater cost on the taxpayer than the savings achieved in denying him or her such access. They will then most likely be on the queue for public housing, more Medicare funded medical services and so on. It will be a far greater cost than the mediated settlement they sought to avoid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me now move on to the government's commitment to families, alternative dispute resolution and children. It is no secret the government prides itself on its commitment to families. For example, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) recently claimed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The family is the core social unit in our society. For generations the family has endured as the primary and most effective provider of assistance and support for people of all ages and from all backgrounds. The coalition is absolutely committed to ensuring that the needs of families remain at the centre of public policy. One of our highest priorities as a government is to relieve the financial pressure on low and middle income families bringing up children.</PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, in his recent address to the 7th Annual Family Conference the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) claimed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The welfare of Australian families is a key area of concern to the federal government . . . as the family is the primary social unit which binds and underpins our society.</PARA>
<PARA>No&hyphen;one has any argument with that. He went on to say that with the proposed amendments and others the Family Court's `emphasis is now squarely on fulfilling the rights of the children involved and on the responsibilities of both parents towards those children'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to its purported attitude towards alternative dispute resolution in the Family Court the government claimed in its election campaign that if elected it would, among others things `support and implement moves to increase counselling, conciliation and mediation options in the resolution of disputes'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The obvious question raised by the proposed amendment when viewed in light of these comments is: how well do these amendments sit with the government's stated commitments to families, to alternative dispute resolution in the Family Court, and to the interests of children?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To answer this question I have considered the impact upon the community which I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> represent of the combination of the proposed amendments, the legal aid cuts and the increases in Family Court fees. In 1995 in Orange and Bathurst alone the Family Court counselled 200 couples who sought help from the service voluntarily. These figures provide an indication of the number of families who will be affected by the proposed changes. The figure is significant given that the combined population of Orange and Bathurst is only about 65,000. People in my electorate seeking counselling must travel to the Family Court in Parramatta or Dubbo unless the court decides to visit the country centres because of demand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After talking to regional solicitors it appears that it is common practice for solicitors to advise their clients to seek counselling as a first step because resolutions reached by mutual agreement are seen by all parties involved as preferable to a decision imposed by a court. At the moment the parties involved in voluntary counselling in my electorate must already pay for their travel, accommodation and child-care expenses if they are to attend counselling in Parramatta or Dubbo. With the proposed changes they will, on top of these expenses, be asked to fork out $40 an hour for however many hours of counselling they undertake and with no guarantee that a resolution will be reached. Furthermore, I cannot see these people being in the best mood to negotiate because of this additional cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With scenarios like these it is easy to see why regional solicitors fear that this proposal will actually force many of their clients to go to court as a first step because of the greater certainty of an outcome and the prospect that counselling might be ordered free of charge. It is unquestionable that the legal fraternity is very concerned about the possibility of fees being introduced for voluntary counselling both at the local and national levels. This is significant because if anything, with these changes, they stand to get more work. The proposed changes, combined with the cut to funding in legal aid, appear to contradict the government's stated commitment to families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the proposed fee is introduced, the government would save only $800,000 this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7665"> financial year. This figure represents only one small drop in the fiscal ocean. What this House must decide is whether it is worth saving this relatively small amount of money, when the impact of this proposal, combined with existing cuts to legal aid, could be catastrophic for lower middle income Australian families, the children caught up in these disputes and, ultimately, Australian society as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From all accounts, the counselling arm of the Family Court, as it stands, is the most fruitful and least financially and psychologically damaging avenue to follow if parties to a marital dispute want to avoid litigation. I agree with Michael Tausigg, the Chairman of the Law Council of Australia's family law section, who claims:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Family Court cannot be considered in the same light as other courts. There can be no user&hyphen;pays principle because the Family Court has a special role in society.</PARA>
<PARA>And I agree with another legal practitioner, with whom I spoke, who said, `The proposed changes are like reforming the medical industry so that patients are asked to hop up on the surgery table and perform their own frontal lobotomies.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Family Court is the court with which most Australians have contact. Family law is a unique area of the law, dealing as it does with very delicate relationships which the government itself has recognised as being fundamental to the fabric of Australian society. If any court is to set an example of how the law is trying to keep pace with the changes in our society it must be the Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1975, as I said, there have been 890,000 divorces in Australia. Last year there were 63,000. These figures speak for themselves. What the government has to recognise is that dysfunctional families, while not fitting the government's ideal of the intact family, are nevertheless families. Indeed, they are families in the most dire need of the government's support rather than having the government heap extra financial burdens on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The Family Court counselling service currently provides a service which is con sidered expert and effective by legal practitioners. The consensus among those practitioners appears to be that the counselling roles of the court cannot be separated from its litigious ones, because they are part and parcel of an innovative legal package aimed at settling highly sensitive matters out of court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Removing the counselling arm of the Family Court by outsourcing to private firms risks a drop in standards, problems with security, and an increase in litigation which will in turn increase the cost of the dispute resolution process to the government and ultimately to the taxpayers. But the social cost to society is what I am really concerned about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One quote from a legal practitioner in my electorate sums up the feeling of practitioners very well. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any move by the government that deters or impedes people in any way from seeking counselling is a negative step and should be avoided at all costs. In the scheme of things, $1.9 million is peanuts. Is it really worth all of the heartache it could potentially cause families and especially women and children?</PARA>
<PARA>In my mind the proposal we are debating here today is best described as regressive. It represents a backward step which flies in the face of the outstanding work the Family Court performs in resolving disputes out of court. It is short&hyphen;sighted and simplistic. It is indirectly draconian in that it forces participants' hands by making them either pay for counselling or pay at least $250 to go to court and get an order that counselling should be provided free. In this sense, it represents a catch&hyphen;22 situation. No matter which way the parties choose to go, they will be forced to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, however, seems to be basing its proposal on the risky gamble that people will choose to attend counselling rather than go to court to resolve their disputes. My sources, people who work in the system, tell me that it is unlikely to be the case. On the contrary, it is more likely that the more cash&hyphen;strapped people in the community will choose to go to court immediately rather than risk having to fork out for counselling, knowing that if it fails they will still have to go to court anyway.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7666">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, couples may not even attempt to resolve their dispute legally because of the cost of delays. If this is the case, one can wonder where the children caught up in these disputes will be left. This is especially the case for country areas like the one I represent, where to attend a Family Court for counselling or for a hearing is also highly likely to involve many hours travel and associated costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government were serious about its commitment to families, if it were serious about keeping family law disputes out of courts, if it were serious about protecting the interests of women and children in these matters, if it were serious about minimising the damage caused to Australian society by family law disputes, and if it cared about people more than it cared about money in this case, then it would not be proposing such an amendment.</PARA>

The answer to the Leader of the Opposition is yes, I did receive such a letter. The answer to the rest of the question is that many of the assumptions made by the Leader of the Opposition in relation to this matter are completely erroneous. So, far from the Natural Heritage Trust being appropriately described in the words used by the Leader of the Opposition, let me take advantage of the opportunity the leader presents me with by saying that the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia is the greatest capital investment in Australia's environmental future ever. That is what it is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, the Leader of the Opposition demonstrates not only an indifference to the interests of Western Australia. It is a long pattern.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable members will be aware, one of the major commitments made by the government parties in the election campaign was to assist small business. I am delighted, in answering this question, to start by recording some of the reaction yesterday to the announcement made by the Treasurer that the capital gains tax rollover relief provision announced in the budget would be further liberalised. If I can paraphrase the words of Mr Robert Bastion from the Council of Small Business Organisations. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is absolutely fabulous, an excellent gesture to small business. It gives a psychological lift which far exceeds the $50 million input by the government.</PARA>
<PARA>But it gets even better. Let me quote the words of Mr Kurt Rendall of the Institute of Chartered Accountants. Listen to these words very carefully. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision highlighted the difference between the coalition government and its predecessor. These guys have a really good understanding of small  business.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>That highlights the difference. It is not surprising that people such as Mr Bastion and Mr Rendall should express those views because not only was the announcement made by the Treasurer a marvellous demonstration of the sensitivity of the coalition government to the interests of small business, but it follows a series of decisions taken by this government since the election to help small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We honoured our commitment to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor, which has eased the cash flow problems of small business by about $180 million a year. We met our commitment to get rid of the unfair dismissal laws. Now that the workplace relations bill has gone through the Senate, from 1 January the stupid, job&hyphen;destroying unfair dismissal law of Laurie Brereton will be a relic of industrial relations history. Of all the damage that you crowd opposite in your 13 years in government did to small business, none was worse than the burden you placed on small business by that ridiculous law. Even the only Labor Premier in Australia, Bob Carr, said that it was a bad law and it was destroying the jobs of young Australians. Your former leader, the former Prime Minister, right on the death bed <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7668"> of the election, said that if the thing was causing a problem, even he would have a look at it. It was a miserable pay-off to Jennie George for the help you got from the unions in the 1993 election. You know that and you deserve all the calumny that has descended upon you as a result of that particular measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the decisions taken by the coalition go much further than that. There are the great benefits to small business that will flow from the other provisions of the workplace relations bill. Then there was the Small Business Deregulation Task Force, chaired by Mr Charlie Bell, which has made a very large number of recommendations. I promised, on behalf of the government, that we would give a consolidated response to those recommendations by the middle of February. They are designed to assist our goal of reducing by 50 per cent the red tape burden on small business during our first three years in government. On top of that, we have maintained a very strong anti-inflationary economic policy. Under our administration interest rates have fallen on several occasions, and that has been of great benefit to small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, I can report, as this parliamentary year draws to an end, that of the many commitments that were made by the coalition in the lead-up to the last election, none was more important than our commitment to small business and none has been more comprehensively honoured by this government over the last nine months than the promises we made to the small businesses of Australia.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought I had seen and heard it all until this morning. Yesterday all of Australia was looking at a high dollar and the implications it might have in relation to interest rates. Even the Leader of the Opposition was talking about the effect that a strong dollar should have in relation to easing monetary policy. We had this genius from Holt who walked into Parliament House this morning and said he thought there should be an interest rate cut because the dollar was falling. That is what he said this morning.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Richmond for a sensible question on the economy and the national accounts. The September quarter national accounts showed a 0.8 per cent growth for the quarter and a 3.8 per cent growth for the year to the September quarter of 1996. The solid growth in the Australian economy was led by investment, with a contribution from manufacturing and a contribution from exports. I have already reported to the House that the capital expenditure survey indicated that, between the same time last year and this year, investment expectations for 1996-97 had risen 19 per cent. For the quarter we saw solid growth in investment of around eight per cent in both equipment and construction and 10.5 per cent growth in relation to construction. This confirms businesses' confidence in the underlying strength of the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was also particularly pleasing to see growth of 2.4 per cent in the manufacturing sector over that quarter. I have already noted in relation to a number of factors that the sector of the Australian economy which is particularly sensitive to imports and import competition would have found difficulties, but <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to see, in relation to manufacturing, solid growth in that area is also welcomed by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also saw a contribution coming out of exports in relation to the national accounts figures&mdash;a net contribution of 1.2 per cent over the quarter. This is growth in the areas where you would want to see solid growth&mdash;in relation to investment and in relation to exports. That is where you would want to see growth in the Australian economy, because it is investment that will lead to growth, investment that will contribute to exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only other feature that should be mentioned in relation to the national accounts which were released today is that the national accounts clearly highlight Australia's status as a low inflation country.</PARA>

The only thing in that report on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>  that is not speculative is that I instructed the department to produce a strategic review. I did that within the early weeks of coming to government. It would be very surprising if I had not done so, for obvious reasons. One of the further reasons is, of course, that the defence white paper in 1994 did not come to grips with the impact of the end of the Cold War on our security and how Australia should respond to those changes. Like past strategic reviews, this review is classified. The government will not discuss the contents of the review but I can say that the review, like those before it, is about Australia's defence and security interests in the broad. It would be absurd, obviously, for it to focus on anything else. We will consider what form of public statement we will make, if any, in due course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the story on the front page, which is written by Mr McPhedran, he links three quite unconnected elements and says that the focus of the strategic review is on force projection into north Asia, which is an absurd proposition as a basis for our defence policy.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members would be aware that the United Kingdom does not index its pensions to former residents who live in Australia, and it does the same in relation to most other Commonwealth countries. This contrasts with the United Kingdom's approach to places like the United States of America, European Union countries and the Philippines. The outcome, of course, is that people who have contributed to their pensions in the United Kingdom and worked all their lives there do not receive any increase in their pension if they come to Australia under family reunion provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under all the agreements that we have with other countries, they do index pensions for their expatriates, as we do for Australians who live overseas. British pensioners are clearly disadvantaged if they come to Australia, with the average UK pension paid to Australia now being less then $40 a week. This is a policy that the United Kingdom government knows has significant implications for Australia and the Australian taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has a firm commitment to look after our elderly residents. This is demonstrated by our topping up of pensions of former UK residents, and I want to make it quite clear to the House that this is a policy that will continue. The fact of non&hyphen;indexation of British pensions, however, does cost Australian taxpayers $80 million a year and we have to contribute very significantly to the cost of their health care and other expenses.</PARA>

It was that we would secure indexation for prospective migrants from the UK&mdash;that is what we were seeking from them&mdash;and at the same time we would guarantee to continue to top up pensions for existing residents in Australia who had come from the United Kingdom. That was the clear and unambiguous proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, as we have seen from the opposition and the Leader of the Opposition by the interjection that he just made, they are not happy enough with that approach. They want to be able to try to project into the minds of people who have migrated from the United Kingdom a fear that, in some way, their pensions might be taken away from them or, at least, that any increase might be taken away from them. The Leader of the Opposition, in something that I see is called `Kim Beazley's pensioner update'&mdash;this is a document dated December 1996&mdash;says:</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just offered to. I would be quite happy to do that. Just to make a couple of other points, your question really goes to the heart of whether or not we are concerned about looking after food safety and hygiene for Australia. Well, of course we are. We maintain a very conservative quarantine arrangement in this country and we will not be diluting it in any way, shape or form, to wit, we have found a substantial amount of extra money to reinforce the northern area quarantine strategy in this country, we are about to release the Nairn review into quarantine in this country and this government will do nothing to lower Australia's quarantine standards. It is very important to make that point. We will not be backing away.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should make the point that of course the people with the greatest interest in this are Australia's farmers. They, like us, supported your push in government for a set of stable and predictable trade access rules and they did so for very good reasons. They know, for example, that under these rules we can access a lot of markets that we have not accessed before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not hear the upside of what has been put in place: 70&hyphen;odd new Australian products into 38 new markets last year, mainly in Asia. That is part of the upside, worth a great deal of money, and probably that is why Australia's farm leaders in the last couple of weeks have been saying some strong things about how, for example, Australia exports five times as much as it imports and so stands to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> benefit by supporting science based quarantine and inspection principles. That is from the New South Wales Farmers Association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Don McGauchie from the NFF says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot refuse to import products simply because of the financial effect it may have on Australian industries, but it is essential to have a high quality inspection service and assessment based on manageable risk to ensure that products which do enter Australia do not place our industries in jeopardy.</PARA>
<PARA>In this instance, as my predecessor on the other side duly noted, the science had been checked off by such august bodies as the Bureau of Resource Sciences, the Australian Animal Health Laboratory and a whole range of other people, including the state veterinary offices and the Commonwealth veterinary office. Under those circumstances, the Australian people can rest assured that the country's most capable scientific groupings have confirmed that the health security of the Australian consumer has been safeguarded in this case.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. I am aware of the strong interest that she and the member for Eden&hyphen;Monaro have in the south&hyphen;east fishery and in its management problems. Since 1992, the south&hyphen;east fishery has been managed by a system of output controls called individual transferable quotas. The fact is that the previous government totally and absolutely mishandled the transition to quotas and did nothing to fix its mistakes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite true. The result was endless wrangling, litigation, uncertainty and, I would have to say, a fair <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7679"> degree of gross injustice. During the election campaign, I gave a commitment that the coalition would seek to resolve the endless wrangling in the south&hyphen;east fishery by mediation, not by litigation. To meet this commitment, my colleague Senator Parer appointed a small working group headed by Mr David Trebeck to recommend adjustment options.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report that working group has prepared is nothing short of an utter indictment of the previous government and of the way they handled this issue. It makes it clear that they hopelessly mishandled the introduction of the quota system and that the formula they used meant some operators suffered a massive reduction in the value of their fishing entitlements. They deceived people about the amount of quota they would be allocated&mdash;some people got less than half of what they had been told that they could expect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It just happens, of course, that the honourable member for Hotham, Mr Crean, was the then minister who handled the introduction of that quota system. In 1991 the industry urged him to delay introducing that system in view of the extreme haste and the uncertainty that had been involved. The chairman&hyphen;designate of AFMA also urged the member for Hotham to slow down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But he would not listen. He went ahead with the quota allocation anyway, with absolutely disastrous results. The new management plan started collapsing from the day he put it in place. Seven weeks after the new plan took effect, the member for Hotham had to write to the AFMA chairman asking him to review the plan. Seven weeks after he had put it in place! And since 1992 there have been at least eight internal or public reviews into various aspects of the fishery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Rankin, Mr Beddall, was the minister responsible for fisheries from the beginning of 1994 until the fall of Labor. In 1993 and 1994 a Senate committee, the Chairman of AFMA and the South&hyphen;East Trawl Management Advisory Committee, SETMAC, all advised the government to establish some sort of adjustment program for the fisheries. The member for Rankin's only response was to say that he was examining the issue. That went on for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> two years, and he was still examining the issue when Labor was thrown out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The working group has recommended: firstly, that AFMA dequota three of the 16 quota species in the south&hyphen;east fishery&mdash;ocean perch, silver trevally and John Dory, which as a bycatch species could not have been included in the ITQ scheme originally; secondly, that financial assistance be provided to the fishing operators whose entitlements were reduced in value as a result of the transition from boat units to quotas; and, thirdly, that a buy&hyphen;out scheme be introduced involving the purchase of up to 50 permits. This would reduce the fishing effort in the area by about 30 per cent and would increase the sustainability and the efficiency of the fishery. I think that is a very good outcome indeed. We are cleaning up an appalling mess left behind by the previous minister and the previous administration. The SEF working group has produced an important and thought provoking report. It has consulted extensively with affected fishing operators. The government will make a decision on its recommendations in the new year after it has received the comments from AFMA and the industry.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

As the member suggested in her question, yes, I am aware that Sunday was World AIDS Day&mdash;and I understand that this is World AIDS Week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia, as a recognised leader in the HIV-AIDS prevention and care area, is right now helping developing countries faced with the devastating consequences of HIV and AIDS. Worldwide, some 22&half; million people are infected, 90 per cent of them in developing countries. Nearly 50 per cent of new infections are occurring in women, and 400,000 of the newly infected are children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the absolute numbers of people infected are highest in sub-Saharan Africa, the most alarming trends are in the spread of the disease in South and South-East Asia. I am keen to see Australia involved in a coordinated regional response to help stop the spread of this disease. I have suggested a regional HIV-AIDS ministerial meeting be held next year to discuss strategies to tackle this pandemic. As a key focus of Australia's health aid programs, assistance to HIV-AIDS activities has climbed to over $14 million a year. Spending on HIV-AIDS activities has been maintained in our aid budget in a very difficult budgetary environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I am sure the honourable member would be interested in two or three examples of where we have been spending that money. In Papua New Guinea, Australians are working with the PNG Department of Health to develop and implement a national action plan on HIV-AIDS. In the Pacific, AusAID is the major financial contributor to the South Pacific Commission's program. In relation to Thai land, the Albion Street Centre in Sydney is helping a Bangkok hospital improve the care of people living with AIDS. In Africa we are supporting a wide range of activities, including a Salvation Army project in Tanzania which provides condoms and AIDS education to street girls and also helps them to find alternative employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is well placed to continue to assist developing countries deal with the pandemic, especially with the considerable expertise we have in this country&mdash;in community organisations, in affected communities, amongst health professionals, in academic organisations and of course in government departments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I know that he has been very concerned about the impact of the subsidies by the Europeans and the Americans on international grain prices and has raised the matter very often in this place. It is of concern. It costs Australian wheat producers and grain producers in general a lot of money, and it costs the national economy a lot of money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had the opportunity in Rome to meet with the US Secretary for Agriculture, Dan Glickman, who made it plain to me that he is very keen to avoid the re-emergence or the opening up again of the use of the export enhancement program for wheat sales from the US, that he feels that at this stage there is no pressure on him to do so and that he is very hopeful that the Europeans are of a like mind. We have seen in recent times the use of some subsidies by the Europeans. It is ironic that only a few months ago they were taxing exports because they did not want exports and now they are back into subsidising them again. But there does seem to be a willingness to acknowledge that it is in nobody's interest to open the whole thing up again and to initiate another trade war.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested to note that Minister Borchert from Germany acknowledges, as does Commissioner Franz Fischler, that there is a need for reform of the CAP and that both of them feel that over time real reform can be effective and that they will move down the road, as I understand the case to be, of decoupling. I made the point&mdash;in response to their concerns that agriculture in Europe is about more than farm production, it is a multivalue thing; they are concerned about preserving the environment and keeping people in rural areas, for example&mdash;that it is their business whether they support them but, in so doing, they ought to seek to do so in ways that do not impact on our values, viability, environmental aspects and the rural population aspects and concerns that we have about farmers and rural communities in this country. That point seemed to be well made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have not made as much progress yet as we would like to make, but it is trending in the right direction. I note with great relief that wheat prices have picked up somewhat in the last week and the slide of recent times seems to be turning around.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In making this personal explanation, it is firstly necessary for me to advise the House that Mr Bob Dent was the first person to be euthanased under the Northern Territory's legislation. Mr Rod Dent is his son. Dr Philip Nitschke is the chief medical protagonist in the Northern Territory who is pushing for euthanasia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the front page of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> is a story which relates to some views expressed by Mr Rod Dent as to his position on euthanasia. Included in that story is the following quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Dent told Dr Nitschke in a conversation taped with his consent by Herald journalist, Ms Gay Alcorn, that he had talks with Mr Andrews, Finance Minister, Mr Fahey, and Liberal back <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7684"> bencher, Dr Brendan Nelson&mdash;all anti-euthanasia&mdash;and was ordered to attend the press conference.</PARA>
<PARA>The facts are that, up until March this year, I had met Mr Rod Dent on three occasions. On one of those three occasions, he addressed a Liberal Party branch in my own electorate. I had not seen nor heard from Mr Dent until he attracted publicity following the tragic death of his father in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 23 November, he approached me at the New South Wales Liberal Party state council meeting and asked me whether I would facilitate his speaking to the Senate committee when it considered the Andrews bill should it pass through the House of Representatives. I agreed to do this, having expressed sympathies to him about the death of his father, and chose not to raise the issue of euthanasia, knowing his view was quite opposite to my own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He then went on to tell me that he intended to tell the Senate committee that he would be opposing the Northern Territory's legislation and supporting the Andrews bill. He said this on the basis that his father had had no choice but to have euthanasia because of the inadequacies, as he saw it, of palliative care services in the Northern Territory.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The whole parliament and, through the media, the whole country are starting to see how flawed and wrong the government's proposed changes to nursing home funding are. It is an inhumane policy. That is the policy we are being offered from this government. It is a policy that is now being questioned by every conceivable interest and representative group involved in aged care in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) continues to show that she absolutely does not understand the difference between a nursing home and a hostel, and that is a very substantial point. It is the difference between these two things that needs to be understood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People choose to go and live in hostels. They live in them. Many of them do so quite independently for many years. People have time to plan to go to a hostel. There are many other choices. They could have more help in their own home, for example. Of course, going to a nursing home is quite different. There is no choice. It is not a market. It is a place where elderly people go when they cannot look after themselves any more, and neither can their family. More than 60 per cent of these people are admitted to nursing homes direct from hospitals. They cannot negotiate in a market. That is a callous joke this government is making at the expense of elderly people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister says she can offer an ironclad guarantee that no-one in this so-called market will be forced to sell their family home to get into a nursing home. There is no evidence at all in any of the material that we have received from her department&mdash;off the back of a truck, of course&mdash;that she can deliver on this guarantee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a government report from her department which shows that 63 per cent of residents of nursing homes have a saleable asset&mdash;the family home. The department has made its estimates about how much it will <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> raise for nursing homes on the basis that all of these people will sell their family home. If they do not sell the family home, there will be no money for nursing homes. We know for sure the government will not provide it. This government has taken $500 million out of nursing homes in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the minister cannot have it both ways. Either the nursing homes get the $130 million because people sell their family homes or there is nothing at all for nursing homes. There is no other pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same departmental paper makes it clear that they expect three-quarters of new residents to nursing homes in the next year&mdash;in the year that this starts operating&mdash;to pay an entry contribution. They estimate that, on average, that will be $26,000. The depart2ment's estimates are based on people selling their homes. Most of them do not have any other assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second document that we have comes from the funding and implementation issues working group, set up by the minister to advise on the implementation of this dreadful policy. It is in this document that we see the dreadful horror of this government's intentions slowly unravel. The working party say that they want access to nursing homes to be on the basis of care needs, but they say in their document to the minister that no specific regulation is going to be needed to make sure that this happens. They do not think there is any need to regulate this issue, which would have to be the most important issue facing older people going into nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is naive in the extreme. This government wants fees to be set by market forces. The minister must be the only person in the country who does not know that those who have more money will get in before those who have less money. I am sure she knows how market forces work. Real estate, after all, works that way. The highest bidder buys the house. This government is not proposing any regulation that would prevent a nursing home taking the elderly person with the most money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a nursing home proprietor in Adelaide said to me recently, they will have no choice. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7691"> They will have to get the entry contributions to survive. Take the following example which this nursing home in Adelaide put to me. If a person comes along with $80,000 to pay to get in&mdash;and the minister says it is quite possible that this will be the fee charged&mdash;and somebody else comes along with $10,000 and has the same care needs, and they both have to get into that nursing home, who is the minister kidding about who will get in first? Of course it will be the person with more money. The minister is the only person in Australia who does not think this is what is going to happen. All the elderly people in Australia know this. All the nursing home owners know that this is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is very bad policy. It is the first time that we will be seeing people getting access to nursing home care on the basis of how much they have to pay. It is un-Australian. Many nursing homes are run by people who see their mission as caring for the frail and sick. They do not want to take people with money ahead of those who need care but have no money. However, they are saying to me that they know they will have to do that because otherwise they will not be able to maintain their nursing home. They are questioning their whole mission in caring for the frail and sick.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue in this working party report is that there will be no controls on the level of entry contributions. At the moment, the average fee calculated by the department is going to be $26,000. But, as the minister and her government know, the great thing about market forces, as this report confirms, is that the sellers will charge whatever the market will bear. As this report makes clear, there will be no regulations on how much they can charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a call in my office yesterday from a concerned nurse in a nursing home. He was concerned because the nursing home where he works has decided that it will charge an entry contribution of $60,000. It has decided this on the basis of the home values in its local area. On the basis of this figure, the nursing home has calculated that it will get an extra income of between $5 million and $6 million. He called this a transfer of care from the needy <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the greedy. This is a process in which the minister is culpable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another idea which we have heard about this week in the parliament is this notion of periodic payments. This new element of choice for elderly Australians, as we have tried to demonstrate in the parliament this week, is a farce. We have had another call from an elderly person saying, `I have a house that I could rent.' The minister's adviser is quoted as saying this morning that the elderly will not have to sell the family home as they could rent it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the figures. If the house is worth $150 per week in rent, as this pensioner's is, let us look at whether they will be able to rent out the house rather than sell it. A pensioner will lose 50c of every dollar earned above the income free zone. Tax then has to be paid on the rent. With the government's new means tested additional nursing home fee, 25c in the dollar will be paid as a result of that nursing home fee. This person can only earn $82 per week. The periodic payment estimated by the industry is $105 per week. Of course, these older people will not be able to rent their homes. They will have to sell their homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third issue, which was also revealed in the parliament yesterday, concerns second entry contributions. The minister has admitted in this place that some people will have to pay twice. She claims:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Very few residents will need to consider the payment of a second entry contribution.</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest to the minister that no-one would like to consider the prospect of paying a second entry contribution. I certainly know it is the case in nursing homes in my electorate that older people are very concerned about having to pay two different entry contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next issue involves carers. This is another very serious matter. It is only someone who has been in the same home and caring for the elderly person for five years who will not have the home sold out from under them. What about the daughter who moves in with the elderly dad to keep him company after her mum has died? He can be well, and she does not have to care for him. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7692"> She is not getting the carer's pension. He could later have a stroke and need to go to a nursing home. Where does the daughter go when the family home is sold from under her to make sure that her dad gets into a decent nursing home? This legislation will have a devastating impact on families. It will cause intergenerational strains and conflicts like nothing we have ever seen before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister says that there will be some prudential arrangements. But let us look at the working party report. There is absolutely no indication in that working party report that the industry has been able to come to any agreement about what these prudential arrangements will be. It is absolutely imperative that we see this whole sorry package at least capped off with decent prudential arrangements. We look forward to seeing those very shortly from the minister, given that the industry cannot come to any agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very awful and unfair plan. It will mean, without question, that we will have a two-tiered nursing home system in this country. Elderly Australians knew nothing about this before the election. They had no idea that they would be paying these entry contributions, that they would have to sell their homes to get into a nursing home, that they would be paying an additional means tested fee once they got into the nursing home, that they would lose their dental program and that they would have to pay more for pharmaceuticals and home and community care. They did not know any of these things. They were not told about them. When one has discussions with older people around the country, one realises that they are quite horrified. They had no idea that this government, which previously had been seen to be sympathetic to the needs of older Australians, could do this. They look to me and say, `How could the government have done such a thing?' That is the question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was in Adelaide recently talking to a group of elderly citizens. One lady was particularly concerned. She was going blind and realised that sooner or later she would have to go to a nursing home. What she was most concerned about, as most elderly people are, was not herself. She was not thinking of herself and what would happen to her in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nursing home. She was thinking of what was going to happen to her husband, who she felt would not have sufficient funds left to live on once they had paid the up-front fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This story has been told to me over and over again. So many people are concerned by the changes that this government has introduced. They are concerned partly because the government is not able to answer any of their questions. They have no idea what the prudential arrangements will be and whether their money will be kept in a safe place. They have no idea how much they will be paying. Will it be $26,000 or, as the minister admitted this week, $80,000? We have no idea what it will be. Is it any surprise that elderly Australians are very concerned about what is going to happen to them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People had no idea that this government was going to introduce such callous changes. It is going to get the message loud and clear from older people around this country that they see these changes as callous. They do not believe, because they are not naive, as the minister seems to be naive, that people with money will not take precedence over those without. Of course that will happen. If we go down the path of market forces&mdash;which is what this government wants to do&mdash;then there will be no choice either for the individual or for the nursing home. It will be the case that those with money get access to nursing homes ahead of those who do not have money. Every older person around Australia knows that. They are afraid of it. They are afraid of what this government is doing to nursing home care. There is not a person in this country who ever chooses to go into a nursing home; they only ever go there when they need to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is very bad policy. As I have said, it is un-Australian. We believe in fair access to health services. We believe in fair access to nursing home care. It is time the government threw this policy out the door and started again.</PARA></SPEECH>

You are callous and your party is callous in the extreme to go out there frightening and scaring people. It is interesting to note that you must have at least one friend left in the industry. You managed to pick up a paper that is under discussion. It is incomplete. It is still being discussed by the industry. I think that shows a great deal of callousness and lack of caring. It demonstrates a greater interest in purely playing politics than getting out there and having some concern about what is happening to older Australians in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It masks the fact that this party over there, while they were in government for well over a decade, had no answer to this problem. It masks the policy vacuum that they lived in. That was very evident when they put their policy out. Here it is. I have it here to table in the House today during this speech. This was the extent of the Labor Party's policy on innovation and aged care and community care when they came up to the last election. Here it is: one page, eight paragraphs, just a little over 200 words. That is the extent of their concern about aged care in this country. I table that document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> We inherited a nursing home sector in a deplorable condition. We have to take the responsibility to fix it in a fair and decent way. We will fix it, and we will do it in a way that is fair to all Australians. We will ask some, of course, to make a small contribution towards their own care. That is not unreason able. It is the only way, given the enormity of the task, the enormity of the mess that we have been left, that we can fix the problem that confronts us and all Australians in the community today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party have had, you could say, a conversion on the road to irrelevance. For 13 years they allowed the nursing home sector to go into decline. For 13 years the Labor government were content to neglect the circumstances of the frail and elderly in our nursing homes. They were content to make them into second&hyphen;class citizens. They were content to preside over a two&hyphen;tiered system that saw anyone who went into a hostel in good salubrious accommodation but saw those in nursing homes condemned to buildings that were falling down around their ears, that were firetraps and that were in a deplorable and disgraceful condition. You did nothing about it. You were the senior adviser to this government during that time. You did nothing to fix that problem.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even after Professor Gregory highlighted in 1993 the need to provide $130 million a year to rebuild the capital base of the nursing home sector, the Labor government failed to make provision for the viability of the future of the sector. They ran down the capital that they were providing to build up the stocks. They had no alternatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report was yet another example of where the previous Labor government undertook an industry review, only to then shelve the results, to sit on them. They accuse us of not knowing where we are going. We know absolutely where we are going. We are going to put prudential arrangements into place. We are discussing those with consumer and industry groups. They had no prudential arrangements in place. There are no prudential arrangements in place in the system that they designed. It is open to abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Labor government allowed the critical assessment of the needs of the aged care sector just to gather dust on the shelves&mdash;they did nothing about it&mdash;such was the commitment to aged care by the former minister, the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence). Labor had no commitment to correct the parlous state of nursing homes in this country. That was a gross dereliction of duty, a failure to honour a duty of care to our older citizens. It was a clear and unequivocal statement by the Keating Labor government that it was quite happy to condemn older people as second&hyphen;class citizens. The Labor opposition, led in this instance by the shadow minister, is determined to undermine the delivery of a high quality aged care service in high quality modern facilities, for purely selfish political reasons and a callous disregard for the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are no sound policy options underpinning Labor's opposition to the government's <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reform package. It is simply crass, second&hyphen;class politics from an out of touch and irrelevant opposition. The government's aged care structural reform package is a light on the horizon. It is a light on this hill for elderly Australians. A comparison of the policies of this government and the Labor opposition is revealing. I have already tabled their commitment to policy&mdash;eight paragraphs. They were able to fill less than one page with their policy. The elderly in our communities need to understand very clearly that the concern of the Labor Party for the aged in our community is new found. We need to ask the shadow minister: where was the Labor Party's commitment to the aged in the lead&hyphen;up to the 2 March election? The sum total, as I said, was eight paragraphs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also need to examine the Labor Party's specific commitments to address the capital crisis in nursing homes and to improve the standard of accommodation. There were none. They were running down their capital program and they had put into place no alternatives to provide it. I would like to quote from Labor's policy document, but there is not one word about the capital crisis in nursing homes that I can quote from.</PARA>

Talk about something constructive that will help the elderly in this country. No person will be denied access to care because they cannot make an entry contribution. Access to nursing homes and hostel places will continue to be based on the degree of frailty, not the ability to make an entry contribution. Not every nursing home will be eligible to charge entry contributions. There will be flexibility and choice offered to individuals in how they decide to pay their entry contribution, if that is the arrangement that is in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our policy is an integrated package that focuses on the needs of the elderly throughout the community; it does not just focus on one type of care. Underpinning our policy is the concept of ageing in place, not leaving elderly or older frail people in a situation where they <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have to be moved from one facility to another. If they enter hostel accommodation and they become increasingly frail, our policy is such that the funding will follow the degree of mental and physical frailty of the individual rather than moving them out of one section across the tarmac to another, just because of the inefficiencies and the inadequacy of the former government's policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are determined to provide a sustainable future for aged care in Australia&mdash;not making these decisions for short-term political expediency but making them in a responsible way so that they are sustainable in the long term, that they are good policies for this country and its people. I do not resile from the objective, nor do I apologise for the fact that it will mean substantial change to the current delivery of aged care services. It will mean a lot of talking and working out with both community industry groups and consumer groups. I make no apologies for that either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, unlike the Labor Party when it was in government, I am implementing the government's aged care reforms in a spirit of consultation and cooperation with all sectors of the community.

Under this government's aged care policies, all Australians will be treated equally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government makes no apologies for making these changes. They have been long overdue. The industry and consumer groups have been calling out for the changes for well over a decade, and we have taken up those calls. As I say, to take unfinished discussion papers that are still under consideration by community groups and to package them and pass them off as government policy is scaremongering. Putting out misinformation is callous in the extreme&mdash;as I said, the most <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7696"> callous act I have seen since I entered this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that we have taken the hard policy development decisions to ensure a decent and sustainable policy of care for the frail aged. We inherited a nursing home sector that was in a deplorable condition and we will, indeed, take the responsibility to fix that. If it means a bit of difficulty in working through the detail, so be it. We have put forward a very clear blueprint to ensure that everybody knows what our intentions are. We have given a very good guide. We make no apology for working through the detail with the community sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, we inherited a nursing home sector in a deplorable condition.

<ELECTORATE> (Cunningham)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(4.16 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Australian Labor Party comes into this chamber and endeavours to defend the rights of the aged and the veterans community in this country, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) says that we are scaremongering. She says that we are heartless, uncaring and do not have a commitment to aged care. Not once did the Australian Labor Party in government, in one hit, cut $500 million out of aged care in one budget. The government has done so and she stands condemned in this place for participating in that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My role in this discussion of a matter of public importance in the chamber today is to talk about the effect that this vicious policy of the government is having on the veterans community of this country. In 1995 there was a seminal report on the special aged care needs of the veteran community published by the previous government&mdash;that is, by a Labor government. The introduction to that report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Taskforce acknowledged that veterans have made a special contribution to Australia which needs to be recognised in a tangible way. Histori <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> cally, veterans have been treated by the Commonwealth Government as a special group, with the provisions of special benefits, income support, health care and compensation. The special status of the veteran community ought to be recognised as a `special community of interest' in aged care planning as veterans reach the final years of their lives and require access to a wide range of aged care services.</PARA>
<PARA>That task force report for the veteran community was followed up by a formal budget and policy response for the veterans alone worth $50 million. The policy was applauded by the RSL at the time as being a model response to the needs of the veteran community and was accepted, indeed, by the coalition. All tiers of federal government would recognise the special status of veterans, I am sure. God knows, we get the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), and many others, going around with their hands on their hearts, standing in this place and talking about the special place of the veterans community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have actually paid tribute to this minister as I have gone around to RSL clubs and conferences and said that, in the main, he has done a pretty good job in quarantining the veterans community from the viciousness of the budget cuts led by the Treasurer (Mr Costello). But what he has not been able to stop is the cross&hyphen;portfolio cuts. What he has not been able to stop is the attack in the home and community care area, the attack on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and, of course, dare I say, aged care, being led by the Minister for Family Services, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), and certainly being trundled along by the Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that, with the advent of this Howard government budget for 1996&hyphen;97, the idea has been shot to pieces that the veterans community can look forward to some form of security. There is no acknowledgment, for example, of the ripping out of the heart of the veterans community considerations. There is no acknowledgment of the special status of veterans when it comes to the $26,000 nursing home entry fee, many of whom would have to sell their family homes to pay, as my colleague has already pointed out. Not even <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7697"> TPI veterans will be spared this impost. Yet, as the minister said in her contribution, this is a small amount. She says for veterans and for people in the low end of the economic scale that this is a small amount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She also pointed at me and called me an `out of touch silvertail'. The sort of attitude being expressed by your ministerial colleagues clearly shows who are the silvertails. Yesterday, in the Senate, Senator Alston said that everyone has enough money to buy shares, when he was talking about the disposable income levels of the average family. Turn it up, Minister! There is no acknowledgment of the special status of veterans when it comes to the recently announced nursing home monthly fee that many will have to pay. There is no acknowledgment of the special status of veterans when it comes to the pharmaceutical co&hyphen;payment, as I have said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no acknowledgment of the special status of veterans when it comes to the new income testing of recurrent subsidies in hostels and nursing homes and, for a single veteran, that could be as high as $238 a week. Deny that! Where is the Minister for Veterans' Affairs? He should be in here to deny that as well. There is no acknowledgment of the special status of veterans when it comes to the new user charges for the home and community care program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has consistently refused to acknowledge or even comment on these betrayals of the veterans community. No mention was made of this in any of the glossy Department of Veterans' Affairs budget documentation. When asked about it in the parliament the other day, he hid behind this minister who is in the chamber at the moment. The other day, in this place, I asked him about this whole question of $26,000 and having to sell the family home, and what did the Minister for Veterans' Affairs say? He said, `Obviously the shadow minister for veterans' affairs has not been listening to the Minister for Family Services. I endorse the statements of the Minister for Family Services. We are working together on this issue.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the veterans community knows that he is working very closely with the Minister for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Family Services. If they work any more closely together, these two are going to be candidates to take over from the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) and probably, dare I say, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer). The coalition pointed the finger at the Labor Party and its minister's contribution. She tabled a policy which was supposed to represent what the Labor Party stood for. The Labor Party had been in government for 13 years and had delivered not only for the veterans community but also for aged care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's pre&hyphen;election promise to the veteran community was explicit and unambiguous. It stated the coalition would, and I quote the minister, `maintain all existing veterans' entitlements'. The reality is that it is so far removed from that promise as to be almost laughable. The veterans' affairs <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Portfolio Budget Statements</EMPHASIS>, for example, list savings over the next four years of $280 million. On 18 September the Minister for Veterans' Affairs said in this place:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The veterans' affairs 1996 budget package honours key election promises to the veteran community. It provides for simpler and more flexible entitlements. It is fair, with better access to services and more assistance to help veterans help themselves.</PARA>
<PARA>Help themselves into a nursing home if they can afford it, he should have said. How is it fair that a totally and permanently incapacitated veteran&mdash;a person who laid down their life for Australia in its hour of need and suffered debilitating injuries as a result&mdash;now, under this government, has to pay $26,000 to get into a nursing home? The TPI veteran may also have to sell his home to pay the fee. If not, he may have to pay an additional fee of around $15 a day. If this TPI veteran moves to another nursing home, he will have to pay it again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that this minister stands up in this place in question time and talks about hostel care and nursing home care as if it were one and the same. Don't you understand the difference? Don't you understand that the type of care is totally different? Hostel care&mdash;you have a choice to go into it to get some care. Nursing home care&mdash;there is not much choice.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7698">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are a veteran and you are faced with the prospect, you and your ministerial colleague come along and say, `$26,000 minimum up-front&mdash;sell the family home or rent the family home.' That is typical coming from a former real estate agent, `If you can't sell it, rent it.' That was the comment made by the minister today and reported in the paper. You are going to find these people left out in the cold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister in her contribution quoted Mike Seccombe from an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of a couple of days ago. The article, headed `Liberals spare the greedy', states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let's not forget the way the Government has turned market forces loose on the nursing home industry. Family Services Minister Judi Moylan continued to sound entirely unconvincing&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>according to the gallery&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as she denied elderly people&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>including veterans&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would have to sell their homes to pay the entry fees.</PARA>
<PARA>The article is dead right about this. You might reckon we have not quite got it right over here, but there are a few people around this place who clearly can see through the facade that you, Minister, put up. You parade yourself as caring and sharing with your bleeding heart on your sleeve and then you slug them for $26,000. You say, `If you cannot sell your home to get into a nursing home, rent it out to somebody and I'll do the deal.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an uncaring, unsympathetic government. When it comes to veterans, when it comes to people who are aged and in need of care, you have no idea. When it comes to the minister and her mate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs who says that he is working very closely with her, neither of them can come up with a credible policy option between them&mdash;slashing money out of the nursing home system, slashing money out of aged care generally. They stand condemned. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When it comes to participating at this stage of the debate on this matter of public importance it is almost a case of an embarrassment of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> riches. I do not know where to start on the rubbish that has been talked about on the other side. But I think I will start with one of the last things that was said because it was also one of the first things that was said. It was a mistake or error or something very strange indeed that was said by both the shadow minister for aged, family and community services, the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), and the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are told in this place first of all by the member for Jagajaga that hostel living is something you choose to do. It is an alternative form of accommodation. I find this absolutely breathtaking. Anybody who has any experience of trying to get somebody into a hostel lately knows that they go through a mile of red tape. Nobody gets into a hostel without an assessment by the aged care assessment team. You have to go through the bureaucracy. You have to be assessed. No hostel on the Gold Coast will take you unless those forms are filled in and an assessment of what the needs are for the person who is applying has been undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A hostel is not cluster housing. A hostel is a place where elderly people go for very particular support and care&mdash;not of the intensity of a nursing home, agreed, but you do not get into a hostel without that assessment. You are living in cloud&hyphen;cuckoo&hyphen;land if you think it is any other way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know what has been worse in the opposition's contribution to this debate today&mdash;the shameless scare tactics, misrepresentations and heap of untruths that it has used, or the hypocrisy that it has applied throughout its arguments. I am just aghast at the untruths that have been told in here. I hate to think what is being said outside by the member for Jagajaga in her conversations with those hostel supervisors. We are not hearing it and there is not the opportunity to correct it. In due time nursing homes and hostels will all know the truth and you will be shown up for what a disgraceful individual you are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot think of anything worse than the tactics that are being run in this House&mdash;and obviously outside&mdash;in relation to the elderly <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7699"> in our community. I cannot think of anything worse. Elderly people feel some vulnerability about their future, and the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) has very carefully constructed everything she has done and said so far in this issue on behalf of the government to reassure, to open up all the possible options and to give all possible support&mdash;and we have the shadow minister, very clearly, going outside and telling untruths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the way, I was just a little intrigued when I knew that the MPI referred to veterans. I have a fairly high proportion of elderly people in my electorate. The number of veterans in Australia is declining. In my electorate they are increasing. That tells you something. I am getting a higher concentration of veterans than most other people in their electorates, and that is a trend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not one veteran has come to me on this subject&mdash;not one&mdash;and I am constantly in contact with major veterans' organisations. I had contact as recently as one week ago. I would think some veterans will come to me in the next few days or few weeks as this garbage is pedalled through the veteran community. At least I now know what to be ready for. I know the sorts of things that I can tell them, and I will tell them very bluntly. In fact I might even get in first.</PARA>

I can only assume that this reference was included because the shadow minister for veterans' affairs is so lowly rated in his area and has got so little to say and so little to attack the government on in relation to what we have done in veterans' affairs that he has to hang his hat on this other MPI being run by the member for Jagajaga. There is no MPI of substance he could bring up by himself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Let us just get on to the hypocrisy side of it. The ALP's policy on hostels is parallel to what this government has done in relation to nursing homes. Every time that issue is raised, the shadow minister for the aged, family and community services veers away from it. She pretends she has not heard and just ignores it. There is no difference in principle between what we are doing in terms of entry contribu tions into nursing homes and what Labor did in relation to hostels. It is exactly the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister opened up with an example of some fee which she says is being proposed in a nursing home that she knows something about. I am indebted to the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) for providing me with a letter today in which he refers to a nursing home in his electorate, a major aged care facility, where the board is going to take a recommendation that no entry contribution be charged.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is typical of what is going to happen Australia wide. You are going to get everything from zero right through to whatever the upper figure is. The point is elderly people are going to have choice, and it is going to be tied into the institution. Most importantly, something is going to be done about nursing homes in Australia. There was no ambiguity about the promises that we made when we went into the election in relation to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard this babble from over there about what is going on in my electorate. For 12 years I have been in here complaining about what the Labor government has been doing in the area of aged care, particularly as it applies in my electorate, one of the major areas in need of aged care in Australia. I have been saying for a long time that what is wrong with the aged care area is the rigidity between hostels and nursing homes. I have been saying how difficult it has been to move down from a nursing home to a hostel; I have been saying how inflexible the system has been. I have been saying for a long time that we have not had enough beds provided in nursing homes. We have had hostels virtually having to fill the role of nursing homes because of the dearth of nursing home beds, particularly in my electorate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7700">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also been saying that I lament the lack of encouragement for people to go into the industry and to do anything about it once they are in there. I go into nursing homes where the care is excellent but the poor old souls are in rooms with three or four others.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sometimes eight, as the minister says. That is what has happened under Labor in the last 12 years. That is what old people have been able to look forward to. I have seen people go in who have been quite clear and happy in their minds. Because there is no choice, they have been put into a bed in a room with a person that they should not be near, and within six months they are mental wrecks. The people who went in with clear heads become mental wrecks because the nursing homes have no choice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can also tell the House, as I did last year, that the Gold Coast Hospital, the major public hospital in my electorate, has empty beds in it. We have waiting lists years long for certain types of surgery, and it has empty beds&mdash;it has no shortage of beds&mdash;because at any given time, between 35 and 40 geriatric cases are occupying beds in that hospital because there is nowhere else for them to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Geriatric cases are very heavy on resources for hospitals. They should not be in hospitals. They are much more demanding of resources than the average hospital patient. The hospitals want nothing more than an opening up of resources and some encouragement of nursing homes so those geriatric cases can go to where they will be more appropriately cared for and those other people&mdash;the battlers; the people the Labor Party bleats about, but does not really want to know about&mdash;can get the medical care they need from the hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the reality of all these years of Labor government. The reality is that we have had a running down of nursing homes. This government has taken the parallel of the Labor Party's policy in relation to hostels and is giving us hope that something will get better. It needs to be remembered that nursing homes are not hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the Labor Party's record in the area of dementia care will be a blot on the record <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of aged care in this country for many a long day.

<PARA>I take great pleasure in introducing the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Amendment Bill 1996. As outlined in my second reading speech covering the Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Bill 1996, this bill is an essential component of the dangerous goods regulatory package which has been developed by the National Road Transport Commission and key stakeholders under the intergovernmental road transport agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill proposes a number of administrative amendments to the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Act 1995. These amendments have been identified over the last 18 months during extensive consultation with Commonwealth agencies, state and territory dangerous goods regulators and key industry groups on the dangerous goods regulatory package. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>I take great pleasure in introducing a package of two bills which form part of the national road transport reform program being undertaken cooperatively by the Commonwealth, state and territory governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Bill 1996 is necessary to facilitate the adoption of a nationally uniform regulatory regime for the registration of heavy vehicles. The Road Transport Reform (Dan gerous Goods) Amendment Bill 1996, which I dealt with earlier, is an essential component of the dangerous goods regulatory package designed to facilitate the adoption of a nationally uniform regulatory regime for transport of dangerous goods by road.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both bills that we have introduced this afternoon are essential components of the regime of reformed road transport law being developed by Commonwealth, state and territory governments and the National Road Transport Commission under longstanding intergovernmental agreements. The objectives of national road transport reform are to produce improvements in road safety and transport efficiency, as well as reductions in the cost of administering road transport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The efficiency of Australia's road transport system has in the past been undermined by inconsistent or contradictory road regulations determined by each of the states and territories, and this has impeded Australia's economic development. Accordingly, in January 1992 the National Road Transport Commission was established following agreement between the Commonwealth and the states and territories to develop nationally uniform or consistent regulations relating to the construction and use of heavy vehicles. One of the priority areas set out in the so&hyphen;called heavy vehicles agreement was the development of a national heavy vehicle registration scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission's role was subsequently expanded by a second agreement relating to light vehicles. This agreement, among other things, required the commission, as a matter of priority, to develop and maintain national standards and associated codes of practice in relation to the transport of dangerous goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7707"> The government strongly supports national road transport reform, as a significant component of transport micro&hyphen;economic reform. A nationally uniform or consistent regime for road transport regulation, rather than separate, inconsistent state and territory regulation for the road transport industry, will deliver substantial benefits to the industry, its users and the wider community and economy. It will remove the frustration, delay, inefficien cies and costs associated with differences in regulatory frameworks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national registration scheme to be established by the Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Bill 1996 is the first step towards removing the problems associated with the lack of national uniformity in the registration of heavy vehicles. The bill will establish the broad regulatory framework for the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The registration package will improve transport efficiency, enhance national uniformity, and reduce administrative costs, particularly for transport operators. The aim has been generally to retain the best features of existing practices and preserve flexibility for jurisdictions to appropriately manage local issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the bill contains a number of substantive provisions relating to the powers of registration authorities, the security of personal or commercially sensitive information and the review of decisions, it is intended that the administrative detail of the scheme will be contained in the regulations to be made under the proposed act. The regulations will also set out the obligations of registration authorities and registered operators of heavy vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The registration reforms were developed by the National Road Transport Commission in close consultation with the road transport industry and vehicle registration authorities in all states and territories. Wide consultation was also undertaken with enforcement agencies and authorities responsible for the administration of third party insurance and stamp duty legislation. The proposed legislation requires compliance with existing state and territory laws in these areas. Comments received through these consultative processes have assisted the commission in refining its final proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Amendment Bill 1996, which I dealt with earlier today, assists the development of the new national regulatory regime for the land transport of dangerous goods. The new regime contains three key components: the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Act which was passed through this parliament in 1995 and which provides the broad legislative framework; the proposed Road Transport <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Reform (Dangerous Goods) Regulations which define the powers and duties of people involved in the transport of dangerous goods; and the sixth edition of the Australian Dangerous Goods Code which comprises the technical requirements forming the basis of the duties that are set out in the proposed regulations as well as several non&hyphen;mandatory guidelines. The aim of the dangerous goods amendment bill is to amend the act to ensure that the proposed regulations and code can be appropriately administered, once made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Ministerial Council for Road Transport voted unanimously in favour of the Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Bill 1996 and the associated regulations. On passage of the bill, it is intended that the regulations will commence by proclamation on a date approved by the ministerial council. Ministerial council also voted unanimously in favour of the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Amendment Bill 1996. The associated regulations are currently being considered by state and territory regulatory authorities. Both bills have also received the support of industry and other major stakeholders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures in the heavy vehicles registration bill will have negligible impact on Commonwealth revenues or expenditure, but will impact on the states and territories. The costs of implementing the scheme will fall mainly on registration authorities, $12.4 million in net present value terms, while recurring benefits will accrue to those same registration authorities, $10 million, vehicle operators, $14 million, and enforcement agencies, $1.5 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The light vehicles agreement signed by heads of government requires the National Road Transport Commission to demonstrate significant net benefits before including light vehicles in the scheme. Due to the high implementation costs which would be incurred by registration authorities, and the low estimated benefits of only $3.5 million annually&mdash;that is, 30c per vehicle&mdash;the commission recommended that the legislation not be extended to all vehicles at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7708"> The measures in the dangerous goods amendment bill have no impact on Common wealth revenues or expenditure. Both bills have widespread support and I urge states and territories to act speedily to adopt the reforms underpinned by the legislative package, once enacted by the Commonwealth. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>

<PARA>The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. Most of the amendments have already been introduced as customs tariff proposals in this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will briefly outline the changes of substance. The Customs Tariff Act 1995 re&hyphen;enacted legislation contained in the Customs Tariff Act 1987 and incorporates about 350 tariff classification amendments recommended by the World Customs Organisation, WCO, to which Australia is a contracting party. The overall aim of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 was to maintain levels of tariff assistance which would have been in existence on 1 July 1996 in the previous act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 1 of this bill contains amendments which were made to ensure the correctness of detail in the new Customs Tariff Act before it became operative on 1 July 1996. Most of the changes are of an editorial nature correcting format and spelling anomalies. The more substantive changes are:</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the rates of duty for beer, spirits, tobacco products and certain petroleum products are the subject of half-yearly adjustments in line with movements in the consumer price index, CPI.

Item 19 in part (ii) of schedule 4 allows the concessional entry of goods which have been sent overseas for repair that cannot be carried out in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 implements a number of significant and important changes to the administration, functions and procedures of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. These reforms will enhance the promotion and protection of human rights of all Australians and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government remains committed to the promotion and protection of human rights. The government is concerned that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has the administrative structure to ensure that it provides timely services, in the most effective and efficient manner, to all parties under the legislation it administers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is the first step towards reform of the administration of the commission and the streamlining of its structure. Over the coming months, the government will be examining further reforms to the structure of the commission. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first major reform which will be implemented by this bill is this government's response to the High Court's decision in Brandy v. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (1995) 127 ALR 1, which is referred to as the Brandy case. In the Brandy case the enforcement mechanism in the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, which commenced operation in 1993 and by which the determinations made by HREOC became enforceable as orders of the Federal Court upon registration, was found to be unconstitutional. This decision also affected the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 and the Privacy Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of the decision, an interim scheme was introduced by the previous government which reinstated the scheme existing prior to the 1993 amendments. Under the interim scheme, except where the respondent is a Commonwealth agency, determinations made by HREOC are unenforceable and the complainant must go the Federal Court for an enforceable remedy. Therefore, unless the complaint is against the Commonwealth, the parties face the possibility of two hearings of their dispute&mdash;one before the commission and one before the Federal Court&mdash;before obtaining a binding decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill provides that all complaints of unlawful discrimination under the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, SDA, the Disability Discrimination Act 1992, DDA, and the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, RDA, and complaints of breaches of human rights and of discrimination in employment under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986, the HREOC Act, will be made to the commission under the HREOC Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main procedural steps under the scheme would be:</PARA>
<PARA>(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a complaint alleging unlawful discrimination under the RDA, SDA and DDA would be lodged with the commission;</PARA>
<PARA>(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> upon acceptance of a complaint&mdash;that is, a decision by the commission that the matter is within jurisdiction&mdash;the president would inquire into the complaint and attempt conciliation;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7710">
<PARA>(c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> if a matter is not accepted as a complaint, review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act of that rejection would be available;</PARA>
<PARA>(d)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> at any stage after acceptance, the president will be able to terminate a complaint on specified grounds, for example, on the ground that there is no reasonable prospect of the matter being settled by conciliation;</PARA>
<PARA>(e)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> if the president terminates a complaint, the president must notify the complainants in writing of that decision and of the reasons for that decision;</PARA>
<PARA>(f)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> once a complaint has been terminated by the president and a notice has been given by the president, a complainant will have 28 days, or such further time as the court allows, to commence proceedings in the Federal Court should they want to do so;</PARA>
<PARA>(g)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> at the time proceedings are brought before the court or at any subsequent stage, any commissioner except the Privacy Commissioner could, with leave of the court, intervene as amicus curiae and make submissions on such matters of law or policy as the commissioner thinks fit; and</PARA>
<PARA>(h)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Federal Court will have jurisdiction in relation to the complaints and be able to make all appropriate orders, including interim injunctions where these are necessary, as the case requires. The court will have the power to delegate some but not all of its powers to judicial registrars.</PARA>
<PARA>I will briefly outline the main differences between this proposed scheme and the interim scheme now in place. First, the bill introduces uniform procedures for handling complaints under the three anti&hyphen;discrimination acts based primarily on the procedures in the most recent of the human rights acts, the DDA. Second, all inquiry and conciliation functions will be matters for the president and not the individual commissioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Third, there will be no inquiry or hearing of unconciliated or unconciliable complaints by the commission as happens currently. Under the new scheme, once a complaint is accepted by the commission and forwarded to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> president, the complainant will be able to access the Federal Court as soon as the complaint is formally terminated by the president, unless the termination is made at the request of the complainant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the commissioners other than the Privacy Commissioner are to be removed from their current role of attempting conciliation, which the bill will confer on the president and are to be given a function of amicus curiae to argue the policy imperatives of their legislation before the Federal Court, but are subject to obtaining the leave of that court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill does not alter the interim scheme introduced by the previous government to the extent that this applies to the enforcement mechanism under the Privacy Act. Although the Privacy Commissioner is a member of the commission, there is a separate complaints mechanism under the Privacy Act. As part of the government's commitment to the development of a co-regulatory approach to privacy protection within the private sector, the government will be examining the complaints mechanism under the Privacy Act and the relationship between the Privacy Commissioner and the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Privacy Commissioner will not be conferred an amicus curiae role as under this bill this role is in relation to complaints of sex, race and disability discrimination and, unlike the other commissioners, the Privacy Commissioner still has a conciliation of complaints function.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also introduces a number of important access and equity reforms. The court will be able to adopt informal procedures as it will not be bound by technicalities or legal forms. Special registry procedures will be established for human rights matters. The court will be able to make rules of court which delegate any of its powers to judicial registrars apart from the power of granting interim injunctions. `Any' in this proposed section may include all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7711"> In addition, where there is hardship, either party to a proceeding will be able to apply to the Attorney-General for financial assistance for the proceedings. Another access and equity initiative is the requirement for the commission to assist complainants in complet ing the necessary forms to commence proceedings in the Federal Court. In addition, the president will be able to prepare a report for the court on a terminated complaint and may give a copy of the report to a commissioner or the parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second major reform made by this bill will be to clarify the lines of management responsibility, facilitating timely decision making by providing for the better administration of the commission. The president is to become the chief executive officer, CEO, of the commission. These functions are currently conferred on the commission itself. The president will also become responsible for all complaint handling under the Commonwealth's anti&hyphen;discrimination and human rights legislation. In addition, the implementation of cooperative arrangements with the states and territories, where these exist, will be carried out by the president.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments made by this bill are complex. This is because the different procedural provisions of three schemes have been amended to introduce a single complaint handling stream and a uniform procedure into the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986. In making these changes, the government has taken steps to ensure that the new procedures represent best practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill removes some quasi&hyphen;judicial functions from the commission and the commissioners. The bill maintains the commission's role in conciliation, as this step in the process has proved most effective and, indeed, most complaints do not proceed past this stage. The bill also more clearly delineates the commission's function of impartially attempting to conciliate complaints from the commissioners' advocacy role for the protection of human rights. These, together with the new management structure of the commission, are important and timely reforms. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a portfolio bill which contains a number of minor policy and technical amendments to portfolio legislation. I will deal with the proposed amendments in the order in which they appear in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first is amendments to correct anomalies in relation to the cancellation of employer&hyphen;funded superannuation benefits. It is proposed to amend part VA of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 and the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989 to deal with the situation where the manner of sentencing for multiple offences produces a result which fails to trigger the cancelling of employer-funded superannuation provisions where policy indicates that they should be triggered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both acts provide for cancellation of employer&hyphen;funded superannuation benefits where a person is convicted of a corruption offence and sentenced to more than 12 months imprisonment. Where a person has committed multiple offences, the court may impose a sentence in such a way that the sentences are cumulative, partly cumulative or concurrent. For example, a person could be convicted of two counts of fraud and be sentenced to 12 months imprisonment for each count, with three months of the sentence on the second count to be cumulative to the sentence on the first count. That means the head sentence is 15 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, a court might impose a single sentence which exceeds 12 months in relation to multiple offences instead of imposing a sentence for each offence, any of which would not exceed 12 months. In the example I just mentioned, the court may order a single sentence of 15 months for both offences. In both those examples, the individual terms of imprisonment do not exceed 12 months, and therefore a superannuation order may not be made against the person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendments make a technical amendment to align part VA of the Australian <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7712"> Federal Police Act 1979 and the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989 with current sentencing practice. A superannuation order may be made if the single sentence in respect of multiple corruption offences or the aggregate of sentences in respect of multiple corruption offences exceeds 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further amendments to the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 and the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989 are proposed to exclude sentences that are an alternative to full&hyphen;time incarceration from the scope of sentences that cancel employer&hyphen;funded superannuation benefits. The effect of those amendments is that a superannuation order may not be made against a person who is convicted of a corruption offence and receives a sentence under subsection 20AB of the Crimes Act&mdash;for example, periodic detention&mdash;even if the sentence is for a period longer than 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Crimes Act 1914 is to be amended to increase the value of a penalty unit.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 it was decided that all pecuniary penalty provisions in Commonwealth legislation were to be expressed in penalty units to enable penalties to be adjusted from time to time. The penalty unit approach allows the real level of fines to be maintained on a uniform basis. The legislation was designed in such terms that, by amendment of section 4AA of the Crimes Act 1914, the value of the penalty units applicable to an offence under any Commonwealth act or regulation could be varied to reflect current money value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the enactment of the provision, inflation has diminished the value of penalties. According to figures provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the change in the consumer price index numbers between June 1992 and September 1995 is calculated at approximately 9.6 per cent. The penalty unit will be increased from $100 to $110.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Customs Act 1901 is to be amended to permit cost recovery in relation to storage and maintenance of confiscated narcotic-related goods. The amendment is aimed at enabling the Commonwealth to recover out&hyphen;of&hyphen;pocket expenses it incurs in relation to the transportation and storage of narcotic-related goods that are condemned and placed in commercial <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> storage facilities prior to the goods being transferred to the Official Trustee for disposal. Narcotic-related goods are, generally speaking, vehicles or vessels used in drug trafficking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment will allow the Commonwealth to recover its costs just as the Official Trustee recovers similar costs under the Customs Act. The amendment does not extend to full cost recovery for the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth will not be entitled to recover its expenses such as the salary of staff, nor is it entitled to recover expenses that are an ordinary incident of its operation. Ordinary everyday running costs such as office expenses and telephone or facsimile charges are not recoverable. Rather, it is the extraordinary costs such as the costs of transportation of narcotic-related goods to a place of storage and the actual storage charges that will be recoverable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Extradition Act 1988 is to be amended in two minor ways to correct deficiencies in present provisions. The first amendment will make it clear that, if a person makes an application for bail on the merits and fails, the person is not able to make a further application unless there is evidence of a change in circumstances that might justify bail being granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, where a magistrate remands a person in custody after the person has made an application for bail, the person is not entitled to apply to any other magistrate for release on bail during that remand. That would be unfair if the person's circumstances change such that bail would be justified but the original magistrate is no longer available, for example, if the original magistrate has resigned or retired. The amendment will overcome this deficiency while still achieving the purpose of restricting `magistrate-shopping'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second amendment to the Extradition Act deals with the appropriate procedure following the arrest of persons who are believed to have escaped from custody. The amendment will make it clear that the appropriate action following arrest is to take the person before a magistrate for testing of the arresting police officer's belief that the person <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7713"> has escaped from custody. The magistrate will be required to be satisfied that the person has escaped from custody authorised by the act before issuing a warrant authorising return to custody. Currently, a person who has been arrested by a police officer without warrant, when the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person has escaped from custody, can simply be returned to custody.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several minor and technical amendments are made to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987. The first relates to applications for variation of restraining orders, and extensions of time. The Proceeds of Crime Act allows a court to restrain property of defendants charged with serious offences. The property that remains restrained six months after conviction is forfeited automatically to the Commonwealth. A person may apply to the court to have the restraining order varied to release any or all of the property from the restraining order, but that application must be listed, heard and decided before the end of six months after conviction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because many defendants await the outcome of the trial before applying for a variation of restraining orders, applications need to be heard and determined within six months and that often places considerable pressure on court lists. The amendments are designed to alleviate that pressure. Where an application for a variation of a restraining order is made within the statutory six&hyphen;month period, the amendments will stay the forfeiture of restrained property until that application has been judicially determined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another amendment to the Proceeds of Crime Act relates to creating a defence of reasonable corporate precaution.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Proceeds of Crime Act a body corporate is vicariously liable for the criminal conduct of its directors, servants or agents. Other Commonwealth legislation establishes liability similarly but at the same time provides a defence of reasonable corporate precaution&mdash;for example, subsection 65(2) of the Ozone Protection Act 1989, a provision which is used as a model for this proposed amendment. The proposed amendment prevents the criminal conduct of directors, servants or agents from being imputed to a body corporate <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> where the body corporate can demonstrate that it took reasonable precautions and exercised due diligence to avoid the conduct of its directors, servants and agents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final act amended by schedule 1 of the bill is the Witness Protection Act 1994. The integrity of the national witness protection program established under the Witness Protection Act is of paramount consideration, not only for the witnesses on the program but also for the Australian Federal Police members who carry out the protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, section 22 of the Witness Protection Act creates various offences relating to unauthorised disclosure about the program or witnesses. Subsection 22(2) of the Witness Protection Act makes it an offence for a person who is or who has been a Commonwealth participant on the program or a person who has been assessed for placement to make certain disclosures, unless authorised to do so by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. The Ombudsman may investigate complaints about the program either on the complaint of a person or on her own initiative under the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendment to subsection 22(2) will enable a Commonwealth participant, a former participant or a person who has undergone assessment to make disclosures, without obtaining the consent of the Commissioner, when making a complaint to the Ombudsman under either the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981 or the Ombudsman Act 1976. Schedule 2 of the bill removes the requirement in several Commonwealth acts to obtain consent to prosecute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides for the repeal of certain provisions requiring the consent of a minister before a prosecution can be instituted against a person suspected of a Commonwealth offence. Those provisions were originally enacted for the purpose of deterring private prosecutions brought in inappropriate circumstances, particularly for offences which related to national security or international treaty obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, since establishing the office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions the retention of those provisions is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7714"> difficult to justify. That is particularly so now that the Director of Public Prosecutions has the power to take over and discontinue a private prosecution brought in relation to a Commonwealth offence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once the consent provisions which appear in the bill are repealed the director will have the task of instituting proceedings for the relevant offences. In relation to those offences it is appropriate that an independent office holder have the power to decide whether to prosecute. The bill does not affect consent provisions which relate to sensitive issues of national security or international treaty obligations.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The principal object of these amendments is to give effect to several recommendations of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Checking the Cash : A Report on the Effectiveness of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988</EMPHASIS> , the FTR Act, by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, 1993. Honourable members will recall that the principal act was part of the Commonwealth's package of legislation, developed following the Costigan Royal Commission into the Painters and Dockers Union, to combat organised crime. It erects barriers in Australia's financial sector to discourage use of the sector by criminals and allows the provision of financial intelligence to law enforcement and revenue agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> It plays a major role as an intelligence tool, able to expose the illicit movement of money, particularly cash, and to facilitate the follow ing of the money trail, both back to its source to identify the financiers and organisers of criminal enterprises, and outwards to locate the proceeds of crime, which may then be available for confiscation under the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987, another component of the anti-organised-crime package. Austrac is the agency constituted under the FTR Act to receive, analyse and distribute to law enforcement and revenue agencies information received from the cash dealers covered by the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recommendations of the Senate committee which were accepted by the government and to which these amendments give effect are:</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 12&mdash;state and territory revenue authorities to be allowed access to FTR information;</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 15&mdash;an expanded definition of `transaction' to include, for the purpose of the reporting of suspicious transactions, preliminary negotiations which do not proceed to a concluded transaction;</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 16&mdash;suspect transaction report information to be inadmissible in court proceedings;</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 18&mdash;to increase the reporting threshold for imported and exported currency and to define the point at which currency is considered to have been exported;</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 19&mdash;to require bullion sellers to identify customers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other main features of the bill are: it establishes a regime of reporting of significant transactions by solicitors; it consolidates Austrac's existing powers of inspection, that is, powers to access and examine the records and record keeping systems of persons required to keep records under the act; it updates the penalty provisions of the act in accordance with current drafting practices, and aligns the quantum and expression of penalties with those in other Commonwealth statutes; it updates other specific provisions that contain superseded terminology or are otherwise in need of modernising; and, finally, it makes minor technical amendments to correct minor drafting errors.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7715">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As honourable members will have noticed, many of the proposed amendments are of a legislative maintenance or housekeeping nature, of little effect other than to improve the useability or increase the clarity of the principal act. I will speak in detail only about those proposed amendments which have a significant impact on the policy of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First, let me mention the background to the proposal that state and territory revenue authorities should have access to FTR information, leading to the proposed amendment of subsection 27(1) by item 52 of schedule 1. The value of FTR information was brought home to states and territories in the course of the National Crime Authority task force known as Operation Quit, which involved the cooperation of the state and territory revenue authorities. That was a task force established in 1990 following a preliminary investigation into suspect transaction reports which ultimately uncovered massive tobacco licence fee fraud covering several jurisdictions. The recoveries by the affected jurisdictions as a result of the task force were at least $10 million up to $20 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the task force was wound up, the state and territory revenue authorities ceased to have access to FTR information. Understandably reluctant to give up a source of intelligence of such proven value in protecting the revenue, they made submissions to the senate standing committee seeking regular access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee was persuaded that their continued access was both reasonable and in the public interest. Its only reservation was the concern that the privacy safeguards of the Privacy Act 1988, central to the Commonwealth legislation, would not apply to the state and territory revenue authorities. As honourable members may know, there is no equivalent state or territory privacy legislation which would apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendment deals with the privacy concerns by requiring a revenue authority of a state or territory to undertake that it will comply with the information privacy principles set out in section 14 of the Privacy Act before the director of Austrac <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> may authorise it to have access to FTR information. That would appear to place the revenue agencies on a similar footing to Commonwealth agencies which are subject to the Privacy Act. Failure to abide by the undertaking could result in loss of access to the FTR information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Item 16 of schedule 1 amends section 3 by inserting subsection (7), adopting the committee's recommendation to make it clear that a `transaction' includes a proposal or negotiations for a transaction, in order to include negotiations terminated before completion. `Transaction' is not defined in the principal act and simply has its normal meaning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In some situations suspicion may actually arise only from the fact that the person did not complete the transactions, and that may occur upon learning of a requirement of the act. There is a clear investigative advantage in permitting as wide a range as possible of suspicious activity to be brought within the ambit of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Item 30 of schedule 1 amends section 16 of the act to make it clear that certain material in relation to suspect transaction reports is not admissible in any legal proceeding other than prosecutions under sections 29 or 30 for offences involving a cash dealer's giving false and misleading or incomplete information in relation to obligations under the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the course of consultation in developing this proposal, its purpose has sometimes been misunderstood. It is not possible for the defence of an accused person to be unfairly impaired by the proposal. Indeed, it is likely that the type of material covered by the provision would normally be held inadmissible in any event, failing to pass the test of relevance or on grounds of public interest immunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7716"> Suspect transaction reports, the information contained in them, or information about whether such a report was prepared can never be evidence as to whether or not a person committed a particular offence or whether an investigation was properly carried out. That material or information is purely intelligence, a possible trigger for an investigation to obtain admissible evidence to prove a particu lar offence. However, from time to time attempts have been made by defence counsel to subpoena such material and the appropriate officer of a cash dealer, usually a bank teller.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the nature of the material, the purpose of such a subpoena can only be a form of fishing expedition, perhaps to discredit the teller in some way or to confuse the jury about the significance of the material. Because such attempts have occurred, tellers are nervous about being subjected to hostile cross&hyphen;examination, and for several years financial sector unions have sought protection for their members. There is undoubtedly potential for any successful attempt to cross-examine a teller in an aggressive or humiliating way to permeate rapidly throughout the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effectiveness of the highly valued suspect transaction reports depends almost entirely on the willingness of front-line bank officers to observe the behaviour of clients and the nature of their transactions. If a person's behaviour or transaction arouses suspicion that a taxation offence or a serious criminal offence may be involved, the teller files a report under section 16 of the FTR Act. If tellers become intimidated, it is likely that they will cease to form relevant suspicions and an invaluable source of criminal intelligence will dry up at its source.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I must emphasise that the admissibility of potentially relevant evidence that may be given by officers of financial institutions will not be affected. Tellers, or any other officer if appropriate, may be called to give evidence, and be cross-examined on it, as to the identity of a defendant or the fact that a transaction occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final major amendment which I propose is contained in new section 15A of the principal act, item 26 of schedule 1 of the bill. That is not an amendment which was recommended by the Senate committee. I have decided that the Financial Transaction Reports Act should be amended to require solicitors to report to Austrac all transactions with their clients of $10,000 or more in cash, that is, in currency. They would also be required to include in the report particulars of the client's identity as known to them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over a decade ago, in 1984, the Costigan commission, the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, reported that some solicitors had let their trust accounts and perhaps their strong rooms be used as a means of parking and laundering illegally obtained funds. The commission noted that, and I quote its report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no doubt on a great deal of the evidence before me that certain solicitors have allowed their trust account, if not their strong rooms, to be employed as repositories for monies, the source of which, on any rational view, could only be illegal enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA>The commission's report goes on to say, `By depositing monies with such solicitors, some hope or expectation is held that law enforcement agencies will have difficulty in locating the funds and in seeking explanations for them.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More recently, in 1991, the National Crime Authority undertook a study into money laundering in Australia. It found that solicitors had often played a part in money laundering operations by assisting in the purchase of property in a way that disguised the source of the funds or the identity of the owner, for instance, the use of false names or `nominee companies' and through trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The NCA found that solicitors also assisted money launderers by placing cash proceeds in trust accounts, for instance, before settlement of property purchases, or for sending overseas&mdash;by wire transfer&mdash;or for returning to the criminal in the form of a loan. Another technique the NCA reported was used by solicitors was the arranging of false loans with other parties on behalf of criminals. The loans were repaid with the proceeds of criminal activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable members may also recall that evidence presented to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in 1993 indicated that solicitors in some areas of Australia&mdash;in particular, suburban practices in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and the Gold Coast&mdash;are handling significant amounts of cash on behalf of clients. The present exclusion of solicitors from the reporting provisions of the FTR Act could represent a loophole capable of being exploited by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7717"> criminals seeking to evade those provisions for the purpose of evading tax or laundering the proceeds of crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of the anti-organised crime legislation was to create an environment hostile to the successful commission of crime, especially those crimes, such as drug offences, which generate large quantities of cash that needs to be laundered and which are likely to be associated with organised criminal enterprises. Any identified loophole which assists those seeking secretly to move or launder cash must be closed to maintain the integrity of the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should make it quite clear that solicitors would not be subject to all the requirements which apply to cash dealers under the FTR Act. They will not have to carry out the client identification requirements that apply to account opening. They will not be required to report suspect transactions, international funds transfer instructions or maintain the same record keeping systems as cash dealers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their obligations will be limited to reporting cash transactions of $10,000 or more, providing particulars of the client's identity as known to them and, if requested, providing access to records and record keeping systems to authorised Austrac officers. The obligations are not onerous. Solicitors who never receive cash of $10,000 or more from a client will have no obligations. There will be no impact on such a practice at all, apart from the requirement to submit records from time to time for the inspection of Austrac officials performing their compliance monitoring functions. Those monitoring powers are set out in proposed new section 27D in item 59 of schedule 1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proposed section 27E lays down the conditions which apply to an authorised Austrac officer, including the giving of written notice and confining the inspection to business hours. The solicitor is obliged to comply with the notice. Failure or refusal to comply with the notice, or to comply with the reporting requirements of section 15A, constitutes an offence, which attracts a penalty of two years imprisonment&mdash;as contained in subsection 28(3). </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The remaining provisions of the bill improve the effectiveness of the principal act but do not introduce new policy or make any substantial changes. The opportunity is taken to insert a new part VIA in the act&mdash;item 59 of schedule 1&mdash;to consolidate the inspection powers of staff of Austrac. There is no substantive change to the powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill inserts a new part IIIA&mdash;item 49 of schedule 1&mdash;dealing with bullion sellers. The amendments require any person who is in the business of selling bullion to identify their customers in the same way as a financial institution identifies its customers who open or operate accounts. The amendments also rectify some technical problems with the definition of `bullion dealers' whereby some were able to escape the operation of the act, hence the alteration in concept from a bullion dealer to a bullion seller. The remainder of the bill makes technical amendments to update the penalty and offence provisions, eradicate superseded terminology and correct minor drafting errors. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr MILES</EMPHASIS> (Braddon&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (6.33 p.m.)&mdash;I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill forms part of a package of three bills to give effect to the government's 1996 budget decision regarding retirement savings accounts. Retirement savings accounts, or RSAs for short, have a central role to play in the government's strategy for increasing choice and competition in the superannuation sector. Choice gives employees greater scope to control the management of their superannuation savings.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7718">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Increased competition will raise the standard of service delivery throughout the industry. It will also facilitate greater product innovation and diversity and place downward pressure on fees and charges. This bill allows banks, building societies, credit unions and life insurance companies to provide superannuation without a trust structure in the form of retirement savings accounts from 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Superannuation has traditionally been provided through a trust structure. However, the trust structure is less relevant in the case of prudentially supervised institutions&mdash;that is, banks, non&hyphen;bank financial institutions and life insurance companies. The government's RSA reforms will enable these prudentially supervised institutions to provide superannuation directly off their balance sheet. This will facilitate a more cost efficient delivery of superannuation without compromising the security of member benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">RSAs will be a simple, low cost, low risk product. In particular, they will be required to be `capital guaranteed'. This means, in effect, that the account balance and any accumulated earnings or interest cannot be reduced by negative investment returns or downward adjustments to the value of investments underlying the policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The accounts into which a member and/or an employer on the member's behalf will be able to make contributions will be fully portable. They will be owned and controlled by the member and will be subject to the retirement income standards applying to other superannuation products, including preservation and disclosure rules. Disclosure rules for RSAs will be simplified, however, in recognition of their capital guaranteed nature. Employees will also be able to transfer amounts out of RSAs at any time, although RSA providers may require notice of not more than 12 months to minimise liquidity risks and ensure orderly administration arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The low cost, low risk nature of RSAs will be particularly attractive to certain sections of the community. RSAs should be especially suited to people with small amounts of superannuation, such as itinerant and casual workers&mdash;those wishing to amalgamate several <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> small superannuation accounts, and those nearing retirement who wish to minimise the market risk on their superannuation savings. Fees should be low and the accounts will be subject to the `member protection' rules which apply to superannuation accounts with less than $1,000. RSAs should also be particularly beneficial to women with interrupted working lives who may need a flexible, low cost and easily accessible product for the receipt of irregular contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">RSA providers will benefit from being able to offer a cost efficient delivery of superannuation and the ability to use more explicitly the institution's name in marketing superannuation as well as from enhanced customer relationships through the provision of one&hyphen;stop shop services, for example, through branch networks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regulation of RSAs will have two elements: prudential supervision for institutional soundness of the RSA provider, and functional supervision for compliance with retirement income and other superannuation standards. There will be no duplication of prudential supervision, which will be carried out under existing regulatory frameworks, for example, by the Reserve Bank of Australia, in the case of banks, and the Australian Financial Institutions Commission and state supervisory authorities, in the case of building societies and credit unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Functional supervision of RSAs and RSA providers will be undertaken by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, which will regulate compliance with retirement income standards. These standards ensure that RSAs are maintained for genuine retirement purposes and provide for a well&hyphen;informed membership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is closely modelled on relevant provisions in the regulatory regime currently in place for superannuation entities under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. This will ensure that the treatment of RSAs in relation to the superannuation standards is as consistent as possible with that applying to existing superannuation products. Industry associations representing prospective RSA providers and the consumer movement were closely consulted on this bill.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7719">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be extensive consultation in the development of the regulations covering disclosure rules for RSAs, member protection, preservation and other matters, to ensure neutrality between RSAs and broadly equivalent products offered by public offer superannuation funds. It is intended that the date of effect of the bill will be 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I would like to acknowledge the contributions of the former member for Bradfield, Mr David Connolly, in the development of the concept of RSAs, and the former Assistant Treasurer, Senator the Hon. Jim Short, in implementing this election commitment. Both of these people have contributed very significantly to the development of RSAs coming forward into this parliament.</PARA>

<PARA>The bill establishes a new body, the Productivity Commission, by merging the functions of the Industry Commission, IC; the Economic Planning Advisory Commission, EPAC; and the Bureau of Industry Economics, BIE. The bill sets out the functions, powers and policy guidelines of the Productivity Commission and its composition and procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in his headland speech `A Competitive Australia', on 18 July 1995, foreshadowed the establishment of the Productivity Commission as an election commitment. The Productivity Commission (Repeals, Transitional and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996, shortly to be introduced, provides for the repeal of the Industry Commission Act 1989 and the Economic Planning Advisory Council Act 1983 and for transitional matters and consequential amendments to other legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government wants greater public scrutiny and understanding of the factors driving Australia's productivity performance. Improving productivity means obtaining a better return from our resources, our people and our capital. We must find ways of using them all in a more creative, efficient and wealth producing fashion. We must also find ways of using our capital in a smarter, more intelligent, more modern fashion. Unless we boost productivity as a nation, our incomes and living standards will fall further, relative to our major competitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Productivity Commission will be the government's principal advisory body on all aspects of micro&hyphen;economic reform. It will continue to pursue the current functions of the IC, EPAC and BIE, but it will also have a broader charter. It will continue to have open and transparent consultative processes which engage industry and community groups in informed debate on important public policy making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sound policy development must be based on a full appreciation of the facts. A primary role of the Productivity Commission will be to identify impediments to improve productivity in particular sectors. It will also have due regard to the important relationships between improved use of resources in one sector and the rest of the economy. It is only <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7721"> with this sort of information and economy&hyphen;wide focus that governments can make sensible and considered choices as to future policy&mdash;choices that will ensure better and more sustained growth prospects for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Productivity Commission will have a particular focus on areas which impact on Australia's international competitiveness. Its research will include identifying best international practice in major industries and disseminating the results. The Productivity Commission will also have the authority to examine labour market practices retarding productivity. Labour is a key input in the economy and its productivity growth is vital to sustaining increases in living standards. Liberating our labour market remains the greatest single economic and attitudinal change to be achieved if the important goals of a more productive and competitive Australia are to be realised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is good enough to expose to public scrutiny arrangements working to the benefit of corporations and to the potential detriment of consumers, it is good enough to expose restrictive labour market practices&mdash;also potentially working to the detriment of consumers&mdash;to the same scrutiny. Hence the Productivity Commission will be given a work program to identify restrictive work practices and significant labour market arrangements which add to the cost of doing business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Productivity Commission will not just focus on areas of Commonwealth responsibility. The states and territories have an important role in the consideration of industry and productivity matters. The states have responsibilities in many sectors of the economy&mdash;for example, intrastate transport, port authorities, and electricity generation&mdash;which can impact significantly upon the efficiency and competitiveness of industry. The Productivity Commission will review areas of state and territory responsibilities. In recent years there has been increased cooperation between the Industry Commission and the states and territories, and the government wishes to see this continue with the new Productivity Commission.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Productivity Commission will focus its attention on all sectors of the economy, including the service sector. Moreover, it will have capacity to examine the efficiency of resource use within government through conducting program evaluations. The establishment of the Productivity Commission will allow for efficiencies in the economic inquiry work of the government. Budgetary cost savings of $5 million are expected in 1997&hyphen;98, $6.15 million in 1998&hyphen;99, $6.15 million in 1999&hyphen;2000, and $5 million in 2000&hyphen;01.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the main features of the bill. The bill proposes that the commencement date of the act be from the royal assent to the Productivity Commission (Repeals, Transitional and Consequential Amendments) Act 1996. The bill establishes the functions of the Productivity Commission. The principal functions are to:</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> hold inquiries and report about matters relating to industry and productivity that are referred to it by the minister;</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> provide secretariat services and research services to government bodies, as directed by the minister;</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> from 1 July 1997, receive and investigate complaints about the implementation of competitive neutrality arrangements in relation to Commonwealth government businesses and business activities and report to the minister on its investigations;</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> provide advice to the minister about matters relating to industry and productivity as requested by the minister;</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> undertake on its own initiative research about matters relating to industry and productivity; and</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> promote public understanding on matters relating to industry and productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill sets out the general policy guidelines for carrying out the Productivity Commission functions, which require it to have regard to the desire of the Commonwealth government to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">improve the overall economic performance of the economy through higher productivity in the public and private sectors in order to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7722"> achieve higher living standards for all members of the Australian community;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">facilitate adjustment to structural changes in the economy and to ease social and economic hardships arising from those changes;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">reduce the regulation of industry (including regulation by the states, territories and local government) where this is consistent with the social and economic goals of the Commonwealth government;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">recognise the interests of industries, consumers and the community that are likely to be affected by measures proposed by the Productivity Commission; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">recognise the social and environmental consequences of measures proposed by the Productivity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides for flexibility and a range of working methods in the performance of the commission's functions. This will enable the Productivity Commission to mix and match its resources to its wide range of tasks consistent with enhancing its own productivity. In particular, the bill provides that the Productivity Commission is not required to act in a formal manner and may hold public seminars, conduct workshops and establish working groups and task forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are no standing provisions requiring public hearings for the purposes of an inquiry, specifying the duration of inquiries or requiring the preparation of draft reports. These procedures are best determined in light of each reference to the Productivity Commission. In referring a matter to the Productivity Commission, the minister will be able to require it to hold public hearings, publish a draft report or develop options. However, in the case of public inquiries it is expected that the Productivity Commission will usually produce a draft report, therefore facilitating community debate, and will usually present a range of options in its recommendations to the government. As indicated before, the Productivity Commission will do much more than conduct inquiries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The bill permits the minister to direct the Productivity Commission to provide secretariat services and research services to govern ment bodies. For example, the Industry Commission currently provides secretariat services and research services to the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, to undertake performance monitoring of government trading enterprises and government service provision. The bill will allow this type of arrangement to be formalised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister can request advice from the Productivity Commission about matters relating to industry and productivity. Unlike inquiries, when the minister requests advice from the Productivity Commission, there is no facility for the commission to conduct public hearings or publish its advice to the minister. However, the minister may publish the advice provided in any way he or she thinks fit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission will be empowered to conduct research projects, which will be more narrowly focused compared with inquiries and be of shorter duration. While internally initiated research projects would be determined by the Productivity Commission, in setting topics it would be expected to be mindful of the views of the Commonwealth and state governments, business, and welfare groups. A common theme would be the factors underlying productivity growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A particular aspect of the Productivity Commission's research will be assessing the performance, including thorough benchmarking, of economic infrastructure such as ports and rail and of government services to business such as business licensing. Other ministers will be able to seek the minister's approval for the Productivity Commission to conduct inquiries or research into topics which fall within their portfolios. The bill also provides that the Productivity Commission may, with the minister's written agreement, and subject to any specific conditions set by the minister, provide research services to a person or body other than a government body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7723"> The Office of Regulation Review will be maintained as a separate unit within the Productivity Commission. The Office of Regulation Review will provide advice to the government and to COAG, undertake research on regulatory standard setting, and contribute to the legislation review program. The Office of Regulation Review is an important comple ment to the other activities of the Productivity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also details the competitive neutrality complaints mechanism to be operated by the Productivity Commission. As the Treasurer (Mr Costello) announced on 27 June 1996, when releasing the Commonwealth's statement on competitive neutrality policy, competitive neutrality requires that significant public sector businesses and business activities not have any advantages over their private sector rivals simply by virtue of their being government owned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The complaints mechanism provides for the Productivity Commission to investigate situations where Commonwealth government business activities may not have had their advantages removed in accordance with the requirements of the policy statement or where other Commonwealth government businesses should have their advantages resulting from government ownership removed. The complaints mechanism arrangements will commence from 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Productivity Commission will consist of a chairman and between four and 11 commissioners. The positions of chairman and commissioners are statutory appointments by the Governor&hyphen;General, for terms no longer than five years, though appointees are eligible for reappointment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Productivity Commission is to provide written reports on all inquiries to the minister, with the bill requiring that he or she table each report within 25 sitting days of receipt, unless the Productivity Commission recommends a delay in tabling the report for a specific period.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I rise to sum up on the debate on the Family Law Amendment Bill 1996 that took place this morning. It generated significant interest among members on both sides of the House, but I observed that most of the comments that were made in the debate on the second reading tackled broader issues than the bill itself deals with. Most members looked at Family Court issues in general or Child Support Agency issues, and in some cases reference was made to legal aid. Most of the comments made, while significant, were not pertinent to the proposal in the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were some other comments made not directly relevant to the bill which I think should be referred to. On 15 October, I made a speech at the National Press Club entitled `Future directions in family law'. In the course of that speech, I addressed the subject of possible changes to the primary dispute resolution infrastructure in the family services area. I made the point on that occasion that there had been a good deal of rather misinformed speculation and comment in the media in the weeks prior to that speech on the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government's intentions. Unfortunately, that misinformation and speculation have been continued in the speeches delivered this morning. I think I should very briefly indicate the background to the government's proposals, which I outlined in some detail in that speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For primary dispute resolution services in the family area, people going through family breakdown currently have access to the Family Court counselling service and the Family Court mediation service in some registries. They have access to private counsellors or mediators and they have access to a wide range of community agencies, many of which are funded by the government. The court offers a range of services to assist couples to resolve their separation disputes without having to go to litigation, and also to assist those who are actually engaged in Family Court litigation. Nearly all of these non-judicial services are provided in&hyphen;house by employed counsellors, mediators or by registrars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The approved community based services are provided by community organisations under contract to the government through the family services program in my department. Among other services, these organisations provide marriage and relationship education, marriage and child counselling, and family and child mediation. The organisations which provide those services include Relationships Australia, Centacare and the various organisations which come under the umbrella of Family Services Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at the three sources&mdash;the Family Court, the private arena and the community organisations&mdash;it is relevant to ask whether the services are provided in the most efficient and effective way, particularly given that the Commonwealth is, in one way or another, involved in the financing of some part of all of them. In relation to private mediators or counsellors, this may be through the legal aid programs or even community legal centre programs. The current principal sources of the services are the Family Court and the community organisations, however.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7725"> This dual stream seems to have a number of potential defects. First, there is no neces sary connection or coordination between the two streams, although some liaison does occur from time to time. Secondly, given that it is government policy to encourage people to resolve their domestic disputes without resort to litigation and without resort to the Family Court, there is something of a contradiction between encouraging people to resolve their family law problems outside the courts on the one hand, while at the same time keeping a major source of counselling, including voluntary counselling, within the Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most people, I think, would prefer to deal with the whole process of separation and associated agreements over children, property and maintenance outside the court environment. There is an increasing interest in the community in alternative dispute resolution methods such as counselling and mediation. The difficulties, from a policy point of view, of having these two streams, uncoordinated as they are, are compounded by a further factor which is that the Family Court services are provided, in all cases, free, whereas the community organisations, in order to survive, are obliged to invite participants to pay a fee. This immediately directs people away from community organisations towards the litigious environment where an adversarial or confrontational attitude may quickly develop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, in its report on the funding and administration of the Family Court delivered at the end of 1995, noted that the court's counselling service has played a significant role in the achievements of the Family Court to date. The low rate of cases that proceed to a defended hearing, quoted by a number of speakers this morning, is often quoted in this context. The joint select committee, however, did recommend that there should be an encouragement to parties to pursue resolution of their disputes outside the court and in the community. The resolution of those disputes, naturally, puts a focus on the community organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The JSC's recommendations have been under consideration by the government and three major objectives have been identified. Firstly, as a matter of policy, parties should be encouraged to resolve their problems <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> themselves. Secondly, the method of resolution should be kept simple and made easy to find and, from a taxpayers' point of view, there should be value for money. The system should be efficient and effective. On that basis, the government is currently giving consideration to what reforms might be effected in the direction of encouraging people to use community organisations rather than court located mediation and counselling services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have in mind that there will be a lengthy consultation process involving all stakeholders, that nothing will happen quickly, but that the policy of encouraging people to deal with their problems in the community is one that should be pursued as the ultimate goal. It is against that background that some of the criticisms of the bill can be answered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The speakers on the opposition side made a number of points which, I think, misunderstand the nature of what is sought to be achieved. First of all, the member for Banks (Mr Melham), the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) and the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) all made a point which was, in substance, to the effect that the imposition of fees within the Family Court for voluntary mediation counselling services blocks access to justice and especially access to counselling which could save marriages and preserve families and keep them intact. These claims ignore the broad community usage of community sector counselling where fees are already paid. People who cannot afford to pay in the community organisations are not required to pay, or are invited to pay at a much lower rate than people who can afford to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Family Court there is a waiver of fees and charges for a range of people including those on legal aid, those who are recipients of income support of some kind such as social security recipients with a health benefits card, or those who can otherwise demonstrate hardship. The Family Court reports that between 30 and 40 per cent of litigants in that court have fees waived. It would be expected that the same number would have their fees waived in respect of voluntary mediation or counselling.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7726">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People now using the Family Court service include many people who, in fact, could afford to pay or make some contribution. They would still be able to use counselling with the fees that are proposed, given that the fees proposed are modest. My department has made an assessment of the fees paid by community organisations. They have a variety of forms in different community organisations, but in all cases there is a waiver for those who are unable to pay, with, in effect, a sliding scale up to those who can afford to pay a top fee. The top fee, on average, is about $40 an hour, which is what is proposed to be effected under this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is committed to improving and extending access to counselling and mediation, including by looking at the best balance between court annexed and community based mediation, as I have attempted to explain. By introducing fees in the Family Court, the government is removing the present inequity whereby court services are provided free. Community organisation services are not provided freely and, instead of having their disputes resolved in the community, people are encouraged to go to court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second criticism offered by the member for Prospect is to the effect that the court provides an excellent service which people will be discouraged from using, going into litigation instead. That is completely wrong. Litigation also involves charges and people are not likely to be encouraged to pay litigation charges which would exceed those for mediation or counselling because of the difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who will not be paying fees because they are on legal aid, or otherwise can demonstrate hardship or impecuniosity, will not be affected either way. The fees likely to be charged, as I have already indicated, will be comparable to those charged in the community sector and they are modest. They will still be vastly less expensive than litigation, except for the indigent litigant who is on legal aid or otherwise has all fees paid and does not have to pay court fees. People should be encouraged to prefer to use the less traumatic and less destructive methods of dispute resolution.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another point made by the member for Banks and the member for Prospect is that the government is breaking an election promise to increase options for counselling and mediation. I completely reject that attempted criticism. The government is committed to the promotion and encouragement of counselling and mediation in family law matters. That is why we are looking to achieve the right services with the broadest possible access in the fairest and most efficient way, encouraging people to use the community services instead of the current distortion that encourages people to use the court because it is free&mdash;or to keep people out of the court system and the litigation process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Banks attempted another criticism. In substance, he alleged that the imposition of fees is anti-family and contrary to the family values policies of the government. The government is committed to the health and wellbeing of Australian families and to giving families the best possible chance of stable and satisfying relationships. That is why we have doubled the resources we put into marriage education to give people the skills to deal with charges and conflicts in their relationships. That is also why we want to ensure that we are not encouraging people to go into the legal system when they have relationship problems. The inequity between the free court service as against the community service could be contributing to that. In addition, the government is taking other steps to give people better access across Australia to the whole range of family services such as counselling and mediation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Jagajaga asserted that the bill does not provide for waiver or exemption of fees. The fees for counselling and mediation will be subject to the same waiver and exemption provisions as other court fees. As I have indicated, people on legal aid, people on income support from government and people who can otherwise demonstrate hardship will not pay fees. As I have said, the Family Court, applying its existing waiver and exemption provisions, currently waives or exempts 40 per cent of users from other fees. The waiver and exemption provisions will be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7727"> provided for in the regulations that set the fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On another point, relevant to the distinction between the community and the court system, I mention that a number of speakers referred to the fact that the Family Court statistics indicate that 95 per cent of cases are resolved without a final hearing before a judge. That is not to say that there has not been a hearing or even quite a number of hearings, but the final resolution of the dispute does not have to go before a judge but is dealt with in some other way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that, although the mediation and counselling services in the community organisations have not been subjected to the same analysis as the Family Court statistics, an evaluation of mediation in a particular area was undertaken and demonstrated that in excess of 70 per cent of mediations were successful. In other words, people within the community were in 70 per cent of cases able to resolve their problems themselves without having to contemplate going to the Family Court either for alternative dispute resolutions such as mediation or counselling or for litigation. That 95 per cent figure is pretty good. If you can achieve a 75 per cent success rate before you even get to the court, it is much better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Bowman (Mrs West) raised another question. The suggestion is that, instead of having voluntary counselling before filing for divorce, family court litigants may elect to postpone counselling until after filing and then rely on a judge or registrar to make the necessary order or directive. The fees that we seek to impose will relate only to voluntary counselling. They will not relate to counselling that is ordered by the court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, if people wish to avoid paying fees, they could choose not to go to counselling prior to filing and then wait for the court to order counselling under the power in the act. The government does not see this as a loophole. If parties see counselling as a valuable process, they will continue to choose to use it prior to filing any application. After all, people presently choose to go to community based counselling services and they pay for those services. If there are unresolved issues <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> between the parties about children, counselling would seem appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Litigation is very expensive, and there is a paucity of money for legal aid to support Family Court litigation. Relationships Australia has, at least in one of its outlets, found that people who go to the community organisations seeking counselling when their relationship becomes rocky can usually be assisted. As I said, for mediation, there was a 70 per cent success rate. For counselling, I am not sure of the figures, but I suspect that it would be reasonably high as well. The counselling, it found, could be effectively completed in six sessions of one hour. That would cost the community, if it were not paid for, in broad terms roughly $240 on the scheme proposed; $240 to prevent a divorce may be saving thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars to the community. I do not think that the criticisms offered by the opposition to this bill have any weight at all. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These two complementary pieces of legislation, the Education Services for Over <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7728"> seas Students (Registration Charges) Bill and the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill (No. 2), seek to levy a charge to partially recover the costs associated with maintaining a register of providers of education services to overseas students. One of the bills actually levies the charge; the other bill puts in place relevant administrative arrangements to administer the charge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the opposition is concerned, these bills are completely uncontroversial. We have no objection at all to introducing an element of cost recovery here. In fact, when we discussed these bills in the Labor Party caucus, the only concern anybody had was why the government is not going for full cost recovery. The financial impact is fairly slight. In a full year, I think it recovers about $1 million, which, as I said, is about half of the cost of operating a register.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The establishment of this register, for which this legislation seeks to recover part of the costs, obviously was part of an overall package of measures that was introduced several years ago in response to some fairly significant problems that emerged in regard to the education services industry. We did have, as honourable members will recall, a situation where quite a large number of these providers of courses collapsed and the Commonwealth ended up having to bear the burden of reimbursing the students who had paid fees up&hyphen;front. The consequential financial impact flowing from that, I think, was very considerable. It was something in the order of $50 million, I seem to recall, and the whole industry got rather a bad name as a result of that. There were some disreputable providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This whole growth industry of provision of education services to overseas students, which is now economically very significant, generates about $1.9 billion worth of export revenue a year. The basis of that is the reputation and standing of Australian education providers. It is not a problem with those providers that are part of the formal education and training sectors, that is, the schools, the universities and the technical colleges. The problem arose in regard to those that were not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> part of that framework, particularly the providers of English language courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in order to address the damage that was done as a result of the events of a few years ago, legislation was passed by the parliament to institute a regulatory regime which was designed to provide some element of quality control in regard to these providers. That led to the introduction of the so&hyphen;called ESOS Act, the Education Services for Overseas Students Act, which has operated for a number of years and has been amended a couple of times, I think.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has just been a major review done of the operation of the ESOS Act. That review found virtual unanimity from the Commonwealth government, the state governments, the various industry providers and the other stakeholders in the whole area. The current approach was essentially the right one, that is to say, a cooperative regulatory scheme involving Commonwealth, states and industry. There was really no significant opposition to that from any quarter. That original piece of legislation has had its sunset date extended for a further period as a result of legislation that was considered by the parliament a couple of months ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are seeing here is of course an element of cost recovery in regard to the costs associated with operating that regulatory scheme. There is no problem with any of that. The opposition will be supporting these two pieces of legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(7.31 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Western Suburbs Community Youth Support Scheme is a community based labour market provider like many others that all members would be familiar with. It runs a skillshare program for the unemployed, together with training programs for particular industries. It enjoys tax exemption. It receives about $1.3 million of its $1.5 million income from various government payments. It helps unemployed people gain necessary skills for future employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, there are some startling features about the way it has operated this year. Western Suburbs CYSS has a grand total of just six members&mdash;the president, the vice&hyphen;president, the treasurer, the secretary and only two other members. By itself that is a matter of concern, albeit technical. What is of greater concern is the fact that earlier this year those six people decided to change the organisation's constitution to permit the payment of honoraria to office holders and members as determined by the members. That is, the six people decided to pay four of their number money from the organisation's income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike any other community labour market operator that I know or, for that matter, any other community based tax&hyphen;exempt service group, it decided that the vice-president, the secretary and the treasurer would be paid an annual fee of $4,800 paid quarterly and that the chairperson would be paid an annual fee of $12,000 paid quarterly. This is public money. It has gone to a community based, tax&hyphen;exempt organisation that seeks donations from the community. It has not been paid to Western Suburbs CYSS for them to take up to $30,000 off the top for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The even more amazing thing about this questionable behaviour is that one of the six members is the local state member, Denver Beanland, who is also the Attorney&hyphen;General of Queensland, the state's First Law Officer. Whilst he did not personally receive these payments, he supported the change to the constitution earlier this year that allowed <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7730"> these payments to occur. So, too, did local Brisbane City Councillor June O'Connell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the First Law Officer of Queensland and a Brisbane City Council councillor supporting the payment of thousands of dollars to people on what used to be a voluntary organisation. The skillshare sponsors handbook says, `Board members cannot be paid for being on the board.' How could the first law officer of Queensland allow&mdash;much less support&mdash;these payments being made?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Payments to the office holders has been made as payment to their companies, not to them as individuals. The first payments were made in July for the quarter ending 30 June, but they do not appear in the annual accounts for the last year, although provision is there for a range of accruals. Why is it not disclosed in the annual accounts?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the organisation wants to operate like a private company, it should be registered as such. But those involved cannot have it both ways&mdash;enjoying the benefits of a voluntary tax&hyphen;exempt community association when it suits and behaving like a private for profit company at other times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last week, Western Suburbs CYSS has taken steps to correct these matters. Three new members are in the process of joining. Importantly, the members who received the payments are currently considering refunding that money. I believe it will be refunded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All this raises important questions of accountability as the Howard government closes every CES office in Australia over the next eight months. It follows the revelation earlier this week that a CES area manager has expressed concern about staff attempting to establish private companies to tender for labour market funds as employment placement enterprises. He had to remind the staff that that was illegal. As more and more of these labour market dollars are distributed to companies and registered organisations and as more and more cuts are made to DEETYA staff, who will ensure the management information systems and accountability mechanisms are in place?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a local community, including the First Law Officer of Queensland, can make such an <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> error of judgment, what will happen in other parts of Australia as local committees each deal with millions of dollars? It is not good enough that the money can be channelled through trading enterprises other than skillshare. Irrespective of which operating account the money comes from, the inescapable fact is that nearly all the money has come from the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister Vanstone needs to assure the parliament and the people that, in its ideologically driven haste to cut the Public Service and close down the CES, it will not invite taxpayers' dollars to fill the pockets of committee members, private companies or those just looking for a quick dollar rather than helping the unemployed.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight it is my privilege to read speeches written by two young ladies from my electorate of Lilley in Brisbane. They are visiting Canberra and are in the gallery tonight. Kylie Pert is a student at the Banyo State High School and Helen Barry is a student at the Sandgate and Districts State High School.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Kylie and Helen have both completed year 11 and were chosen to come with me to Canberra on their merits and interest in politics. I wish to express my thanks to Ansett Australia, which very generously provided the airfares for both the girls. Each student has written a short speech on their views of education for youth in Australia. I would like to read these. Kylie says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a major concern to me and to many students that the importance of youth and youth issues are, on occasions, misunderstood.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been fortunate enough to come to Canberra this week and express these concerns on behalf of my peers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most relevant is education, however, other issues discussed by students are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Unemployment;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Multiculturalism; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Immigration</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as well as gaining an awareness and understanding of Australian politics. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7731">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Students feel more teachers are needed or that the allocation of teachers needs reviewing. Even in Brisbane&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>a city&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as a result of the lack of teachers, it is necessary to be taught more subjects using the School of Distance Education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To give some examples I refer to Accounting, Economics, French and Modern History. This type of education is difficult and without the guidance of a teacher, the results are normally below the capability of the students and this in turn can consequently affect the future employment prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that parliamentarians have a responsibility to take a stronger interest in youth. They should make students aware of the importance of education. They should talk to them so that they become aware of young people's problems and concerns. Parliamentarians should encourage students to set goals which will assist them when the time arrives to tackle the outside world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After all, the youth of today are the future and potential of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We, the students have to come to terms with the complex issues of today to ensure we eventually make the right decisions for tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current Parliament is making decisions today which will affect us tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore we would like them to be fully aware of the youth of today, of our concerns and expectations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We the students feel it is important that we have an education which will allow us to make Australia a country of which we are all extremely proud.</PARA>
<PARA>Helen says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the past few days, I have been able to witness first hand the inner workings of our government. Consequently, I have been exposed to a great deal of information of which previously my knowledge was limited, and feel very fortunate to have been provided with such a unique opportunity that too few Australians experience.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An issue which is of particular concern, is that of the lack of knowledge Australian youth possesses regarding the structure and role of Australian government and foreign affairs. Although this does not require as urgent attention as many other issues in Australian society, I consider it necessary that Australian youth be better educated on our government system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Expanding the knowledge of government and foreign affairs is essential for a number of reasons. Eventually, Australian youth are going to be faced with the task of voting in elections and referendums, and in order to make an educated decision <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on the issues concerned, a basic knowledge of our political system is critical.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One such issue which we will inevitably be asked to express our opinion on, is the republic issue. In my opinion, without an understanding of how the existing government system works, we cannot possibly be expected to make a worthwhile comparison among the two systems, and hence our responses will simply be misinformed opinions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to this, an understanding of government and foreign affairs would be of immeasurable value for youth when deciding on employment opportunities. An increase in the knowledge of foreign trade policies, taxes and the role of government would undoubtedly lead to a greater success regarding small business initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I reflect on the benefits to be gained from a knowledge of the Australian political system, it becomes evident that the government must ensure such education occurs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Throughout primary school, we are taught the fundamentals of our political system in social studies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, when we enter high school very few courses are aimed at developing such a knowledge, and there is limited encouragement for further independent study of government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, it would give me great pleasure to see the government take affirmative action to introduce some form of compulsory political studies into the curriculum of high school students, ideally during years eight and nine.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .       . . .      . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, as I have only one more year of high school to complete, I am personally keen to learn of the government's efforts to reduce unemployment, and their role in the recent increase in tertiary fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although as a student I am constantly bombarded with statements that "my opinions must be heard, as I am the future of Australia", I feel that efforts to prepare youth for this role are not always sufficient.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .       . . .      . . .</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I know I am speaking on the adjournment debate, so I apologise that this may very much sound like a grievance. I have probably had more notices of motion on the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7732"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>  than any other member of the opposition, and I have to report that I have had zero luck, a duck, as far as the Selection Committee is concerned. It did not matter whether the issue was the Ombudsman, East Timor or Lebanon, not one notice of motion was picked up. It is a matter of disappointment for me. Even when I have seconded a motion from the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) or the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), I have still not been given a guernsey.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that in this House people have talked about higher standards for the House. It is true that the Speaker is prisoner of the standing orders provided to him or her. I have not been remiss in proposing changes to the standing orders. I must say it is the condition of opposition that leads me to have such an interest. I have proposed&mdash;it is not an original proposition; in fact, it is former Senator Jessop's proposition&mdash;that the House should have a staffing and appropriations committee. I have not been permitted to debate that proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have moved a notice of motion concerning a standing order for a better question time by limiting the time spent in asking and answering questions. When this was first tried in the Senate under the previous government, there was much resistance in the Senate by government ministers of the day. But most now conclude that it in fact assists question time. I have not been allowed to put that proposition to this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My last notice of motion would allow a new form of private members statement&mdash;indeed, 20 per side per week&mdash;called members electoral statements. I hope Mr Speaker will understand my frustration that we are in the penultimate week of the sittings, the penultimate week this year for me being in opposition, and not one of these issues have been selected by the Selection Committee as being worthy of discussion in this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I still am an eternal optimist. I sincerely hope that the leader of government business, the Leader of the House (Mr Reith)&mdash;this really rests with him&mdash;might pick up at least some of the suggestions I have made. People talk about higher standards in this House. I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> must confess that I really love to describe myself as a parliamentarian who respects this House and the forms of the House, but it is up to the Leader of the House to determine whether or not any one of these initiatives is taken up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note the number of government members who are in the House tonight. Had the notice of motion for private members constituency statements been allowed, each and every one of you would have got up this week. You would have been in the Main Committee this week making not a five-minute contribution but a three-minute contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that the opposition does not have the numbers. It does not have the numbers in the House; it does not have the numbers on the Selection Committee. But I say to government members opposite: you indeed do have the numbers, very magnificently. If we want to improve standards in the House, then the Speaker needs to be assisted. As far as oppositions are concerned, we need to make more than empty statements. We have to indicate what our intention ought to be should we be&mdash;and hopefully soon&mdash;returned to government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, in the meantime, it is in your hands. You may think that a staffing and appropriations committee would do nothing. You may think question time is fine and there should be no changes. But you would have a lot to gain if the proposition about additional private members time in constituency statements were advanced. We have made no progress this year. I sincerely hope that we will make some progress next year. Again I say that the Speaker is a prisoner of the standing orders which this House provides him. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recently I invited high school students in my electorate to submit essays for a competition. The essays had to encompass the writing of some words that involved an Australian flavour. The competition was won by Makayla Cameron of Ferny Hills. Makayla is a year 12 student at Ferny Grove High, a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7733"> high school that has been the alma mater of such sporting icons as Tracey Wickham and a current Olympian, Sharon Cripps.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Extracts from Makayla's essay, entitled `Advance Australia Fair', display an insight beyond her years. Makayla rejects any suggestion that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waltzing Matilda</EMPHASIS> should be the new national anthem. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How could a song about a thief (a swagman who stole a sheep) who commits suicide (by drowning himself instead of facing responsibility), truly represent the spirit of Australia?</PARA>
<PARA>She in fact praises the Australian identity. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We don't need to find our identity, it's already in the hearts of every True Blue Aussie. It simply needs to be resurrected and practised.</PARA>
<PARA>She offers a recipe for harmony and peaceful relations. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia needs to focus on the concept of creating a harmonious community, a nation which can live together in peace in a balance between freedom and responsibility, instead of being obsessed with the idea of individual rights and demands.</PARA>
<PARA>She makes a number of other adroit and mature observations. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Children need to be taught discipline, respect, responsibility, pride, dignity and patriotism . . . This must begin with wise, just, honest and accountable governments who legislate with care and fairness.</PARA>
<PARA>She finally endorses the retention of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advance Australia Fair</EMPHASIS>  as our national anthem. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What other purpose should every Australian citizen have but to `Advance Australia Fair'?</PARA>
<PARA>Makayla has now finished her secondary school and plans to embark on a computer and business career. She hopes to have a musical career and then, ultimately, a political career. What she has seen in Canberra on her short stay down here has not caused her to change her mind. I wonder at that at times; but overall she is very enthusiastic about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also in Canberra along with Makayla is Miss Tanya Benson. They are both sitting in the gallery. Tanya attends Pine Rivers High School and has just completed year 11. She is down here for her outstanding community service. She won the 1996 Miss Pine Rivers <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> title, which was assessed on the basis of her personality, charm, grace and intelligence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She represented the Pine Rivers Bears Junior Rugby League Club, which is a dynamic young club in the electorate, and she has attended numerous functions involving the Pine Rivers Bears. In fact she has helped to raise the profile of the Bears to such a degree that I hope very soon their clubhouse will be finished and functioning and serving as a great focal point for the development of young footballers in the area, as well as developing the sort of community spirit which, by her selfless endeavours, she is trying to foster. She also raised significant funds for community benefit along the way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She has occupied the position of Miss Pine Rivers for just over six months. She has enjoyed it immensely and I can tell you, Mr Speaker, that, from my observations of her and my trips around the electorate, she is a remarkable young woman whom I admire greatly. She is a woman of great poise, maturity and insight and she has done the area of Dickson credit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She will be finishing year 11 very shortly and will be finishing high school next year. She has also participated in musicals such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Annie</EMPHASIS>, which was run by the school, and is tutoring year 9 in maths. She also has her drivers licence. She hopes to pursue a career in business and hospitality. It is a great pleasure to have these young women down here in Canberra to show them our system and parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I am raising tonight is a matter of grave concern to me. When I left high school I got a job catching animals for zoos. It was a very interesting occupation and I think it was very valuable to Australia. In 1958, the last year in which the company I worked for operated, the company exported something like 7,500 kangaroos, mainly to the United States, for the price of &pound;125 each. In 1958 it was a lot of money and it was good money for Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7734">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Due to the insistence of the RSPCA in New South Wales and Victoria, the government took steps to ban that export, effective as from 1 January 1960. In the same year, the kangaroo meat export business boomed. Seven pence a pound was the going price for exports to Germany of kangaroo meat for human consumption. It was sold as Australian venison. Unfortunately, that industry was abused. When the maggots hatched out, the Germans stopped that import.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk about the effect of that. The silly legislation banning that export led to enormous cruelty involving the export of animals. It did not stop the export of animals; it simply drove it underground. The company I worked for regularly had trappers out on the fields legally trapping certain birds. Rare species were clearly avoided. Those trappers in the field took great steps to make sure there was no illegal trapping. Of course, once the ban was imposed the field was left wide open to illegal trappers. There is some evidence of the enormous cruelty and loss of life involved in the export of fauna. There can be no doubt that it happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to give the House the benefit of some figures involving the United States. The red-bearded dragon&mdash;pogona vitticeps&mdash;which is local to the Eyre Peninsula area, was not known to the United States until 1992. It was then worth $10,000. The price today is down to $150, and they have learnt to bring in techniques that will undoubtedly make the price go lower. The knob&hyphen;tailed gecko&mdash;nephrurus&mdash;is another one. It was not in the United States until 10 years ago. Now they have mutations there and are in fact exporting them. None of these was exported to America legally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The United States is now the biggest exporter of the python molarus, which is a Burmese python. So the CITIES legislation has really counted for nothing. Birds are no different, of course. The cacatua roseicapilla, better known here as the galah, is fetching substantial prices in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Raymond Hoser wrote a book called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Smuggled</EMPHASIS>. He has just recently written the sequel, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Smuggled 2</EMPHASIS>, which contains a foreword from the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan). <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The book raises very great concerns about the obvious corruption involving the authorities in this business in Australia, principally the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service. The allegations in this book are so serious that I believe they do need to be thoroughly investigated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, the New South Wales Parks and Wildlife Service, and a couple of other people&mdash;Mr Victor Bates and Mr Vacik&mdash;tried in the Supreme Court of New South Wales to get an injunction to stop the distribution of the book. Judge Levine refused to do that. He said there was no inference at all that allegations were unsubstantiated, and in fact gave costs favouring Mr Hoser.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting thing is that, when I have spoken to journalists about Mr Hoser, many of them have said, `Do not touch him, this man has got a criminal record.' It is not hard to get a criminal record when you are dealing with crooks, as exists in some of these departments. In most states of Australia, we have allowed these people entry to people's homes without warrants. Of course it is abused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Hoser is now once more being subjected to another appeal as there is judge swapping. This is such a serious matter that it ought to be investigated. I have no faith whatsoever in royal commissions or the political system. I believe it should be thoroughly investigated by a parliamentary committee. This is the only body which I can see would actually get to the bottom of the allegations in the book. The book has substance. It is readable. It is very credible. After all, it has a foreword written by the minister. If we do not investigate the book, it would be an indictment of all of us. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to inform this House of the display of paper products that took place today, which was very important for everyone in this building. In speaking this evening, I am not out to advertise a particular product, but I do want to draw attention to a situation that many in the House would not be aware of. In fact, they may have been unwittingly using imported paper and therefore contributing to our <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7735"> foreign debt. I am an environmentally conscious person and fully aware that the use of paper is essential and, moreover, that the members and senators of this parliament use vast quantities of it&mdash;dare I say it, perhaps far too much.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it is with pleasure that, along with the member for McMillan (Mr Broadbent), I was involved in organising the display of stationery manufactured by Australian Paper. This display was held to draw the attention of members and senators to the quality products available in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must confess to a little self-interest here. As the member for Gilmore, I was proud that those involved in the display were workers from my own electorate, specifically from Nowra. Not only are they workers from the mill but they also play a role in its marketing and have an excellent rapport with the management. Much of the stationery which was on display is manufactured from recycled fibre. I was very proud indeed to have promoted a range of quality products that would allow us as members, and those in Senate, to purchase Australian made paper that will generate economic growth with due regard for the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to outline a little about the display and the environmental advantages of the products that were on display. The display of Australian made paper took place today in a Senate committee room, and it provided a comprehensive range of office paper, including copy paper with 80 per cent and 100 per cent recycled content.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, I would like to outline more fully the environmental significance of the paper available. There has been some debate about pre&hyphen;consumer wastepaper and post-consumer wastepaper. An important fact to remember is that wastepaper is paper that has been removed from its point of production for a subsequent use. It has either been used or been the residual of a further process, like cut-offs from printing, or rejected as unsatisfactory for quality deficiencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If such paper is not returned to a paper making plant for recycling, it must be disposed of as garbage, such as burning or putting it into landfill. As a result, recycled <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> paper is paper made from wastepaper that would otherwise have been rubbish. It is therefore truly recycled waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to draw the attention of members of the House and the Senate to the possibility that they, like me, were unknowingly using imported paper when they would have preferred to use a quality Australian product. Naturally, I am not about to advocate the use of inferior product simply because it is Australian, but in the case of the display I urged politicians from all persuasions to look at the Australian product and to make their own judgment. To use a hackneyed cliche, we need to put our money where our mouth is when buying our own products when and where they are available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know politicians from all sides have serious concerns about regional unemployment and depressed economies in these areas. If we can make even the slightest contribution to our local economies, then as politicians we must endeavour to do so. I have therefore decided to use Australian paper because of its quality, environmental sensitivity and general competitiveness. I would hazard a guess that the majority of parliamentarians who attended the display today will choose to do so as well, particularly after speaking with the actual workers who made the paper.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In all my years in parliament, I have experienced no issue more vexing than that raised in the private member's bill we are debating today, the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996&mdash;not least because nothing in my political life had led me to expect to have to make a judgment on euthanasia in my capacity as a member of the national parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the difficulty this bill poses for many members is that we are effectively being asked to pass judgment on two quite unrelated issues with only one vote, the vote each of us shall shortly cast on the motion that the bill be read a second time. Those two issues are, firstly, the right and/or competence of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly to pass laws on the subject of euthanasia and, secondly, the morality of euthanasia itself. It should be noted that the bill presented by the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) also aims to prohibit the Australian Capital Territory and Norfolk Island from passing laws which would permit euthanasia. However, this bill would overturn only Northern Territory legislation because it is the only territory to have passed legislation on the subject to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the first issue we are to vote on, there seems no doubt that the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly had the right to legislate on euthanasia when Marshall Perron's bill was passed. In a letter to members of the federal parliament, Jim Robertson&mdash;a former member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly&mdash;states the position we are therefore facing as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . what Kevin's bill seeks to do is to not just create a new law, but overturn an existing law validly made by a parliament constituted of Australian elected representatives, then retrospectively tell that elected assembly what laws it may or may not enact for its people under the general heading of "Good order and peace", that universal right of all parliaments in our centuries old system . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For this proposed legislation is not so much about whether you or I like what the Territory Parliament has done (I do not as it happens), but whether or not another parliament in another place ought to retrospectively deny it the right to legislate for its people in accordance with existing law and its conscience. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7737">  </PARA>
<PARA>I have read some rather curious views as to whether the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly is actually competent enough to have passed such a law. For example, it has been a recurring theme of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  editorials that, given the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly's comparative youth as a legislative institution, its actions cannot be viewed as equal to actions that might be taken by longer&hyphen;established parliaments&mdash;presumably the New South Wales state parliament being considered to be superior to all other Australian parliaments in its decision&hyphen;making ability because it is the oldest, although the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald</EMPHASIS>  does not go so far as to actually state that corollary of its view of the Northern Territory's parliament. Nevertheless, the inane conceit those editorials display is equalled in error only by the offensive notion that the age of an institution can confer superior wisdom on whichever politicians happen to be transiting its premises at any given time. Indeed, those views are so stupid that no-one&mdash;and certainly no Australian democrat&mdash;should feel the need to waste any time or mental energy on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a member of the Fraser government which legislated for Northern Territory self-government nearly 20 years ago, I have no doubt that our expectation then was that that territory would ultimately achieve the status of a state of the Commonwealth of Australia&mdash;when its population and financial development warranted that step. The actual method of statehood's achievement was left to future determination. However, I am quite sure that the Australian parliament's intent at that time was to genuinely and actively foster the Northern Territory's development to a position of equality, not some form of second&hyphen;class statehood. It is therefore really only an historical quirk that that territory's laws can be overridden by us in the manner this private member's bill seeks to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A justification for this bill's proposal, we are told, is that the availability of voluntary euthanasia it provides would extend to all Australians who might choose to travel to the Northern Territory, and that it therefore has a national effect. I have a problem with that view. I have been assured by the bill's proponents that there exists no way to extend the bill's provisions to any future laws of the six Australian states. In other words, should any or all of those states pass legislation identical to the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995, this parliament would&mdash;could&mdash;do nothing about it. That raises the same issues as the moronic blatherings of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> editorials I have referred to. At worst, this is an intellectually and politically bankrupt objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those are strong words. Allow me to explain from my particular perspective as a member representing a Queensland electorate which is geographically all but adjacent to the New South Wales border, and demographically contains a higher&hyphen;than&hyphen;the&hyphen;national&hyphen;average aged population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have received a number of letters from frail and aged constituents asking me to vote against the Andrews bill. The irony of their requests is that I am quite sure that few&mdash;if any&mdash;of them would be in a position to avail themselves of the Northern Territory's act. It is highly unlikely that they would be physically capable of travelling to the Northern Territory in the first place. Further, they probably have no clear idea of the considerable expense that would be involved. I truly believe it fanciful in the extreme to predict that significant numbers of old people&mdash;those whom the advocates of the Andrews bill say would feel `pressured' if the Northern Territory's act is not overturned&mdash;would gather themselves up to make the journey, separating themselves from their homes, families and friends to die alone in a strange place.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7738">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, were New South Wales to enact such legislation my constituents' situation would be very different. Cost and separation from family would no longer be issues. The action the House of Representatives appears almost certain to take&mdash;passage of the Andrews bill&mdash;would then no longer appear noble but, rather, simply foolish. Northern Territory residents would be denied&mdash;presumably for a long time&mdash;something their own elected representatives had proposed for them. No national prohibition on euthanasia can be conferred by the national parliament, because this is not the parliament with effective control over the subject.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the second, inescapable dimension that debate on this bill has raised, the morality of the provisions of the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995. This has been by far the more difficult issue for me to reach a decision on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I shall not take the House's time recounting instances of suffering and terminal illness I have witnessed. Everyone, sooner or later, has these experiences and reacts to them as individuals. I do not believe we can judge the issue, as legislators, solely on that personal basis. I have struggled to make the `right' decision&mdash;read all the letters and associated material sent to me, considered the many articles written by columnists and ethicists, meditated about the religious imperatives. The more I have read, the less certain any answer has been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only one factor has been quite unambiguous&mdash;namely, the strength of community support for euthanasia according to various opinion polls. They are important, but they are not the last word on the subject. In the end, the most important single factor for me has been doctors' views&mdash;both those in favour of euthanasia, and those opposed to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time is too limited to allow me to include in this speech any more than a fraction of the medical input I have received, but I shall quote briefly from a document&mdash;a speech&mdash;sent to me by a doctor who supports the Andrews bill, because it graphically sums up the types of situation I have had outlined to me by many doctors in recent months. In describing the progress and treatment of a man with lung cancer, this doctor says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I visited him at home until the time came when fluid developed in his lungs which needed draining. He was admitted to hospital, it was drained, but within a few days, it reaccumulated. I was called urgently to the hospital as he was screaming that he couldn't breathe. His wife was at his bedside. I ordered a dose of morphia intravenously. The nun drawing up the drug paused and I spoke to her quietly&mdash;"Sister, if you have any moral dilemma I will give it myself."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">She replied "Doctor, I wonder if it is enough."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He died peacefully within the hour.</PARA>
<PARA>Doctors who have told me these stories have made me fearful&mdash;fearful of not having laws which permit their patients  (potentially, all of us) a say in the time and manner of their dying. If I should ever find myself facing the type of extremity that only that overdose of morphine (which seems to be the standard resort) can end, I want to have a say in the matter. In short, I support the empowerment of patients and I recoil from the notion that only doctors and nurses have the right to determine just how much suffering others must go through before they take it on themselves to decide to end it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with Dr Roger Hunt when he wrote to us:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A sensible legal framework and professional guidelines, rather than covert practices, should assure proper standards of care for terminally ill patients.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe the arguments of the seven doctors in their open letter to the Premier of Victoria to be compelling:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7739">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are not raising a theoretical issue. The assistance of suicide by doctors is already a recurrent reality in the state of Victoria. We have assisted patients to end their lives and we know others who have. We believe that we have acted in the best tradition of medical ethics, offering our patients relief from pain and suffering in circumstances where it would have been an act of cruelty to deny them. We respect life. All of our professional training and work deepens that respect. However, the reality is that there are some patients who are beset by physical and mental suffering which is beyond the reach of even our most sophisticated efforts at control.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, I quote from a letter to the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gold Coast Bulletin</EMPHASIS> , written by a Vietnam veteran who recounted how he was urged to kill North Vietnamese soldiers by the same priests who would now deny him the right to end his own life of cancer&hyphen;induced suffering. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm 57 and I wear a nappy. I lie in my own filth until my dear wife attends to me early in the mornings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">She insists I call her during the night but she is so exhausted I feel bad about disturbing her.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I take tablets and medicines by the bucket, pills supposedly to ease the pain along with injections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I consume pills to counteract the effects of these drugs and pills to counteract the side effects of those. It goes round and round, on and on.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I eat like a sparrow and sick up soon after . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's not the way I look that upsets me as such, but the constant pain, fading in and out of a clouded sleep. I look at those I love through a perpetual mist of pain.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's lying in my own filth and the revulsion I sense as those dear to me clean my pathetic body.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We feel revulsion when we step in the body waste of an animal on the street, yet I lie in it most times, as I am too weak, unable to make the toilet or the bedpan . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am castrated as well and the physiological and physical barriers that came with the news did not help once the treatment began for my advanced cancer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I watch and listen to the debate on euthanasia very closely, because it affects me, and yet, it is denied me by people who feel they know what is best for me . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm sick of being sick. I'm tired of this slow painful death, of sucking for air in short gasps where there never seems to be sufficient oxygen&mdash;like a fish out of water, dying out of its natural environment.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wince at the guilt they feel when they forgetfully speak of next Christmas or next holiday or any issue that relates to the future, knowing I will not be here.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I assure them I hope I'm not&mdash;not like this.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before commencing my substantive remarks on the Euthanasia Laws Bill, I would like to thank the many constituents and others who took the trouble to write to me or telephone my office about this measure. There can be no doubt that the community is concerned about the implications of the Northern Territory act and I have received more representations on this bill than I have on any other matter which has come before the House. I certainly appreciate the efforts people have made to bring their views on the bill to my attention and I found them very useful in formulating my own response to the complex ethical and moral questions which are raised by this whole debate. The overwhelming majority of the representations I received were in favour of the Andrews bill and against the existing Northern Territory law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7740">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One threshold issue which often comes up in debate is that of whether the Commonwealth parliament should take up this issue at all, given that it has already been determined by the Northern Territory assembly. The reality is that the Commonwealth retains constitutional responsibility for the territories, whether we want it or not. The responsibility is there and we must accept that responsibility&mdash;if we have the right, and no-one I know disputes that, then on an issue of this importance, we also have a duty to pick up that right and determine the matter at the national level. The territories are not autonomous states and while they retain their current legal status under the constitution we cannot abrogate our obligation to ensure that the legislation they pass is consistent with the national interest. This is not a power we should exercise lightly, but one could not suggest that legislation which authorises euthanasia is anything other than extraordinary of itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not the first time that I have personally had to confront the question of euthanasia. I was appointed as a member of the Select Committee into the Law and Practice Relating to Death and Dying in the South Australian parliament in 1990. The committee was formed on a bipartisan basis on the motion of Mrs Jennifer Cashmore MP. The deliberations of the committee, which involved a great deal of public input, were long but productive. I would have to say that it was easily the most effective committee on which I served during my 10 years as a member of the House of Assembly. All members worked well together&mdash;sharing a common goal to improve the law and practice relating to palliative care and to ensure that whatever changes were made to the law were undertaken in such a way as to bring the whole community along in the process. We placed a premium on consultation and education&mdash;listening and leadership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee resolved to reject the pro&hyphen;euthanasia stance of a small but very determined and genuine group in the community. We were all of the view that this would be an inappropriate response to the needs of the terminally ill. We decided instead to focus our attention on the issues of patient autonomy and palliative care. The committee made a series of recommendations for reform of the law and practice relating to death and dying which strengthen the autonomy of the patient through the mechanisms of informed consent, the right to refuse treatment and the availability of the option to appoint a medical attorney to represent the interests of the patient when they are unable to exercise their rights in a personal capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also recommended the reform of the law to remove the burden of possible criminal and civil prosecution from doctors and other professionals who sought to relieve pain and distress through the use of narcotics, which might have the double effect of reducing the patient's life expectancy, or who discontinued the burdensome or futile treatment of a terminally ill patient in accordance with proper standards of palliative care, without negligence and in order to improve the quality of life of the patient&mdash;even where this had the unintended consequence of shortening the life of the patient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This series of mechanisms&mdash;strengthening patient autonomy, including the appointment of the medical agents, informed consent, refusal of treatment and placing the priority on palliative care; removing the burden of law on the health professionals where they work to improve the quality of life of the patient through pain control and the relief of distressing symptoms; and ensuring that there was no obligation to maintain burdensome or futile treatments&mdash;together with a range of other lesser reforms, which I will not detail at this time, had the effect of refocusing the attention of patients, the health professions and the broader community on high standards of good palliative care rather than on what some see as the alternative of euthanasia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7741">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The critical distinction here is intention. The intention of the doctor who employs pain relief which they know will also have the effect of reducing life expectancy is the paramount consideration. There is every difference between the administration of a drug to relieve pain and the administration of a drug to end life. Our law and ethical principles have always placed great weight on this kind of distinction of intention and while the practical outcome may not be far different in some cases, the nature of our society would be fundamentally different if we did not draw that important distinction based on intention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the term of the committee, I had the good fortune to be appointed as health minister in South Australia and, working with my colleagues from both sides of the House on the committee, I was able to ensure that the recommendations of the committee were introduced as a bill into the parliament. The bill was approved by the lower house with an overwhelming majority of the vote, only three members opposed it. However, the bill took many months to pass the Legislative Council, such is always the way with upper houses. The act finally became law in 1994, and substantially in the same form it was originally introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The medical and related health professions, using the technology available in an advanced country such as ours, have made great strides in the treatment of the terminally ill in recent years. Modern methods of palliative care in the hospice setting are able to relieve much of the pain and distress which in the past could accompany some illness in the terminal phase. The concept of dying with dignity though is a very powerful one and is justly to be wished for all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The focus on patient autonomy and palliative care, which is embodied in the South Australian Consent to Medical Treatment and Palliative Care Act which, taken together with the dedicated work of our health professionals, will help make that promise a reality. Palliative care is not perfect but it has improved dramatically and can be further improved if the resources and commitment are there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter of great regret therefore that the Commonwealth has recently chosen to broadband the funding for those services and to reduce funding for the states in that area. Society stands to gain significantly from the modest investment we make in palliative care services. I would urge the Commonwealth to think again about this kind of funding cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory act does not establish a sound legal or social base for euthanasia. The legislation is legally imperfect and the result of far too little consultation and debate. It did not enjoy a community consensus which is essential for this kind of social reform. The steps that South Australia took were significant enough of themselves to require several years of hard work to ensure that they represented the best law we could make at the time, and the community consensus which underpinned them was a soundly based one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act in the Northern Territory was adopted with almost unseemly haste and with the hallmarks of a proposal assembled to meet artificial deadlines. I do not question the bona fides or the goodwill that motivated the proponents of the bill. I accept without question that they acted from the best of motives and in accordance with their personal beliefs. I do not question their integrity but I do question the legislative outcome that this parliament is now invited to set aside.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I oppose euthanasia as a matter of conscience but, in any event, I do not believe that the Northern Territory should have considered this kind of legislation without first establishing a sound base of palliative care backed by innovative and caring legislation, and with the understanding and support of health professionals and the wider community. With all due <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7742"> respect to those involved, I do not believe that this has occurred. Therefore, our duty as a Commonwealth parliament is clear, we should support the bill now before the committee and thereby overturn the Northern Territory act.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate that has ensued, resulting from the passage of legislation in the Northern Territory to allow people ostensibly who are ill to be put to death, is one that has sparked an enormous emotional response on both sides of the argument. It is proper that emotional arguments are taken into account in this, and it is understandable that some people see the possibility of a painful death as something that can somehow be eradicated by killing them early.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important to put on the record precisely what euthanasia is about. It is not about suicide. It is not about prolonging life in a way that should not be done. It is about allowing one human being to put another human being to death and I am opposed to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument that says that somehow the federal parliament should not discuss this is to me an argument which has no validity at all. How could it be possible that we who are elected to the national parliament, with the responsibility under our constitution to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the people of Australia, could refuse to debate an issue as important as this one which is about the sanctity of life of the individuals we govern?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under our constitution we indeed have the power to override the law of a territory. I am on the record as being a supporter for statehood for the Northern Territory. But, at this time, the Northern Territory is a territory, not a state. Therefore, the states rights argument does not pertain to this piece of legislation that we are looking to overturn. With regard to states, there is already the position under our constitution where, if both the Commonwealth and the states have jurisdiction to pass legislation, the Commonwealth legislation can prevail over state legislation. But this is not to be confused with the fact that we are talking about a law of the territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To me, the spectacle that we saw of the first man who was put to death, and the publicity that attended it, was horrendous. As is this morning's news that the son of the man who was put to death, who supported euthanasia at the time, has now changed his mind. The people who can never change their mind are the people who are put to death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a good article written by a Mr Delacey, a writer with an interest in liberal thought. His review of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bioethics in a Liberal Society</EMPHASIS> by Max Charlesworth has been published and he has written an article entitled `Euthanasia, Innocence and the Slippery Slope'. He argues, as I do, against legalising the killing of other people. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What are the grounds for thinking that voluntary euthanasia will start our descent upon a slippery slope to non&hyphen;voluntary and involuntary euthanasia? The short answer is `plenty'. Consider the first: the views of euthanasia lobbyists. Their efforts are presently directed at legalising voluntary euthanasia for people who are in advanced stages of terminal illness. But there are already signs that many of them will not be content to stop there. For example, many years ago, in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Practical Ethics</EMPHASIS> , Peter Singer argued on utilitarian grounds that there were circumstances in which it was right to kill certain types of people, for example, haemophiliac infants who were far from being close to death or desiring to be killed. His recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rethinking Life and Death</EMPHASIS>  shows that his views have changed little. In regarding a newborn infant&mdash;and these are Singer's words&mdash;as `not having the same right to life as a person', the cultures that practised infanticide were on solid ground. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7743">  </PARA>
<PARA>Singer has not become an isolated figure, a crank, for expressing such views. On the contrary, his standing has risen. Indeed, he stood as a candidate for the Greens in the last election. Where were those views put so that people could make a judgment about him?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing that makes a difference between that sort of society and the society which I want to see Australia remain is that it is in accord with the philosophy which to me is fundamental and which I follow. That is, the philosophy of individualism which means that every single solitary Australian matters, is valued and is valuable to the society. That includes the haemophiliac children whose life is precious to them and those who love them, but whom Dr Singer would put to death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The `slippery slope' is an emotional argument but it is also a sound one. In looking at the other side of the question&mdash;the emotional argument by those who see loved ones in pain in the final stages of a long and disturbing illness&mdash;I can feel nothing but compassion. I want there to be sound palliative care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own electorate we have strong committees that are raising money to ensure that we can have a hospice within our electorate. We have many elderly people in our electorate. Palliative care, hospice care is the sort of care that I want to see for people who are in those stages of illness where pain has to be monitored, where pain has to be taken into account but still that person can so often cling to life as having meaning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fairly recently I know of one man who had had a dreadful bout with cancer and was close to death. He had lost enormous amounts of weight and yet went out and bought new shirts and suits because what was left of his life he was going to live to the fullest despite his pain. Now those are emotive arguments. They come on both sides of the argument. But at the end of the day it is that philosophy that every individual matters, that every individual is valued and valuable that to me is the determining argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can never condone a law that will allow one human being to put another to death; for that same reason, I oppose capital punishment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to conclude with the words of someone whom I admire very much and that is Morris West. He talked about the privacy of the death bed. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No place should be more private than a death bed. No place should be more free from judicial surveillance and post-mortem inquisition or whatever relationships are active at that moment. The existing privacy and liberty of the terminal periods of human life will serve us better in the end than new prescriptions of law that will inevitably entail other demands and other prescriptions&mdash;what a state one day permits by law it may one day prescribe.</PARA>
<PARA>The slippery slope argument is a powerful one. The examples we saw of what happened in Germany in the 1930s should teach us a lesson. In my country every individual to me is valued and valuable and I don't want ever to see a law that cannot be overturned which allows one human being to put another human being to death.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you Mr Deputy Speaker. Events in recent days orchestrated by supporters of this bill aimed at shoring up support for the bill have only helped to show how important that Northern Territory legislation is. We are all aware that the son of the first person to die under the Northern Territory's Rights of the Terminally Ill Act has reversed his previous stand and come out in support of this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to reports in today's media, Mr Rod Dent took this stand so he could further his own career in the Liberal Party. He has even suggested there is a Liberal Party line on this bill which suggests those Liberals who are not supporting the Andrews bill are taking a brave stand which is perhaps jeopardising their own political careers. What a shameful episode this has been. The high moral ground some have taken on this issue has been undermined from beneath them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The entire aim of this bill is to give terminally ill patients the right to choose the end to their own lives. We are told that euthanasia is already practised illegally around Australia but at present it is not up to the patients to decide, it is in the hands of doctors and we can safely assume they are often pressured by relatives including patients' children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bob Dent's dying wish was for his son Rod to carry on the fight for this bill after his death yet Mr Dent junior has apparently ignored his father's dying wish to further his own political career.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, this episode has reinforced how important the Northern Territory's legislation is. We cannot trust other people to make our decisions for us. Terminally ill patients who are still of sound mind deserve to have the right to choose their own fate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill seeks to overturn the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act of the Northern Territory. This Northern Territory act is not the euthanasia act, as it has been described. Euthanasia suggests a deliberate act on the part of a person other than the person seeking escape from pain and suffering. I believe that any discussion of this issue should always refer to the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, for that is what should be under discussion in this debate. It is a subtle difference, perhaps, but an important one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An examination of the flow chart that has been provided to explain this Northern Territory act shows the checks and balances&mdash;almost two dozen of them&mdash;that protect the rights of the terminally ill and the medical staff associated with the requested death. Some of these checks include the following: is there any medical measure acceptable to the patient to effect a cure? Has an independent medical practitioner with special qualifications in the patient's terminal illness confirmed the existence of the illness and the prognosis? Has a qualified psychiatrist confirmed that the patient is not suffering from treatable clinical depression? Has the patient formally indicated that he or she wishes to end life? Have seven days elapsed since the patient formally indicated that he or she wished to end life? Further on in the process the questions are: have 48 hours elapsed since the certificate request was signed, and has the patient given any indication of not wanting to end life? Only after these checks and balances are addressed is the move taken to terminate life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like every other member of this House I have been besieged by letters and personal approaches from my electorate in recent months&mdash;in fact, from all over Australia. Some have been simple requests to support the bill. Some have been asking me to vote against the bill and protect the Northern Territory law to allow people to seek a release if that be their choice. Some have argued on state and territory rights issues. Some have been highly sophisticated <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7745"> submissions&mdash;complete with videotapes and audiotapes in several cases&mdash;with each one presenting a strong point of view one way or the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wrestled with these conflicting arguments. In fact, my own sister asked me to vote against any law that sanctions state controlled killing. My brother argues the opposite way: that this Northern Territory act does protect the rights of the terminally ill to seek death and that that is their right. But I strongly believe that this Northern Territory law is not about state sanctioned killing at all. In fact, by not legislating to protect the rights of the terminally ill, we are sanctioning the unofficial and illegal practices that go on today without any cover of law. This is not the state sanctioned killing of capital punishment or abortion on demand, as some would have us believe. In those cases the person involved has no say. I detest the concept of capital punishment, however strongly I might feel at the moment an horrific crime is perpetrated. I support abortion only when the life of the mother can be shown to be in jeopardy. Here, again, the professional discretion of the doctor is called upon to make a decision because the unborn child has no choice in the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, we are talking about a person who makes a choice with full knowledge of the consequences, assisted by caring professionals. Most of the letters and submissions opposing euthanasia have been argued from a Christian perspective: that no&hyphen;one has the power to take life; God giveth and God taketh away. I respect that belief but I do not agree with it. Nor do many Christians with whom I have spoken agree with it, including a man from Lithgow who recently nursed his wife through an agonising dying process as she constantly asked in the last weeks for the release she so urgently sought to meet her Maker, she believed. Why then, when one is so eager to escape this life to be with one's God, do we need to expect people to climb a barbed wire fence to get there if that not be their choice?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I declared my opposition to the Euthanasia Laws Bill and support for the Northern Territory legislation in September this year when requested by the local Catholic bishop to make my position known. I could have taken the political way out, I suppose, and voted against my conscience and supported this bill, or I could have abstained. But those would have been cowards' ways out. My electorate, according to the latest census, is 90 per cent declared Christian, so while the national polls may be showing 75 per cent support for euthanasia perhaps in Calare it is closer to fifty&hyphen;fifty, or maybe it is even in opposition to the Northern Territory bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I have argued and discussed it and written hundreds of letters explaining my position. I am pleased to say that the vast majority have either supported my position or disagreed with it, but have respected my making clear so early in this debate just what my feelings are. They know I have closely studied the available data; that I believe such a practice as euthanasia, rather than being subject only to medical regulation, as in the Netherlands, should be lifted from the realms of the hidden, the unofficial and illegal and given legislative status.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been polls of all sorts on the issue. Newspoll in July showed 75 per cent support for euthanasia. Of course, the polls can be questioned, but the polls have been very consistent for a decade. As a member of this House suggested, if you were to frame a referendum and ask, `Do you support the doctors can kill act?', the answer would be different. But, as I said earlier, this is not the doctors can kill act, it is the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act. A <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7746"> referendum asking `Do you support the right to request death if you were terminally ill?' would, I suggest, attract the same sort of support as the Newspoll.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of 2,000 doctors surveyed, 50 per cent said they would assist active euthanasia; 28 per cent admitted they had performed it. A more recent survey showed far less support, but that survey was taken amid the current passionate climate largely propelled by the churches and right to live organisations. That is their right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am most concerned about the tone of this debate and the tactics employed by some to get their message through. One submission to me was entitled `Putting people down'. That is a crude portrayal of what should be seen as the right of a person to seek a dignified death, one our medical profession provides in an undignified way by using techniques such as the increased morphine option, which still prolongs and eventually poisons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concerns have been expressed by the Aboriginal population in some quarters, particularly the Top End, about the Northern Territory law. Anyone knowing my background understands my long&hyphen;term understanding of and commitment to Aboriginal issues in this country, stemming back to my academic studies in the 1970s and my support for the Koori culture. I understand the Aboriginal spirituality as best a non&hyphen;Aboriginal can, and I propose to detail my views in the Native Title Amendment Bill debate, in which I will outline how traditional Aboriginal law and beliefs cannot be satisfactorily drafted into white man's law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I noted with concern the fears expressed in the Koori community about the euthanasia issue, and I question whether those who have stirred these concerns will be so outspoken in support of traditional Aboriginal spiritualism and the sacred nature of their land when the time comes to debate the Native Title Bill. It is incumbent upon us to educate the Aboriginal population that the legislation is the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue in this debate is states rights. We know the Northern Territory is not a state but now know how close even the Prime Minister concedes it is to statehood. To override the territory's independence is to make a mockery of self&hyphen;government. The Commonwealth does have a constitutional right to overturn this Northern Territory legislation, but it has no moral right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, a word on the role of the media in all this. It must be careful it does not portray the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act as a right to kill act. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak in favour of the bill of the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996. I will outline my reasons shortly. Firstly, I say that I am glad that the parliament has been given the opportunity to vote freely according to conscience. I would also like to thank all the people who rang me and wrote to me from around Australia for taking the time to tell me how they feel about this bill. Their contribution has assisted me with my own stance on euthanasia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that some constituents have been frustrated by the fact that this bill will be decided on a conscience vote. In one letter from a constituent, for example, I was asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Please explain the justice and even&hyphen;handedness of a conscience vote of a small group when the bill itself is aimed at destroying democratically enacted law having the approval of about four out of five Australians and providing only an option which those not in agreement may ignore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no room in a modern democracy for martyrdom. Surely the fate of St Thomas More and others tells us that. But it would be a retrograde step for democracy in this country if the principle of the conscience vote was excised from the parliamentary tradition. From time to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7747"> time, issues that go to the essence of what it is to be human come before this House. Employed sparingly and sensitively with tolerance from all sides, the conscience vote allows a community such as this parliament to reach a decision free from the constraints of partisanship and prejudice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most polls demonstrate clear majority support for the practice of euthanasia, but if majority support should automatically be responded to, then Australian parliaments should also support capital punishment, high levels of tariff protection and an end to Australia's immigration program. I do not support any of those things, and I do not believe that it is possible to support euthanasia after examining the legal, professional and ethical problems that it raises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no doubt that many of the proponents of euthanasia are motivated genuinely by compassion. Some may have witnessed a close friend or relative suffer a painful death, but I believe that what is needed for those who are terminally ill is better palliative care, knowing when to continue or not to continue treatment, and knowing when treatment is unwanted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the difficulties I have with the Northern Territory's Rights of the Terminally Ill Act is that the availability of palliative care services for most territorians is rudimentary at best, and so legalised euthanasia will make unnecessary deaths in the Northern Territory inevitable. Palliative care, used appropriately, can avoid the extreme solution, the absolute solution, the final solution of voluntary euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rod Dent, the son of the late Bob Dent who was the first man to die by legally sanctioned euthanasia, yesterday withdrew his support for the Northern Territory laws when he held a press conference with the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews). Rod Dent is reported as saying that he had changed his mind about the territory legislation after watching a video of his father. It was the son's belief that his father had resorted to euthanasia only after becoming very depressed at the state of palliative care in the medical system. Rod Dent was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have decided to support the Andrews Bill because I believe you cannot put in place laws for euthanasia where you do not have a decent palliative care system. I believe that the Northern Territory failed my father by not providing good medical care.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Brian Pollard has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a shameful parody to portray the modern dilemma about decisions regarding death as a grim choice between intolerable suffering, and its only real alternative of being killed, though one too often sees such a presentation.</PARA>
<PARA>In invoking the dedicated work of the pioneer of modern palliative care, Dame Cicely Saunders, Pollard summarises the components of good palliative care as including: control of physical symptoms; emotional support and communication; respecting the patient's wishes; teamwork; and the family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During my intern year I spent a month or two working in a hospice at one of Adelaide's teaching hospitals. Working with the dying and providing them with adequate palliative care is one of the most emotionally demanding areas in medicine. Having worked in that area, having got up in the middle of the night to certify deaths or to respond to the needs of those who are dying, the idea of physician&hyphen;assisted suicide in this sort of setting with the terminally ill is something that makes me deeply uncomfortable at my core.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recognise palliative care's limitations. Some people have suffering which cannot be relieved by palliative care. This suffering is more commonly emotional rather than physical, and I believe that allowing emotional distress to be a criterion for euthanasia opens the practice to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7748"> potential abuse which would be undetectable and uncontrollable. It is true that a right to die does exist but, as Dr Pollard wrote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia</EMPHASIS> in 1993:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An appeal to a right to die is perverted when it is intended to mean a right to be killed as in euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Our Western legal tradition provides justice for all and protection for the weakest. The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights declares that every human being has the inherent right to life. As the member for Menzies has pointed out, the Northern Territory statute removes this protection of the weak and actually selects them as the least protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Euthanasia differs from the withdrawal of active treatment in that in the former case death is the intention and death is inevitable. As Dr Pollard stated in the same article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia</EMPHASIS>, `Prescribing for death would be unlike any other medical action.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory act changes our concept of medical practice. Will the MIMS drug manual now record one of the clinical uses of thiopentone as being for killing patients? Would a euthanasia practitioner like Dr Nitschke be considered a specialist? Will a royal college of euthanasia practitioners be established? What training is required to perform euthanasia? Do these practitioners need medical insurance, if so, what level of medical insurance do they need? Do they require peer review?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On graduation from medical school I took, as was the tradition, the Geneva Declaration, which was a modified form of the Hippocratic oath. The declaration specifically proscribed medical killing. That declaration is not binding but it has the status of an ethical code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hilaire Belloc, who was a Liberal member of the House of Commons at the turn of the century, put it differently in verse when he quoted, of the medical profession in the Victorian era:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thou shalt not kill; but need'st not strive</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Officiously to keep alive.</PARA>
<PARA>Medical practice has nothing to do with killing people. Why do you need a doctor to kill? What skill is required there?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth looking at the experience of the Netherlands. Dutch statutes actually outlaw euthanasia but the interpretation of the courts has allowed, under certain conditions, doctors to kill their patients. It has been reported in Holland that the option of euthanasia has developed into an expectation and even an obligation. Even more worrying, due to the common practice of falsifying death certificates, nobody knows the real incidence of euthanasia in the Netherlands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1623, the poet John Donne stressed the necessity of acknowledging death as not just an event for the individual or the immediate family, but rather an event for the community. This is what he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankind</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.</PARA>
<PARA>The practice of euthanasia in the Northern Territory affects us all, it affects all Australians. I support the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you Mr Deputy Speaker. I rise to express my opposition to what has become known as the Andrews bill. As a member representing Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory I join with most territorial members and senators in opposing the bill. But I want to make it very clear that my opposition is not primarily about <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7749"> state or territory rights. I accept the clear constitutional right of the Commonwealth to act in this matter and if, for example, there was a bill in the territory for proposing capital punishment I would be prepared to support a bill overturning that. So I am not prepared to say that on the basis of the fundamental rights of the territory it is wrong that this matter be handled in this way. My concern is with the merits of the bill, not with the rights of the territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do wish to address some significant issues about territory rights and their relationship to state rights and the way the parliament is handling this matter, but I do not wish to use that as a cloak behind which I will hide. My opposition is based primarily on my concern and my views about active voluntarily euthanasia. On balance I have come to the view that I support active voluntary euthanasia and legislation properly constructed and properly determined by democratically elected parliaments to establish that right. I support that and I have told my constituents so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the previous speaker in this debate has had, I have had a number of letters from constituents on both sides of the debate, and I have felt an obligation to write back to them. Of course, it was very easy to write back to those who were writing to urge me to do what I intended to do anyway. It is always very easy to respond to such letters. But a substantial number of intelligent, concerned members of my constituency have written thoughtful letters expressing views opposite to those which I hold. I try to respond on every matter, but we all know the flow of correspondence we get. But it seemed to me that, in a matter as fundamental as this, a matter where the decision is an individual one for each member, it was particularly appropriate that I wrote back to my constituents, not only saying what I intended to do but also briefly saying why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those who wished to seek it in detail, I indicated that the way to see this would be by reading what I said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>; but in those letters I said that, as a general principle, my view is that informed adults should have the right to make the decision about ending their lives as a matter of free choice, in circumstances of great pain and suffering. I do not pretend that that was a comprehensive analysis of the philosophical issues associated with active voluntary euthanasia and with this bill, but it was intended to go to the core of the argument and to the core element in the debate, which has convinced me to take the course of action which I am taking, and I felt I should at least put to my constituents a clear indication of the nature of my thinking on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Always, when we address issues to do with legalisation and the provision of a legal framework for controversial matters which we all know are taking place in our society but about which many people have concerns, one argument which is put and which has validity is that it is better to have legislative safeguards around what is currently an informal practice exercised at the discretion, in this instance, of certain medical practitioners. The surveys indicate how prevalent the practice of active voluntary euthanasia is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that, if your view is that euthanasia is immoral or wrong, then the fact that it happens is not a satisfactory argument for the provision of a legislative framework; but, if you recognise&mdash;and some people do so more unequivocally than I on this matter&mdash;on balance, the legitimacy of the argument for active voluntary euthanasia, it is much better to have a transparent scheme with strong safeguards rather than to allow the current informal arrangements to continue.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7750">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the time available, let me turn to the four points that have particularly convinced me that I should support active voluntary euthanasia and therefore oppose this bill. The first point goes to the autonomy of the individual: a fundamental principle of liberal democracy that, as far as possible, the state should provide autonomy to the individual to determine his or her decisions with regard to their life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is the issue of equity of access. I do not have time, in the 10 minutes allowed me, to deal with this issue in the way I would like to, but I am concerned&mdash;in this, as in other debates&mdash;that, where we maintain the facade that something does not happen in our society, the wealthy and the powerful get access to proper medical assistance, whilst those who do not have the influence or the financial capacity to get access to this properly illegal exercise are disadvantaged. The argument has been put eloquently by others; I simply reiterate my concern because I do not have time to go into it in detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third point goes to the question of certainty, so that people can know their rights and not simply gain access to active voluntary euthanasia through good fortune because of the views of the doctor by whom they are being treated. The fourth point concerns empowerment and the transfer from doctors to patients of the power to make decisions with regard to this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to take some time to speak briefly about the territory rights issue to which I referred briefly initially. As I said at that time, I do not regard the territory rights question as paramount, but it is a significant subsidiary matter in dealing with this bill. I recognise the right of the Commonwealth to determine the form of self&hyphen;government, to legislate directly for that, and to set the parameters within which the territories govern themselves. I also recognise the right of the Commonwealth to legislate in any matter in the territory as specified in the constitution. But I think that it is not appropriate and not good practice for the Commonwealth, having given legislative authority to a territorial parliament, to seek to micro&hyphen;manage what has been transferred and to say, `We gave you the power to do this, but we don't like the way you have done it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have never been a great advocate of states rights, any more than I am now an advocate of territory rights. I have always been one with a greater concern about people's rights. It does stick in one's throat, however, to find many of the greatest advocates of states rights so enthusiastically supporting this piece of legislation when they know that the Commonwealth could not act in that way with regard to their states and almost certainly they would not support the Commonwealth doing so if it could. I find that hypocritical in the extreme, but I do not intend to take the opposite tack myself and, having recognised the right of the Commonwealth to override states where it has the constitutional right to do so, deny its right to do so with regard to the territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the legislation does have implications in the territories beyond its immediate intention. I am concerned about the uncertainty created and the implications for other areas of policy, such as the Medical Treatment Act 1994 of the ACT. My concern is that the objectives of the bill are wrong and that it is being poorly pursued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To sum up, I would like to refer to some comments made by a former Liberal senator, the then Senator Peter Baume, now Professor Peter Baume, who, in a recent Lionel Murphy Memorial Lecture, referred to the need for good quality palliative care to be available to all who require it, and acknowledged that it is not available at the present time. He went on to say:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7751">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The capacity to control symptoms, called palliative care, is progressing quickly. But even the best palliative care will not help everyone. There will be some people whose symptoms and distress continue, whose suffering is unrelieved, and who are condemned, as the law stands now, to suffer and to endure until they are lucky enough to die. . . There are occasions when people wish to die, when people have had enough, when people of sound mind wish to avoid a future which offers only suffering and grief. That we forbid an adequate response to every such person is an indictment upon us and upon our social arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>For those reasons, I oppose the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate an opportunity to place my sentiments on this matter on the public record. Like many of the other speakers and the previous speaker, I have received many letters on both sides of the debate which have caused me to wrestle with my own conscience. I think that I need to say from the outset that I support the bill based upon my philosophy and my opposition to euthanasia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that is not to say that I have not listened intently to the debate that has gone on around this place. It has been quite refreshing, actually, to listen to speakers who have different perspectives on this matter because there are, in fact, two principles that we have been wrestling with. One is an issue of conscience in respect to our individual positions on euthanasia, and the other is an important pillar, too, which is the perceived rights of one parliament to make its own law without interference from another parliament. I have listened intently to the contributions, particularly on the second of those matters, but my conclusion is to continue with my support of the bill on the principle of my opposition to euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the benefit of those people who have written to me, I would like to place on the public record my own experiences with close family members, close friends and their families as they have confronted the challenge of dying. There have been three occasions which have left a permanent impression on me about the challenge that people are confronted with, which we will all one day inevitably be confronted with, as to how we handle death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first of these occasions was the death of my brother&hyphen;in&hyphen;law, Mr Neville Chapman, who was a much loved member of our family. I have two natural brothers, but Neville was not just my sister's husband, he was, indeed, an additional brother. We cherish the memory of him. He had a terminal illness&mdash;a tumour&mdash;and, after several operations, he expressed the wish to pass on. It was a long and torturous time for our family, but on the night that Neville passed away we were all there&mdash;friends and family&mdash;and I would not have wanted to have been cheated from the experience of assisting Neville to go on to another world, as he referred to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was supported by nursing staff at home and he died in the comfort of his own home. On the night he died, 25 family and friends were gathered in the room. Neville was in and out of a coma, but when he was conscious he expressed his will to pass on. The day before that, he was quite upset. There was a member of our family that he had had a confrontation with and he expressed a desire to meet with her and settle the matter. That was done. We arranged that and, between the two of them, they resolved their conflict. Neville's conscience was appeased on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the doctor made his last attendances, I asked him, `How much longer?' He said, `I've just administered a massive dose of medication that to a normal person would be fatal, but he is comfortable and he is not in pain. I suggest that you all say goodbye.' We did that progressively, one by one.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the members of our group, somewhat reservedly, sat at the rear of the bedroom where Neville was. I said to him, `You need to say goodbye to Neville, he wants to go on.' Immediately upon his saying goodbye, Neville passed away. It was a beautiful experience for our whole family and one which we treasure. It was of great assistance to us in managing our own grief at the loss of someone we considered so precious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would not have wanted us to have been cheated of that opportunity as a family. As we shared together the experience, we were all confronted with what I think members of the parliament have been confronted with, which is the challenge of how we would have managed that situation if it were us lying there, helpless and dependent. This is really what confronts us all in terms of where we stand on the philosophical principle of allowing people to take their own lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second occasion was with my father, a man for whom I have great love. He was a stroke patient who spent the last two years of his life wrestling with his rehabilitation. He finally expressed the desire to die&mdash;he had had enough. I have heard many contributions on this topic along these lines where someone is lying there helplessly and they have had enough and want to pass on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, on one Saturday afternoon that I spent with my father in the nursing home where he was bedridden, he actually asked me if I could do it. It is a great shock to a son to have his father ask him to put him away. After I had recovered&mdash;I had to leave the room&mdash;I asked my father, `How would you suggest we did this, Dad?' He said, `Well, you could simply smother me, son. You have two brothers, but I am asking you because I know you would have the courage to do it.' Even in that situation, I said to my father, `Dad, do not be frightened of dying. It is an experience that we will all be here to share with you.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was able to make the contribution because of the previous experience with my brother-in&hyphen;law. We were all there again for the passing of my father&mdash;again, a precious experience that the family shared. On many occasions I asked my father, `Are you uncomfortable? Are you in pain?' and he always said, `No, I just wish it would hurry up.' I just want these expressions of sentiment on the public record because I do not think people are conscious of the fact that death is part of life's experience; it is part of a family's experience. As distressing as it can be, it can be a beautiful experience. Those two occasions I count as being the two most significant experiences of my own life. I know I will carry them to my own deathbed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember saying to my father&mdash;by this stage he was unconscious&mdash;he was wrestling and quite unsettled and I simply whispered in his ear and said, `Dad, just do as you are being instructed.' I do not know what a death experience will be, but clearly my father was being challenged in some way and I said, `Just do as you are instructed.' Within seconds he passed away. It was a precious and beautiful experience that I was there for his last challenge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third occasion was a good friend and mentor. On this occasion, cancer of the kidney and liver saw him substantially debilitated. Watching him pass through that demise with his family was very distressing. On many occasions I asked him&mdash;and I checked with the palliative care support&mdash;`Are you in pain?' and he said, `No, I'm just waiting quietly to pass on to a better world.' On that particular occasion, I stood more to the rear as that family went through the same experience that I had had myself. I think it is part of the management of grief for all of us. To be cheated of that and have that replaced by some clinical procedure I think denies the community and families the opportunity to share in the whole experience, and thereby equip themselves for when they confront the same challenge.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am supporting the bill. I regret that this causes me to forsake another principle which I hold dear, and that is the rights that are in our constitution of parliaments of the states. Even recognising that the Northern Territory is not yet a state, I know it does aspire to that position. I have to try and reconcile myself in terms of the significant impact this legislation in the Northern Territory has on the whole nation. I feel that the greater majority of the nation has been denied an opportunity to put its point of view. I believe that is what this parliament is doing as we debate this bill and I am therefore supporting it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is probably one of the most difficult debates that members of this House need to participate in but it is one that we have been presented with and therefore have to deal with. It is true to say&mdash;and I think everybody in this particular chamber and in the other chamber will agree&mdash;that, given the nature of the debate and given the lobbying that has gone on for every member since this debate has come up, probably every emotion that surrounds the question of euthanasia has been provoked in each of us. There has been a lot of evidence given by other members of personal experiences. I could do that as well but I am not going to. The reason I am not is that every other member of the population who needs to face this question does not have that ability and so I do not believe that I should.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have done my own straw polls in the community&mdash;at dinner tables and at community functions&mdash;and I have yet to find an overwhelming majority or, in fact, any majority that agrees that we should stop this bill. I have had people of the Catholic faith, and I am not Catholic, people of all faiths and people of no faith at all overwhelmingly say to me that they should have the ability to make their own choice in this particular decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to touch briefly on the position of the territory governments. I think I am a little unique in this place&mdash;certainly, I do not know of anyone else in the House&mdash;in that, until recently, I was a member of the ACT Legislative Assembly. As a member of the ACT assembly, I watched very carefully the evolution of self&hyphen;government. I know that Mr Andrews, in bringing this bill forward, is doing so within the rights of the constitution. However, he is only able to do so because it is a territory that has made this decision and not a state. Now, I find that very difficult. I find it a bit indulgent that he can do it because a territory has made the rule but if a state had made the rule he could not do it. If a state had made the rule, where would we be with this particular debate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have seen at very close hand the decisions that have been gone through within the ACT on self&hyphen;government. I understand very clearly the difficulties that our community has gone through, and is still going through, to a minor degree, in growing into self&hyphen;determination but I believe very strongly in that democratic process. It is interesting to note that this particular question of euthanasia, in a slightly different form, has twice come before the ACT Legislative Assembly in its very short life, since 1989. On both occasions, the ACT parliament determined to revoke that particular suggestion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has happened differently in the Northern Territory but, as with the ACT, we have seen the local democratic process evolve. As a previous member of that level of government in the ACT, I am compelled by my own belief in that process to enforce that process. I believe very much that the people of the ACT, through their government and their parliament, have a right to determine how they feel about this issue. As I have said, the ACT government has looked at it twice and refused it twice. The Northern Territory government has looked at it and it has adopted it. So be it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7754">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the question of euthanasia itself, I think it is a personal issue. It is personal to the point that I do not think I should stop others if they wish to adopt that view but I am not advocating it either. In fact, I do not know whether I would go down the track of euthanasia in my own instance. I think I would make up my mind on that question at the time I needed to but I think I should have the right to make that choice at that time. There are people in the community who are enormously opposed to euthanasia and there are people who very strongly support it. I do not think, as an individual parliamentarian, it is my right to stop people from having the choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is obvious that I am not coming from a religious background. I am coming from a purely human rights point of view, and that is that I am not going to impose my wishes on other people in my community. In an ideal world, people could be in a position to go down the path that was suggested by the previous speaker, but it is not an ideal world and there are people who may make the decision that they wish to take the euthanasia path. If they do, and they feel strongly and independently about that, I do not think I have the right to stand in their way and say, `Because of how I feel, you cannot do this.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know there are huge difficulties in trying to legislate for this sort of social policy. I understand all of those difficulties but I also think that, if we are going to have this debate, we have to be pretty honest about it, and I am not for one moment implying that other members are not being honest. I am being as honest as I can be in what I think is a very difficult situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a very strong supporter of the palliative care process. I belong to the local association, I have my own personal experience in relation to it, and I will continue to support the expenditure of funds, both government and non&hyphen;government, on those services; but I am not in a position where I believe that I can vote for the Andrews bill. I am going to vote against the bill, and I am going to do it for all of the reasons that I hope I have explained as well as I can here today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the democratic process of the two territory governments we have in this country, and you see that one has gone one way and one has gone the other, they have to be answerable to their own communities, and that is the way it ought to be, despite the fact that it is correct in terms of the constitution. But if we are going to give these people self&hyphen;determination, we have to allow them to do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, in relation to the personal issue, it is just that: personal. It is so personal that I refuse to stop those who wish to do it from doing it. By the same token, I am not advocating euthanasia for everybody. I am saying that, where people have strong opposition to it, they simply must understand that others have a strong view for it, and that we must therefore let the individual decide. If society in the two territories to date&mdash;but we are talking particularly about the Northern Territory&mdash;has made a decision through the democratic process that people have this right, then allow them to exercise it. For those in the community in the Northern Territory who do not wish to participate in the euthanasia process, fine; nobody is making them. But for those who wish to exercise their right under that legislation, we must allow them to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr MILES</EMPHASIS> (Braddon&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (11.17 a.m.)&mdash;I rise to state that I support the Euthanasia Laws Bill which is being brought in by Kevin Andrews. I want to make a few comments about it. I acknowledge the sensitivity of the member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) in talking about this. It is an issue of emotion and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7755"> complexity which requires all of us to really examine our role as members of parliament and also to reflect on the great diversity and range of emotions in regard to this whole issue, and to try to do that in a compassionate, sensitive way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is great that we have got a debate such as this, as it allows everybody to have a conscience discussion in this House, and it is refreshing to be able to have that opportunity in the parliament to talk about fundamental issues like this without the restraints of party discipline and so on, and for all of us to be able to express our views. I am not sure how many members have gone before those of us who are now speaking on this bill, but I wonder whether there is anything more to be said, really. But a responsibility which we have is to share our ideas on the floor of this House in regard to how we see the complexities of this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to begin by saying that, as a young boy, I grew up with an elderly grandfather, who was part of our family. In regard to this issue, my thoughts are certainly moulded by my life experiences of living with an elderly grandfather who was a great person to have in the house while I was just a boy growing up. When it comes to the issue of euthanasia, having the right, as provided for in the Northern Territory legislation, does create new pressures of possibilities on people as they go into that age and phase of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly would never have wanted, nor do I want, a situation where people who have poured out their heart and their love and their life for other people around them get to a stage where they feel that they are a burden and that if they moved on in life the family may be better off. They may be able to hand on assets or some financial reserves or something which they may have. They might feel that because of the pressures that just happen to exist on the family around them, the best thing for them would be to undertake the euthanasia option and therefore pass on. I think that that is a pressure that ought not ever be considered. No person as they come to that phase of life should ever have those thoughts become part of their thinking. That is one of the reasons for which I support this legislation brought in by Kevin Andrews.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is that the legalisation of euthanasia also introduces uncertainties into the clear prohibition of intentional killing, which is the foundation of all civil rights. When we talk about civil rights in our western traditions in the world, one of the things which is fundamental to that is that there should be no intentional killing. In actual fact, it does raise the question as to whether by having the right to die you actually undermine the right to live, as a concept. I have not explored that philosophically to any great extent but I suspect, in working through that issue, that if you do bring into the legal structures of our society the right to die, you are also taking away from it the concept of the right to live. I think that is an area which we need to explore a little more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, I think that people often give compassionate motives for speaking in favour of euthanasia. I think that is very genuine and I understand that and I can see that that is a valid point to put. It is very valid, I think. However, in a matter which is so individually complex as dying, it is impossible for anyone, including the sufferers themselves I might say, to determine artificially the balance of factors which would support the deliberate taking of life. Once you try to legalise these things, you would have to try to determine the balance of what you weigh up and what should be done and how this should be undertaken. Yet there is a huge diversity of emotions, of love and compassion, which is involved at this stage in life with people. Inevitably, what happens, because we try to work out how and under what restrictions this should happen, is it becomes an artificial sort of formula on how it should be able to be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7756"> undertaken. I do not think that that has the capacity to provide for the great diversity of circumstances that exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that we should weaken the clear existing legal prohibitions against deliberate killing. To do so will only increase the vulnerability, I believe, of the dying. Doctors do not now want, and must not be given the responsibility for, deliberately ending the life of a patient. To do so, I believe, would increase the power of the doctor over a patient to an extent that would distort the relationship between them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, on those points, it is not possible to secure limits to euthanasia. Once we start down that road I think it opens the door. Already there is a steady increase in reports of the practice in the Netherlands where the legal barriers to deliberate killing have been compromised, and I think we would find the same in our community if we did the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that our position in this parliament ought to be to oppose the situation in the Northern Territory and to support the Kevin Andrews bill. I go back again to the fact that for me, placing pressure on people, particularly as they get on in life, to start thinking of the options&mdash;that they would be better off passing on than actually staying&mdash;is totally untenable. I am sure that that would happen and it would be very unfavourable in our society and community. I think that our duty in these circumstances is to provide care and sustenance, socially and spiritually, at this stage for any of our brothers and sisters within our community, so that they are provided for and given the care that a person at that stage of life should have and should be able to expect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last thing I want to say is that I think this does open up the possibility that younger people, of 20 years of age or so, might say, `I am really depressed. I am having a lot of difficulties.' They might go to doctors and be able to get an option of taking their lives early. I do not think that we should be opening it up in that sort of sense at all. That would be a real concern to me. People are often very stable, but if sometimes they start to show that they are depressed&mdash;it might only be for a month or two&mdash;this also opens up the possibility that not only could it happen with elderly folk, but also it could become an option for a younger person. A younger person might say, `I am happy that I have lived for 20 years. I now want to take my own life.' I think that that would be tragic. I support the bill brought into the House by Kevin Andrews.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This issue before us today is a matter of deep conscience to all members of the parliament and, I think, to any decent human being who gives it any more than cursory thought. Every member of the parliament has listened to the views expressed not just here in the parliament, but throughout the Australian community. I have listened carefully to the debate. I know some members have referred to opinion polls as a basis upon which they think the matter should be determined. Others have referred to the constituent mail and the contact they have had. Some claim to be casting a vote which reflects the majority view of their electorates. I do not think that anyone can genuinely know the actual views of the 82,000 or so constituents in their electorate on a matter of such intense personal feeling. At the end of the day, I think that we have to vote as our consciences dictate. That is exactly what I will be doing. I do not pretend to be able to represent anyone else's conscience in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also wish to place on the record that the question of the states or the territories rights does not move me in this debate. Human rights are far more important and, as other speakers have indicated, I would be quite happy to exercise a vote to overturn state or territory laws that I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7757"> felt strongly about. This bill and the Northern Territory legislation means what it says&mdash;the thin end of the wedge argument also does not move me. People who have claimed the Northern Territory legislation produces outcomes that it does not, do not do their cause any good whatsoever. It does nothing of the sort and, were it to be so, I think that you would find a unanimous attitude within the federal parliament. So those who have adopted a scare campaign approach to this have done themselves and their cause no good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn now to the substance of the issue, which is voluntary euthanasia. The active intervention by doctors to end the life of terminally ill patients who are suffering extreme physical and mental pain has been practised in Australia for years. Doctors have publicly admitted that the practice exists. This has been so without the Northern Territory legislation and it would continue to be so if the Northern Territory legislation were struck down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is, therefore, not about whether there will be active euthanasia. It is about whether there should be some rules laid down by the community about the circumstances in which it is legal, and whether there should be safeguards and rights for those contemplating euthanasia. Indeed, it seems to me that the Northern Territory laws make the unauthorised euthanasia practised by one doctor in isolation from other medical practitioners less likely, rather than more likely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As have many others, I have watched as family members or close friends have suffered the agony associated with some terminal illnesses. One person underwent an operation for a brain tumour, resulting in her being a bed&hyphen;bound vegetable with virtually no motor control and deteriorating general health. After some months, her very loving husband told close relatives in the family that they might like to call around one afternoon because the family doctor&mdash;who was himself a very close family friend and was a regular at family Christmas lunches and New Year functions&mdash;would be calling the next day. That next day was the last day of her life. That was about 35 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another was a person who, after years of pain and illness, relied on regular blood transfusions and hospital visits to stay alive. I well recall him asking me recently to accompany him to his doctor so that he could have his new will completed. He rejected his scheduled blood transfusion and instead went away for a few days to the Sunshine Coast. He became ill at the beach, away from his family and away from his doctor, and he did not recover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Northern Territory laws were available to such people, would they have used them? Probably; but who really knows? Should I now vote to deny others in these or similar circumstances the opportunity to choose a dignified way to seek medical help to end their life, subject to the safeguards that are contained in the Northern Territory laws? My answer to that is no. The Northern Territory law provides for three doctors, including a psychiatrist, to agree on the appropriateness of euthanasia in every case. It provides for waiting periods. It provides for informed consent. And it only applies in the Northern Territory. People in any other part of Australia are not subject to any part of the law. You would have to shift to the Northern Territory if you wished to avail yourself of the voluntary euthanasia law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the course of the debate, both in the parliament and in the community, I have heard fears and claims of what it could do to young people and to people who, without their knowledge, would be victims of `involuntary' euthanasia. There is a view in the community that, because the national parliament is discussing this, it will have national implications: that is, that there will be a national voluntary euthanasia code. That is simply not the case. None of those things apply. The legislation does not affect the people in the state of Queensland <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7758"> as a law, nor does it affect the people in any other part of the country outside the Northern Territory. The bill is not legislating nationally for the availability of voluntary euthanasia. This debate is a consideration of whether the Northern Territory legislation should be allowed to stand, or whether we should exercise our power and rights as a national parliament to overturn those laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to recognise that doctors themselves have expressed strong concerns about participating in euthanasia. I fully understand that view and I support the right of any doctor to refuse to be involved in any aspect of voluntary euthanasia. That is a very proper exercise of their conscience, and there is nothing that I know of that would force them to do otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot has been said about the circumstances of what I understand to be the only legal act of euthanasia that has been committed, the case of Bob Dent. I do not wish to traverse the events of the last 24 hours. But I do want to remind the House and to place on the record some of the comments that Bob Dent made when he wrote the letter which he sought to make public. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is now a constant fear of a fall, which could cause terrible injury to my fragile bones. I cannot even get a hug, in case my ribs crack.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">My own pain is made worse by watching my wife suffering as she cares for me: bathing and drying me, cleaning up after my `accidents' in the middle of the night and watching my body fade away. If I were to keep a pet animal in the same condition I am in, I would be prosecuted.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>That has raised, quite properly, the matter of palliative care. Irrespective of one's view on the question of voluntary euthanasia or this bill before the parliament, all members would support improved palliative care services. Irrespective of the outcome of the vote on this matter, I do hope that one of the positive outcomes of this debate is that there will be, across all parties, a commitment to see an increase in palliative care services, their availability and the quality of palliative care. I believe that the current budget actually reduces the funding to palliative care. I do not want to make a point about that, but I do think that arising out of this may come a focus on the community obligation to palliative care, which probably has not been given the priority it deserves over the years. It is something that I would urge all members of parliament in all parties to take up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly has twice considered this law. There is a clear will of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly to have voluntary euthanasia available to their citizens. I believe they have carefully considered these issues which are before us today. They have arrived at a conclusion which I believe is a reasonable one. I will not vote to overturn their law. I will be voting against this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have chosen to speak today in support of the private member's bill introduced by Mr Andrews, the member for Menzies. Its purpose is to overturn what I consider to be an unrepresentative law which affects all Australians and was recently passed by the Northern Territory legislature.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is amongst the most important legislation to come before the parliament during this government's tenure and I am aware of the many arguments put on both sides of the debate. But, in particular, I must say that I am appalled that the government has chosen to reduce the standing of this bill by referring it to this Main Committee. As stated before, I am utterly opposed to being pushed into the Main Committee to conduct a debate on behalf of my <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7759"> constituents on one of the most controversial pieces of legislation to come before this parliament this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now that I am able to participate and contribute, I want to make it perfectly clear from the start that I do not think that anyone can do better than to start from the same place that the member for Menzies did by identifying the key falsehoods being spread in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, this is not a debate about state or territory rights. This is not a debate about the separation of church and state, nor about imposing religious values on others. This is not about regulating current practice and this is not a simple issue of personal autonomy. This is plainly and simply about whether or not the government should have the authority to legislate for the death of its own citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people like to believe that this is legislation that gives terminally ill people the right to choose a swift and dignified end and that it can be managed by legislation. All we need to do is provide a set of adequate controls and everything will be all right. This is just not true and I intend, today, to concentrate my part of this debate speaking to this fallacy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I do, I would just like to spend a couple of minutes spelling out the key untruths that some commentators have said euthanasia is about. The first is about state or territory rights. It has been stated that territories, by their nature, do not have rights in this issue, but rather obligations. The constitution is quite clear on their position. Good government in this country does not allow us to be selective about which parts of the constitution we wish to follow. Even if it did, this is a law that does not just affect territorians and cannot be left to territorians and their government alone. All Australians who meet the criteria of the territorial law can apply. It is a law that has been passed by a small majority of a small legislature. It is not representative of the nation's view, otherwise similar legislation would be either debated or enacted in all parts of the states and territories of the Commonwealth of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the people of the Northern Territory are deemed to have such an informed and important electoral voice in this nation then I ask the question that should be put to the other premiers that supported the Northern Territory Chief Minister: why do they not allow the Northern Territory to become a state and give them the full representation in the Senate that statehood would give them? Of course they will not do that and they have dragged their heels on this matter for a long time. I have not heard yet that this ought to take place as part of this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not about the separation of church and state, nor about imposing religious values on others. There are many who find it convenient to criticise people who oppose euthanasia as being dominated by the church and trying to impose religious views on others. I find this cynical and dishonest, as many of the same critics are prepared to leave care for the sick, the homeless and the disabled to the same churches who minister, aid, support and provide counselling to many in need. It is illogical that the church should then be denied a voice in life and death issues that face people who rely on them for care. The fact is that the church represents a constituency which has a legitimate right to raise a voice which in any case, in this particular instance, is supported by many non&hyphen;religious people who have raised similar concerns regarding this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This territorial law devalues people and can make them feel as if they are a burden. It can promote a suicide mentality which must be worrisome for a country that has one of the highest youth suicide levels in the developed world and, I might add, that in the case of senior citizens has a suicide rate for male persons twice that of female persons. This is not about regulating current practice; what currently goes on will continue. People will be able to choose not to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7760"> receive treatment that will prolong life, and suggesting that it will not is just a fallacy. It is a fundamental human right to reject medical attention. There is no obligation on anybody to accept medical attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Suggesting current practice is not adequate to meet a patient's needs is avoiding the truth. Switching off life support or continuing palliative care will continue to be a choice. This law does not mean that people living outside the Northern Territory will no longer be able to access treatments available. So why must we accept changes to the laws there? This is not a simple issue of personal autonomy. This is an area where most people can identify with the feeling that there is a right of choice&mdash;and one of the most fundamental. Pro&hyphen;choice has been a label and a symbol applied also in the abortion debate, but in that case the choice is not made by the life about to be extinguished. In this debate, however, all life must be regarded as fundamentally precious, as is not the case in the other debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned that this belief in the right of choice is one of the least understood. People who qualify for euthanasia under the Northern Territory act will be under enormous stress and quite significant external influences. Men and women who know that their lifetimes will have shortened, finite limits may feel that there is no reason to prolong the inevitable. This may be emphasised by physical pain, reduced control of bodily functions, or simply feeling that they have become a burden to others. Human nature is such that a decision on one day of depression can easily be the opposite of one made on another day. The safeguards put in place by the Territory's legislation are totally inadequate to protect in these circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I fear that, if euthanasia were to become a commonplace thing, for some people the decision to die would almost be viewed as a duty. I put it to some of the people who perhaps support the user&hyphen;pays concept as part of public policy: think carefully. We have a system where we provide fair assistance to those who need it&mdash;and that ranges all the way to quite old age. Once you apply a regime where some people are considered to be less important than others in terms of their lives, the next step along the track is to start to make the same distinguishing policy decisions in relation to their rights to receive medical attention, medical resources or, for that matter, the other ranges of resources we extend to them by virtue of our system of fair and equal treatment of all citizens in this country. If that happens, people in that position may well, in the future, come to be seen as having a less important requirement for these resources or for care to be extended to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make one observation in the very brief opportunity I have in 10 minutes in this place. Consider carefully this: we have a system of health insurance, both public and private, that is community rated&mdash;in other words, there is no risk rating. It is not a quantum leap in logic to suggest that, once you accept that euthanasia is a commonplace part of our society, one of the first things that will be challenged in the long run on the question of resource allocation will be community rating of health insurance. In my view, that will be a black day, and I believe that the Northern Territory legislation is pushing us towards that inevitable destination where we consider some people as being less important than others in terms of their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The territory safeguards are totally inadequate. Without a positive request from a patient made at a moment before execution of the euthanasia process, we slide into a situation of proxy permission being given for people to be killed with the permission of the state. In the remaining time I have, I just want to emphasise this particular point. We have seen already a situation where a lady in an unfortunate position in Tasmania is applying to avail herself <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7761"> of the Northern Territory's legislation. She is, I believe, a quadriplegic. In this particular instance, she feels that her quality of life is so diminished that she wishes to end her life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This then brings us into the whole question of how these safeguards will apply. What age limit, for instance, will be considered to be the minimum? What, for instance, is going to be the situation in relation to unsoundness of mind? To be unsound of mind in a traditional legal sense has meant that a person would need to be so severely affected by mental illness, or a similar factor, as to be incapable of managing his or her own financial personal affairs. I understand that in the Netherlands, for instance, there have been instances where euthanasia has been made available to those who are in such an unsound state of mind because of their financial and other pressures in relation to their day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would just like to reiterate the outrage I feel at being obliged to speak for only 10 minutes in this secondary chamber on such an important piece of legislation. It is a disgrace, and I would like to urge government members to consider this. Here I am, 10 minutes have expired in such a short time. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that many in this place will, of course, have a very clear&hyphen;cut view of where they stand on this issue. But I think there are a great number of us who have not found it an easy decision, and have not always found a number of the issues particularly clear. The arguments have often been clouded by suggestions about states rights and political concerns, and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just a social issue that we are addressing. It is for many a very personal debate as well. There has been a lot of emotional and emotive argument, and I think that it is one that people find it very hard to be objective about, quite frankly, because we are all, of course, conditioned by our past experiences&mdash;and sometimes by very deep personal experiences&mdash;in this whole area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that it is a decision that no member of this parliament is taking lightly or easily because, apart from being conscious of the issue per se, many members have been aware of the pressures within their constituency and that, whatever they do, they are going to upset a lot of people one way or the other. The decision we take now, it seems to me, is one that is very similar to the choice that the doctors will make under the Northern Territory legislation when they make that actual decision to assist someone to die. If we vote for euthanasia, we are indirectly assisting that process, and if we vote no, we are denying people that option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like most other members, I suspect, I have received a lot of lobbying on this issue. I have had a lot of letters and correspondence; very few, I would have to say, from within my own electorate. The vast majority, by a factor of 10 or 20 to one, have come from outside my electorate. Those from within my electorate have been a mere couple of handfuls, to be honest. But I have talked with a lot of people around my electorate and I have found that, when talking to people, there seems to be a different view from the quite obviously orchestrated letter writing campaigns. Like many other members, I have read lengthy tomes on the arguments on both sides. I have read articles, I have listened to Marshall Perron, and I have talked with Kevin Andrews and others. I have been lobbied personally, and sometimes there have been some very personal and heart&hyphen;rending letters, both for and against euthanasia. I have also had some pretty strident and graphically threatening letters about how I should vote and I have even been accused that, if I vote the wrong way, I would have blood on my hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The churches, of course, have been very active and opinion polls have been talked about by many. It seems to me that the problem with the opinion polls, although they are fairly clear&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7762"> cut as I read them, is that, firstly, you have got to get the question right and, secondly, and probably more importantly, before the general population can answer an opinion poll they need to actually understand what they are talking about in terms of what is euthanasia. I think a lot of people confuse euthanasia with just turning off life support systems, which is not what we are talking about today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make a couple of points very clear. It is a pity the previous speaker, the member for Moore (Mr Filing) has departed, because I would agree with him to the extent that I think this should have been a debate that took place in the main chamber. I think we all should have had equal time. In this debate, above all, nobody speaks as a minister. We all speak as private members; we should have all been treated equally, in my view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I will deal with another issue, as well, in terms of states rights. I notice that present in the chamber is the honourable gentleman from the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas). I have to say to him&mdash;and others who have the view&mdash;that I do not believe that states rights is an issue that clouds my judgment on this particular issue. Clearly, the territory is a territory and the Commonwealth has the right to overturn legislation of the territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, frankly, even if you take the view that the territory is almost a state, it seems to me that there are occasions when the national parliament must take a national stand on some issues. My judgment today is not based in any way on the states rights issue and I have to make that very clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say also, though, that from the beginning I have leaned towards supporting euthanasia, but I have had concerns about the safeguards. Once the principle has been accepted, or become law, then of course it can be open to misuse and that is a concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this bill, the Andrews bill, is passed&mdash;and we all know, of course, that euthanasia is practised covertly&mdash;what happens to the doctors who are currently covertly assisting people to die? Do they suddenly stop doing that? I very much doubt it. Much has been said about Holland and abuses. I do not understand why, if it is so terrible in that country, that country continues to practise it. There have been many extrapolations about abortion and I am not going to get into that today. We have been regaled from both sides of the argument with all sorts of information about safeguards and there is the Dondas chart, which I was appreciative of reading and working my way through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard arguments about pressures on the elderly. Experience tells me that, whatever we do in terms of legislation, it is hard to legislate perfectly. My own experience is largely conditioned, obviously, by personal experience. My mother died of cancer a couple of years ago; she received outstanding hospice care&mdash;outstanding palliative care. It was overseas but, nevertheless, it was outstanding care and I am not suggesting that she in any way would have sought euthanasia under the legislation we are talking about. But it is not always available and then, of course, it is not always enough and I understand that the Northern Territory has, in fact, upgraded its palliative care program significantly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Euthanasia is happening now and it seems to me that we need to bring the matter under control. Let us be clear: voluntary euthanasia is not about turning off life support systems; it is a very conscious and deliberate act. We are talking about the deliberate act of a person to take a decision about themselves for themselves. And the bottom line, for me, is a matter of choice and the right to die with dignity. If someone gets to the point of losing all human dignity and the brain may be functioning fine but the bodily functions are not, then I believe <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7763"> that in those limited cases there needs to be a legal option. I simply do not see that a person in that situation must have the standards of others imposed upon them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of all the material that has crossed my desk there are two brief extracts that sum up where my thinking is. One is from Peter Baume who says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let us agree that the question is one of how we are to die. Palliative care should be available for all who need it. Its practitioners are doing more clever things and will continue to improve what they are doing year by year. But even the best palliative care will not solve all of the problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let us regulate and control voluntary euthanasia rather than leaving it illegal and uncontrolled as it is now. It is at present an activity totally unregulated. One disturbing effect of present arrangements is that the powerful and the wealthy are more able to get access today than are the powerless and the poor. But finally, and most importantly, let us recognise the rights of people to make victimless decisions about themselves, for themselves, and then let us ensure that only those considered views are acted upon.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Another view that has certainly coloured my thinking is from Tony Staley, the President of the Liberal Party, a man who suffered appalling bodily damage in a car accident and who has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do believe it needs to be carefully constrained by proper procedure to ensure that those who express the desire are absolutely firm in purpose. But for people in that situation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and he is talking about those who really have no other option&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it is the last and great human right for them.</PARA>
<PARA>One of my branch members, a constituent, wrote to me recently to say that they were appalled by the fact that the Liberal Party, and members of the party, should be going down the route of trying to stop euthanasia. My constituent said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it beggars understanding that a Party which espouses as its core philosophy the right of the individual should run around in circles finding the most specious of arguments to deny the ultimate right to the individual, especially those who find themselves in circumstances beyond their control and without hope.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have no doubt the cumulative MP conscience is being balmed by the view that it is not necessary for them to take a stand because euthanasia is already happening and no one is really suffering. It is so that it happens&mdash;it is not so that there is no suffering. Levels of pain or ability to cope with it is known only to the individual and cannot be generalised or understood by anyone else.</PARA>
<PARA>After much agonising and, I have to say, some doubt, it is my personal decision to support the pro&hyphen;choice view. Therefore, I will vote against the bill introduced by the member for Menzies because, ultimately, I believe people should have the right to choose to die with dignity if they wish.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(11.57 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say from the beginning that, prior to the recent raising of the issue of the Northern Territory euthanasia legislation in this House, on a scale of critical issues, as I saw it, moral issues such as euthanasia rated pretty low in my priorities. It is not that I am insensitive or uncaring, but I have never really had to deal with the issue on a personal level and I therefore had no really strong feelings one way or the other. As you may be well aware, I am very much a new member of this House. I guess you could call me a member of the Class of `96. I am not only a new member but I also admit that I am very new to politics. If you had asked me two years ago if I would be interested in a career in politics, I can assure you the response would have been a firm `no'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What changed my point of view was, in all honesty, nothing to do with how the government of the day was dealing with moral issues, but what I saw as its dismal performance on issues such as economics, unemployment and industrial relations, and its failure to address the needs of families, the elderly, our youth and small business. I was also very angry at the way our <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7764"> grassroots Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were being treated, the abuse of the people of Cape York generally, and the inequities and divisiveness of our current native title legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those were the reasons I decided to walk away from a very successful career in private enterprise and take the advice of a dear old friend who had said one evening, after a very unsuccessful and frustrating meeting with the then local federal member in the Cape York town of Coen, `If you want a change of attitude, change the government.' This was after I had expressed my total despair at where I thought we, as a nation, were heading. Well, here I am. We have had a change of government and, undoubtedly, a change of attitude. I am very much prepared to fight for the changes that I feel we need to improve the quality of life and security for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point I am not prepared to go down the track of attempting to right all the perceived moral issues of this nation. Like the previous speaker, the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), I have been absolutely bombarded with letters, with individual representations and by lobby groups from both extremes of the argument. Most of them, I have to say, have come from outside my electorate. There is a pro&hyphen;euthanasia organisation in my electorate and also a right to life organisation. But most of the lobbying has come from outside the electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also have to say that I have seen some dreadfully sad examples of how people have been desperately wanting or needing to depart this world and they have given me some very strong arguments as to why they should. Equally, I have had arguments from people who have come up with examples of where people could have taken an easy option&mdash;and possibly would have taken it if it had been available to them&mdash;but at the end of the day there had been quite pleasant and miraculous results. It was very difficult to say that one side had come up with stronger arguments than the other&mdash;I think both of them were very strong. So, at the end of all of this, I am certainly more informed on the subject, but, in spite of intense lobbying, I want to remain focused on why I intended to come into this House in the first instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking quickly at the Northern Territory euthanasia law, I say to you that I have some concerns with regard to it. As an individual, I do not know whether I would be prepared to avail myself of it. If it were an option that I had to consider in my own state of Queensland, I would have very serious reservations about supporting that legislation. If it were a national issue, again I would have to look at it on its merits at the time and I would have very serious reservations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are arguments here that the word `territory' means that it is not a state. I suppose that technically that is correct. But I think the reality is that we have a government democratically elected by the majority of the Northern Territory people. As I understand it, when the decision was made to put this bill through in the Northern Territory they voted on it not once but twice, and it clearly reflected the view of the majority of the people in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Something I hold very dear that is very important and that we, as politicians or legislators, must always remember is that we are here in this House as representatives of the people and it is our responsibility to reflect the views of the people&mdash;we are to enact legislation that reflects the needs and the aspirations of the people. We have state and territory governments that are separate from our national houses. The Northern Territory people have spoken quite clearly on this; they have made a decision that this is what they want, and their government has legislated to fulfil that requirement.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7765">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that if there is a major problem with that legislation, then the Northern Territory people have the avenues available to them to stop it at the next election. They can vote their government out as quickly as they voted it in if they make that decision and that is the route they wish to take&mdash;that is something that they have to choose to do. As a national government, if we start interfering with the decisions that are made by democratically elected state or territory governments, we run the real risk at the end of the day of having to ask: where do we go to next? The ACT has legislation on marijuana laws and a whole range of other things that are totally unacceptable in my state. Do we come in here and tell the ACT that we are going to override that legislation? Are we going to start dealing next year with capital punishment in legislation? In the meantime, we start to go down the gurgler from an economic point of view. I think that we have a responsibility to the whole range of issues that we were put into government to deal with and I continue to focus on those. As a government, we need to make sure that we maintain those priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The big problem in the Northern Territory was not that we suddenly had a group of Australians that were mad keen on killing off their elderly, sick or infirm; quite the contrary. I think we may well have had a situation where palliative care was not seen as a high priority and, as a consequence, there were a lot of people who were suffering unnecessarily. I think that we, as a government, need to look at addressing that. It is all very well to provide the best of palliative care in the urban areas of Australia, but we must not forget that there are also very large populations living in rural and remote areas of Australia who suffer equally and I feel we need to start to focus on these areas. I think this will very much be a deterrent for people wanting to take this option of voluntary euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be focusing my interests on the palliative care side of things, in the hope that we can discourage anybody else from enacting this type of legislation. The decision that is being made in the Northern Territory is on the conscience of the citizens of the Northern Territory and if they, in any way, feel that it is not working or it is inappropriate, they certainly have the ability to change the legislation or to replace their government with one with a different point of view. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr BILLSON</EMPHASIS> (Dunkley) (12.07 p.m.) Firstly, I acknowledge the presence of my parliamentary colleagues, particularly the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) for being fulsome and energetic in his provision of information. I thank him for that. I am of a mind to support the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996. There is a certain irony to matters of conscience in this place. Someone else determines when your conscience is to be on exhibition. This has not been an easy matter for me. I have not retreated from the debate, nor sought the easy comfort of viewing this matter simply as a single dimension states rights issue, or a moral conviction or personal liberty question. For me it is a complex mix of all of these considerations and many more, no doubt coloured by my own personal experiences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is naive for the proponents of the Northern Territory legislation to claim that the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act is a matter solely for territorians. The act has consequences far beyond the territory boundaries. The federal parliament has the power to enact overriding legislation, as the territory legislature is a creation of the Commonwealth's self&hyphen;government legislation. Notwithstanding this fact, I would have preferred standing here today to debate a proactive Commonwealth position rather than something that reacts to the actions of another legislature.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7766">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I genuinely believe that every member who has spoken on this bill speaks with a heart full of compassion. No side of this debate can claim, in my view, a greater care or concern for the well&hyphen;being of fellow Australians. Having apprised myself of available material, listened carefully to and sought opinion on this matter, my response to the more than 100 people who have written to me about this subject outlines my thinking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One person, a friend and a significant contributor of time and energy to my election on 2 March, chose to respond to my written advice. While he agreed to disagree with my conclusion, my approach was accepted as thoughtful, considered and informed. It was the approach of a legislator. My inquiries and deliberations centred on three core questions. What is the public policy imperative of the Northern Territory law? What is the problem it is trying to solve for the betterment of the community? Is the response likely to achieve these goals?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My qualified general support for the Andrews bill comes out of the fact that the Northern Territory act seeks to solve a problem that does not exist. More precisely, I believe that, in seeking to solve a non&hyphen;existent problem, the Northern Territory legislation actually creates new real problems that are of far greater concern than the issues that the Northern Territory legislature sought to address in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At common law, a competent adult can refuse medical treatment, and treatment of a patient against the wishes of the patient constitutes the tort of trespass. In my home state of Victoria, and also in South Australia, laws permit passive voluntary euthanasia where parents can deny or instruct the withdrawal of medical treatment, and death results. Not one Australian medical practitioner has been prosecuted for administering a palliative care or pain management regime&mdash;to deal with patient pain and suffering&mdash;which hastens death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put my public policy questions, framed in the light of reported accounts of what the current reality is, to the Northern Territory act's proponent. He responded that the public policy imperative was solely equity, in the belief that worse&hyphen;off people are denied the choices and support which better&hyphen;off people have access to. Having thought about this perspective, I rejected it. All the advice, experiences, choices and information which I have drawn from and have contemplated are available to every citizen of Dunkley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bulk&hyphen;billing doctors who are a part of the Mornington Peninsula division of general practice, our excellent local hospice service, palliative care experts, carers themselves and support service providers are all part of the safety net of support services of our community. The procedures contained in the Northern Territory legislation are likely to reduce the options available to the terminally ill patient for the management of their own suffering. The obligations on medical and psychological practitioners to publicly sign off on a competent individual's decision to end their own life is not welcomed by most practitioners, because of the professional implications. The link between terminal illness and depression is widely published.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Protecting the frail and vulnerable from coercive external influences is a matter not sufficiently addressed by the Northern Territory act. This matter, above all, was the subject of the most moving commentary in the letters I have received. Some frail, ill and elderly people confided in me that they already felt that they were a burden and a nuisance to loved ones. I am not convinced that you can legislate for compassion, care, sensitivity and safety on such personal issues, which each have their own circumstances and unique considerations. I believe that choices about the management of the suffering associated with terminal illness <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7767"> are essentially a private matter, with the role of government being the provision of appropriate and professional palliative care to support personal choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Individuals exercise their choices, guided by their own trusted medical practitioners and advisers, and before their own conscience, their own family and their own God, if they have one, and as they believe appropriate. This was the case before the Northern Territory legislation and, hopefully, will again be the situation if the Andrews bill passes through both houses of parliament. While I stop short of commending the bill to other members of this House, because of the reservations I have mentioned earlier, it is my intention to support it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I notice that, of recent times, it is in order to change one's mind on the position one takes in regard to the matter of terminating one's life. I must say that I find this debate on the Euthanasia Laws Bill unhappy and unnecessary but, nevertheless, extremely difficult, as has been the comment of many people in the process of past weeks. In making a decision as to which way I came down, as a famous duke once said, I found it a `near&hyphen;run thing'. Nevertheless, I can make that decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many aspects which have been covered by other members in this chamber, and I would like to make a few points. On almost every one of these points, my decision one way or another has been at the margin. In the end, I do not believe that, where there is chronic and insufferable physical or mental pain or where a person knows they are losing their mental capabilities (as is the case in various forms of dementia, and I have had reason in recent weeks to see somebody quite close to my family be in the situation of writing himself notes every day to remind himself of his name) people should not be allowed to show some sort of control over what would perhaps be their final act, before either passing into insensibility, perhaps for months or years, or otherwise living in circumstances of extreme or even unbearable pain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the situation about palliative care, and I understand that there is absolutely no doubt that some medical practitioners know for a fact that, if administered for long enough and at high enough levels, certain practices will finish in death; and I have no problem whatsoever with that. But, in the rare case&mdash;and I think it really is a rare case&mdash;that some people want to end their lives, then, on the margin, they should not be prevented from doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say that in the light of the many conditions that were put in place under the Northern Territory bill. How many times have we heard of, or known of, people who, having had a marvellous life, perhaps in extreme old age&mdash;and more people are living to extreme old age these days than did before&mdash;are now totally immobile and in deteriorating physical or mental circumstances, and who say that they wish that they could go to sleep and not wake up in the morning? But some of us are going to say, `All of those circumstances could be there; but I, from my position, am going to say to you that you do not have that choice available to you.' In general, we are saying today that, in a relatively free society, all through your life the one thing we want to give you, wherever we possibly can, is choice. Yet this final choice is going to be denied, perhaps because of people's religious beliefs. Perhaps because of my religious belief, am I to say, `I am telling you that you are not allowed by law to have a dignified exit'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the short time we have in this debate, I would say that the essence of the argument in favour of being able to terminate your own life is really a matter of choice in extreme circumstances. The argument against euthanasia seems to form around two particular matters: one with a basis in religion, and the second in concern about potential abuses; and I notice <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7768"> that Holland seems to be much quoted. I am not aware of abuses in Holland, but it seems to me that the Northern Territory bill itself has at least 22 checkpoints.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chart&mdash;which, I understand, was attributed to the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas), but which somebody else, in fact, drew up&mdash;is really like a Monopoly board. There is a series of Monopoly&hyphen;like gates that you have to pass through, and more conditions as well. I am not talking about Holland; I am talking about the Northern Territory bill. It seems nigh on impossible that anyone who did not want to terminate their life could possibly pass through all those checkpoints and actually get to the point where the button was pressed&mdash;which is, as I said, what the Northern Territory bill is about; and the present bill is about terminating the Northern Territory bill. If we agree&mdash;but we obviously do not&mdash;that the Northern Territory bill is faulty, it can only be faulty in very minor ways, and it seems to me almost impossible that many people could pass through those gates successfully if, in fact, they did not want to terminate their life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate, then, comes down to whether others should prevent me or anybody terminating my or his life in regard to those 22 particular conditions. Like everybody else, I have had plenty of letters in recent days. I have had an orchestrated campaign, I have to say, over the last six or seven weeks. Up until that point, the letters were running about fifty&hyphen;fifty&mdash;I think they were probably slightly in favour of terminating one's own life&mdash;but since then they have run the other way. I have checked my records and, prior to the introduction of this bill we are debating today, I may have had one letter ever on the subject. With 82,000 people in my electorate, I had only had one letter on the subject of termination of life&mdash;even after the Northern Territory legislation was in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have come to the conclusion that what was happening was that people who were interested were watching what was going on in the Northern Territory. In other words, here was a small jurisdiction, they had passed a bill&mdash;call it a bill about euthanasia or a bill about the right to terminate life of the terminally ill who made that choice themselves&mdash;and we were sitting there, and I think they were sitting there, saying, `There is an interesting thing taking place up there in the Territory, there is a limited number of people, it is limited jurisdiction and we will watch and see what happens.' They were watching to see, as with many of the fears expressed in this debate, whether or not the right to terminate life was going to escape out of the Northern Territory bottle. What has happened is that what is proposed in this bill is that nobody is going to be able to see whether or not it would have escaped out of the Northern Territory bottle, because the bill proposes that the lid goes on the bottle and the bottle is thrown out to sea. So I have to say that, for a number of reasons, I will oppose this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My last reason is that I think, in the main, whilst I agree absolutely that this Commonwealth parliament has the right to dispose of or terminate legislation brought down in the Northern Territory, that it is not a matter of whether it has the right; it is a matter of whether it should or should not in this case. I cannot see the point of creating territories which have their own legislatures, allowing them to legislate and then, sometime later, making a decision that you are going to terminate some piece of legislation they have brought down. If they are responsible enough to legislate on the matter, then we should allow that legislation to carry through. So, to repeat what I have said, it is a near run thing but, on the margin, I have to say that I have come down in favour of allowing the Northern Territory legislation to stand. I will therefore vote against this bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So far into this debate, little new can be said that has not already been put more eloquently by those who have spoken before me. But I want to at least explain to my constituency how I have come to my position on the Euthanasia Laws Bill and what issues I have taken into account in reaching my conclusions. In my view, there are three basic issues to decide in determining how I should vote on the Andrews bill. The first question is: is this bill a proper exercise of Commonwealth powers? The second is: does the bill enjoy community support? The third is: should euthanasia be permitted in Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that for many of those who have spoken in this debate the first two issues are not considered to be of great consequence. I have been somewhat disappointed that some members seek to discount the significance of those two questions and want to deal exclusively with the morality of euthanasia itself. However, it is my view that ours is a constitutional democracy with a defined balance of powers between the Commonwealth, states and territories, and that we have a representative parliamentary system whose members have an obligation to represent the views of their constituencies. I want to be satisfied in relation to all three of these matters before casting my vote on the Andrews bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no doubt that the constitutional responsibility to make laws in relation to euthanasia rests with the states. It is not a matter of state rights. Indeed, I reject the concept of state or Commonwealth or territory rights. It is the people who have rights; governments have responsibilities. But the federation would be clearly unworkable if one tier of government ever sought to illegitimately extend its powers at the expense of others. There has been, over recent times, a graphic shift of responsibility as the Commonwealth has used the external affairs powers, its superior financial powers and, indeed, an expansive High Court to extend its influence at the expense of the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have taken a stand on this issue in the past. In October 1994, I voted against the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill. I did so because I believed that legislation overrode lawfully made decisions of the Tasmanian government, and decisions for which the Tasmanian government had received a recent mandate from its people. I had no doubt that the state had the power to make the laws that it made in that regard and that it had exercised those powers correctly. The Commonwealth intervention was based on a misrepresentation of an international treaty. It was supported by very dubious High Court rulings. It was also based on hopelessly flawed United Nations Human Rights Committee rulings, where the hearings were conducted without any natural justice. Those decisions, and that Commonwealth act changed, in my view, the balance intended under our constitution. It sought to enable the Commonwealth to intervene in areas where it had no reasonable right to intervene.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, this euthanasia case is somewhat different. There is no United Nations treaty, no human rights committee, no endorsement of flawed procedures, and no attempt to override the intended balance of powers between the Commonwealth and the states. Indeed, there is no doubt that, when the founding fathers met to draw up our constitution, they clearly intended that the territories would be regarded differently from the states in the way in which powers were distributed between the various tiers of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 122 of the constitution quite clearly says that the `parliament may make laws for the government of any territory'. It does not say that about the states but it does make a very clear distinction in relation to the territories. Clearly, the Northern Territory is not a state. It has ambitions to be a state, ambitions which I support, but it is not yet a state. It is not, in my view, accidental that the founding fathers included this particular section in our <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7770"> constitution. I believe they took that action because of the small numbers of people living in the territories. It was always intended that, as a territory grew, it would become a state and enjoy the same rights and responsibilities and privileges of the other states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at this particular decision, and, indeed, many others, we can see that the territories could in fact make decisions within their own parliaments, their own assemblies, which affect all Australians. This is one such example. It is incomprehensible to believe that the decision of the Northern Territory will not affect all Australians. If this legislation stays, an industry to provide euthanasia will quickly develop in the Northern Territory. A state that has no palliative care industry would instead have an industry that facilitates death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, this small section of the Australian population&mdash;less than one per cent&mdash;would effectively be deciding the euthanasia issue for all. It was decided in the Northern Territory assembly, a single house without any review, with the smallest possible majority. Indeed, it was a majority which disappeared on the substantive issue at the next by-election. In my view, it is perfectly reasonable for the Commonwealth to exercise powers, clearly given to it in section 122 of the constitution, to make a decision about whether the Northern Territory legislation is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether the Andrews bill enjoys majority public support is not clear. Public opinion polls seem to support euthanasia, but there is real doubt that the public understands that this bill&mdash;and, indeed, the Northern Territory legislation&mdash;is not about withdrawing pointless medical treatment which prolongs a painful end. It is about active intervention to kill, even if in prescribed circumstances. The correspondence in my electorate overwhelmingly supports the Andrews bill. But most of it comes from organised lobby groups, so it cannot be regarded as being definitively reflective of the views of my electorate and I must make the decision as I see the issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To me, euthanasia is not just another medical procedure; it is the ultimate, final act. It is not just an issue for those who are choosing to die; it affects also their families and friends. The impact on a family of the first legal euthanasia is so apparent on this day. Too often, parents feel that they have become a burden on their family. They have in many instances worked hard and gone without, all of their lives, to save up an inheritance for their family, being themselves prepared to do without to give their children a better chance in life. I fear that this moral pressure which parents so often feel may lead them to say, `Let me also ease the burden on my children in these last days and make a voluntary decision to terminate my life.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`Euthanasia', I am told, is a Greek work meaning easy death. But there is no easy death. Coming to terms with dying is a very important part of living. Leaving this world content, being at peace with God and fellow man is, I think, important to most Australians, and to most people when they are facing their last times. Who knows what benefit someone, even someone who is terminally ill, may still provide to those around&mdash;a strengthening word, an example of courage, an expression of faith that helps someone else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have been listening to the very powerful and moving stories of so many members of parliament who have referred in this debate to their own experiences of being close to someone who has died, I have wondered how many of such people, in their latter years, thought about how important their death would be in a national debate on an important issue. Who knows what final contribution, even in our last hours, we may be able to make to help others and to assist our community.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7771">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have never personally been a supporter of euthanasia. I have not been persuaded during this debate that I should change my mind. So I have decided to support the Andrews bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When an elected member of parliament who belongs to a political party is able to vote on an issue, the community usually&mdash;and sometimes cynically&mdash;says, `Oh, well, the member follows the party line.' That is an oversimplification of the role of a member of parliament who belongs to a political party and is unfair, because policy decisions result from many people in that party working and contributing towards a resolution and a policy outcome. However, when a member belongs to a political party that says also that members may exercise a right to vote on an issue if it can fairly be categorised as a conscience issue, I think that member can proudly say that he belongs to a party which recognises the sensitivities of issues and allows members to vote according to conscience without any recrimination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly pleased that, in the whole of this parliament, members from all parties have been given the privilege of voting according to their conscience on this important legislation, the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996, even though some of those members not belonging to my party do not normally have that right. Parliament is enriched by the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, members of the community in my electorate have spoken to me and said, `Lou, you really should vote the way we say you should. After all, it is what we want you to do. It is our will.' I try to explain to those people, `Yes, I respect your view and I am interested to learn about it and to discuss it with you. But it is not the view of all of my electorate.' It is quite strange when they then say, `Oh, but it must be. How can anyone not have a view the same as ours?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an interesting paradox that a member of parliament has to explain sometimes to his individual electors that what they say to him is not necessarily the same as the views of the rest of the constituents. Like other colleagues, I have had a lot of correspondence, phone calls, and personal conversations with people in my electorate about this issue. If I were wanting to count up the number of people that have actually taken the trouble to contact me, I would find that most would overwhelmingly be against euthanasia and would overwhelmingly want me to vote in support of the Andrews legislation and thus frustrate the Northern Territory parliament in its legislative program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I have been around a while and I am also aware of the fact that the silent majority often does not take the trouble to express its view. You cannot always say to yourself, as a parliamentarian, that since you have got most letters from people who take one view, it therefore follows ipso facto that that is the view of the whole electorate. I do not take that view. My own conscience view is&mdash;and always has been, and I believe always will be&mdash;that life is precious, and that the mysteries of life are not always understood, and I certainly do not understand them fully. I personally would always strongly oppose euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a former minister for health and a shadow minister for health in the Victorian parliament, I was often confronted with the dilemma of trying to find enough resources to meet all of the health needs of the community. There are cogent arguments put to you to fund this and not, perhaps, put as much into another area. That is one of the dilemmas, of course, of being in public life and making decisions that often you have to balance things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not see any compromise on the question of legalising euthanasia. It is something that I cannot support. I remember when I was at the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne and being shown the premature babies in that particular area where with great skill many babies <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7772"> have been saved and have gone on to become healthy children and adults and productive citizens of this country. I can remember one of the bureaucrats saying, `Minister, you know it costs, I think, $27,000 a week to keep these babies alive. You know, Minister, you are going to have to&mdash;' I said, `No, I don't know.' `You know, Minister?' I said, `No, I don't know.' But I knew he meant, of course, that maybe the funds should be cut off. There was no way that I would adhere to that, either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been a strong advocate of the development in Australia of palliative care. I think that is an issue. I have asked a lot of people who have been opposed to us opposing this euthanasia law whether they understood that in Victoria, in particular, and in other states, there is the right to refuse medical treatment. I played a little role in that when I was in the Victorian parliament in helping to develop those laws. They are surprised&mdash;and many citizens of Australia do not understand&mdash;that there are now legislative rights in most states to refuse medical treatment which prolongs that person's life when that person does not want support systems. There is now a right to refuse. When I explained that, I found a lot of people who were wanting to have euthanasia laws said, `That is all I need, Lou. I am happy with that and I do not particularly want to go ahead with supporting euthanasia.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming from a state parliament and now in the federal parliament, I respect very much the sovereignty and the principle of the elected parliament being accountable and having its rights to enact laws, even though you may not approve of them, without interference from central government. So you can understand that I am in some quandary here, except that I believe that under section 122 of the constitution, federal parliamentarians are expected to maintain their duties and responsibilities and not abrogate them. So I do not find the arguments against interference with the Northern Territory parliament very strong at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point is that the Northern Territory law has extra&hyphen;jurisdictional operation. In fact, people have already moved from my home town in Victoria to the Northern Territory to seek access to the Northern Territory law. So it is a nonsense to say that the Northern Territory law only applies to Northern Territorians. It has the potential to apply to all Australians. That is another reason why the Commonwealth parliament has a legitimate right, in my view, to debate the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, in the abstract, it can also be argued that the Commonwealth commitment to health funding through Medicare and other grant systems involves interconnection between the Commonwealth and the states and territories. So Commonwealth parliamentarians have the responsibility anyway in the knowledge that, if one territory in Australia has a law like this, it is going to act as a magnet for people from other parts of Australia. They will want to avail themselves of this law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I go back to the fact that our responsibility is to work as hard as we can to improve access to and the quality and effectiveness of palliative care. That is the important area. I am not here to moralise about the painful process of death. Obviously, I have had family and friends involved in that process, as we all have. However, from all the reading I have done and instruction that I have received, I strongly believe that palliative care can give relief to people who are suffering, and it can give it in a way which is dignified and which assists them to cope with a difficult passage of time. However, I know that more needs to be done in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I pay tribute to the people in my electorate who are committed to developing those programs, particularly for rural people on farms and in isolation who do not have access to palliative care as you and I who live in large communities have. I pay tribute to those people in my electorate <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7773"> who are pioneering the development in Australia of palliative care to isolated communities and to people on farms through volunteers and visits and the like. I just wanted to take the opportunity to mention those people and commend their work in this society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I respect the right of people to disagree with me. I have no disrespect for their view. It is good for us to be able to participate in a debate on an issue as sensitive as this with goodwill and understanding on both sides. I have a final prayer for all the people of this world that this country and this nation will lead the world in caring for people in the right way.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak on the Euthanasia Laws Bill. I do so after careful consideration of the arguments put forward by both sides of the debate and after considerable consultation with my electorate. That consultation presented a number of highly emotive responses to the issue. It is easy to dismiss the arguments for euthanasia purely on religious grounds, or even to accept the case for euthanasia purely on civil libertarian grounds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that were the case I, like many Australians who have been raised in an essentially highly democratic, Christian dominated society, would experience little agony over the eventual decision. But that is not the case. To simply fall back on either of these values would be a betrayal of the trust that the voters of Deakin have placed in me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been no shortage of interest groups&mdash;churches, community organisations, constituents and even party members&mdash;prepared to offer their counsel, opinion or, in some cases, their direction. I have also listened to the emotional and heartfelt personal accounts of those who have witnessed the slow demise of a loved one. I sincerely thank them all for their input and trust that they will understand, if not accept, my eventual, very personal vote on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I place on record my belief that the bill should have been referred to a House of Representatives parliamentary committee prior to being debated in this House. I know the arguments put forward by those who voted against this idea last month; arguments such as, `We need to get the matter over and done with as soon as possible', or `The longer we take, the greater the chance that Bob Dent will not be the only one to die as a result of the Northern Territory legislation', or `The Senate will refer the bill to a committee anyway'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">None of these arguments is convincing. A responsible parliament, as evidenced elsewhere in the world, has to conduct thorough research prior to considering such important and vital social issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To me it is not enough that the Northern Territory parliament has investigated the issue. We are not the Northern Territory parliament, we are not the House of Lords or the Canadian parliament all of which undertook comprehensive research. We are the Australian parliament and to abdicate that responsibility to a Senate committee or rely on another parliament's research is just not good enough. It is an abdication of our responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me also make it clear that my decision to vote for referral to a committee was in no way motivated by a desire to `park the bill'. This is too important a bill to ignore or to shunt off indefinitely into the too hard basket. For example, there are many unanswered questions in relation to the Northern Territory law. Even as recently as the day before the debate began I received legal opinion within my electorate concerned about the safeguards in respect to psychiatric cases.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7774">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Against this backdrop, at the end of the day I am voting in support of this bill on a range of social, medical and moral grounds, some of which I would like to place on record today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like many other speakers, I fail to see the imperative to adopt euthanasia laws. Have our society, our medicos, our policy makers, been screaming out for action? Has there been a flaw in the system which needs to be fixed? Has palliative care been discredited? Unlike unemployment, business growth, education of our kids, investment in the future and the support of our traditional family structure, there is no imperative for euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are here today because of one man's personal crusade and because one territory took it upon itself to pass a law which affects all Australians, not just territorians or those currently with terminal illness, but all Australians. It is not confined to within the territory's borders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, in 1996, it is easy to be swayed towards allowing euthanasia when we are confronted by the heartfelt and emotional stories depicting the slow deterioration of an individual's life. It is relatively easy to be swayed by the notion that we are being compassionate by removing the agony, the pain and the indignity of an individual's suffering. It is also easy to be swayed by misleading public opinion polls which ask, `Do you believe in relieving the suffering of a dying person?' Of course the answer would be yes, but does that response extend to, `Do you believe in terminating the individual's life?' I ask those that form their opinion and take solace from opinion polls or talkback radio to analyse the facts as I have had the opportunity to do. Interestingly, most people who engage on a path of research into this topic, as has been evidenced by former pro&hyphen;euthanasia proponents, have a realisation that the case for euthanasia is not so clear cut. Those pro&hyphen;euthanasia arguments must be considered in terms of the long&hyphen;term effect on our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 2006, after 10 years, or even in 15 years after socialisation of normative behaviour by our institutions, politicians, doctors, or even families, what kind of a society will we have? I do not know the answer to that question, and while there are many unknowns about our future, can I, as a legislator, take a risk with the life of future generations? Can I, as a legislator who may, by that time, be retired, be assured of its administration?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In saying this I am mindful of four very important considerations. Firstly, can the safeguards and tests which will protect the voluntary aspect of euthanasia&mdash;the voluntary aspect of it which is often lauded by proponents of euthanasia&mdash;still be maintained? As a psychologist there is one thing that I know: the greatest predictor of future behaviour or performance can often be past performance. While that is not a truism, it is the best that we have got at this moment. Past performance and past experience, and even current behaviour in countries which sanction euthanasia, indicate that the answer to that is no.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second consideration is that the role and the duty of a doctor will not be compromised. The integrity of the trust which currently exists between doctor and patient cannot be safeguarded. How do I calm the levels of anxiety which are bound to creep into an aged and invalid resident or patient as they are wheeled into a hospital or nursing home? These should be places where a high level of trust and faith in a positive outcome of support is evidenced, rather than places of suspicion and mistrust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, can we be assured that the growing army of palliative care volunteers will not lose heart? Volunteers in my electorate who belong to such organisations as the Nunawading Palliative Care Association and the Mid Eastern Palliative Care Association are people I respect and admire deeply. They are surrounded by those very people whom we are placing at risk by a future society where euthanasia has been normalised.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7775">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, can I have faith that future legislators who are confronted by high current account deficits, high public spending, high inflation or growing unemployment will not rule a red line through research programs, tax initiatives, institutions, health programs and medical schools which are aimed either at finding remedies to current and unknown diseases or at relieving the suffering of those who are terminally ill? I say that because I have had the personal experience of knowing someone who died of a terminal illness only four or five years ago and whose life could perhaps have been prolonged today because of the continuing, extensive research into the disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not say these things lightly, but as a comment that we as a society are pressured to compete in an ever increasing and dependent global village. I also express these concerns based on the sense of urgency we experience when we are occasionally confronted by a mysterious disease. Would the world's medical research teams be mobilised to find a response to the growing list of cancers and to diseases such as AIDS? I am not convinced. I am not willing to take that chance for the sake of not today's Bob Dent, but tomorrow's infirm, diseased or incapacitated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, allow me to make a closing statement to the people of the Northern Territory and to my friend, Shane Stone, the Chief Minister. I do not believe that the rights and status of the Northern Territory are diminished in the eyes of the public or in the eyes of many of our federal parliamentarians. This issue must be considered by the federal parliament. It is too important an issue for us to hide behind the states rights argument. After careful consideration, I give my support to the private member's bill as proposed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In Charters Towers, my home town for the second half of my life, we had a case that got great national prominence when a young lady was accused of the mass murder of six people who were terminally ill. The case that touched this off was a hard case, and I think the territory people advocating euthanasia would use the Bucholz case as the sort that euthanasia would address. The case got enormous publicity&mdash;it was on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS>  and on at least two occasions it was on the front of every newspaper in Australia. The original case that touched it off concerned a person who was in a very advanced stage of cancer. If he had not been under a drugs regime he would have been enduring enormous pain and his body was in a very advanced state of deterioration. That was the background to the case concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since all of the players involved were very well known to me I did a little bit of research. I went over and spoke to the top person in the field of drugs and drug administration in Townsville and asked if I could discuss the case with her. I asked, `What happens in a case like this? Here is a person in a very advanced state of deterioration and who is most certainly terminally ill. If you take away the drugs regime that person will be in incredible pain. Since we can never actually prise our way into people's consciousness, maybe he is in incredible pain now, we do not know. We cannot say definitively'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The person concerned said that in the real world where real people live, as opposed to where the politically correct brigade live, if a person is dying there are three states that they will be in. In the first state they will be in great pain in which case they will be getting a very high regime of morphine. In the second state they will be dying but be in no pain, in which case it would be impossible to justify euthanasia. The third state is dementia and that is a grey area that the lady did not wish to go into.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7776">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said, `Come back to the morphine'. She said, `Morphine is a poison. The higher the regime, the shorter your lifespan'. So the more intense the administration of morphine, the shorter will be the lifespan. She said, `In the real world that is the reason why euthanasia is not a big issue. In the world where we live, in hospitals, that is not a big issue'. Whilst the AMA has taken some dreadful decisions which clearly indicate that they have a fairly cavalier attitude towards medical health in Australia, on this issue they have stood their ground on a matter of principle. Doctors know that in the real world there is a way of dealing with this. That is the way that it is dealt with and that is the way that it has been dealt with over a very long period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dealing with the case where there is great pain, the solution employed is the morphine solution. I do not like using that description because it was the same term used by the Germans to do away with anyone who had dementia or who was a little bit less than perfect or who was a burden upon the state, and I think that that is very relevant to the debate here today. But in the first case, that case is dealt with in a manner which everyone has found reasonably acceptable over a very long period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the second case, if there is no pain then there is no desire for euthanasia. It would be a very rare occurrence. There is no great issue involved there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third case which concerns me greatly is the dementia case. In Charters Towers we have the mental hospital which serves the northern half of Queensland. We also have the Eventide Hospital for old people who are in an advanced state of physical disability. One runs across an awful lot of people in this particular grey area. I remember one particular case where there was the most violent fight going on between the hospital employees union and a doctor at the Eventide Hospital over a gentlemen who had a gangrenous leg. The doctor was arguing that the leg could not be taken off because the person had said that it could not be taken off whereas the nurses, the attendants at the Eventide Hospital, said that unless the leg was taken off then clearly the man would die. That was the reason for the violent altercation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I went and saw the man myself and I said, `Mate, your leg has got gangrene and unless it's taken off you are going to die. Could we please take your leg off?' He then said yes. So I walked down the corridor and had a cup of tea and then came back and said to him, `The hospital doctor is saying you shouldn't have your leg taken off because you don't want to have your leg taken off. Is it true that you don't want to have your leg taken off?' He said, `Yes, it is true that I don't want to have my leg taken off'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was quite obvious that anyone could walk in and elicit any sort of an answer from this gentlemen. However, I would not have described the man as a dementia case. He was a person you could talk to, although he was a little incoherent at times. He was most certainly not a case for euthanasia. Clearly, I could have elicited an answer from him saying, `Yes, I agree to be done away with'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, the euthanasia area is an extremely dangerous one with respect to dementia. It is an extremely dangerous mechanism to put into the hands of a lot of doctors. They have studied hard all of their lives, and I think that the human element of their personality has been destroyed by the intense study regime which they have committed themselves to over a long period of time. I would see them as remarkably inappropriate people to have such an extremely dangerous mechanism as this. Also, in the case of dementia, people go in and out of it. You can have periods where they are extremely lucid and it would be terrible to conceive of any of my friends or relatives being done away with because they were going through a period of dementia when they might otherwise have come out of it later on. That would be terrible.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7777">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two other possibilities that must be canvassed here, in my opinion. We are all human and we have very great financial burdens to carry, particularly in a country where over a million families have gone broke and lost everything over the last decade. But, probably, it is true at all times that people are under financial pressure. You may have a person whose grown&hyphen;up children are under terrific financial pressure. They are about to have their home taken away from them, or their kids have to be pulled out of school because there is not enough money to keep them at school or university. And there is an old person that has a home and some assets. There is enormous pressure, both upon the children to recommend that daddy be speeded on his way and, sadly, there is tremendous pressure upon daddy himself. The more he stays alive, the less access the kids have got to his life insurance and, to a lesser extent, his assets and property.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, he has a terrible decision to make: whether to stay alive and watch his children go bankrupt, be taken out of university and thrown on the economic scrap heap; or to take his own life. That is the only way that his children would be entitled to his life insurance, and with life insurance and superannuation, most people have very substantial sums of money tied up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, a person still has some tenuous clinging to hope, no matter how hopeless his position is and, as the member for Deakin (Mr Barresi) pointed out, who knows what miracles medical science will come up with in a period of three or four years. The year before Dr Barnard did his famous heart transplant who would have remotely conceived that you could take a person's heart out and put somebody else's heart in that person and he would live on. The wonders of medical science are occurring every day and so people cling to hope. That clinging to hope would lead them not to sell off their homes. It places people in the twilight of their lives in a dreadful situation because now they will go out being very displeased with their children, or the children will be very displeased with themselves. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996, also known as the Andrews bill. Firstly, I would like to go to the question of whether we should be debating this matter in the federal parliament. While I am a supporter of state rights, I believe that there are two compelling reasons why it is appropriate that this debate occur in the federal parliament. Firstly, under the constitution, the Commonwealth has a right to do so. Section 122 of the constitution states that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The parliament may make laws for the government of any territory. . .</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Andrews's bill will amend the Northern Territory (Self Government) Act to insert the provision 6A(1) which states that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Legislative Assembly does not have power to make a law to permit assistance to be given to a person to terminate his or her life.</PARA>
<PARA>The second reason is a moral and legislative responsibility. This is not a new law for only the Northern Territory, or a new law only for Australia. It is, with only a few exceptions, a new law across all nations. The consequences of the Northern Territory law cannot be bound by the boundaries of that state. It will seep like a dye thrown into a pond and it will stain the lives and colour the thinking of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, I would like to define what euthanasia is not. The turning off of a machine, or the withdrawal of treatment which has become a burden, or is futile or unwanted, is not euthanasia provided the intention is not to kill the patient. Providing sufficient pain relief to a patient is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7778"> not euthanasia, even if that treatment also hastens death. Euthanasia is the deliberate intention to kill another human being. Euthanasia is not a right to die; it is a right to kill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the patient has requested that he or she be killed, it is termed voluntary euthanasia. If he or she is unable to make a conscious decision to request to be killed, but a relative or guardian requests it in the belief that this is what the patient would have wanted, it is called non&hyphen;voluntary euthanasia. Most of those who are pro&hyphen;euthanasia, as I found in my electorate, have very worthy reasons to support their view. They had a relative or friend who suffered greatly from a terminal illness and, quite rightly, they are concerned that such suffering should not continue for others&mdash;a very worthy aim. However, if we allow those in authority to take euthanasia as the easy way out, we will never see the good palliative care in this country that we must have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The treatment and care of the dying is a specialist field and one still lacking in many hospitals in Australia. In the past, and even today, many people die with a great deal of suffering. The answer to this suffering is not to kill them or to euthanase them, but to offer them the very best palliative care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to quote Dr Brian Pollard who, after 30 years as an anaesthetist, commenced service at Concord Hospital in 1982 to care for the dying. He has cared for over 1,000 patients and could be expected to have a clear understanding of the facts and falsehoods associated with dying. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of all the causes of suffering, pain is the most prominent and the most feared. The methods for the control of pain in terminal illness are different from those needed for other illnesses and failure to appreciate this distinction is possibly the commonest reason why such pain is often not as well managed as it ought to be.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are few pains due to cancer which today cannot be either eliminated or reduced in intensity to the point where the patient can bear the residual amount.</PARA>
<PARA>To those who say that it is very easy for me to quote doctors, to quote learned professionals in the field, I would just say that I have personal knowledge. Eight years ago my father contracted a terminal illness and suffered a great deal over 18 months. I was with him when he died. Palliative care, even as little as eight years ago, was poor, although I believe sincerely that the doctors and nurses who cared for him did their very best.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the sadness and the periods of anger and depression that dying people experience, and the frustration, confusion and hopelessness of the relatives. It would be very easy when a patient is depressed and in pain for the family who are feeling frustrated and burdened to come together and say, `The best way out is euthanasia.' However, I have seen the opportunity arise for very rich moments for families and for the dying: the opportunity to see a newborn grandchild, or the opportunity to say things that would have been left unsaid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If lives are not sacred, no matter how diminished those lives may be in our opinion, then no life is sacrosanct. If we allow euthanasia to become acceptable, to receive the stamp of authority of our parliaments, then palliative care will never improve. I have a great fear&mdash;it is a bit like the shampoo commercial in that it won't happen overnight, but it will happen&mdash;that, in the future, what McDonald's has done for food, euthanasia will do for palliative care. We will have fast food and fast death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The temptation for private health insurance, for instance, to differentiate between those who do the right thing and agree to save the health insurance industry a great deal of money and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7779"> those who do not would be enormous. I fear for those who are vulnerable, who are dying. It is a time when one is very much at the mercy of others. I fear for those who are poor, for those who perhaps do not have the ability to argue their case. It would be so easy to be coerced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps this is a little unfair, but I understand that the term amongst the pro&hyphen;euthanasia lobby for those who are contemplating or being given the option of euthanasia is `warm bodies'. If any phrase emphasises the dehumanisation of the individual, the term `warm bodies' is one that, frankly, I find very sad.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to introduce an element of levity into such a serious argument, but I can foresee a time when a son going to visit his mother who is ill in hospital would say to her, `Look Mum, Mrs Smith down the hall has done the right thing. You're really being difficult. Matron is upset by this. She wants someone else to have this bed&mdash;a young person. We are looking at selling the house and everything you have&mdash;but it is your decision, Mum. We could send the children to school, we could pay off our house with that money&mdash;but it is your decision, Mum.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can see, unfortunately, the commercialisation of euthanasia, with a loving package that you could have with your favourite movie, nightgown, and perhaps a day out. This is a time when those most vulnerable in our community should not be commercialised, should not have their humanity reduced. I support good palliative care, the sanctity of human life, and I support the Andrews bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have said, issues such as this tear at the very thread of Australia's soul. The euthanasia debate has polarised our community as, no doubt, every member in this House can attest. Recently, in the space of three minutes, I took two independent calls from constituents. The first threatened, in no uncertain terms, never to vote for me or the Liberal Party again if I did not support the Andrews bill.

I know that the elected members of the Northern Territory assembly weighed up similar information and gave equally serious <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7780"> consideration to the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act when it was first passed in 1995. What concerns me is that this government chose not to take action at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth government had the right, under the Northern Territory (Self&hyphen;Government) Act 1978, to intervene if it felt it was necessary to do so. The Governor&hyphen;General had six months to recommend any amendments to the law or disallow the law, but the Governor&hyphen;General, on the advice of the Commonwealth government, assented to the legislation in June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth government had another chance to intervene in this matter when an amendment was presented in February this year. Once again, the Governor&hyphen;General did not disallow the amending legislation. I ask the obvious question: why? Why are we considering taking historically unprecedented action at this stage? I hate to use a frivolous cliche, but it appears to me that what we are discussing here is the shifting of the goalposts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that the well&hyphen;respected political journalist Crispin Hull might well have supplied the answer in an article he wrote for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> in October. Mr Hull said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Northern Territory government sources say the Keating Government was lobbied by both sides in the euthanasia debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">One side wanted it to use the Commonwealth Government's veto power and the other wanted it to allow the Northern Territory's law to stand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems that the anti&hyphen;euthanasia forces realised that the option of veto by the executive looked a bit heavy&hyphen;handed and that it might be better to push for some Christian Right MPs to propose a private members bill based on the Commonwealth's over&hyphen;riding constitutional power to make laws for the territories on any subject whatever . . .&mdash;the very power which was used to give the Northern Territory self&hyphen;government in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>I do believe that this attack on our democracy has been overlooked by those whose primary concern is the matter of euthanasia itself. This is an extremely emotive issue, and one which strikes at the core of our personal safety. But with the Andrews bill we are telling the people of the Northern Territory that the conventions of representative democracy do not always apply. Yes, the Commonwealth government can interfere when the proper exercise of power by another legislature is in question, but this has not happened in Australia's history. So how can we expect the people of this nation to continue to give us their trust if we choose to take such unprecedented action?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have not discussed at length is the fact that this overriding constitutional power was designed only to be used in cases of riot or civil unrest. The strength of our democracy is that one member of parliament can introduce a bill which allows for public and parliamentary debate. That right is sacrosanct and should not be eroded. But I also believe that if federal MPs get into the habit of overturning territory legislation each time it conflicts with their own beliefs, they mock the very process of democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe we have given enough thought to the moves being made by this bill and the ongoing effect when one parliament attempts to override the decisions of another parliament. Are we fully conversant, for a start, with the effects Commonwealth intervention would have on the operation of criminal law in the Northern Territory? I do not believe so. Some of the best criminal and constitutional lawyers in this country are undecided on the matter. We must remember that the Andrews bill has wider ramifications in that the  Australian Capital Territory and Norfolk Island are also affected by it. It can be fairly presented that this bill is anti&hyphen;democratic in relation to the territories.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7781">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the people of this nation have the reasonable expectation that what we say is what we do. I do not believe we can ignore the fact that the Northern Territory was granted self&hyphen;government in 1978. I do not believe this government can debate the Andrews bill as though the Northern Territory government has no relevance. I do not believe we should continue the debate on euthanasia until the aspect of Commonwealth rights in the matter of the Northern Territory has been clearly addressed and resolved. To do so would be politically and morally unthinkable.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to participate in the debate on the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996 I want to say at the outset that there are many people of good conscience all over this country&mdash;indeed, in my own electorate&mdash;who have differing views on this very important issue. I believe that this piece of legislation is just as important as any economic bills before this parliament as it deals with society values. I believe those who support euthanasia do so legitimately and fervently, with compassion for those who suffer in their dying days or in times of great physical and perhaps mental stress. I believe they are compassionate people and they believe that the Northern Territory bill is a proper way to address this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have considered very strongly how I would vote on this issue and how I would address the issue. I have to say that, in my own conscience, there is no way that I could ever support active euthanasia. Instead of looking for ways in which to assist the frail and ill in our community to end their lives, we should rather be exploring ways of improving their quality of life. In this context, that includes finding additional resources for palliative care and all that it can do for those who are suffering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe strongly and always have in the sanctity of life. I maintain that we lack secure limits on voluntary euthanasia, and I ask which group of people would be next in line for inclusion. Will we include those born with disabilities or other impairments when we ask society to allow others to kill people? The fact of legal euthanasia creates additional pressures for those already feeling vulnerable: the elderly, frail, lonely, ill and those suffering depression or anxiety. The Hippocratic oath requires medical professionals to preserve life and relieve pain and suffering and it has never ever condoned the taking of life. We have a need to provide greater community support in the palliative care area to allow people greater choice about how they are cared for in their last days to improve the quality of life, not death. I am not persuaded as to the efficacy of the proposed safeguards in the Northern Territory legislation. Dr Peter Baume, in his article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Medicine</EMPHASIS> on 15 January 1996, in arguing the case for euthanasia admitted that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Difficulty arises sometimes in knowing who is making the request for euthanasia while competent, who is no longer competent, who is suffering from treatable depression, and who might make a different request at a different time.</PARA>
<PARA>Euthanasia is another word for state sanctioned killing. In a country where we do not support capital punishment for the most heinous crimes, the Northern Territory has introduced legislation that allows for the state sanctioned killing of those in our society who are most vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Comments made by Father John Brosnan, the prison chaplain to Ronald Ryan, the last man to be hanged in Australia, included these:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You know what state sanctioned killing did to Ronald Ryan or, in the case of euthanasia, what it would do to the patient. However, we rarely consider what an involvement in state sanctioned killing does to the rest of us. If someone believes their life has become worthless because of community prejudice, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7782"> loneliness or inadequate physical or emotional care then the job of the community is to improve the person's life, not destroy it. Allowing the problem to be addressed by killing the person allows society to avoid having to take the harder and more expensive road of actually providing resources for a more supportive, interesting and caring way of life for those who have lost hope.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A sense of hopelessness or worthlessness is not something to be accepted or admired as an expression of autonomy. There may be a cry for help or a demand for new efforts for those who care about the person. Killing the person with the problem is not the way to solve the problem. We all acknowledge that, with all the safeguards, checks and balances of the legal system conducted in a public forum, innocent people will still be killed and have been in this regard in capital punishment. There may not be many but there will certainly be some. How then can anyone pretend that innocent people will not be killed in a system where a couple of doctors have to agree behind closed doors?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With most legal rules, even the most disastrous mistakes can usually be addressed in one way or another. With capital punishment and euthanasia, every mistake is permanent. There is no turning back.</PARA>
<PARA>The deleterious effect of suicide on a victim's close friends and family is well documented. There are no guarantees or safeguards to ensure that close friends and families of a state sanctioned killing will not also be traumatised by that death. I can understand that many might feel a genuine sense of relief at the cessation of suffering of the terminally ill and dying and the capacity to be with them at the end because the time and date can be arranged, so to speak. But when that initial sense of relief wears off and the grieving process proceeds, it is possible that there might develop a sense of guilt and questions arise as to whether or not all options of palliative care were taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a difference between rejecting futile life&hyphen;prolonging treatment and actively assisting someone to die. Doctors who provide the means of ending a person's life, but who take no active role in the administration of, for example, a lethal injection, are in practice assisting in state sanctioned killing. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Disability Review</EMPHASIS> No. 2, 1996 made the following comment. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The paper concludes that such legislation (legalised euthanasia) could create a social climate in which people with disability may actually be required to justify their very right to exist.</PARA>
<PARA>The states and territories have rights to make laws for their citizens but there is, in this instance, an overriding national interest. The Northern Territory legislation, in effect, has changed the law on euthanasia for all Australians, not just territorians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do understand that there are many differing views on this issue. There are differing views in my electorate. There are differing views throughout Australia and across society. This Northern Territory legislation is, to the best of my knowledge, the first legislation in the world to allow the medical profession to terminate life which it deems is no longer wanted by the individual who previously held it. While I agree with the right, and I believe in the sincerity of every member who has and will speak on this issue before our parliament, in all conscience, there is no way that I could support the Northern Territory legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a letter to me&mdash;and I assume in a similar letter to other members and senators&mdash;Colleen McCullough, the well&hyphen;known Australian novelist, wrote, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have to say that prudence, commonsense and a considerable experience of human nature dispose me to think that euthanasia is an unattainable, if humane, dream. It wouldn't work because it couldn't work. I wish it could.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While this bill, the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996, does seek to use the Commonwealth's constitutional powers to override a law of the Northern Territory, this debate, both in this place and outside in the wider community, is really about the right of Australian citizens to active euthanasia. The debate on this issue within our national parliament is undoubtedly as divided as the debate in our local communities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this bill is designed to achieve is to overturn the intent of the Northern Territory legislation. The intent of that Northern Territory legislation is to allow people to make a conscious decision to end their lives. It is not to provide a legal framework that will allow medical practitioners the right to relieve pain and suffering, even if, in doing so, that action hastens the death of a patient. It goes that step further. It crosses a threshold that I feel uneasy and uncomfortable with. It actually provides a legal framework for a patient to request, albeit with a level of counselling and consultation, to terminate his or her life by administering a lethal injection. This process is, I believe, active euthanasia, or perhaps more correctly should be called `assisted suicide'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have great sympathy and empathy for anyone suffering the debilitating and dehumanising effects of a terminal illness. In fact, I watched my father, who died almost two years ago to the day, after being diagnosed with bone cancer. I saw how that disease affected his life and that of my mother. I watched as the disease progressed, resulting in an amputation of one leg. I watched how my father had to learn to walk again with the aid of an artificial limb&mdash;an extremely difficult exercise for such a very large, tall man. He had been a very active man, used to playing golf at least three times a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I watched as my mother's life changed as she took on the role of a full&hyphen;time carer. There were times, especially in the latter stages of my father's illness, when it was difficult to adjust the level and mix of medication required to keep the pain under control as the disease progressed. It is this method of treatment that I believe, as legislators, we should be concentrating our time and effort on&mdash;that is, improving the standard of and access to palliative care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will always be grateful to the nurses of the district nursing service who daily visited and cared for my father and, especially in the last week of my father's life, for the loving care and dedication of his doctor and the nursing staff of the Buderim Hospital in which he spent his final week. My family are indebted to them because they ensured that my father received the appropriate level and type of medication needed to keep his increasing level of pain under control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some who might describe this method of pain management as passive euthanasia. However, I will always be grateful that my father&mdash;and countless numbers of others in the same position as my father&mdash;was able to die peacefully and with dignity. This method of pain management and dying with dignity is not what the Northern Territory legislation is designed to achieve. Instead, it is designed to allow a person deliberately to end their life by self&hyphen;administering a lethal injection. I cannot support that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like all who have spoken in this debate, I too have read and consulted widely on this issue. I have to say that I have found no better expression of my beliefs or feelings than the words of Sir Gustav Nossal, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dying with dignity and in peace should be everyone's right, particularly in an industrialised country with high standards of health care. Nevertheless, I am against the formal legislation of euthanasia. A well&hyphen;ordered society is a very fragile thing, as recent history (Hitler, Pol Pot, Rwanda) shows. I believe there <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7784"> are grave dangers in a society giving to anyone, no matter how well intentioned, the right to terminate a human life. However, I do believe that those who are terminally ill should come to the end as free of pain as possible and with as tranquil a state of mind as possible. This may necessitate the use of strong drugs in doses that imperil life. I certainly do not believe that fear of possibly fatal consequences should limit the dosage of narcotics, tranquillisers or other medications in such circumstances. It seems to me that the crucial thing here is intent. The intent to relieve pain and suffering is good; the intent directly to kill breaches what I consider to be societal norms.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Euthanasia Laws Bill that has been proposed by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews). In doing so I note that the debate has gone on for a long time and that there has been a great deal of learned discussion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill seeks to amend the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978, the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 and the Norfolk Island Act 1979. The purpose of the bill is to ensure that the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly and the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly do not have the power to make laws which would permit that form of intentional killing of another&mdash;called euthanasia&mdash;which includes mercy killing, or the assisting of another person to terminate his or her own life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come to this debate with the general view which I have always held that I am opposed to the principle of taking the life of another. Obviously, there are examples when this occurs such as in just wars. There are also cases overseas where lives are taken in the course of capital punishment which is ordained by law. I see those situations in terms of self-defence but when it comes to the intentional taking of someone's life, whether they ask for that or not, I demur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that those who support the principle of euthanasia always qualify it and they are very rigid in the way they wish to qualify it. They are very concerned to make sure, because a lot of them are very decent, thinking people, that they are doing the right thing as well. They are always quick to point out that it must be voluntary, that it must be a completely free choice, and that it must be with complete consent or informed consent. They also are keen to insist that this would apply only to those in terrible need, to those who have a terrible need to end their suffering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Maybe this is a simple view but it seems to me that there is a catch 22 involved in this situation. From my memory of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Catch 22</EMPHASIS>, that was a situation where people who were serving in a war wanted to get out of it because of the danger. They would go along to the doctor and say, `I am mad and therefore I should be relieved of my duties'. The doctor would always reply, `If you come to me and say that you are mad and you want to be relieved of your duties then you are obviously very sane indeed. Therefore, I will not accept your application'. They were caught.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of euthanasia it seems to me that there is a parallel. There is a catch 22. We want to make sure that people who are asking to die do so with full and informed consent and yet we are applying the law to those people who cannot exercise full and informed consent. An example of this might be AIDS dementia. Basically, the Northern Territory legislation is a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7785"> catch 22 situation. The Northern Territory legislation says that a patient must be suffering from an illness that in the normal course of events, without the application of extraordinary measures of treatment, will result in death. A psychiatrist must confirm the absence of any treatable clinical depression in respect of the illness but it must be causing severe pain and suffering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation also says that the patient must be of sound mind. It is always very difficult for someone to determine who else is of sound mind. I would have thought that someone who is in terrific pain and suffering and who wanted to end their life because of this pain and suffering is not really in a situation where they can make an informed decision. It seems to defeat itself. They cannot live to regret their decision if they have taken that decision. I would demur on the side of caution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also think it is wrong to change the onus of proof with respect to the medical profession. We all have these experiences. My grandmother was 101 and she was in a nursing home. We took her out at one stage when she wanted to come home but then she wanted to go back. She kept telling us how she was getting better but unfortunately there was never going to be a cure for old age. The one thing that she always feared was the thought, `They do not want me any longer. I am too old and they do not want me'. I felt that if those people walking around in white coats were authorised to give a lethal injection it would have been more of a strain upon her in that circumstance. It is always better for people in that situation to think that the people who are caring for them have their interests at heart. I would hate to see a situation develop where that was to change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like all other members, I have received lots and lots of representations on this issue, most of them opposing the concept of euthanasia but, of course, many supporting the concept of euthanasia. Some have written to me saying that, as the member for Cook, I am duty&hyphen;bound to do as they bid and to exercise their order and vote for euthanasia. But the truth is that if I were going to take that balancing exercise and either weigh the letters or count them, there would be far more letters opposing euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you did a poll of the electorate, I suppose, if people were not confused, it would be interesting to see what the result would be. I think that quite a lot of people think that turning the machine off is euthanasia, when it is nothing of the sort. In fact, as regards applying pain&hyphen;killing relief, I think sometimes the injections of morphine can be the terminally ill patient's best friend, if it takes them to a position where quite often people might die from pneumonia. I think that the people administering pain&hyphen;killing medication who get to the stage where that medication serves to hasten the end of the person can really act in good conscience in doing so. I think there is a world of difference between trying to relieve suffering and trying to end suffering by taking people into another state&mdash;the state of death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been some concern about the role of this parliament and its ability to make legislation of this type. We have had representations, petitions, pleas and all sorts of other things from, for instance, Norfolk Island&mdash;I have got one here from the government of Norfolk Island. There have also been representations made by the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) and from the Northern Territory government. Much has been made of the role of those legislatures to govern for the peace, welfare and good government of the people under their jurisdiction, but I have a simple view about this as well: I think that governments have to play to the whistle, the way we do in sporting contests. If this government has the power to enact this legislation, so be it. If we do not have the power, let the High Court decide. So <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7786"> my view is that, if we can do it and we feel obliged to do it, we have every right to do so. That is my simple view of the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also received another representation from Norfolk Island from none other than Colleen McCullough. I think all members have received a letter from Colleen McCullough. I was very impressed with her views on euthanasia, taking them not from a religious point of view, but I think from the point of view of someone who has a great deal of sympathy and has worked in the very sad areas where people have been severely retarded, or where people have suffered severe illnesses, and terminal illnesses in many cases. I do commend to people her paper which she delivered to the New South Wales parliament entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Euthanasia: putting people down</EMPHASIS> and I would like to subscribe to what she said in that paper. She makes the point that those who genuinely want to die will find a way to suicide without assistance. There can be great debate about this, and people who might be handicapped would find it very difficult to do so. It is not a simple question. She says also:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . but I believe that those who ask others to kill them do not genuinely want to die, for to ask someone else to do the unthinkable in the name of mercy and compassion is to shift the burden of responsibility to other shoulders and to invite another person to bear the guilt.</PARA>
<PARA>It is an interesting point that she makes. I think there is a glimmer of truth in that. I think it is very hard for people who have that expectation put upon them. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill is bad law. I think it is ridiculous that we come into a parliament and we introduce selectively a piece of legislation which does not address the question, but addresses self&hyphen;government and the powers exercised under the present legislation providing self&hyphen;government for the Australian territories. I say that on the premise that I am totally opposed to euthanasia. I say it on the basis that we are part of a federal system. If we had wanted to address the federal system, then we could do so. If we want to provide legislation which would analyse and detail the powers which we think should be available for the Commonwealth on social and other issues, we can do so by referendum. This could well be a bill which came in to call for a referendum of the Australian people to determine whether or not the Commonwealth government should have powers with respect to a range of social issues. In this instance, it might be in respect of euthanasia. It might be one that extends to abortion. It might be one that extends to a whole range of other social issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is for that reason that I find it incredible that we have got a private member's bill that does all the wrong things. It comes into this parliament and tries to do something which frankly is discriminatory in the extreme and which prejudices the extent of what I see as the natural evolution of the power for the territories of Australia to be in the same position as every other Australian jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have spent a fair bit of time in the last few weeks worrying about the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) who has produced a debate about racism. This is just as discriminatory. We have a whole lot of Australian citizens. If you come from a territory, you are just as much an Australian as if you come from New South Wales. Why should you be lesser creatures? This bill says that we are discriminating per se against everybody who lives in a territory. It does not say that it is going to deal against euthanasia for those who live in the states, so they are somehow going to be different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I happen to be totally opposed to euthanasia. I think that one life unnecessarily taken is one life too many, but I am appalled when bad legislation is given the status&mdash;because it has been <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7787"> allowed to take a prominent place on the agenda of the parliament&mdash;of being tantamount to government legislation. As a member of the government, I do not think it should have that status. I think it would have been far better if it had been treated as is every other piece of legislation that is introduced by a private member and had taken its turn in the discussion on private members' day. I say that because we are not voting on euthanasia in this bill. I have heard, with a great deal of respect, the views expressed by my colleague, the honourable member for Cook (Mr Mutch) and I have listened to a number of other contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is we are not talking about euthanasia. We are talking about the powers that this Commonwealth should exercise selectively to discriminate against a few Australians. I think it is bad law to be discriminating against a few Australians. I am against racism. I do not agree with the prejudices that have emerged from some of the views expressed by the honourable member for Oxley. I certainly do not think that we can say&mdash;because we produce a piece of legislation that looks particularly at self&hyphen;government&mdash;that we are talking about the question itself. It worries me that a device has been chosen to wheel around a very significant issue. I would have far preferred that we had come into this parliament and, if opposed to euthanasia, we had said, `We're going to introduce a bill which says that we are going to ensure that no law pertaining to euthanasia can be produced in Australia.' That is what this bill should be doing. This bill is a device. It does not achieve what those who are advocates against euthanasia believe. It does not achieve what those who might be pro&hyphen;euthanasia believe it is going to do. All it does is selectively apply in those territories that have been identified under schedules 1, 2 and 3, and it is not going to apply to anybody else. I think that if we are going to be honest with ourselves, we should not introduce discriminatory law against Australians. That concerns me greatly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a whole lot of other aspects of the detail that worry me, but in the time you have in this place, you cannot really talk about the great detail. If you are going to look at the legislation as it appears now, I am worried about some of the exemptions. If you are looking at clause 2 of the exemptions, I am worried at the extent to which a person, for example, is or is not allowed to refuse a blood transfusion. Because of the difficulties we have with AIDS and because of the problems with it, I can understand people saying, `I won't have a blood transfusion', quite apart from their religious views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am equally worried about whether or not a person can be required to have certain types of medical treatment. There are difficulties, as far as I am concerned, in all children not being immunised. I would like to have obligatory immunisation of children. I think that is a very worthwhile public health measure. I am concerned at the extent to which, in public health, this legislation really does not cover a number of those ambivalent issues. We all know that, as individuals and adults, if we go in for surgery we have an obligation&mdash;providing we are conscious and are able to accept the responsibility ourselves&mdash;to sign a form which says that appropriate medical treatment, anaesthesia and so on, can be provided to us. The same applies if we are the next of kin to a person who is unable to give that authorisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if a person is injured in a motor vehicle accident they have to be treated under the emergency conditions that apply to that particular patient. As far as I am concerned, that has to be allowed to continue. Were this bill to be passed, I do not want it in any way to prejudice those necessary treatments continuing. Indeed, as one who has been associated in a number of ways with people whose medical procedures have been withdrawn, and where they have been provided, I am particularly concerned that when you lay down the sorts of laws that apply in clause 2 you cover every known condition. I certainly do not want any individual to be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7788"> denied the right to say, at a time when a person is brain dead and is on some form of life support, that that life support should be withdrawn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have read clause 2 as it appears in each of the schedules. It does not really address the problem at all. All it says is that the Legislative Assembly shall have `power to'. If they do not exercise that power, does that mean that clause 1 is going to in any way inhibit that power? In other words, clause 1 is saying that there is to be no power with respect to euthanasia, as it is defined, but clause 2 provides the power. But if you do not exercise it and if the territories have not, in fact, applied a broad ranging law which allows them to withhold or provide medical or surgical measures, et cetera, does that mean that existing right is in any way going to be impeded?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am equally quite concerned that in the particular application, as it is defined in the application section, we are doing something that seems to me to be something that has always been, to my legal mind, bad law. That is, you are providing it subjectively. You are not really doing it as far as the law itself is concerned; you are treating it as a particular case&mdash;the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1993. So you are applying this law in a general sense to a particular law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My worry, being absolutely opposed to euthanasia, is that this is a bad piece of legislation. It is applied in the wrong way. We should not be discussing it in the manner we are now discussing it. I am genuinely very concerned that, by voting for it, people are not doing as they think they are. I think voting for it, as it stands now, is not doing as they think&mdash;voting against euthanasia. Rather, you are voting on an entirely different criteria. For that reason I confess that, having looked at it, I am still in my own mind very doubtful about whether I will give my support to it, even though I am totally against euthanasia. The legislation is such that I would like it withdrawn and redrafted&mdash;and I have half a mind to move an amendment to that effect.</PARA>

The estimated capacity available on passenger services in December 1995 was 7700 tonnes per week.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Yes. Male Call `96 is being conducted by Macquarie University. The Commonwealth Department of Health and Family Services has commissioned Professor Susan Kippax, from the National Centre in HIV Social Research at Macquarie University, to undertake the survey. The total cost of Male Call `96 is $350,163.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of Male Call `96 is to collect nationally consistent data on men who have sex with men and the extent to which they engage in practices which place them at risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV, other sexually transmissible diseases and hepatitis A, B and C. This group is being surveyed because men who have sex with men are a high priority for education and prevention under the soon to be released Third National HIV/AIDS Strategy. Male Call `96 repeats a national survey of men who have sex with men run in 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The findings of Male Call `96 will be used by the Commonwealth to evaluate the Strategy by assessing the extent to which men have changed their practices since the last time they were surveyed in 1992. The findings will also inform education and prevention programs developed by State and Territory Governments and non&hyphen;government organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the advertisements are to recruit men to participate in the survey by phoning the free call 1800 number. The advertising program is very similar to that used in 1992. The advertisements are designed to appeal to a broad cross section of men who have sex with men, which includes men who <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are married, bisexual or regard themselves as heterosexuals.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am aware that on 30 September 1996 a home&hyphen;made grenade was thrown into the garden of the Greek Orthodox Patriarch in Istanbul.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) On February 16 1995, a meeting was held with the Deputy Prime Minister, the Honourable Brian Howe and the Premier of Western Australia, the Honourable Richard Court, to discuss proposals for funding under the Better Cities mark 2 program. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7797"> The projects identified at this meeting were developed through a State&hyphen;Commonwealth steering committee, however negotiations on a final intergovernmental agreement between the two governments were not concluded prior to the federal election in March 1996. Nor was such an agreement entered subsequently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) On 17 July 1996, I announced that no new projects under the Better Cities programmes would be entered into. Furthermore, the 1996/7 budget does not provide for any new projects in the Better Cities Mark 2 Program. Accordingly, there is no opportunity for the WA Government to now enter into an agreement in relation to the projects referred to in question No. 463.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V5">Mr Williams</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Paragraph 42(1)(a) of the Marriage Act 1961 provides that a marriage shall not be solemnised unless in notice in writing of the intended marriage has been given in accordance with section 42 and has been received by the authorised celebrant solemnising the marriage not earlier than 6 months before the date of the marriage and not later than 1 month before the date of the marriage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The parties do not have to be in Australia when Notice is signed or given. The Notice may be given by post, or delivered by an agent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A `prescribed authority' may, if satisfied that the circumstances of the particular case justify so doing, authorise an authorised celebrant to solemnise a marriage, or where the prescribed authority is also an authorised celebrant and there is no other  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7798"> authorised celebrant suitable to the parties conveniently available, solemnise a marriage himself or herself, notwithstanding that the notice of the intended marriage has been received later than 1 month before the date of the marriage (subsection 42(5)).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)&amp;(3) I am unable to provide this information. Records of marriages in New South Wales are maintained by the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages, a State official, under the provisions of the Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act 1995, a State Act. That Act expressly provides that `(i)n providing information extracted from the Register, the Registrar must as far as practicable, protect the persons to whom the entries in the Register relate from unjustified intrusion on their privacy'. I am assured by the Registrar there is no evidence of any breach of, or irregularity under, the Marriage Act 1961 having occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) There is no proposal currently under consideration for any amendment to the provisions of the Marriage Act 1961 relating to the giving of notice of an intended marriage or to the shortening of such notice. The Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages points out that the majority of shortenings of time are granted to Australian citizens or residents who find themselves in unusual circumstances.</PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON></ANSWERS.TO.QUESTIONS></HANSARD>
