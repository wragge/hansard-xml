<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill seeks to amend the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995. The Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995 was put in place to ensure that the Commonwealth was repaid when people who have used Medicare or nursing homes receive a compensation payout to cover these costs. In practice the act forced insurers to withhold payouts to people injured at work or in motor vehicle accidents until any debt owing to the Commonwealth was paid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act was passed with bipartisan support during the life of the last parliament. The act took effect on 1 February this year but it has become quite obvious that there have been significant delays in the early operation of the act. This has meant that many people have been forced to wait several months to receive their payouts. In many cases the sums which are owed to the people concerned are considerable and interest only accrues up until the date of the court judgment or the date of settlement. No interest is earned during the period of the delay by the person who has been injured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several of my own constituents have suffered as a result of these delays. One in particular had a payment of $75,000 frozen for several months while he and the Health Insurance Commission exchanged letters to seek to determine how much was specifically owed to the Commonwealth. This case has now been resolved, but I have been contacted by a very large number of other Labor members and senators who have raised further cases of individual hardship. This is the issue that the bill will address, how to speed up the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> release of compensation payments while protecting the Commonwealth's right to be repaid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aim of the bill is to change the withholding requirements. Rather than withholding the entire compensation amount, this bill will only withhold the total amount of Medicare benefits paid since the injury occurred. In the majority of cases this will mean that claimants will receive over 90 per cent of their payout within 14 days of the settlement of their claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key amendment requires that, once a case has been settled, the Health Insurance Commission at the claimant's request must provide within 14 days a notice giving the total amount of Medicare benefits paid on the claimant's behalf since the injury occurred. Only this total of the Medicare benefits payments will be deducted from the compensation sum and the balance will be released to the person who has been injured. Having subsequently negotiated about which of the withheld benefits are to be repaid, the claimant will then receive the balance of any other amount withheld within three months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are well balanced amendments which will enable people to get earlier access to the majority of their compensation payouts while ensuring that the Commonwealth does not lose out. I was pleased to note recently that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) also expressed concern in the House about this problem. I have to say I am a little disappointed that in answer to a dorothy dixer in question time he scored a few political points but did not indicate whether he would be supporting a legislative change to address the problem. I therefore hope that the minister will support my private member's bill to address this matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the support of the member for Chifley on every occasion. No doubt the minister and his department, like the opposition, have received many calls and letters from people who have been affected by these delays. The minister has certainly been aware since 22 May when he scored those cheap political points here in question time. The minister should also be aware of the diff <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> iculties that have been caused by the legislation which both parties supported during the life of the last parliament. In fact he quoted cases of people who have had lump sums of up to $1 million being delayed by very small amounts owing to Medicare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter of deep regret that to date the minister has not announced any action or intention to legislate to address these problems. It is my hope that this private member's bill will not only get speedy consideration, but at the very least this private member's bill will increase the pressure on the minister to come up with a proposal which ensures that people are not unfairly treated by unreasonable delays in releasing compensation payments. I commend the bill to the House and I seek leave to present an explanatory memorandum on the operation of the bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not every Australian has had recourse to use the Office of the Ombudsman and, in terms of Commonwealth agencies, it is a very modest office costing a little over $8 million a year. I should say to the House that, in 1994&hyphen;95, 4,565 written complaints and 12,444 oral complaints were received, making a total of 17,019 of our fellow Australians seeking to use the Ombudsman.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The office of Ombudsman is one of the important cornerstones of our human rights infrastructure in Australia. It is fair to say, and I will quote from a parliamentary report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most honourable members on either side, and senators for that matter, support human rights in this place.</PARA>
<PARA>A lot of members were particularly concerned about newspaper reports that the budget of the Office of the Ombudsman was going to be cut quite severely in this budget round. It caused <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2530"> me some concern. In the child support inquiry, I got to know the Ombudsman, Philippa Smith, very well. It became a real puzzle to me why her consistent criticism of the Child Support Agency had been neglected by the parliament and the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill seeks to redress a situation about which I have some concern&mdash;that is, the Ombudsman tables her report as a statutory office holder in the parliament each year and, regrettably, no committee of this House actually looks at that report. This parliament could set up a joint committee&mdash;and it is not proposed that it would have a permanent secretariat&mdash;which would meet on a needs basis, receive her report and make sure that appropriate action was taken. Over 40,000 of our fellow Australians sought recourse to the Ombudsman in 1994-95. She has brought down a very useful report, and I will quote a few lines:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As an externally independent review agency, the Ombudsman can and does, to use the words of Justice Lee, bring the lamp of scrutiny to otherwise dark places, even over the resistance to those who would draw the blinds.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we are talking about public service departments, Commonwealth agencies, ordinary citizens and, I might say, small businessmen, if you read this report, who have been forced as a matter of last resort to contact the Ombudsman to secure their rights under the law because the Ombudsman insists that public administration must be consistent with the law. More than that, she highlights shortcomings either in her powers or in trends of the law. For example, she notes in her latest report that `there is much contracting out within the Commonwealth public sector'. She does not object to it but she highlights the fact that these are creating new complaints and new areas of concern and that legislation is deficient. Something needs to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot report to the House that anything is being done about her report. My bill will redress that situation. She points out where people have exceeded their powers, for example, in relation to a customs search. When ordinary citizens or small business approach the Ombudsman, they do not go to the chamber magistrate and they do not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> engage a solicitor or a barrister because the service is free of charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The guts of the private member's bill is this: it is not the Ombudsman who has failed the parliament; it is the parliament who has failed the Ombudsman and the 40,000 of our fellow Australians who have contacted the Ombudsman. We are declining to listen to the needs of the people who have contacted the Ombudsman. I seek leave to present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> condemns the racist comments made during the last federal election campaign and deplores the use of racism as a tool from which to gain political mileage;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> recognises that Australians, whatever their race, creed or political beliefs, should never become victims of racial vilification or denigration;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> recognises the achievements of Australia's indigenous population and endorses the continuing process of reconciliation between non&hyphen;indigenous and indigenous Australians; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> recognises the achievements of Australia's immigration policy since 1945.</PARA>
<PARA>Calling someone a racist is quite rightly an accusation not to be made lightly. However, it is a word that is used carelessly at times. In the past, we have all seen it aimed unfairly at people who had a genuine interest in discussing our country's immigration policy. It is a charge that has been unjustly thrown at people concerned that the government's policies on indigenous Australians were not working as effectively as they could have been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is often a fine line that divides sensible commentary on these issues and racial vilification. We should be able to accept that people can walk that fine line without necessarily tipping over into racism. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2531"> We should defend their right to speak about these issues at all times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The word `racism' to me carries with it strong connotations and evokes pictures in my mind which I take no great pleasure in revisiting. I am reminded of sitting on a train in tears as a young person while the passengers behind me were insulted and abused in front of the entire carriage by a respectably dressed gentleman simply because they were speaking in their own language. I am reminded of my husband's stories about his experiences of racism as a result of his Italian heritage&mdash;never mind the fact that he was born in Broken Hill. I am reminded of the personal testimonies concerning racism, often involving verbal and sometimes even physical abuse, made to me by my constituents during my 25 years in public life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet, while racism is a charge not to be made flippantly, we should never shrink from its use when appropriate. Each of us has a duty&mdash;and I say `us' meaning all Australians, not just members of parliament&mdash;to stand up and expose racism wherever it exists. Racism is insidious. It can spread like a cancer through our society. For it to run unchecked is to ask for it to consume us from within until we can no longer stand out against it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Racism is nothing new. Australia has had its own experiences with racism just as every other nation on earth has been touched by it. In the past, through our ignorance and naivete, racism was officially sanctioned in legislation and the constitution&mdash;I am referring, of course, to the White Australia policy and our past treatment of Australia's indigenous people, only granting them the status of Australian citizenship via referendum in 1967. Yet, like many, I thought those days were far behind us. My seat of Prospect is one of the most ethnically diverse in the country and yet the level of racial disharmony remains, thankfully, incredibly small&mdash;a testament to the success of Australian immigration policy since 1945.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought the Australia portrayed in John O'Grady's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">They're a Weird Mob</EMPHASIS>&mdash;a nation comically uncertain and suspicious of outsiders&mdash;had long since vanished. It was during the last election campaign that I realised how <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wrong I had been. Rather than simply existing among a small lunatic fringe, it seems that racism is still alive and well in mainstream Australian society&mdash;a fact evidenced by the comments made by certain candidates during the campaign, and from the massive support some of these people received on election day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The election had not even been called when on Australia Day, of all days, we heard the first of what would be many racist remarks by pre-selected candidates across the country. That first racist remark came from northern Queensland and was echoed, via our nation's media, to all corners of the country. What sickened me was that this particular person, after making this and other comments, rather than recognising their tastelessness or their capacity to offend most Australians, went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Judging by the response in the local media . . . and slaps on the back we've had as we've been going around the shopping centres and doing our normal doorstops on the hustings and knocking on doors, I would say the kerfuffle that happened would be worth about 90 per cent positive for us in this seat.</PARA>
<PARA>For this man, racism had seemingly brought instant reward&mdash;and in the end it did prove to be a winner of sorts. This particular candidate on election day, whilst not gaining a seat in this parliament, managed to elicit close to a seven per cent swing in his vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With no small thanks to a campaign based on racial vilification and denigration, other candidates managed to go that one step further and take their seats in this place. One victorious candidate said that her win was for the `white community' and that now in Canberra she would fight for `anyone apart from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders'&mdash;a comment which I take as a slur upon our country's democratic traditions and our role as representatives of the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own election battle in the seat of Prospect, one candidate, encouraged by the idea of receiving electoral reward for his racism, suggested that Australia's immigration policy was `skewed' in favour of particular races and that he would like to see more `northern Europeans'. I could go on and on, but that would be unnecessary. I am sure all <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2532"> honourable members are familiar with what comments were made and by whom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people made their insidious comments cloaked by the argument that they were bucking against `political correctness'. Their twisted logic figured that racial vilification was okay because for far too long Australians had been told what to think by the `thought police' in Canberra and that now they were fighting back. The great smokescreen of `anti-political correctness' was being used by these candidates to justify racism, pure and simple.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did not hear a sensible and judicious questioning by these candidates of the government's immigration policy, as is every Australian's right; we heard gutter talk about `slanty-eyed ideologues'. We did not hear these candidates raise discussions on the merits of citizenship; we heard base references to `dewogging ceremonies'. We did not hear from these candidates constructive criticism on ways in which the government could better structure or focus its policies on Aboriginal Australians; we heard hate-mongering and contemptible sneers about `how the blacks have never had it so good'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think it is an exaggeration for me to say that these candidates searched voters for feelings of economic uncertainty and concern for the future&mdash;those same feelings which were tapped by the Nazis prior to 1933. They sought out this uncertainty, and they gave it a focus. They found a target against which these feelings could be expressed. They gave their supporters a scapegoat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been suggested by some that these candidates deserve nothing but our ridicule and that we should marginalise them. I reject this argument. These people stopped existing on our periphery when they achieved national exposure for their comments and vaulted their way into federal parliament. We need to condemn them&mdash;publicly and persistently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am reminded of a quote from Martin Niemoller:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When Hitler attacked the Jews I was not a Jew, therefore, I was not concerned. And when Hitler attacked the Catholics, I was not a Catholic, and therefore, I was not concerned. And when Hitler attacked the unions and the industrialists, I was not a member of the unions and I was not concerned. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Then, Hitler attacked me and the Protestant church&mdash;and there was nobody left to be concerned.</PARA>
<PARA>The lesson is there: we cannot afford not to be concerned about this racism in our midst. It reflects upon us all. It threatens us all. Australia has a rich history of bipartisan support on matters concerning race and ethnicity. Let us join together once more in this spirit and again condemn racism of all kinds&mdash;and in particular those who seek to profit from its use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have much to be proud of in our past immigration policies and our present determination to bring about Aboriginal reconciliation. Let us not allow the racists in our ranks to hold us back or sap our strength on these issues. Let us treat them with the contempt and scorn they so richly deserve. That is why I commend the motion appearing in my name on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak to this motion today. I congratulate the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) on putting it forward and I must say that I agree with her comments made here today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most people in this House are here to do some good for Australia and are motivated by a strong sense of duty to the Australian people. This has been reflected in many of the maiden speeches that have been made since the new government was elected, and I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate people who have made their maiden speeches and who have referred to their personal hope and idealism for a better Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also a great pleasure to sit in this House with, for example, the member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro). She is the first female of Australian&hyphen;Italian origin to take a seat in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already said in this House that, `regardless of which side of the chamber we sit on, we represent one nation'. It is a pity that only a handful of individuals in this place, none of whom can be described as being major players in Australian politics, have made unfortunate remarks in the lead-up <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2533"> to the recent election. It has guaranteed them a level of publicity they would otherwise not have attracted. Their agendas are not in the best interests of Australia, nor are they supported by the major political parties represented in parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Often their defence has been the comment that, as a democratic body, the parliament is here to represent all opinions in the Australian community. That may well be true, but elected members also have an obligation to show leadership in the area of social consciousness and enlightenment. This is how the Westminster form of government has evolved into the most effective way to guarantee rights and liberties to all individuals and why it has been imitated throughout the world as a model to ensure progressive social policy. I am sure that these sentiments are shared by the vast majority of members in this House&mdash;they are typically broad&hyphen;minded and inclusive and would not wish to linger on divisiveness and the tired debates which have racist overtones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), who is a former member of the Labor Party, made the comment in 1991 as an ALP member that reform such as the New South Wales racial vilification law is `not the proper vehicle to teach such morality. In a democracy the truth should never be proclaimed by the state'. I disagree. Morality is generated by families and by tradition and enlightenment within the larger community and by the fears and the needs of that community. If it is not proclaimed and enshrined in the state then where else?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the now Independent member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) made inappropriate comments during the campaign the Liberal Party acted quickly and decisively and her endorsement was removed. The member for Kalgoorlie for years had been making inappropriate comments in addressing right wing fringe groups and it took Labor years to expel him. The Liberal Party condemns, and in the words of the motion of this House, `the use of racism as a tool from which to gain political mileage'.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Ms Hanson" NAMEID="BK6">

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8V5">Ms WORTH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For her own benefit, I remind the member that she has not made her maiden speech and it might be in her best interests to listen. The Liberal Party believes in individuals. It is therefore naturally suspicious of generalisations and assumptions about groups or communities of various peoples. The Liberal Party&mdash;I am happy to say&mdash;has and will continue to embrace multiculturalism and real reconciliation with our indigenous communities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Debate surrounding these issues has often been vigorous, but the intention and motivation has always been to deliver the best possible assistance to new Australians and to indigenous Australians. The Liberal Party also believes that, again in the words of the motion before us, `Australians, whatever their race, creed or political beliefs, should never become victims of racial vilification or denigration'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own electorate of Adelaide it has been a longstanding privilege for me to work with the various communities and to attend the many social functions hosted by the immigrant and ethnic communities. It reminds me of Australia's outstanding history of immigration which I will go on to discuss. In the last few months I have attended St Patrick's Day festivities, the celebration of the Vietnamese, Chinese and Cambodian new years and Greek and Italian festivals. I have also been involved in organising the most successful meeting between John Howard and leaders of the Greek community in mid&hyphen;1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Twenty&hyphen;five per cent of all my constituents in Adelaide were born overseas and we live harmoniously together. During the recent campaign, I am proud of the fact that members of the Italian, Greek and Vietnamese communities all were associated with my campaign and helped me. I am most happy to have been associated with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the wake of the vast exodus from Europe after World War II, Australia agreed to participate in an international scheme to resettle many of the world's displaced persons. Although the White Australia policy was officially removed from the ALP platform in 1965, it received widespread support from some individual members within that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2534"> party for many years after. In the late 1940s, the ALP refused the Japanese wives of ex&hyphen;servicemen entry into Australia. In 1949 Labor's War&hyphen;time Refugee Removal Act was intended to expel some 9,000 Asian refugees who had decided to stay in Australia after the war. One of the first acts of the Menzies government was to allow these people to stay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1966 the Liberal government abolished the White Australia policy which had been in place since Federation. During the 1960s the Liberals also abolished the discrimination against non&hyphen;Europeans with respect to various pensions and social services. In 1977 the Fraser government accepted Vietnamese boat people. The decision was vehemently opposed by the ACTU and its then president, former Prime Minister Bob Hawke. A bipartisan approach to this issue was not possible given Labor's concern about the possible anti-communist background of these people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1978 the Fraser government expanded the terms of the family reunion scheme and the nine principles adopted to guide immigration policy at that time remain essentially unchanged to this day. In the late 1970s the Department of Immigration was renamed the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, and the Ethnic Affairs Council and the Federation of Ethnic Community Councils of Australia were established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's immigration policy since 1945 has indeed been impressive, not only because of the numbers that have come to this country but also because of the cultural changes that we have seen. People tell me all the time in the electorate that we no longer just have fish and chip shops; we now have different restaurants and cafes on the footpaths. The different accents that one hears blend in and I am sure that has made us a much better country. We are also a very much more tolerant society than we were and the envy of other parts of the world for the way that we have managed to live with tolerance and harmony. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has recently stated that the coalition:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . remains committed to reconciliation. That commitment can't stop us from ensuring the full accountability of all those who have the taxpayers' money for the expenditure of that money, and ATSIC is no different and the Aboriginal Legal <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Service is no different from any other agency of Government . . . which is funded by the Australian taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no legitimate ground for the leaders of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community in Australia to believe that the new Government . . . is going to stop the process of genuine reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA>As set out in the coalition's election commitments, reconciliation cannot proceed `until disadvantages in health, housing, education and unemployment and the high incarceration rates are overcome'. These are big challenges but they must be met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite over $1 billion in funding per year, the Aboriginal health, housing, education and employment prospects remain miserable. All Australians are exasperated by the lack of progress and the failure of this high level of funding to make inroads into the high level of disadvantaged people witnessed in our Aboriginal communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As stated in the coalition's pre-election statement on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, indigenous health is the worst of any indigenous group in the developed world. Indigenous unemployment is four times that of other Australians and is rising despite increases in community development employment program funding. Less than a third of Aboriginal children complete secondary school. My own studies of Aboriginal health in places like Burke, Wilcannia and Walgett reveal wide&hyphen;ranging criticism of ATSIC and a desire, particularly from Aboriginal women in those communities, for a real change in the way it is administered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Direct Commonwealth assistance to indigenous Australians commenced under Prime Minister Gorton, while the McMahon government introduced funding for land purchases and commercial development in 1976.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased that on this occasion we again have an example of the way in which both sides of this House can find common ground. The member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) has been followed by the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), and both have made I think very substantial contributions which do honour to this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I think there is a temptation amongst some of the critics of positions that are taken by the government and by the opposition to say that there is some lack of capacity for debate when mainstream parties find common ground, that they are squeezed out. They sometimes call this political correctness. The truth is we should not underestimate the value to the Australian community that comes from the great political parties of this country finding common ground on some issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I have been critical of some fraying at the edge of that bipartisanship in the area of immigration and ethnic affairs, for which I have responsibility as a shadow minister. I have been critical of the two-year waiting period decision of the coalition. I think, ironically, it will have an effect quite contrary to that which has been perhaps at the back of the minds of some who have supported that. It seems highly likely that if people are forced into situations where they are compelled to wait two years without benefits, were that to occur, and without a proper safety net then only the very wealthy or the desperate would come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When that situation is coupled with an emphasis on English language skills, then, paradoxically, it is highly likely that our immigration intake would be skewed further towards those from the Asian region rather than towards what used to be traditional source countries. These are the ironies and paradoxes that emerge when one, in a sense, seeks to indirectly achieve that which is indefensible directly.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is true to say that since the days of Malcolm Fraser we generally have found ourselves in broad agreement, and that has been very important for us as a community, as a nation. It is not surprising that there are still some within the Australian community who do not agree with the positions that are taken by both major parties, the National Party and the Democrats on this area of policy. Why is that? Because for a very long period of time we did have, supported by both sides of the Australian political system, a White Australia policy. It is within my lifetime that that policy existed and was maintained and defended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is hardly surprising that there are some within our Australian community who still feel troubled by that change. It will be fertile ground for demagogues and those who wish to play the racist card in public life in any society. Le Pen in France is a good example of that, as are some of the more recent phenomena that we have seen in Australia. I simply hope that the good sense and the tolerance of the Australian community are able to reject those appeals to intolerance that may have been exampled in some other societies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> gives some reason for confidence in that. Whilst there is concern about the level of migration intake into Australia, the huge preponderance of people who expressed that concern sheeted it home to concern about unemployment. I say straightforwardly that there are many academics of good standing who would say that that concern is unplaced, not justified, and that in fact bringing people in from overseas is actually an employment stimulator. But, of course, that runs counter&hyphen;intuitively; it runs against people's own gut instincts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concern expressed about immigration was not based on racial grounds. Indeed, there was overwhelmingly strong support by much more than a simple majority for our programs of multiculturalism, programs which were endorsed by both sides. I think it is very important in this debate for us to stand up strongly and endorse the principles of the member for Prospect.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2536">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I turn to some of the documents that have been circulated more recently by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). She has produced a fairly misleading set of documents that suggest that Aboriginal people in Australia are treated in a way which is prejudicially to their benefit, to a degree which is unjustifiable. Let us be blunt: firstly, if you look at indices of disadvantage in Australia, Aboriginal Australians are up there right at the top. Secondly, her data was wrong. For example, she claimed there was no program for children in rural Australia. There is, and it is the assistance for isolated children scheme. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point made is that we should not keep on saying it. I do not think that is right. I do not think we should keep speaking about multiculturalism, for instance, in the form that the honourable member for Prospect has raised it. The debate should not be about multiculturalism itself but about how to make it work even better than it has been working in the past. We have one of the great migration programs in the world&mdash;we are one of the great multicultural nations of the world&mdash;and I do not think we should be talking about that in any form other than how we should be making it even better. Different to what has been said today, we should keep <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> saying that it is great to have a migration program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third paragraph of the honourable member's motion states that the House `recognises the achievements of Australia's indigenous population'. I feel very strongly about that. Whilst, without doubt, there have been some advances made in Aboriginal affairs, the fact is that when you look at the socioeconomic standing of the Aboriginal community vis-a-vis the white community, you see that they have gone backwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think it is right for us to talk about the achievements of the indigenous people when they continue to have the worst socioeconomic standing of anyone in Australia, the most disadvantaged in Australia. Whilst we are talking about indigenous people having made advances, all I am saying is that the advances have been mediocre compared with what white Australians have achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spent a lot of time on Aboriginal affairs. I have spent three years travelling all around New South Wales. I have been from the north to the south and the east to the west. I have seen the struggle of the Aboriginal community&mdash;in many instances not their fault but the fault of the white administration that has been put in to oversee their progress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second paragraph of the honourable member's motion states that the House `recognises that Australians, whatever their race, creed or political beliefs, should never become victims of racial vilification or denigration'. The fact is that all parliaments in all states have sufficient legislation to deal with racist comments or racial vilification. If the honourable member had specific matters that she wanted to raise in this parliament, then let us talk in specifics rather than in generalities. It does upset people to say that racial vilification or denigration goes on without there being any grounds for action being taken to stop it. In fact, I think there are sufficient measures in place in a free society to deal with this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first paragraph of the honourable member's motion states that the House `condemns the racist comments made during the last federal election campaign and deplores <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2537"> the use of racism'. There is no question that I agree with her in regard to that first part of her motion. There is absolutely no reason for people to use racist comments to try and improve their standing in the electorate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a recent Sydney Town Hall Liberal Party bunfest, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . importantly, one of the other goals I set myself, was quite simply to bring about a restoration where people felt a little more freely, if the mood struck them, to talk about controversial issues without fear of being branded as a racist or some kind of other bigot for daring to raise those subjects.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, that comment was eerily reminiscent of the response of the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) on 22 February to comments by a number of his candidates. He said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  that he deplored `politically correct agenda setters' and that he was concerned that his own comments would be overmagnified and that the media would `ratchet up a few more notches in magnification of every utterance deemed to be either incorrect or unusual or whatever'. He went on to say that he felt people were stopping debate on migration by these kinds of allegations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting to note that when he was pressed as to his own views on migration, the total sum of his conclusion was that he would support no large increases in the near future. For those of us interested in the debate, that is a fairly minimal contribution as to the very substantial issues around the place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was, of course, responding not to one problem on his side of the House but to a very significant number, an example being the contributions of the National Party leader in New South Wales and the federal member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) in their endeavours to confuse and aggravate their electorates by fanciful comments that Aboriginals were going to be moved out of Redfern to Broken Hill and Parkes and rural New South Wales. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> That was one of the measures he had to respond to at that time. He also had to respond to the member representing Mount Isa in western Queensland when he talked of slanty&hyphen;eyed people dictating policy in this country. He said afterwards, `I was only referring to the Spanish inquisition. I really wasn't making any racist comments referring to people of Asian extraction.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are talking of people of Asian extraction, we had Dr Lim from the Northern Territory, who also made a big contribution to the policy area. He made a reference to `niggers in the woodpile'. I know there are some who might say, `He's Asian, so he's got more right to be racist.' I do not accept that. That was another comment in this policy area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been many references to a candidate, Mr Burgess. His big thing in life was that citizenship ceremonies were `de-wogging'. He is supposedly able to defend that because he was born overseas or something and therefore it was not an attempt to put people down; it was simply a nice expression on the way through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, we have someone slightly more prominent than the Leader of the National Party in New South Wales&mdash;that is, the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. His contribution in December 1995 was to say that it was a matter of individual judgment as to whether the word `coon' was offensive. Once again, we have people in very prominent positions on the other side of politics saying these things. I am not saying that they are representative of the whole party, but we face a very big danger if these comments are not hit very hard. Some have; we know that one candidate was deprived of endorsement in Oxley. When we start hearing excuses such as, `Anyone attacking these people is trying to dictate people's beliefs, they are attempting to set up the thought police and they are attempting to dictate what is politically correct,' then we do have some concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Premier of Victoria perhaps had the response that a few people such as Tim Fischer should have had on this matter. Premier Kennett noted on 15 February:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bob Katter and his colleagues have to be mugs of the first order. I don't know how people like that can honestly stand for political office claiming to  represent all of their community equally.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, there have been a series of comments. I cannot be as positive about the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald</EMPHASIS>  poll as my colleague who spoke earlier. We have a degree of concern in the electorate about the level of migration. We do have to care about this policy area. There has been a very strong bipartisanship over the last decade. If that bipartisanship is frayed at the edges, if the ante is upped and if people attempt to exploit these past political differences, we are unfortunately going to get increased conjecture and increased problems for this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to add my support to the motion of the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio). I commend her most sincerely for bringing it before the House. I believe that it is an issue where we need to be bipartisan and not score political points, because Australia has come a very long way. We need to be proud of the distance that we have travelled in relation to ethnic and racial prejudice, but we still have a long way to go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Prospect raised issues of extreme importance to Australian society. I began my work analysing Australian race relations back in the early 1970s. That led to my documentary history, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aborigines in white Australia: a documentary history of the attitudes affecting official policy and the Australian Aborigine</EMPHASIS>, which was one of the first Australian reference books to document the evolution of relationships and our transition from intolerance to a recognition of the need to do much better to ensure equality of life experience and respect for all in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The classic American sociologist, Gordon Allport, wrote many years ago that, `Racial prejudice is uneconomic, it is fertile ground for violence and war, it is trivialising to human reason, and is not, never has been and never will be a good thing in human society.' Throughout history, societies have made sharp distinctions between `them' and `us'&mdash;in other words, the home community and outsiders. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The step from differentiating one group from another to attributing inferior qualities to the other is very small but is not inevitable or immutable. We have to learn from a very early age that to be different is not to be inferior.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until 1965 Aboriginal men and women working in the northern Australian pastoral industry, for example, were not paid wages but, instead, received rations. These rations were often of the poorest quality. In granting equal pay, however, the tribunal excluded women workers and inserted a slow worker clause, giving an out to the employer who could then pay a minimum rate in protecting the European worker. How did we justify that? We referred to racial differences. We referred to the fact that the Aboriginal worker was somehow innately less able to put in a hard day's work and was somehow less physically able to sustain long, hard work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a great deal of evidence to suggest that racism, ethnic prejudice and its consequences are very often the unconscious rationalisation of economic exploitation, particularly in our country. When resources become scarce, one group will often justify their greater access or winning of what is to be had by some reference to the other's racial or ethnic inferiority. For example, when the gold started to run out last century, the Chinese, who were numerous and diligent on the gold fields and did a lot better than some of our European ancestors, became the focus of Australian racial hatred, vilification and eventually violence. This hatred became institutionalised in the poll taxes levied on Chinese arriving and in attempts to exclude them altogether from mining in the territories where gold was found later in the century. It eventually fed into the White Australia policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the struggle for work among the less skilled and tradesmen intensified at the turn of the century, the white workers in the fledgling trade union movements banded together for white labour only policies. Much of the furniture produced at the turn of the century was stamped very neatly on the back `European labour only'.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2539">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we have come a very long way from all of that. Our language and our literature and, more importantly, our laws reflect that long, hard path that we have travelled. Today most of us stand proud to list the differences among the cultural groups which make up our pluralist society. At the same time, however, we must ensure that, wherever there is pressure in some part of our society, whenever the poorest of one group find themselves competing with the poorest of another, we do not allow those differences to be exploited by reference to racial inferiority or ethnic difference as some sort of rationalisation for one group getting more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have come a long way since we applauded Sir Paul Hasluck in 1951 for announcing the assimilation policy. We moved on from assimilation to integration. Now we have to be vigilant that we glorify the differences in our community and never again make reference to the fact that to be different is to be unequal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I therefore support the member for Prospect and the other speakers who spoke in a similar vein most strongly. I hope that this record of our concerns will be used and reflected upon in years to come.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In resuming the debate on this motion, I would say that one thing the government and the general community should actively be discouraging is the blatant scaremongering among some people in the anti-gun law group. I received a mock media release dated the year 2000 in the mail just this week and I will read two paragraphs from it. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last Sunday night Northern Australia was invaded by up to 1,000,000 Asian soldiers and militias using thousands of new plastic landing craft deployed from high speed aluminium supercats.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The invading forces are concentrating on every outlying community and isolated station owners and mining sites. They are shooting the males from long range then dismembering them, raping the women and shooting or slashing the kids and babies to death.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the voice of an insignificantly small percentage of Australians, but it is surely one that should be discouraged. In Townsville, the sporting and recreational shooters have put forward their views in a very considered way. I have passed on their suggestions and comments to the Attorney-General (Mr Williams).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other side of all of that is represented in the 300 or so letters of support I have received in my office only in the last two <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2540"> weeks. There has been a tremendous response indeed. Research in Queensland shows massive support for the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). For example, some research I have access to asked the question: do you agree that a total ban on a range of guns is necessary&mdash;that is, automatic and semiautomatics? Ninety per cent of people in metropolitan areas said yes and 80 per cent in regional areas said yes. The question was also asked: do you agree that the proposed restriction on gun ownership is fair? Basically, 80 per cent of people in metropolitan and regional areas said yes. The third question was: do you agree that a national approach involving all Commonwealth-state governments is the best for all Australians? Virtually 90 per cent of all Australians, both in metropolitan and regional areas, said yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think I can do no more than appropriately read a letter sent to me by licensed gun owners, Don and Tess Fisher, from Pallarenda in Townsville. Bear in mind that Don and Tess are gun owners. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are very concerned by the vociferous and highly organised attitude of the gun lobby in attempting to deny the silent majority of Australians the right to feel safe in their own land. Indeed, if this highly orchestrated and over promoted campaign does not succeed in its purpose for the reasons it gives then the rest of us must give thought to arming ourselves with similar quick&hyphen;firing, high&hyphen;powered weapons in order to protect our families from the extremists now appearing in their ranks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We suggest to you that the silent majority will remain just that in the face of such an army of roughnecks as seen on nightly news broadcasts. Who among us wants to be in the sights of another hate filled and righteously indignant gun nut bent upon winning such a brutal, divisive argument? It is precisely because of these people that high powered military style weapons exist in this country today. Who in their right mind needs such things in Australia other than professional shooters licensed to destroy large feral animals? Be assured that there is a vast majority of intimidated people like us who regard the attitudes and arguments presented by the gun industry and its customers as abhorrent; that if their threats to politicians, law and order and their fellow citizens prevail, then this country faces a future more violent than anything we have witnessed so far, made so by the gun enthusiasts leading this campaign against democratic reform. Legislation providing for the control of all guns must be enacted now, with extremely <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> harsh penalties appended for non-compliance. Anything less is betrayal.</PARA>
<PARA>I can understand a number of the arguments that have been raised. A significant group of people who have owned guns for a considerable length of time have, all of a sudden, been told that some of their firearms will no longer be legal.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am thankful for the opportunity to be able to speak today on a private member's motion relating to the tragic events which happened in Port Arthur close on two months ago now. Like many other Tasmanians, I can relate personally to many of those affected by what occurred on that fateful day in April. I, like other members speaking in this debate, and especially being from Tasmania, wish to place on record my appreciation to all those who were involved in the aftermath of that tragic day&mdash;the police, the emergency service workers and, especially, the dedicated staff of the Royal Hobart Hospital.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has happened, both in Tasmania and in other states, since that tragic afternoon late in April. We are now in a position where most states have introduced national uniform gun laws into their parliaments. Hopefully, we will soon be at the stage where we can take it for granted that these commonsense laws are in place and operational, and we can then go on and address other pressing issues confronting the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a crying shame, in my eyes, that we as a nation needed such a tragedy to galvanise us into doing something which should have been put in place many years ago. To claim our federation structure is the reason behind our vacillation is a real cop&hyphen;out. Parliamentarians of all persuasions have hidden behind excuses for too long. Some have even been <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2541"> seduced by the supposed threat from the gun lobbies into total inaction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my mind, it is a real shame that we have seen such a polarisation of sections of the community over this gun issue. We had examples of this on the weekend in Hobart, Tasmania, where a pro- and an anti-gun rally were held at the same time, less than a kilometre apart. The vast majority of those pictured in the media as being the real redneck pro&hyphen;gun lobby are, in my mind, disaffected citizens who are frustrated with the process and the total lack of information available to them. They have been preyed upon by the fringe idiots in Australian society who have their own agenda to run.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a federal member, I too am frustrated at having to waste my valuable time and that of my staff in trying to second&hyphen;guess what is going to be decided with regard to genuine collectors, farmers, shooters competing at national and international competitions and bona fide members of registered gun clubs. We cannot get the information. If people cannot get the information and read and disseminate it amongst their friends, of course they are going to get frustrated. As I have said, we have some fringe idiots in this part of the world who will seize on the opportunity that arises from that. I think that this frustration has occurred primarily because of the process that has been adopted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fine to have a meeting of police ministers at which to adopt a national approach to this vexed issues and draft national laws. But why, oh why were the various national peak bodies which have a genuine interest in, and concern for, this issue not consulted so that we could have a general consensus approach put down in the first place? We are now faced with both pro&hyphen; and anti-gun groups being uncertain of what lies ahead. This uncertainty has been seized upon by the fringe idiots.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) for bringing this motion relating to the incident at Port Arthur before the parliament and for allowing a few members to say a few words on the tightening of the gun laws. As we know, after the tragic events in Port Arthur the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) came back to the parliament and, like all Australians, and representing all Australians, was outraged and saddened by what had happened. He immediately said that he would do something about tightening the gun laws. Therefore, he looked at a set of regulations or a method that he thought would be best to tighten these gun laws.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of people are saying that this was a knee&hyphen;jerk reaction. I do not think it was. I believe that the Federal Committee on Violence that was set up after the Melbourne outrage had been meeting for some time. It had made various recommendations over the years. The meeting of police ministers had also made recommendations. So a lot of those things were already in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the years different governments, as the previous member, the member for Franklin (Mr Quick), has said, have not wanted to do anything about it; they had put it in the too-hard basket. The Prime Minister decided that something would be done. I think that the Australian people would have been upset had he not moved to do something. So he brought forward these ideas, which he put to the states. Of course, the various states are considering legislation to tighten gun laws so that there can be uniform gun laws throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been to meetings and have spent a lot of time answering phone calls relating to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2542"> this issue. I try to answer all of the calls. As the previous member also said, it would have been wise to get some information out earlier so that people would know that most of them would not be seriously affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, some people are affected. Like the Prime Minister, I would like to apologise to those people. Many people in my electorate have phoned me. Most of the people&mdash;I would say about 99.9 per cent&mdash;whom I have spoken to on the phone and at the meetings have been law-abiding, well&hyphen;adjusted and reasonable citizens who really are only trying to do the things that they used to do in the past in a legal and sensible way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, it is the same for everything that we do. I often say to the young people who come into the parliament that the more abuses of freedom and liberty that are taken by people the less freedom and liberty the rest of Australians have. Unfortunately, that is what has occurred in this situation. I support the Prime Minister, mainly because I believe that we should get all those unnecessary firearms that are not needed for anything in particular, or are dangerous, out of the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are talking about what has become known as the Port Arthur massacre and events like that, it is interesting that, of the 500 deaths that have occurred from shotgun blasts or from shootings since 1993, the majority were in domestic situations or were suicides. I believe that the fewer firearms you have lying around the place the fewer people would have access to them, and then the fewer deaths there will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also believe that the states should take account of some of the suggestions being made by the committee which the Prime Minister set up. They should take account of some of the smaller issues, if you like. I think this would assist people in accepting the laws as they go through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> For example, there is the issue of trying to modify the magazines on shotguns. I had a phone call today from some elderly shooters. They were saying that they need automatic shotguns because of the recoil on their shoulder. The women who shoot in clubs would prefer to use that type of firearm also, be cause it is less restrictive and does not hurt their shoulders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing that really alarmed me involved a gentleman who was speaking to me at a meeting. He was well dressed and well presented and was talking a great deal of sense. Then he said something which really frightened me: one thing about it is that if you have a firearm in the cupboard you know you are an equal citizen; it is an equaliser. I thought that this was strange thinking. It really frightened me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I must say that most of those people whom I have spoken to about firearms are well&hyphen;adjusted and normal citizens who are trying to go about their business. The new laws are a restriction that many of them are not used to and which they resent. They resent most strongly those people, like the perpetrator of the crime at Port Arthur, who have brought this about and have inflicted this on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the legislation to take some of the firearms out of society. I was one of those who received a white feather in the mail. Rather than being frightened by it, I just think of this poor fool sitting down in Melbourne, cutting up white feathers and putting them into envelopes. Surely he must have something better to do than that. The Prime Minister has my strong support. I would ask the Prime Minister and the various state governments to look at any minor alterations which would assist firearm owners.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The presence of guns in our community has led to sickening tragedy. It is the case that Hoddle Street, Queen Street and now Port Arthur are no longer merely place names. We need to remember that these renowned occasions where there has been the presence of guns are also the most rare. The threat which is represented by too easy and ready access to guns is more frequently evidenced by comparison to the `routine', unsung tragedies of family violence, including domestic murder. Each year, 600 to 700 Australians die from wounds inflicted by a gun: 80 per cent being suicides, approximately four per cent being accidents, and the remaining 16 per cent being homicides.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2543">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Australian Public Health Association notes, almost all the firearm suicides involve either very young men or men aged 64 years or over. Firearms also account for one&hyphen;third of Australia's murders, in which a majority of the victims are female&mdash;some 80 per cent&mdash;and these women are related to or intimates of the man pulling the trigger. From the gun lobby, we are told that the guns are necessary weapons of protection. But from the death&hyphen;through&hyphen;injury data, we know that in households where a gun is kept it is 48 times more likely that the gun will be used to kill a family member rather than an intruder. It is from home stored guns, wielded at the hands of their loved ones, that women and children are at most risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each of these instances&mdash;death by gun related suicide, accident and murder&mdash;is a tragic testimony to the efficiency of the gun as an instrument of death, an efficiency which far exceeds that of any other commonly available weapon, such as a knife. The emergency departments of our hospitals across the country testify to the harsh and too often irreversible efficiency of a gun when compared with a knife wound, a drug overdose or a physical assault. In such instances, the proximity of a firearm, its availability, ensures little opportunity for cooling off between impulse, action and consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Death is not the only consequence of the presence of guns in the domestic sphere. As Associate Professor Simon Chapman of the University of Sydney observes, many more people&mdash;predominantly women and children&mdash;have to live with the fear generated by the perpetual threat of a gun in a house: the brandishing of guns in the midst of arguments and the menacing behaviour of those with guns to coerce and intimidate within the home, such as sitting with a gun on the lap or at the dinner table. A gun provides to its holder the capacity to engender a climate of intense fear which must be eroded by the changes in the legislation&mdash;changes which we are supporting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The challenge then is to develop policy that will dramatically curtail the cold efficiency of these weapons' outcomes, that will by restricting access not only add a buffer of time between the reaching for a gun and having it in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> one's grasp but also remove from the domestic sphere a presence which engenders dread where there should be affection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The desire to see a clear separation of guns away from our homes and families has a significant tradition amongst those who have sought to reduce family violence. A large number of national and state based organisations against domestic violence have been calling for the removal of guns from homes because of the enormous threat the presence of guns has for women and children. The tragedy of Port Arthur does make the legislation particularly pressing. However, it did not invent the need for it; it resoundingly confirmed it.</PARA></SPEECH>

In my first days in this parliament, I counted the number of people on the government side&mdash;35 people&mdash;and the enormity of the situation became apparent. For the last two months there has been controversy and debate on the gun legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My deepest sympathy and sorrow go to those who have lost their loved ones. Obviously, I can never appreciate their heartache, but my heart goes out to them. I express my appreciation for the work done by the emergency services, the police and the paramedics&mdash;all those who were there on 28 April. The memories will live with them for the rest of their days. My sympathies go to the victims who were fellow constituents. Jim Pollard, aged 72, had his life robbed from him. He had just become the oldest graduate of Southern Cross University. I also attended the funerals of Robert and Helen Salzmann from Ocean Shores.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The knee&hyphen;jerk reaction to this legislation has triggered a lot of discussion. If we had not had this tragedy, this debate would not have been taking place. I applaud the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) for the courage that they have shown and the action they have taken to have national gun laws and registration across the states. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2544"> If one extra life is saved, the legislation is worth it. Many people talk about civil liberties of gun owners. What about the liberties of the 35 individuals who had their lives robbed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been a difficult issue for our party, but it has had to be addressed. As was pointed out by the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) and the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks), if we can restrict the level of access to guns, the number of homicides, youth suicides and domestic violence will decrease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the United Kingdom there have been fewer than 100 homicides per annum because of access to firearms whereas in the United States there have been well over 16,000. We do not want a situation where you have to have a firearm to protect yourself, which is almost the situation that prevails in the United States.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The town of Eden has taken some pretty hard knocks in recent years, particularly in relation to the timber industry, as the previous federal Labor government made one political, rather than scientific, decision after another.

Fire blight is a bacterial disease of pome fruit which leads eventually to the death of the trees. The disease is well established in New Zealand, but at the moment Australia is disease free. New Zealand is now making its second application to import apples into Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This fire blight bacteria can spread as simply as by wind&hyphen;borne pollen and by bees. Australia's most common pome fruit varieties are most susceptible to fire blight. The Goulburn Valley, in my electorate of Murray, would be particularly devastated. We have the biggest pear crops, we have the canneries and we have the weather conditions which are suited to the spread of this bacterial disease. An outbreak of fire blight would put Australia&mdash;with some 5,000 tonnes of apples and pears worth $150 million at farm gate value and approximately $500 million at retail level&mdash;at major risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is estimated that up to 50 per cent of Australia's apple and pear production would be lost if we got this disease imported with imported fruit. This would result in a 25 per cent reduction in the net return to apple growers and a 40 per cent reduction in the net return of pear growers. Added to this is the reduction in the wages and salaries of those employed on farms and by processors, together totalling some $53 million.

Skillshare is already delivering these services. Let us not reinvent the wheel. Orange skillshare has funded 454 commencements this year. It has had 743, with 309 outcomes&mdash;142 per cent of target.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Commission of Audit has made far-reaching recommendations in relation to financial accounting by the Commonwealth. It recommends that legislation be introduced by government to set and report clear fiscal strategy with targets and benchmarks. It would make the government responsible for actually releasing to the public on a twice yearly basis up-to-date and comprehensive reports on fiscal and economic outlook at budget time, at the time of the mid-year review and immediately before elections. The fiscal reporting legislation would also require identification of discretionary policies intended to smooth the economic cycle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The disgraceful concealment of the true position of the Commonwealth accounts before the last election has made it entirely necessary that legislation be put in place to allow a situation where the public is brought fully up to date with the information held by a government before an election. What happened in relation to the 1996 election, the concealment by the then Minister for Finance and others, should never be allowed to happen again. The only way in which that can be done is by legislation which forces by law a government to disclose the kind of information that was held by the Labor government prior to 2 March 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Requiring the disclosure of that information will be in the interests of not only oppositions but governments too.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fact that the Managing Director of Telstra, Mr Blount, and the Telstra board have given a strong endorsement to the government's proposal to privatise one-third of Telstra. And that is hardly surprising because the experience around the world is that when you partially privatise Telcos you end up delivering a better customer service, that when you inject some private sector money into organisations like Telstra the customer benefits and that when you expose them to competition the taxpaying public benefits. That is the reason why the government is committed to selling one&hyphen;third of Telstra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2552">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe there will be enormous public benefits. We believe that you will have a far better customer provision. We know that the community service obligations can be maintained. I am amused to keep reading in the press that members of the opposition say that if you privatise one-third of Telstra you are going to take away the community service obligation, particular in rural Australia, yet the organisation that knows more about rural Australia than any collection of Labor politicians could ever hope to, the National Farmers Federation of Australia, has made it 100 per cent clear that the great majority of its members and supporters, the men and women on the land in Australia, believe that the partial privatisation of Telstra is very good policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Frank Blount has done is to blow right out of the water this very weak argument about the privatisation of Telstra. What he has demonstrated is that it will give a higher quality and better value service for all Australians. It will deliver a more accountable and efficient Telstra through greater price scrutiny. There will be an increased ability to respond to investment and market opportunities. There will be better access to capital in an expanding communications market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, it is part and parcel of our proposal that the employees of Telstra be given privileged access to ownership of shares in the partially privatised company. That is something that Labor Party people and trade unions do not really like. They hate the idea that workers should have privileged access to shares in the companies that employ them because&mdash;heaven forbid&mdash;the workers might end up having a greater loyalty to the company than they do to the union to which they belong. And it would be absolutely shocking if that were to ever happen!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Mr Blount has said&mdash;and bear in mind that he is the Managing Director of Telstra and was appointed to that position while the former government was in power; he was not appointed to that position by us&mdash;that he has given an `unequivocal undertaking that we will deliver a higher quality of service and better value to you, as a partially privatised company, without diminishing or compromis ing Telstra's proud record of community service'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He went on to say that Telstra would be enabled, because of the partial privatisation, to respond more quickly to investment opportunities and to align more comfortably with new private sector partners. So he goes on, and the list is almost endless. What it is is the latest piece of evidence that not only are the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats completely out of step with what has really happened in the telecommunications market over the last few years, but also they are being very hypocritical in relation to their past performance on privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know the multiple backflips with double pikes that they performed on the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. We all know how they were opposed to the sale of the Commonwealth Bank in the mid&hyphen;1980s when they said that former Labor prime ministers would spin in their graves if you thought about selling the Commonwealth Bank. They said they would only sell half of it; they promised to keep the other half&mdash;and in the end they sold the lot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that, if the Labor Party had won the last election, they would be up here now extolling not the virtues of selling one-third of Telstra but the virtues of selling 100 per cent of Telstra. The real difference in the last election campaign between the Labor Party and the coalition parties&mdash;and the Australian people knew this&mdash;was that, if the Labor Party had won the election, it would have sold the lot, despite having denied it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that we said we would sell a third; we won the election and we are committed to selling a third; it will advantage Telstra, it will advantage the Australian community; and, to boot, it will lay the economic foundation for the largest environmental expenditure in Australia's history.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Given the success of landcare and protecting our natural resources, what is the government doing to create opportunities for Aboriginal people to become involved in landcare activities on lands under their direct control?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="2553" SPEAKER="Anderson, John, MP" NAMEID="4K4" ELECTORATE="Gwydir" PARTY="NP" MINISTERIAL="Primary Industries and Energy" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Landcare has undoubtedly been something of a cultural revolution and a great success in Australia. There are now 2,500 landcare groups and 20,000 active members. But one area that is often overlooked is that some 16 per cent of Australia's land surface is under Aboriginal control or management. Degradation of soil and water resources is evident on quite a few of those lands, and flora and fauna resources of natural significance are also at risk on some of those lands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Landcare activity is presently, it has to be said, a relatively low priority for many Aboriginal communities, given that health, housing and education tend to dominate their concerns. Nonetheless, it has been recognised that landcare is integral for the future viability of communities as a whole. So threats posed by pressure from land uses which are beyond the capacity of resources to sustain as well as by major weed and feral animal infestations could lead to problems unless early action is taken to ensure improved resource management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contemporary Aboriginal land management is quite complex as a matter of fact, particularly where multiple uses are envisaged. So I am quite pleased to be able to announce that shortly a network of nine Aboriginal landcare <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> facilitators is to be established. The aim will be to increase awareness of Aboriginal land management throughout the whole community, including the value and importance of traditional knowledge and practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is envisaged that improved land management will be achieved through awareness raising, education, training, demonstration, and by assisting to identify problems and solutions. We need to recognise too that face-to-face communication is particularly important for Aboriginal people. This is recognised, as too are the close spiritual and cultural affinity that Aboriginal people have with land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, a greater involvement of indigenous women and youth will be sought in land management and landcare. In the past, land management decisions in relation to Aboriginal lands have often been made by administrators and not the traditional owners, subsequently frequently with very poor results. I am confident that this new initiative, which has the full support of stakeholders and representative groups, will lead to valuable long-term benefits to Australian lands as well as to the communities which depend on them.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. The overwhelming majority of people who have a mental illness pose no threat to themselves or anybody else. However, there is some evidence that certain specific types of mental illness may in fact pose an increased risk. Predominantly I refer here to people with paranoid states, people who have not complied with medication, or people who have a history of drug abuse associated with mental illness. Therefore, to get further information, there is a cabinet subcommittee looking specifically at whether or not there are certain behavioural conditions that might be indicators of increased aggression and whether any policy action is warranted in this area, especially in relation to firearms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a complex area subject to much misconception. Because of this I have commissioned a group of experts who I hope will be giving an interim report by the end of this month. I should say, though, in relation to those reports that the government is not looking at introducing the types of personality tests speculated about over the weekend. I cannot see how such tests could possibly work. Nor are we proposing a register of persons with mental illness. There has been very substantial progress in recent years in greater community tolerance of people with mental illness, and I would not want to see anything that increased the stigma associated with mental illness.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is noting the recommendations of the audit commission that the Commonwealth retain responsibility for higher education and that university funding be undertaken by way of scholarships to students. In relation to the first of those recommendations, the Commonwealth already has effective responsibility for universities and there is certainly no intention to change that. In relation to the scholarship application recommendation, while the principle of contestability between institutions has some merit, the government notes that there is already a high level of competition between universities for staff and students.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question. As a preface to my answer, I note that this is refugee week. I will answer this question in the context of that. I want to affirm that this government maintains, as have governments before, a strong commitment to assisting bona <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2555"> fide refugees. Of course Australia has been very generous in a number of ways in ensuring that people who have been displaced and persecuted are resettled in Australia. It has had a very active program of support for those people who have very heavy requirements for support in Australia. Those who have suffered torture and trauma, in particular, have a heavy need for support when they come here to Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in this context I think that we need to look at the way in which some people come to Australia and seek to advantage themselves by accessing programs that are there for those who have particular needs. There are a large number of people who enter Australia illegally. Many more come here outlining circumstances such as a bona fide visit leading to them being able to access Australia. Then of course they seek to stay here, often not advancing any claims for protection but simply wanting to access a system that enables them to press claims that are not bona fide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation we have at the moment is in no way satisfactory. My department is involved at the moment in something of the order of 559 cases before the courts and the numbers are steadily increasing. Sixty per cent of that workload relates to applications for asylum here in Australia. They have been made by people who have primarily come here illegally or who have misled us as to their intention when they have come to Australia. Last year my department spent something of the order of $60 million in financing detention and processing procedures in relation to this very large number of people. This amounts to a very significant proportion of my department's total budget.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sixty million dollars for dealing with detention, processing, defending cases before the courts and paying asylum seeker assistance. It is a situation which distorts our priorities and limits our ability to help those who are most vulnerable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1989 the Immigration Review Tribunal was set up. In 1994 the Refugee Review Tribunal was set up. They were to provide independent merits review. The fact is that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> since that time litigation, which was then very prevalent, has not decreased but increased. So we now have a multi&hyphen;tier system for dealing with these matters. We keep people in detention very often while they pursue every entitlement that they believe under our system of law they are entitled to press.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great majority are not able to found a claim which engages our protection obligations. Those who do are primarily assessed either through my department's consideration of these matters or through the independent merits review system. I think the number it actually established before the courts as having an entitlement for protection were four. A situation which occasions such significant costs and which does not serve our need of assisting the most vulnerable and certainly limits our capacity to be able to provide resources to assisting those who have needs cannot be allowed to go on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am certainly reviewing that system. I hope to be able to bring forward in the next sittings recommendations which will ensure that these are addressed and that we have an effective merits review system, but one which does not provide further access to judicial review which occasions such difficulties for the people involved. In relation to these matters, I am sure that the opposition will want to support us on those measures because this is an area in which we have been able to achieve bipartisan support over time&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Adelaide for her question and indeed her interest, along with that of the honourable member for Grey. They have taken a great deal of interest in the future of AN and the future of those people who work at AN and, indeed, have taken a great deal of interest in the chaos that not only exists on the Labor benches in the House today but also exists in the case of AN and its future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason why those two members of parliament have a concern about the future of AN is due to the total and utter mismanagement and incompetence of those who sit opposite here today. There is nobody who can be blamed for the problems of Australian National Rail other than the Labor Party during their 13 years in office&mdash;nobody. You can't blame Bob Menzies. You can't blame Captain Cook. You can't blame anybody else but the people who sit opposite us here today who, during their 13 years in office, allowed <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the problems of AN to fester and grow to create the circumstance that we are faced with today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those problems were magnified by the way the former Labor government established the National Rail Corporation. In the process of forming the National Rail Corporation, it added further to the long-term problems of Australian National. Those long-term problems have left AN in a state of chaos.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chaos was exemplified by the fact that the losses of AN started to increase. Indeed, you will recall if you go back to April of this year, shortly after the coalition came into office, that the current chairman of ANRC, Mr Jack Smorgan, reported to the incoming government that the losses in AN had blown out, in his view, to around $106 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the Labor government do during the period it was in office? The former Minister for Finance, now Leader of the Opposition, was the minister responsible for the fiscal management of all government business enterprises. He, more than anybody, would have been aware of the problems of AN. What did he do? Nothing&mdash;nothing at all. Those problems continue to grow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we were elected to office we implemented a review undertaken by Mr John Brew, formerly the chief executive officer of the State Rail Authority. Mr Brew has done that review. It was presented to the government late last week, on 19 June. We are now in the process of considering that review and considering what recommendations we will pick up from it.</PARA>

I refer to the public statement by the Chinese ambassador in Canberra that your decision to axe aid projects to be funded by DIFF will cause significant financial losses for China and `do no good to the Australian side' in terms of our credibility and business interests. Can the minister tell the House how Australia's business interests in China were advanced by his denial in this House last Tuesday, contrary to the facts, that he had not received any representation from Chinese ministers concerning the axing of DIFF? Was it not a fact that in the letter from Vice Minister Sun, Vice Minister Sun made it clear that he is writing on his own behalf and on behalf of Minister Wu? Is it also a fact that your acknowledgment and reply on 29 May, the following month, makes that absolutely clear&mdash;that it was a ministerial representation? Can I conclude by asking: what is the minister's response to the fact that the letters exchanged between the minister and the vice minister of the Chinese ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation concerning DIFF were actually leaked from the Chinese embassy in Canberra on the day after your answer last Tuesday? Doesn't that fact demonstrate that the contemptuous dismissal of the serious concerns of the Chinese government has actually caused great damage to our bilateral relations, damage which prompted the Chinese embassy to take action when you lied to this parliament?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I frankly would have thought that if anything did damage to Australia's standing with China it was the shadow minister for foreign affairs going around claiming that the Chinese embassy is an embassy full of leakers; that apparently they leak documents. Frankly, I am astounded that you would say something like that and, yet again, do some damage to Australia's standing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is absolutely true: I did get this letter from the vice minister and, as I explained in answer to the previous question, I replied to the letter from the vice minister. When I sought advice from my department as to the status of the vice minister in order to clarify the record here&mdash;which I am quite happy do to do&mdash;my department advised me that he was a departmental secretary equivalent. It is hard to make these comparisons but, given that he was not a minister of the equivalent status of some of those who sit along here on this front bench, it seemed to me a perfectly clear point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The suggestion from the Labor Party that somehow the whole of the edifice of our relationship with China under them, under your government, depended on a soft loan scheme is simply an astounding proposition. As I said earlier, if this were such an extraordinarily important point in our bilateral relationship with China, then surely you would expect the Chinese foreign minister to have raised it with our ambassador. You would expect that; you would expect that if it was something he was so deeply concerned about it. The simple fact is that he did not.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course government officials from governments which will no longer receive DIFF funding have discussed these issues with my officials. The fact that government officials discuss these things is inevitable. Maybe they report to their ministers on what they do, and surely they do. But it is a far cry from saying that the Chinese foreign minister has written to me, or come to me, and expressed fundamental concern about this issue, which of course he would do if it were a vitally important issue in our bilateral relationship.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RI4">Mr PROSSER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Parkes for his question. The current government places a great deal of importance on small business. In fact, the Prime Minister, during the election campaign, described small business as the engine room of the Australian economy. Small business generally feels quite disappointed after 13 years of neglect by those sitting opposite. We intend to, and have, put in place many positive programs to assist the small business community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The deregulation task force set up by this government met in Canberra, and then last Friday in Melbourne. The meeting was well attended by small business representatives, industry groups, the state government and regional councils as well. I might add that even the Commission of Audit report recognised the deregulation task force that this government has set up as being the way to go in tackling the burden of regulation, an input cost on small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We recognise that it is an input cost to small business. We are doing something about it. In addition to that, the positive things that we have done to lift the employment opportunities in small business involve our commitment to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor, and the positive industrial relations <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2560"> reforms introduced by my colleague the Minister for Industrial Relations.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) having demonstrated by his disgraceful action that he is not fit to hold the high office of Minister for Foreign Affairs. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>As all members of the House will be aware, the most solemn duty imposed upon a minister of the Crown under the Westminster system is to be truthful and to be candid to the parliament and to the country. These were the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) himself when, as Deputy Leader of the Opposition, nearly 13 years ago he moved the first motion of censure against a minister in the then Labor government. The Prime Minister reaffirmed that appropriately high standard when on 2 April this year he issued guidelines on ministerial responsibility which include the vitally important rule:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers must be honest in their public dealings and should not intentionally mislead the parliament or the public. Any&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and this is terribly important&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">misconception caused inadvertently should be corrected at the earliest opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA>It is in the light of the evidence that has come to hand that I have moved this very serious censure motion this afternoon&mdash;the first censure motion the opposition has moved against the government. Our attitude has been that we should not be moving, as they did, censure motion after censure motion; that it should be reserved for the most serious of cases. We determined that only when there was absolute evidence in a very clear case would we use this in the parliament. But the charge of misleading parliament is one of the most grave that can be levelled against any minister. It is not a charge that should be made lightly&mdash;and we do not do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an additional, crucial dimension in this particular case. The subject of this motion is the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer)&mdash;the man who represents our country overseas; the man who is indeed the diplomatic face of Australia; the man who speaks on behalf of our nation at international fora; the man whose word must be absolutely believable to our friends and to our neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have before us today is an open and shut case. There are no ifs; there are no buts. There is no opportunity to wriggle off the hook. The facts speak for themselves. Last Tuesday I asked a perfectly straightforward question of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I asked him whether he could confirm that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2561"> China, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam had all made official protests against the government decision to axe development projects to be funded by the DIFF scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I pointed out in that question last Tuesday that the Chinese ambassador in Canberra had stated publicly that the axing of DIFF would `do no good to the Australian side in terms of our credibility and business interests'. I asked whether it was not the case that the Chinese government had made at least four representations at vice ministerial level. That was my question. The foreign minister's reply was&mdash;what can I say?&mdash;the reply of a petulant schoolboy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just the tone of his performance last Tuesday that is a problem. We now have in a foreign minister someone who is an embarrassment to this House and, worse still, someone charged with the responsibility of representing our nation overseas.</PARA>

He said, in his contemptuous dismissal, that there had been no repeated protests at a ministerial level.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;`We', yes. He is writing on behalf of Minister Wu and himself. Mr Speaker, I am reading from a translation of the vice minister's letter. But I have checked it, and I am assured that it is a very good translation, one that captures the essential nuance of the letter. It is a good translation from exactly the document that the minister held in his hands when he read the views of the Chinese government. He read them and he responded to them on 29 May.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at what the Chinese government had to say. I know all honourable members should listen very carefully to the words of the vice minister, writing on behalf of the Chinese minister of MOFTEC, who said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2562">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been Sino Australian Government soft loan cooperation initiated since 1988. In the past few years with effort by both governments this cooperation has gradually expanded and achieved satisfactory results. Up until now the joint cooperative soft loan projects total over 60 with the turnover reaching US $540 million. The completion of these projects has reinforced our infrastructure establishment and environmental protection and the living standards of the poor areas of our country have been improved, positive effects have been produced.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter refers to the fact that DIFF has assisted Australian exporters to enter the Chinese market and that the scheme has proved beneficial to both countries. The vice minister's letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For a long time AusAID has established a relationship of cooperation with my Ministry and that assured soft loan projects would be completed smoothly. But recently AusAID has been waiting for the new Government's policy that withhold the normal operations of soft loan projects, and for this we express our strong concern.</PARA>
<PARA>These people are not mincing words. This is right to the point. This is central to the whole DIFF debate. `We express our strong concern'&mdash;that is what the Chinese government had to say. That is what they said directly, that is what they said in writing to you as foreign minister for Australia. What did you say to the House last week? You said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But if this was a serious issue in our relationships they would raise it at the ministerial level. They would be writing me letters. They would be expressing their concerns to me. There has been not one raised.</PARA>
<PARA>The vice minister's letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because both sides on the agreed projects have invested a lot of man hours and capital if those projects cannot be started by the 30th of June this year it will cause the project companies on both sides a substantial financial loss.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Chinese government had to say to us. I believe that they said&mdash;you can understand this from the China side&mdash;that these companies taking these projects cannot wait any longer for uncertainties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of those projects might have to be forced to seek the technology and equipment from other countries, particularly at the moment as Australian soft loan future is unclear.</PARA>
<PARA>The Chinese government said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the above stated reasons I hope your Government will give continuous support with the agreed listed projects so these projects can be executed on time.</PARA>
<PARA>They enclosed a list of the multitude of projects that were covered under the DIFF scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is little wonder that the Chinese government was enraged when the minister stood here in the parliament this week and said that no such representations had been made. So enraged were they that within 24 hours they had taken action to expose the minister's deceit. What an absolutely extraordinary state of affairs. Can you believe that this is happening so soon in the life of this government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does it say about the government's commitment to further develop our nation's engagement in Asia? Why did the minister do this? I think the answer is simple: his policy is indefensible. The axing of DIFF has been universally condemned. It has been condemned by Australian business organisations. It has been condemned by overseas aid organisations. It has been condemned by all our neighbouring governments. As one leading foreign policy commentator has described it, the decision is just `dumb, dumb, dumb'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Was it arrogance, or was it to do with the fact that his parliamentary secretary, within a few minutes of his misleading the parliament, elaborated on the minister's earlier reference to Richard Woolcott and said that he challenged Richard Woolcott's integrity. Was that the reason that you did not come into the parliament and correct the record? Or was it the fact that you were bogged down, denying that you recalled anything of the public controversy in 1992 about the leaked report from 1988 of Miles Kupa, which your ministerial colleague in the other place, Senator Hill, said would do Australia grave damage and bring grave offence in Indonesia. This is at the time that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2564"> you were the shadow minister for trade, working in the same area. Were they the two reasons you did not come into the parliament and correct the record? We will, perhaps, never know.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the House: there is no alternative in this situation. The Prime Minister has to sack this foreign minister if he is not prepared to go. If the Prime Minister does not sack him, for whatever reason, it will be an appalling abrogation of the standards to which he professes to adhere, the standards that he made such great play of in the lead-up to the last election and immediately after the election, the standards that the government set itself. If the Prime Minister does not sack him, it will mean that ministers will be above reproach for their conduct and for all their statements in this House. That is a totally unacceptable situation under the Westminster system. It will give Mr Speaker a green light from here on for ministers to mislead this parliament, and to do so with impunity. That is what a failure to dismiss this minister will mean. It will mean that, on simple matters of fact, ministers will be able to stand up in this parliament and say that black is white and that white is black, and they will be allowed to get away with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that ever becomes permissible, this House may as well forget about question time. We may as well forget about the Westminster system.

If ever there was a minister in the previous government who was discredited and dishonest, it was the member for Kingsford-Smith.

I said in question time that the position of vice minister was the equivalent of the position of secretary. That was the advice I received from my department last week, and I now have further advice which I have just received during this debate. The further advice is that there is above the vice minister the position of first vice minister. The first vice minister is the equivalent of a secretary, and Vice Minister Sun Zhenyu is the equivalent of a deputy secretary in our system.</PARA></TALK.START>

She is the equivalent of our minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Never let it be forgotten that the shadow minister, the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith, in one of his first exercises in party politics in opposition, has himself already committed quite a significant gaffe by coming into this parliament and telling everybody in this parliament that the Chinese embassy leaks material to him! I have to say that was a most extraordinarily foolish thing to have done. That will be bitterly resented by the Chinese embassy, and I do not doubt they will be happy to talk to you about that. Whether they are the equivalent of deputy secretaries or secretaries&mdash;or whatever positions they hold&mdash;I am sure they will be happy to hear that the shadow minister for foreign affairs came into this parliament on a political stunt and took the opportunity to accuse the Chinese embassy of leaking.

The then minister responsible for the overseas aid program expressly promised to lift the level of aid during the life of the 1993&hyphen;96 parliament from 0.36 per cent to 0.4 per cent. Remember that? In 1993 you promised to lift aid to 0.4 per cent of GNP. Did you lift aid from 0.36 per cent to 0.4 per cent of GNP? No. You reduced it to 0.33 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>

You are the people who made a promise to the Australian electorate before the 1993 election and you flagrantly broke it. What did you do about foreign aid during the last election campaign? What did you do then? You repeated the promise, didn't you, Gary? You repeated the promise you made in 1993. You went along on 23 February and you said in a prepared speech that Labor would increase aid from 0.33 per cent to 0.4 per cent by the year 2000, didn't you? And, when a spokesman in your office was asked whether that was a commitment, your spokesman said, `Yes, it is a commitment.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There it was, all over the newspapers, that you had made this commitment. All the aid groups believed you had made a commitment. But what happened? We actually sat down and costed your commitment. Increasing aid from 0.33 per cent to 0.4 per cent would have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2566"> blown out your budget by another $1 billion. You would have a $9 billion black hole now if you or the then Prime Minister had not got on to the phone to Gary and said to him, `Look, let's walk away from this commitment. It's not a commitment. We have decided it is an aspiration.' So we went from a commitment to an aspiration. Whether that was done by a phone call from the Prime Minister history will never record, but the fact is that the then minister switched his commitment and we had a completely new aid promise. The $1 billion aid hole was simply a matter of serious embarrassment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me conclude by saying that, when it comes to integrity in foreign policy, these people have very little to boast about. The member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith raises the question about Indonesia. Don't forget what happened last year with the Mantiri affair. Let the House know this: what happened was that the Indonesians asked the Australian government whether they would give agreement for General Mantiri to become the ambassador to Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has made an absolute nonsense of that. He has done you personally, as a minister, no credit at all. You must defend him because you do not wish to see him drift out in circumstances of extreme embarrassment to the government. I can understand why you would wish to absent yourself from this debate, and you ought to feel absolutely free to do so. I will not offer a critical remark if you or anyone else wants to move out of this place and not defend him. You will have to defend him when you come in for the vote but I suggest you all nick off because he is a major embarrassment to you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go to this piece of correspondence which he cheerfully ignores. His department, as he admitted in here today, sought to get him to correct himself. His department said, `Perhaps, sir, you may have inadvertently misled the House. Perhaps, sir, you may have been unaware of this correspondence.' The department did not hotfoot it over to advise him of this correspondence from the Chinese foreign ministry because they felt he perhaps needed a little additional information. They hotfooted it over, like any good department, to advise the minister that he had misled the House, to give the minister maximum opportunity to rise in this place and do the thing that ministers must do when that occurs&mdash;that is, immediately correct themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The department was in that office really quickly because they knew exactly what was at stake. They knew exactly what was in the letter. They knew exactly what was in Alexander Downer's correspondence of only two weeks earlier. I will read the opening paragraph. The rest of the letter is a damning indictment of the government's cretinous policy on DIFF, so we will start out with the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2568"> first paragraph. It is that first paragraph which reveals the true deceit of this man. It begins thus:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable Minister&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>as though people of no significance are the formal, first point of contact on a congratulatory piece of correspondence as well as that for issues being raised with a new minister coming in&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, congratulations to you on your appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs and our Honourable Minister, Wu Yi would like me to send her best regards. We now . . .</PARA>
<PARA>One thing we can be absolutely certain of is that the vice minister is not royal. Therefore, when he uses the plural he is referring to someone else other than himself. Who does he refer to as someone else other than himself? A minister, Wu Yi. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We now send this letter to you regarding the DIFF programme matter.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter then goes on to detail to the minister over here the policy on behalf of the minister, under the instructions of the minister, and their protest at what has been the dishonest destruction of an important point of cooperation between us and what will be by the turn of this century, or shortly thereafter, the world's largest economy with which all will wish to trade. The letter says all of that. Then Alexander Downer, the foreign minister, replied to all of that, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Vice minister,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to sincerely thank you, and Minister Wu Yi&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he sure as hell knew who was corresponding with him&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for your congratulatory message in your letter of 24 April 1996 on my appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs. I would also like to thank you for writing and expressing your views about the Australia&hyphen;China Concessional Finance Facility (CFF).</PARA>
<PARA>There is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that it was thoroughly understood in the minister's office, in the department of foreign affairs, that they had on their hands a piece of ministerial correspondence. They were not out there wandering around just for the sake of completeness. If they had been doing that, they would have been straight over to him <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with a whole raft of correspondence that had been out there in the department from all those stations around Asia that had been receiving protests from governments at all levels about what had been going on with the DIFF program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His department selected this because, on their best interpretation, he had inadvertently, they hoped, misled the House. We on this side of the House do not believe for one minute that he inadvertently misled the House. He will stand up and say anything in this chamber without the slightest concern for the veracity of it. He burbles on at the mouth and he gets himself and this country into trouble repeatedly. However, again in his burbling here, without realising that he had to adopt a sensitive defensive position, he realises now what this House must now consider: whether or not it was inadvertent that when he stood up to give his buffoon's answer to our shadow minister for foreign affairs he had sincerely forgotten his correspondence of three weeks prior to that date. He turned that inadvertence into a lie by his inaction from that point onwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He should take a look at the ministerial guidelines that his Prime Minister gave him when he came into office. The Prime Minister clearly anticipated such events. In his directions to Mr Downer, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers must be honest in their public dealings and should not intentionally mislead the Parliament or the public. Any misconception caused inadvertently should be corrected at the earliest opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA>It is quite possible that ministers with thousands of things on their plates will forget pieces of correspondence they have. They rarely, I might say, forget pieces of correspondence to other ministers but they will forget from time to time pieces of correspondence they have with other people. If they are very smart, they will never forget pieces of correspondence they have with China at whatever level. It is actually possible that these things will occur. When you get up there and say that you have not misled this place&mdash;and there have been three days of sittings since the department drew your attention to their view that you had inadver <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2569"> tently misled the House&mdash;whatever it was that you did last Tuesday, you have lied since.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have failed to correct the error on your part. You have failed to come into this chamber and say, `I wish to add to my answer for the sake of completeness' or whatever weasel words you want to use&mdash;words that ministers from time to time use. You did not avail yourself of that opportunity, and you did not avail yourself of that opportunity for the most obvious of reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a minister who is not concerned with standards. This is a minister who believes that he can skate around in any particular direction. Everything is light&hyphen;hearted. We are all having fun. We are all acting out some sort of P.G. Wodehouse Bertie Wooster event of the 1920s. The minister has this sort of belief about himself: it does not really matter what it is that you say in this place; the minister just gets up in this place and rattles on. But the simple fact of the matter is that, having put himself in this position, he has made a liar of his entire government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This deceitful man, who happens to hold the foreign ministry, has disgraced his office and his position. The reason why he did not correct his error is that he faces embarrassment on a multiplicity of fronts. His gaucheness, his ineptness in handling foreign affairs issues, has meant that on a whole plethora of fronts he now faces public criticism. It has come as a shock to him. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a shock to him to sit there and see cartoons of himself in the paper with a bowl and chopsticks in front of him, and noodles all over his face. When he sees them, he finds them embarrassing and deeply depressing. Therefore, in that sort of atmosphere, having ticked them off, we have an incompetent selection&mdash;no, not incompetent because he is a good man; an ill-advised selection&mdash;in regard to an appointment in Indonesia; a number of embarrassments in relation to DIFF that are popping off all over the South-East Asian region; and an incompetent performance in recent times in dealing with our principal ally, the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you have a hat-trick running, you do not want to make it four wickets in four balls. What he was entitled to do was to move away from the hat-trick of being bowled out on the serious issues that confronted him to the record of four wickets in four balls. That is the last thing that he wanted to have apply to himself on this occasion. He is being mocked and ridiculed out there in the general public. But, worse than that for this country, he is being mocked and ridiculed everywhere around the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is on notice in the region around us. The former Prime Minister did not say that the countries of this region would not deal with this government. The countries of this region deal with polite people. The countries of this region consist of polite people. They believe that they can have a sensible conversation with whomever runs Australia, and they are prepared to put their points to them. In dealing with this country they do not regard themselves as dealing with a bunch of obtuse individuals. They believe that, when the advice of ministers on behalf of ministers is right, those ministers will get a bit of attention. They believe that we can deal with signals they send by both back channels and forward channels&mdash;because this is not a confrontationist region. This is not a region that shirtfronts you as a minister when you meet other ministers. That is not their way. That is not the way of this region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But they make it amply clear to you that you know exactly what they mean in the sorts of correspondence that they enter into with <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2570"> you. The sort of correspondence that you got from the vice minister on behalf of the minister was precisely part of that sort of process. Of course the minister is not going to raise it with you. Of course the minister is not going to buttonhole you. The minister has had you written to at length and in detail about their country's objections to the policies that you have put in place. Then you responded at length and in detail to the complaints of the foreign minister that had been put before you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The test that the former Prime Minister put to you was not whether or not you would be listened to but whether or not you would be capable of conveying a view; capable of putting a uniquely Australian position on the security and economic issues of this region; capable of dealing with the subtleties of the region; capable of promoting an Australian interest in an area in which&mdash;in terms of population, economics and power&mdash;we are very much a minority. This is a country where leaders have to be better than most&mdash;not `as good as most' but `better than most'. This is a country which must not only observe proprieties; it must know the signals and understand them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nickname of this gentleman when he was at school about 20 years ago&mdash;but some would think it only 18 months ago&mdash;was `Dodger'. We now see the reason why that was so: Dodger Downer by name, Dodger Downer by nature. He has dodged the Prime Minister's position on propriety. He has humbled the Prime Minister's position on propriety. He has set a low standard for the observance of the Prime Minister's position on propriety.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Here we are, the first sitting day after the release of the National Audit Commission's work&mdash;one of the most significant, important and far-reaching documents that any government could produce, let alone a new government; a document that will have enormous and far-reaching impacts on the people of Australia; a document which today highlights the failure of these people sitting opposite <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> us&mdash;and what do we have brought into the parliament as the key issue of the day? One day after the release of the most important, most critical issue confronting the people of Australia today, the key issue being brought before us in the parliament is none other than this flimsy, false and unsubstantiated argument about the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nobody can say that the opposition, and in particular the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), has the least idea about tactics when in opposition because, if they did, they would have been running on a totally different issue today. The fact that they have run on this issue today just highlights how inadequate they are as an opposition which causes us to reflect on how inadequate they were as a government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For an example of their inadequacy, one only has to point to the very person whom the opposition has chosen to lead the charge on this issue of integrity, ministerial propriety and honesty. The very person they have brought forward to lead the charge on this issue is none other than the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton). We on this side of the House all know that the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith is a person who brings a reputation into this parliament which has some relevance to the issues of honesty, integrity and ministerial propriety. We all know about that because we have been following the course of politics in New South Wales for the last 25 or 30 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members only have to cast their minds back to the preselection of the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, the former member for Blaxland. Who featured in that preselection? It was not necessarily Paul Keating; it was one Laurie Brereton. Why? Because it was Laurie Brereton who was seen disappearing from the preselection meeting with a ballot box on the back of his motorbike. That was the first time we ever heard about Laurie Brereton, who later came into this political arena as the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith. That is a very healthy insight for those of us who sit here today hearing about honesty, integrity and ministerial propriety.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2571">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the man whom the Labor opposition today brings forward to carry the flag of virtue on behalf of the Labor Party in this parliament. What a joke! If you follow today's carrier of the flag of virtue for the Labor Party through the course of his time as a senior member of the New South Wales Labor government, a senior minister in some incredibly sensitive and important portfolios, then you will appreciate the value of the joke that this Labor opposition is imposing on us here today. Cast your minds back to some critical issues that occurred during the period when the honourable member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith was in the New South Wales parliament. It just runs off the top of your head, does it not? You do not have to think hard. You can think of things like the Botany council, for goodness sake; this is an example of how they stand for virtue, integrity and honour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One only has to go to things like the issues surrounding the monorail. Do honourable members remember the monorail? Oh dear, the monorail! On television last year we saw the former minister for public works and transport say that he had made a mistake. But throughout all the period that he was the minister championing the cause of the monorail, did he tell us the truth? Of course he did not and he admitted it many years later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason why the background of the person who is bringing this charge against the Minister for Foreign Affairs is important to us today is that it gives us an insight into the way that these people opposite in the Labor Party value honesty, integrity, virtue and ministerial responsibility. The charge that they lay against the Minister for Foreign Affairs&mdash;a person who does have honesty and integrity&mdash;is very weak indeed because of the nature of the person they send forward to lead their charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One only has to go back to the period when he was in office here in the parliament in Canberra and to some of the things he did while he was in government as the Minister for Transport and Industrial Relations. Did he tell us the truth about AN? Did he tell us that there was an impending loss of $106 million in AN's forthcoming budget? Of course he <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> did not. Did he hide the truth from us? Of course he did. Is he standing here today pretending that he has the virtues of truth and honesty? Of course he is. But do we believe it? No, of course we do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the man who did more to harm small business in Australia, by introducing the unfair dismissals provision, than anybody else on that side of the House when they were in government. This is the man who leads their charge today. Is this the person who told us the truth about the third runway? Did he tell us that only 13 per cent of all the takeoffs would be to the north of Sydney's Mascot airport? Did he tell us that? What was the truth of it? Twenty&hyphen;nine per cent of all of the takeoffs occurred to the north of Sydney's Mascot airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the man who was given the very sensitive responsibility of negotiating the single aviation market across the Tasman between Australia and New Zealand, a very important initiative announced by the former Prime Minister himself, one Paul J. Keating, just after the budget in 1993. He announced it and it was negotiated. The member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith was the Minister for Transport at the time. What happened after that delicately negotiated single aviation market had been agreed on? People had shaken hands on it. Australia put its credibility on the line, shook hands with New Zealand and said, `This is a deal we will deliver on.' What happened? Two or three days before it was due to be implemented on 1 November 1994 it was scrapped by the minister at the time, the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The circumstances of its scrapping tell a story about how these people appreciate honesty and ministerial responsibility. There is a story that goes with it: the then Secretary to the Department of Transport, Graham Evans&mdash;he is no longer there&mdash;had dinner with the current New Zealand High Commissioner, Mr Graham Fortune. They had dinner the night before it was revealed publicly that the single aviation market would be scrapped. Did they discuss it? Did Graham Evans, the then Secretary to the Department of Transport, raise such an important issue with the New Zealand High Commissioner? No, of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2572"> course he did not. He did not raise it. Why? Because, as Graham Evans said later, `The minister, Laurie Brereton, told me not to.' In other words, tell the New Zealand High Commissioner anything else but the truth. This is the name of the game on the Labor side of the House and this is the very person they bring before us today to lay a charge in relation to honesty, integrity and ministerial responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is this a sham or is it not? Of course it's a sham&mdash;a complete and utter sham. And the fact that they don't even believe it is proved by the fact that they brought the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith here today to lay that charge against the Minister for Foreign Affairs. If anything could be more `shamful', this is it. They should be ashamed of the fact that this person has brought this charge against the Minister for Foreign Affairs in this House today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party has imposed on the people of Australia a shadow minister for foreign affairs who has this track record. As a result of the track record of this person, Australia has had to mend its fences with New Zealand. It is a very interesting thing to look at the way the current Minister for Foreign Affairs has re-established our relationship with New Zealand. When the new government came into office it was made quite plain to us that the performance of the former Labor government and level of dishonesty engaged in by it had completely and utterly ruined the previously close relationship Australia and New Zealand had enjoyed for so many years. The new Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, has re-established the close relationship between Australia and New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were told by the former government, the Labor Party that sits in opposition here today, that if the Australian people voted for a coalition government the Asians would not deal with them, would not talk to them, would not have anything to do with them. Of course, what happens? The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, within a matter of weeks got Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia to come to Australia to hold discussions with him. He has established <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> relationships with all the major Asian ministers for foreign affairs. He has established a very, very favourable impression for Australia post the election of the new government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does that say about the sorts of things these people opposite were prepared to say in government? What does it say about them? It says that they are prepared to say and do anything at all. Damn integrity! Damn honesty! Just say what you feel will be helpful at the time! That is not going to be the trademark of this government or indeed the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, because what he said in the House last week is exactly what happened. The thing members opposite in the Labor Party need to recognise is that what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said last week is true. He said that he had not received representations at ministerial level on this issue. He hadn't, and you know it.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that is worth noting, too, is what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said last week.

<PARA>That's true. Deep shock! What a misrepresentation of the truth has been revealed here today! What they have proven to us today by their tactics of raising this censure motion is that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in answer to a question last Tuesday in the House of Representatives, told the truth. He said that he had not received representations <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2573"> at ministerial level on this particular issue and this is confirmed today. But what he did say was that there had been representations, and I will read it again for the benefit of the House today. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is that of course some officials who are involved in the details of these programs have raised issues with my department . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is exactly what has happened. I know it is hard to understand some things. It is really difficult. We all appreciate the difficulties of switching to opposition. It's tough. We were there for a long time. We know how it goes. But if you are going to raise a censure motion, make sure you base it on the facts. Make sure you don't take an `answer' out of context as you have done today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you have done today is an example of what you did in government. What you did in government was not to deal with the truth honestly, was not to put virtue and integrity at the forefront.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, my question to you concerns the National Commission of Audit report which, as you would be aware, was handed to the Treasurer on Friday. During question time the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training and the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs all referred to the importance of this report. Indeed, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development during the debate of the censure motion described it as being `very important', `significant', and having a `far reaching impact on the people of Australia'. Can you use your good offices to approach the Leader of the House to ensure that this most important report is tabled in the parliament?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You may be aware, Mr Speaker, that honourable members on both sides of the House who may wish to obtain a copy of that report are unable to do so because it is not available at the AGPS. Given the significance of the report, both on the basis of the references by ministers and questions from the opposition, I think it is most important that all members have access to this report as soon as possible.</PARA></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That, in view of the (a) increase in unemployment resulting from downsizing in both business <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2579"> and the public sector, (b) damage to effective enterprise functioning from downsizing due to the decline of employee morale, greater insecurity and loss of initiative and dynamism and (c) the repudiation of downsizing by business opinion leaders in the USA, calls on both business and public sector organisations to reject the perverse and destructive strategy of downsizing and contribute instead to employment generating economic and social development.</PARA>
<PARA>During the last decade downsizing has become the norm in large business and public sector organisations. Headlines such as `More jobs will go at Qantas, says chief', `Nissan to vote on redundancy', `ANZ to shed 2,500 staff in cost cutting drive', `Another 6,000 rail jobs will go' and `Commonwealth Bank to cut 7,500 workers' have become commonplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labour shedding has become the fashion in big business. Some companies even reward their chief executives in proportion to the number of employees they get rid of. The enormity of CEO pay packages is sometimes now directly tied to the size of the cuts in the corporate work force. Such tactics are also reported in the more reactionary state governments, such as that under Premier Kennett in Victoria. The same tactics are being applied to public sector departments as to public sector business enterprises and to larger private businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most governments in Australia are aiming to minimise the number of people they employ. Minimising the size of organisational labour forces has virtually become an end in itself. Downsizing has become a powerful factor in the rise and persistence of high unemployment. Yet at exactly the time when unemployment is our principal problem, the principal, fashionable management trend has been to reduce staff. How ironic and perverse!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Future generations will be astonished at the magnitude and destructiveness of this contradiction. The theory behind downsizing has been simplistic. The argument has been that reducing the amount of labour input would improve productivity&mdash;that is, the same level of output could be produced with a decreasing number of inputs. At the very least, that is damaging to the economy. Robert Kuttner describes the paradox well when he says:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . when one company becomes more competitive by doing more with less, the result is greater productivity. But when the entire economy competes that way, the income lost to displace workers may outweigh the gains to productivity. Unless we devise complementary strategies to yield jobs for the displaced, the `competitiveness' craze is likely to worsen this problem.</PARA>
<PARA>That was written several years ago before downsizing became such a widespread phenomenon. The argument of the downsizers was that increasing individual company productivity would restore high national economic growth rates. Kuttner demonstrates that this confuses two measures of productivity&mdash;that of the corporation with the productivity of the nation. Even if labour shedding led to improvements in corporate productivity, this may lead to such growth of waste nationally, through the loss of the output of unemployed workers and underemployed enterprises, that in other areas national productivity may in total decline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, as the experience with downsizing has grown, there has been a striking development. Managers themselves are starting to realise the destructive consequences for their own organisations of repeated reductions in the number of staff. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New York Times</EMPHASIS> did a recent series of articles on the issue, which are full of quotations and stories relating to organisations in which downsizing has occurred. For example, in discussing consequences of the amalgamation of Chase Manhattan Bank with the Chemical Banking Corporation, and the consequent cut of 12,000 people, the articles report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A huge insecurity complex has taken root in the Bank's employees. The deracinated workers feel forlorn, if not outright hostile. They are baffled about where their loyalties should lie&mdash;and where their employers' loyalty lies. Anxiety stalks the corridors.</PARA>
<PARA>There is intense trauma to those who lose their jobs as well as damage to the survivors. The insidious effect on one continuing employee is quoted as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The merger has eliminated for me a certain motivation and all risk taking. We've all become soldiers, we will obey whatever is said and will not challenge. Since the merger it's a nine to five job for me.  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2580"> </PARA>
<PARA>So the mood has changed. Employees are more suspicious of management and less willing to participate in corporate activities. Some employees report great difficulty in maintaining motivation, and with that growth of lassitude productivity drops because employees feel despair rather than hope. There is widespread anger about the dimensions and frequency of lay&hyphen;offs. The instability generates pervasive paranoia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A central problem is that in many corporations there have been repeated downsizings. A one-off exercise is damaging, but the consequences are clear when the exercise is repeated several times that everyone then feels insecure and any basis for renewing motivation and improving security is removed. Amongst those who remain, trust between colleagues is reduced and even disappears as they struggle to shore up their position. Many now believe that they cannot depend on their job any more. The effect has been pervasive economic anxiety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia, surveys conducted through the ANU found in 1989-90 that 27 per cent of respondents in employment felt various degrees of insecurity about their jobs, and that is high enough, but five years later, in 1994, a similar survey found that the proportion had risen to 43 per cent. That is, in addition to all of those who cannot find paid employment but want it, nearly half of those in employment feel a degree of insecurity about their tenure. No wonder anxiety and insecurity are the hallmarks of our age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Belatedly, this destructive fad is being questioned. Some management experts argue that many companies downsize in a violent, overly hasty reaction to bad news. They cut without overhauling their strategy or the way they work. A recent survey by the American Management Association of 1,000 companies found that fewer than half the companies laying off people managed to increase their operating profits after workers were shed. The question that too many companies ask is: how can we get by with the minimum number of people? The director of management studies of the association states:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You're not going to grow if you simply do the same work with fewer people. You end up with a demoralised work force and no new business.</PARA>
<PARA>Other studies have come to similar conclusions. A survey conducted within the Harvard Business School recently studied lay&hyphen;offs over more than a decade in 100 large American companies. The survey found that often too many people are fired or the wrong ones retrenched and those who survive are not retrained to pick up the workload in the shrunken company. The researcher said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Downsizing is typically viewed as a financial exercise. Companies add up their costs per employee and say if we sack 10,000 employees, that will save us that much in expenses and make us that much more profitable. So they cut 10,000 people across the board.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet that approach rarely succeeds. The Harvard Business School reports:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On average downsizing doesn't pay.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, lay&hyphen;offs have failed to pay off in many companies. The deep cuts can cripple product development, marketing and customer services as business evaporates. Management is forced into further cuts, sometimes with angry customers clamouring until management recognises its mistakes and starts to hire again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of this has led to one of the gurus of downsizing to recant. Stephen S. Roach, the Chief Economist at Morgan Stanley Bank, wrote to clients admitting that the downsizing approach is fundamentally flawed. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For many years I have extolled the virtues of America's productivity led recovery. While I think it's safe to say that such a scenario has become the new mantra for US businesses in the 1990s, I must confess that I'm now having second thoughts . . . these doubts have caused me to rethink many of the glorious consequences I have long argued would be forthcoming in a truly productivity-led recovery. . . Slash and burn restructuring was not a permanent solution. Tactics of open-ended downsizing and real wage compression are ultimately recipes for industrial extinction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If all you do is cut, you will eventually be left with nothing, with no market share. A myth has been there and I'm guilty of having perpetrated the myth&mdash;of the virtue of boosting companies by remaking the corporate entity into a more leaner, more flexible and competitive organisation. It's been a powerful learning experience for me because it takes me to the core of what I have been <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2581"> schooled in. At the end of the day, you can create wealth only if you've got a corporate sector that has its act together and takes a long-term strategic view. Do we get there by growing or&mdash;which is what we've been doing&mdash;by hollowing out companies.</PARA>
<PARA>I could continue. The important point I want to make in this debate is that downsizing has now been rejected as a strategy by many business leaders in the US. It is therefore vital that it also be rejected as a strategy by the public sector and the private sector in Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

They had absolutely no choice: they had to make extremely difficult and unpalatable decisions in relation to their own level of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the greatest respect to the member for Fraser, the greatest problem that he and his colleagues have is that they still fail to understand that, fundamentally, especially in the small business sector of this country, the great bulk of employers feel that their employees are their greatest asset. There is never any acknowledgment of that whatsoever. If the member for Fraser were to bother to go to the small businesses of his own electorate and ask them what their greatest asset is, I can tell you now that they would say that it is their employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the Keating&hyphen;induced recession, the recession `we had to have', a large number of small business people went through equal trauma to that of their own employees whom they had to dismiss. They dismissed them not because they wanted to, not because they had read some book about downsizing in the Canberra or Melbourne libraries, or wherever it might be, not because of some philosophical bent about getting staff numbers down because of some paranoid desire to get rid of staff. It was a matter of utter necessity. If you ask anyone, in small business especially, what single task they hate most, they will tell you that it is laying off staff.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2582">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Fraser fails to appreciate that small business people know their employees, their wives, their husbands, their partners and their children. They know when their birthdays are. They are part of that industry. It is not some paranoid desire to get rid of staff because of what some book has said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Downsizing is put as if it is almost some sort of capitalist plot. It is not. During that recession, it was a matter of horrific necessity. I know that from personal experience. My own father was forced to lay off 450 people some 20 years ago. Imagine the trauma associated with that. He had not read a book about it. He cried for a week. It was the most difficult thing that he has ever done. And it was not from a book.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other important thing is that the member for Fraser still fails to appreciate that it is indeed the scenario set by governments that often determines employment. The single greatest disincentive to employment in this country has been the Labor Party's unfair dismissal laws. There is just no doubt about that. I think the former Prime Minister was forced to recant during the&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Interestingly, a large number of the phone calls that I get about the unfair dismissal law are from employees themselves. They know that it is the greatest single inhibiter to their son, daughter, wife, granddaughter, grandson&mdash;whoever it might be&mdash;getting employment, especially in the small business sector. I am afraid it is a fact of life. The shadow minister can nod his head in disagreement, but it is absolutely a fact of life.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No-one likes staff reductions or this horrible word `downsizing'. We are actually talking about people, and I think the expression degrades the very people that we are talking about. I do not like the expression and I do not like its consequences. In my own region I have seen dramatic reductions in employment over the last 20 years that are totally unrelated to downsizing. If you look at the unemployment levels in my region, you can see a direct correlation between the drop-off in the manufacturing sector, for example, and the level of unemployment. None of that has been driven by some textbook philosophy about staff reduction. It has been driven by circumstances beyond the control of the employees and the employers themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> If we are to have a serious discussion about downsizing, we need an acknowledgment that the former government, of which the member for Fraser was a representative, has been one of the major factors in employee reduction in this country. In my view, that was one of the prime reasons why a very firm decision was made in this country on 2 March to reverse what the Australian public saw as direct government driven employee reductions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not disagree with the view of the member for Fraser that downsizing is dramatic. But let us look behind the scenes, and thus not take the bland view out of the textbook that he has, to see what is driving those things. I think you will find that it has a lot more to do with circumstances than textbooks. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think congratulations are due to the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) on bringing this timely debate to the attention of the House. I have to say to my good friend the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) that, other than the last 60 seconds of your speech, I think you missed the point about what this debate ought to be about. Downsizing, as you said, is obnoxious and a sinister concept.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How the pendulum swings. During the 1960s, management throughout the world rewarded itself through status and power, and no doubt remuneration, by expanding levels of staffing and employment. During the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2583"> 1990s, management is rewarded with status and power by doing the opposite&mdash;downsizing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Downsizing is another word for the sacking of workers and the acceptance of chronic and endemic unemployment at the behest of financial markets. It is a totally negative concept. It is about reductionism. It can also be viewed as a practice that rewards avarice and greed. Chief executive officers around the world are rewarded with exorbitant sums of money in salary and stock options to sack workers. There is no doubt that the late 1980s encouraged personal avarice and greed: privileges for an elite minority at the expense of 10 per cent of everyday workers who received for their role in society, at best, casualisation of labour and lower wages&mdash;as in the United States&mdash;and, at worst, endemic and chronic unemployment, as in Europe and Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In these difficult times I would have thought a more positive view of society would be encouraged, particularly to solve our unemployment problem. Instead of rewarding our small elite for sacking workers I would have thought our goals would be to reward those people who are the builders, the makers, in our society in manufacturing, in science, in research and development, in education and training, and the proponents of public works in infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a sad indictment on our society that an invidious concept such as downsizing can be regarded by some as a plus; negatives become pluses. It is absolutely crazy. We all ought to know that in this place it is easier to attack than defend. It is easier to reduce than to expand. `Down' means lesser intelligence. To go downstream or descend is easier than to go upstream or ascend. `Down' means to push under, to push down, to fall, to lose, to be dejected, to be sullen, to cease, to stop, to be severe. It can go on. The word is just negative. All of the explanations of `down' words or phrases are negative. Make no mistake: downsizing is no different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sections of the world economic community which accept downsizing as a positive are to be condemned. The attitudinal consequences of downsizing with huge rewards <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> given to people who achieve it are, quite frankly, outrageous. The proponents of downsizing equate the term with efficiency, competition and greater productivity. What balderdash! What absolute unproven codswallop! The logical conclusion of any downsizing is that there is nothing left, nothing whatsoever. Downsizing should be rightly equated with social inefficiency, environmental vandalism and the operation of the lowest common denominator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is another example of the sinister use of language used to maintain privilege, status and power as was predicted in a different time by George Orwell, 50 years ago. In his essay `Politics and the English Language' Orwell objected to the disguised real meaning of phrases and words, particularly those used by politicians, journalists and political commentators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He objected to the Stalinist term `elimination of undesirable elements' and to the British usage of `pacification' in relation to India. No doubt he would object, as we all should, to `ethnic cleansing', `collateral damage', `friendly fire'. What would he say about `economic rationalism' and `political correctness'? The point that Orwell made in his essay is that these terms and scores of others currently used today in political, economic, social, environmental and educational writings mean different things to different people, and the absence of any common meaning excludes rational debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Fraser said, Stephen Roach is a leading US economist. He has worked for the US Federal Reserve Bank and is currently a chief economist for the financial institution Morgan Stanley. He was previously a leader of the school of thought which promoted a `productivity led recovery', which used corporate downsizing as a means of retaining business competitiveness. In May this year this foremost proponent of downsizing delivered the concept a fatal blow by essentially rejecting it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2584"> A fundamental role of any economy is to provide jobs and a fair distribution of income to its constituent members. Anthony Sampson recently canvassed similar issues to Stephen Roach in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Company Man</EMPHASIS>. But Samp son's approach and emphasis are quite different from that of Stephen Roach. As with Stephen Roach, Sampson argues a political backlash from electors over downsizing or job losses, for the simple reason that the pace of change cannot be absorbed by the electorate. The political outcome could easily be of the fascist mode. Of course, Sampson is not the first to herald such a direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Corporations and business will not deliver full employment. Why would they? They do not have the long-term responsibility for stability and for families that governments can have and should have. Yet governments all around the world are moving away from the commitments and social contracts they have had with ordinary workers since World War II. This government have already indicated that they have not got an original or workable idea to deal with the problem of unemployment and, worse, that they ignore the signs of discontent out there in the electorate&mdash;much of it in their own electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The workplace relations bill is a classic example of stupidity which, if implemented, will result in lower wages, social disruption, casualisation of labour and lower productivity. The Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996 is another example of a government devoid of answers to the most compelling questions in our nation. The very idea of walking away from government responsibility for education, health and welfare, and handing them over to state governments, is exactly the wrong direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ethan Kapstein, Director of Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in the United States, in a recent article in `Foreign Affairs' volume 75, No. 3, makes a lot of points about globalisation, and also a point about downsizing. I will quote some of those points:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just when working people most need the nation&hyphen;state as a buffer from the world economy it is abandoning them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For generations students were taught that increasing trade and investment, coupled with technological change, would drive national productivity and create wealth. Yet over the past decade despite a continuing boom in international trade and finance, productivity has faltered and inequality in the United States and unemployment in Europe (34 million)&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>four million in Germany&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has worsened.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the political debate in the United States and many other countries will soon turn sour. Populists and demagogues of various stripes will find `solutions' to contemporary economic problems in protectionism and xenophobia. Indeed in every industrialised nation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>including Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">such figures are on the campaign trail. Growing income inequality, job insecurity and unemployment are widely seen as the flip side of globalisation.</PARA>
<PARA>After World War II:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in every industrial country, labour was not treated as a commodity, subject to the free market's destructive whims, and the organisation of workers into labour unions was actively encouraged.</PARA>
<PARA>Note the opposite direction this government is taking. Further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the mid 1980s until now, . . . in order to stabilise their financial affairs states adopted stringent monetary and more recently, fiscal policies&mdash;in short policies deemed sustainable or credible by financial markets. Those policies privileged stability over employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Restrictive economic policies&mdash;reduced deficits, reduced spending, reduced taxes, and the most exalted deity, low inflation&mdash;have favoured financial interests at the expense of workers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Public officials who adopt restrictive measures are labelled `responsible' by editorialists and the markets reward their behaviour, sustaining the ideology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The argument that present day fiscal restrictions must be maintained in order to balance budgets and stabilise national economies is without merit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contemporary critics who would say that spending money on labour policies is unfair to the nation's children forget that the best thing that we can bequeath to the next generation is social peace.</PARA>
<PARA>It is worth noting that over the past 17 months throughout the developed world, every national government, whatever the persuasion&mdash;left, centre or right&mdash;in the OECD has lost. When the world needs leaders at a crucial time, those very same leaders are under such enormous and constant invasive pressure from the media and oppositions that many potential capable leaders are discouraged from even bothering to participate. There are two fundamental questions that all countries in the developed world must address. They are: the distribution of income to reduce <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2585"> inequality and the sustainability of full employment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a little hard to get a handle on exactly what this motion, moved by the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), is driving at. It seems to call upon governments and business to cease shedding jobs and instead start increasing employment. That is a fine objective, but surely the mover of the motion is not denying that there are times when labour does have to be shed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that is not what the mover of the motion means, then there are some parts that I can certainly agree with. If not, I think it is a somewhat simplistic and contradictory motion and would need heavy qualification. But I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> shall try to be positive in my comments on it. Life in the real world is fairly complicated and it is necessary from time to time, unfortunately, to lay people off, and anybody who has been in that position, as previous speakers have indicated, will know how difficult that is. It is one of the hardest things you ever have to do in your life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unemployment figures in this country have not been joyous ones under any government. When we last lost power in 1983, according to the seasonally adjusted figures, 691,000 people were out of work&mdash;a figure far too high. The metal trades decision did not help that. We had world inflation and we had a drought at the time. When we took over power again in March 1996, 811,000 people were out of work. The seasonally adjusted figure was 771,000&mdash;an increase after 13 years of 80,000, despite the well&hyphen;intentioned ideals of the Labor Party to reduce that figure and despite us hearing in question time day after day about the millions of jobs the previous government had created.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were obviously other factors in the equation that were never mentioned, such as population increases and so on. This is something that has been happening over the last 25 years or so. When we previously left power in 1972, 161,000 people, seasonally adjusted, were out of work. When we took over in 1975, 335,000 people, seasonally adjusted, were out of work and that figure was soaring because of the many things that were laid down in the three years of the Whitlam government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The structure of unemployment is particularly worrying&mdash;just as worrying, if not more so, than the number. The long&hyphen;term unemployed, who remarkably used to number in the hundreds back in 1972, are today numbered in the hundreds of thousands. I think the figure has climbed to something like 30 per cent of the total unemployed&mdash;231,000 on my calculation at the last election this year, which was probably a somewhat artificially low figure because of many of the labour market programs into which they were absorbed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also the phenomenon of part-time work increasing greatly over the last decade <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2586"> or so and there has been a soaring increase in those that experience underemployment. We have to take these factors into consideration. Government, of course, impedes many jobs. I guess everybody on both sides of the chamber wants to see us as close as we can get to full employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Business gets bound up in red tape&mdash;rules and regulations&mdash;higher than necessary taxes in many cases and a very rigid wage system in this country, even though it is starting to free up. The on&hyphen;costs to business of employing someone are horrific. They approach 50 per cent in some areas with fringe benefits tax, superannuation, workers compensation, the training guarantee levy&mdash;remember that?&mdash;and all of those sorts of things. Those costs make it harder and harder to employ people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as that, I think most people recognise the urgent need to get rid of the unfair dismissal law in this country. That is probably stopping tens of thousands of people from getting jobs. Business has been constantly besieged with these rules, regulations and taxes which force them, if anything, to shed labour more than they otherwise would as we have just moved through a recession. Many businesses have even given up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at the government side of employment, Australia has had a pretty proud record with the Public Service in the past. That reputation has slipped somewhat in recent years. The quality of the work done through inadequate supervision and rules and regulations, and the politicisation of the Public Service is a disturbing trend in my opinion. In December 1995 the Australian Public Service comprised 145,000 people. In the main areas in which they were employed there were about 20,000 each in the Department of Social Security, the Department of Defence and the Australian Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note the turnover in the Public Service, which takes place naturally all the time, since we left government in 1983. Something like 0.3 per cent of those that moved out of jobs in the Public Service were moved forcibly, whereas today the figure is almost 50 per cent&mdash;49 per cent on my last reading. Forty&hyphen;nine per cent of those who <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> move out of the Public Service are forced to do so. That is something that has to be looked at very seriously indeed and the motion does not take that into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have to look at the fact that every time a public servant is employed their wages and on&hyphen;costs have to be paid for by taxing someone in business or creating a lower standard of living by increasing taxes on wage earners. That is another part of the equation, as desirable as it is to have a certain public service around this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do agree with that part of the motion that refers to the way in which some elements of the private sector have knocked out part of their work force in recent years. I know it is easy to get stuck into the banks, but they have been particularly remiss in this area in my electorate just in recent years, since I have been a member in the area that I now hold or have held. The banks have left Gulargambone, Tullibigeal, Eugowra, Canowindra and Brewarrina. Two have just announced that they are going from the town of Trangie and one is about to go from Narromine and Peak Hill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I admit that the method of banking is changing in this country. People with loans are largely catered for by mobile banking in this country. A person with the knowledge with a laptop computer drives to your door. If you have a loan over $300,000 or $500,000 they talk to you about it and you do not have a need to go to the bank, as such. They also entice customers from the smaller towns to the larger towns where their loans can be more properly assessed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trouble with that is that the banks find they are running at a loss in these smaller towns and they are pulling out. It is not only the job losses of the employees in the towns that are of concern, but also the loss of an institution that has often been there for 100 to 150 years in many of these towns. The National Bank in Brewarrina has been there for 122 years and they are now getting out of Brewarrina. That is very sad to see indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2587"> When you talk to the banking officials they say, `It is not profitable to be in these towns.' I am talking about towns of 1,000 to 3,500 people, such as Narromine. Both banks ann ounced within a day of each other that they were going from Trangie&mdash;Westpac and the National Australia Bank. We promised the National Australia Bank, which was the second one to announce the decision, that they would get all the Westpac customers plus customers coming back from the larger centres like Dubbo. They could have increased their business, on the promises that we had, by 245 per cent. Even after that, they said that there was still a fourfold shortfall on what they would need to be profitable in Trangie. They said they needed $10 million to $15 million on their books to make it viable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frankly, I think the banks have to look at themselves. The credit unions tell me that they can go into these towns and offer virtually the same services with one-tenth of the book value&mdash;about $1&half; million. The only thing they cannot do is give expertise for the large commercial loans. They are working on tying in links with PIBA, the primary industry bank, so that this can be done. If this happens we will see credit unions springing up in country towns all around Australia as the banks move out of these towns. That will be the ultimate answer for the downsizing that has been taking place in these banks in country towns around Australia. I am pleased to see that there is an answer emerging so country people can retain their services in these areas.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion of the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore). In doing so, I wish to make the following points briefly. As well as adding to our unemployment, unfortunately, downsizing in the public sector and in private corporations has created greater demands and pressures on those employees who remain in employment&mdash;the hidden human factor. It has exacerbated what is now one of the main inequalities in Australia today&mdash;the inequality between the overworked and the out of work. We have a situation in Australia now where, on the one hand, many people are suffering stress from too much work and not enough time for family and leisure. Yet, on the other hand, unfortunately, many other people are, for a variety of reasons, suffering poverty, depres <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> sion and low self-esteem from being unable to find any paid work at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that this is an irrational situation, soon to be made worse by the government's attack on Working Nation. Yet the so-called economic rationalists who got us into this mess have not learnt from their mistakes. They are ideological fundamentalists and they are unfortunately in a position in which they have many disciples in the new Howard government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government have moved to drastically downsize the public sector as if it were a natural reflex action to do so. I suggest that they have not given proper consideration to the broader and longer term consequences of doing this, which go beyond the loss of jobs and reduction of services to the public, especially in regional Australia. In part, this is  because they have no empathy with public sector workers. They do not understand or appreciate the valuable work that the staff of government departments and programs do and the way in which the positive benefits of this work ripple through the whole community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the issue of downsizing, I suggest that it is also one of a number of devious methods used to reverse in practice this nation's historical progress towards shorter hours of work. Too many employers are now increasing the amount of unpaid overtime for their existing employees rather than putting on additional employees. One of the unfortunate factors with respect to this problem is that there is a tendency at senior management level for the size of the remuneration package to be directly related not to productivity, morale or best practice at work, but to the success of management in sacking workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party is very concerned about the insecurity and inequality which downsizing is causing in the community. We are carefully analysing reports which document downsizing's negative effects and we are listening to the strong community concerns about the irrational current distribution of work. It is the major policy issue that must confront the nation at  large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also suggest that workers themselves should take a stand on this issue by refusing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2588"> excessive overtime and demanding additional jobs in their workplaces. We all have a responsibility, especially those who have a job at this particular time. If they were to do that, they would then create the jobs for their brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, spouses, partners and, unfortunately, in some cases, even their parents. Unlike the coalition, our policies and future actions will be guided by the need to find solutions to these problems rather than to make them worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Fraser is to be commended for bringing this private member's motion before the House. This House is obligated to do everything possible to encourage business, including local, state and federal government organisations and government business organisations, to rejuvenate and create employment creation policies in association with the private sector. The community demands a sense of security at work and at home. In that context, they are entitled to employment&hyphen;generating economic and social development policies, not antisocial employment downsizing policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the intent of the motion before the House this evening. It is not about scoring short&hyphen;term political points; it is about putting on the agenda the requirement for all of us to face up to the fact that downsizing is not taking Australia forward&mdash;be it in the government or the private sector. If anything, it is creating further uncertainties and insecurities in life and taking Australia backwards. The No. 1 issue that we must face up to in the 21st century is bringing a sense of security back into the Australian community. I suggest to all that the key to that is to pursue job creation policies.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate as an unashamed economic rationalist. I would have been much happier if the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) in his opening remarks&mdash;I hope I quote him with accuracy because that is my intent&mdash;when referring to the `economic rationalists who got us into this mess' had been generous enough to recognise that the economic rationalists who got us into this mess are in fact sitting on the other side of the House and there are other economic rationalists sitting on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this side of the House who had no way of participating in the mess we go into. It is very fair and timely to remind the member for Batman that, effectively, what we are dealing with tonight in this debate on downsizing is policies that the present government has inherited from the present opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would find my own position much more weakened and I would find myself much more enthusiastic about the idea of expanding the Public Service if there had been some evidence to me as a now urban dweller that the services that I came to take for granted have in some way disappeared following the downsizing of the Public Service. But I do not find that the water or power services to my urban block have in any way decreased as a result of the actions of the state government of South Australia and its downsizing policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rose in this debate and introduced myself as an economic rationalist&mdash;not someone who was always an economic rationalist. In fact, I entered this parliament as something of an interventionist but, as a result of watching the previous government in action and recognising the courage of some of its members in pursuing economic rationalist objectives in the long&hyphen;term interests of the national economy, I was converted&mdash;I would remind the shadow minister at the table, the honourable member for Batman&mdash;by the actions of his fellows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to stand here tonight as someone who wants to be callous or unkind or who deliberately seeks to deny people employment, but what I am painfully aware of is that if I want to create jobs that really matter and are not a burden to the Australian taxpayer I have to find jobs that are productive. Every employer that I know who has an employee capable of generating $10 worth of productivity but is effectively paying that employee a few dollars less is in a situation where he is going to keep that employee on because employing that person is to the employer's advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government wishes, I can tomorrow give it a formula that will create jobs right across Australia. They could take every one of my wine grape growers and say, `No longer must you mechanically prune or mechanically harvest your grapes. You must <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2589"> employ people to prune those grapes and next season employ people to harvest them.' Jobs will be created&mdash;and exports in the Australian wine industry will disappear. I can take every one of my grain growers and create jobs tomorrow by telling them that they must abandon their bulk handling techniques, go back to putting grain in bags and go back to getting superphosphate in bags. But how will they compete in a world grain industry?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Downsizing, uncomfortable as it is, has given us the opportunity to reduce our cost of production and gain an edge in the export market. That is why the economic rationalists in the opposition have advocated it for the last 13 years and that is why a number of economic rationalists in the present government have discovered it is the only way to go. You are swallowing the medicine of 13 years of Labor Party policy&mdash;and they are 13 years that have not all been unproductive. If we are serious about job creation, we have to be serious about finding jobs for Australians in a productive sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Batman was quite right when he said that one of the dilemmas we face is that we currently have one group of people overworked and one group of people out of work. That is why the coalition has stood for a new industrial relations policy that offers the very flexibility that allows people, instead of increasing their overtime, to employ other people and enter into new employment arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with the member for Batman that it is scandalous that we should have CEOs whose pay package is determined by the number of people they sack. I cannot live with that, but I do believe there are opportunities to do something about downsizing. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(8.21 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, I congratulate the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) for bringing forward this private member's motion on the question of downsizing and giving the chamber the opportunity to consider issues to which we have probably given insufficient attention before. The member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), who has just concluded his comments, referred to himself as an economic <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rationalist. In a work that was published by John Langmore, the member for Fraser, and one of his academic colleagues, Professor John Quiggan, early last year called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Work for all</EMPHASIS> , they chose to use the expression `economic fundamentalist', which I think is probably a better expression and better summarises the types of policies and objectives which are pursued by people who refer to themselves as economic rationalists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two bases upon which an approach can be made to this question. The first one&mdash;and this was pursued by the member for Fraser and the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford)&mdash;is the economic justification for concern about what we refer to so frequently now as downsizing. Second, we can look at it from the point of view of some of the social imperatives which it involves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make mention of an article in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS> on page 43. The article is written by Terry Smyth and entitled `Axed: whichever way you say it'. I think it is delightful. What he has done is refer to the nomenclature which we used to call at one time `the sack'. I am not going to go into the details of that article, but I encourage anyone to have a look at it. We no longer talk about people being sacked. We have all these euphemisms, slogans, cliches and expressions, which are designed to obscure the reality that people are being sacked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said the second way in which this general question could be examined was on the basis of the types of social imperatives which are inherent in it. What concerns me about it is that, when we talk about wealth creation, we too frequently talk about wealth which comes from material output and from material accumulation. How, within that type of framework, do we measure the enormously important national and social wealth which comes from the dignity, the pride and the self-esteem which is associated with people in employment?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="ANDREW" NAMEID="HE4">

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly. The member for Wakefield says, `Productive employment.' Yes, I endorse that absolutely. No-one should make the claim that we should pursue the inefficient production of material <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2590"> wealth. No-one makes that claim. The examples that the member for Wakefield gave during his contribution would not be endorsed by anyone on this side. Economic dries, wets, rationalists, or fundamentalists&mdash;everyone would accept the need to pursue economic efficiency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is a difference between that and seeking to ensure that there are sufficient employment opportunities available for all people in the community. When we look at the number of unemployed people, including the long-term unemployed, we appreciate the lack of personal esteem, the lack of dignity and the lack of pride on the part of people who find it not possible to make a contribution to that social exercise of producing items for material consumption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we should be looking at is creating a global picture, a global image, of what we mean when we talk about wealth. It is not just things for material consumption. When we talk about wealth we should be talking about the quality of life as well. When we talk about the quality of life, we are talking about the opportunity for people to make an individual contribution to the collective production of wealth. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am terribly sorry, but I cannot really agree with the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), disappointed as I am on this occasion. We do frequently agree, but this will not be one of those times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He compliments the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) on his outstanding contribution in raising this motion. It is one of the greatest nonsense motions that I have read in a great long time. The motion calls on `both business and public sector organisations to reject the perverse and destructive strategy of downsizing and contribute instead to employment generating economic and social development'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Fraser has some sort of economist's&mdash;that is, idealistic and non&hyphen;practical&mdash;view of the real world out there which led him to reach the conclusion that companies and the public sector relieve themselves of employees whom they need to do a job over some ideological desire to contribute to their own wealth by having no <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people to do work to provide services and products for other people which the other people actually want. I do not know how we get to that position, quite honestly, but there are many instances in history where we have become fat and lazy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Victorian government led by Joan Kirner for a time, and before that John Cain, which Jeff Kennett and his people replaced on 2 October 1992, was so careless of taxpayers' funds that they built up layer after layer after layer of public bureaucracy to provide services to the public which, in fact, the public never got. Those layers of bureaucracy literally clamped one upon the other the things that the other was trying to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a bureaucrat, a clerk grade 5, was trying to accomplish a task he was given, a clerk grade 4 probably found a good reason why he should not do it. So the wheels went around and around within a wheel. We wound up with 40,000 or 50,000 public servants on the public payroll who were really not required and who not only were not contributing to the efficiency of supplying services to the public but were a detriment to good service provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So over time the government did relieve itself of that burden, which was paid for by the taxpayers. It is public funds. Remember, it is our taxes&mdash;yours, mine, the people sitting up in the gallery and all the people listening at home. It is our money, our taxes, that pay for public servants to do the job which we want done. If they are doing it inefficiently, then we need to change the mechanisms by which we supply the services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the private sector, I do not know of any company that would divest itself of personnel that it needed to produce its products; supply its services; do market research for it; help it sell or deliver its products in the marketplace; or do research and development to design new products or new vehicles of service which will gain it an increased market in the future. I do not know of any company that would deliberately divest itself of employees who could contribute to that good outcome which it sought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recognise that the member for Fraser is caught up a bit in his ideological warfare, that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2591"> he has read a few articles that said that there were a few companies in the United States that overdid trying to become efficient as they found themselves more subject to international competition by virtue of the fact that their tariff walls and non-tariff trade barriers were falling as a result of GATT and as a result of more bilateral and multilateral agreements that the United States had signed. Maybe a few of them did go too far, and they are now in the process of hiring back. Maybe there are some companies in Australia that went too far, and they are now hiring back. If they are able to do that and maintain profits and their efficiency and productivity and, in fact, improve and increase their output, then I say `good on them', and I welcome that. I agree with the honourable member for Charlton that every person in this world should have productive work to do for the benefit of themselves and society.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I undertook in the House today to check my records to see whether any foreign minister or any minister of any other portfolio from another government had raised with me the question of the abolition of the development import finance facility. I am informed by my department that, between the time the government informed foreign governments of the abolition of the program&mdash;which was 16 May&mdash;and 18 June, the date on which I made my remarks in the House, no minister had expressed any concern to me about the abolition of the development import finance facility program, either in correspondence with me personally or orally.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the amendment be disagreed to.</PARA>
<PARA>The reasons why we disagree to the amendment put to us by the Senate are the following. The coalition announced during the election campaign that it would reduce the provisional tax uplift factor to a level which is more in line with the nominal income growth in the economy. That is why the uplift factor has been reduced from Labor's eight per cent to six per cent in 1996&hyphen;97. The government is also committed to ensuring that the provisional tax uplift factor in all future years is also set more in line with nominal income growth in the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor, the uplift factor was set at unrealistic, high levels. This was merely a grab for revenue which put severe strain on the cash flow position of small businesses. Under Labor, the provisional tax uplift factor exceeded actual growth in income subject to provisional tax in each and every year between 1991 and 1994&hyphen;95. In 1991 and 1991&hyphen;92, Labor set the uplift factor at 10 per cent when the growth in income subject to provisional tax was negative in both years: minus 4.1 in 1990&hyphen;91 and minus three in 1991&hyphen;92.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor set the uplift factor at eight per cent for the last four years, including 1995&hyphen;96. When the coalition moved an amendment to reduce the uplift factor to six per cent in 1995&hyphen;96, Labor did not accept that rate; instead it retained the eight per cent rate. It penalised provisional taxpayers. This government will not allow that to happen again. This government will be ensuring that the provisional tax uplift factor in each year is set <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more in line with nominal income growth to prevent the tax grab under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will be setting the provisional tax uplift factor for each year when the most accurate information is available. For 1997&hyphen;98 and future income years, that assessment will be best made at a later date. The rate for each income year will be based on the most accurate available forecasts of income growth for the coming income year when they are available.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us remember that it was the Labor Party which introduced the legislation to implement a default factor of 10 per cent. In 1990, the Income Tax Assessment Act was amended to set the uplift factor at 10 per cent for 1991 and to provide that the uplift factor would be 10 per cent for subsequent years unless parliament provided otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is not hiking up the uplift factor to 10 per cent after 1996&hyphen;97; that is a pure and simple lie. We are moving this because we are standing by our position. We believe that it is important that we maintain our promise to the people that we would be reducing the uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent, and that is fundamental.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak in opposition to this motion before the House. I do so on behalf of Labor Party members, who will be voting against the motion that has just been moved by the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles). We do that because this provision moved by the parliamentary secretary is part of the $5 billion tax grab of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the government throughout the life of this parliament: $2 billion in the state&hyphen;Costello taxes over the next three years; a $500 million increase in the Medicare levy; $300 million sales tax on cars; and $1.5 billion on the tariff concession orders. The net impact of this provision before the House equates to $540 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2593"> million throughout the three years of this parliamentary term.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This provision is to be condemned because it is part of the Treasurer's $5 billion tax grab. On average, each taxpayer in Australia is $210 per annum worse off under this government&mdash;all before budget night; all before the big slugs come in the next federal budget. It is no wonder that so many government members have been reported in the press as being critical of their Treasurer, because he could not lie straight in bed. It is broken promise after broken promise. It is deceit after deceit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is well and good for the parliamentary secretary to come in and say that they are trying to keep an election promise. The truth, on this motion, is you promised an uplift factor of six per cent full stop, not six per cent for just one year. The parliamentary secretary cannot pretend to the House that he was seeking, along with other government members, a mandate for just 12 months. You sought from the Australian people a mandate for three years&mdash;a mandate for 36 months, not 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) put his hand on his heart and said to the Australian people that the uplift factor would be six per cent, they assumed, and we all assumed, that he was talking about six per cent for three years&mdash;not a tax grab, not another fistful of dollars where you are offering $180 million to the 800,000 provisional taxpayers in Australia for one year only, then you are snatching back $360 million in the following year and snatching back another $360 million in the following year. So the net impact over the three-year life of this parliament is a tax grab of $540 million at the expense of 800,000 provisional taxpayers throughout the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The irony, the real hurt and the real harm in this provision are that the government is letting down and is deceiving the people it said, specifically, it would assist. All those small businesses in Australia who thought, when the government said an uplift factor of six per cent, that it meant it for three years&mdash;they are the people you are hurting by not accepting this Senate amendment this evening. All those self-funded retirees that the govern ment said it would assist through a six per cent uplift factor for three years&mdash;they are the people you are hurting by not accepting this Senate amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decent, honourable and honest thing is to recognise that the government sought a three-year mandate, and when you made a promise for an uplift factor of six per cent you meant it for three years. There was no qualification; there was nothing in brackets; there was nothing in any of the correspondence, the public statements, or the policy speeches that the coalition put out before the election which indicated this was one year only. There was nothing in any of those statements which said that this was an election promise with a sunset: that when the sun went down on 30 June 1997, all bets were off and all of a sudden the uplift factor would go from six per cent to a permanent rate of 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> All the Labor Party is trying to do in this matter, quite seriously and sincerely, is to keep the government honest. There was one way by which they could have had a 10 per cent rate entrenched in the legislation&mdash;that was to promise it. They could have been open, honest and transparent with the Australian people and said, `Look, we'll give you six per cent on the uplift factor, but it is for one year only. It's got a sunset and when the sun goes down on 30 June 1997 all bets are off and then you will have a permanent rate of 10 per cent.' This is a tax swindle. This is a tax grab where the government is trying to offer a fistful of dollars for the purpose of the election campaign&mdash;the tax bribe, the six per cent rate&mdash;and then come into the parliament and legislate a permanent rate of 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have been caught in the Senate. You did not mention any of those things in your second reading speech. The Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens&mdash;all the non-government parties in the Senate&mdash;voted for this provision.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will he say if in actual fact next year's uplift factor, just because of economic circumstances, happens to be put down to five per cent? What will he then be saying in this House? Will he eat humble pie if and when that happens? He does not want to countenance that. He is talking about this being a tax grab when we are actually dropping it from eight per cent to six per cent. Is that what the Labor Party thinks a tax grab is? Do you think it is a tax grab when you drop the taxation factor from eight per cent to six per cent? Is it a tax grab? That is what you said it was. What absolute bunkum!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You avoided the very issue of the 10 per cent default factor&mdash;the factor that your party brought in and left here for the entire time that you were in government. There was not one mention of it, yet you were trying to con the Australian people into believing that is what we were talking about. This is the absolute hypocrisy of the Labor Party: it is trying to tell the listeners to this broadcast that the government is dropping the rate from eight per cent to six per cent because it is a tax grab. It is nonsense, and you know it. You are backing and filling just to fill in space and time when there is no legitimacy to your argument whatsoever.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is ironic that the government is saying it can move legislation next year and have it carried to try to convince all those 800,000 provisional taxpayers that tonight does not matter. This is the same government that tells us about its problems day in and day out, the longest running saga of this parliament, of how you cannot pass legislation in the Senate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government members and ministers stand in this parliament day after day berating the other place, complaining about obstruction, complaining about delays, complaining about its failure to pass legislation, but those on the other side would have us believe tonight that all of that does not matter because on this provision they can pass legislation any moment they like. That is not the case. The Australian people know that if this provision goes through the parliament as legislated, and if the Senate obstructs it in the future, provisional taxpayers will be trapped, caught, stuck with a 10 per cent permanent rate. That is the impact we are trying to avoid tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is in a rare position&mdash;that is, the Australian Labor Party is trying to solve its Senate problem. We are saying, `Don't worry about the outyears and future adjustments on the uplift factor on provisional tax. We can solve the problem tonight by entrenching a six per cent permanent rate.' So if the Senate does obstruct in the financial year after the following one, we will not be trapped with a 10 per cent rate. If the Senate does obstruct for the full course of this parliamentary term, we will not be stuck with a permanent rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What a rare opportunity this is. It is a magnanimous act by the Australian Labor Party to help the government solve its Senate problem on this particular provision. You promised the six per cent permanent rate full stop. You did not promise that it would be six per cent for one year only and that it would then go up to 10 per cent where it would stay. You promised six per cent.</PARA>

Aren't we good fellows, aren't we a good government to bring the permanent rate of 10 in 1997-98 down to nine or eight per cent?' That is a swindle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's credentials on this matter can also be demonstrated by understanding who it is who is leading their parliamentary debate&mdash;not a spokesperson who has anything to do with the Treasury department but a parliamentary secretary in a non-Treasury area. Where is the Treasurer (Mr Costello) tonight if this is such a matter of principle for the government? Where is the Treasurer to deal with these matters? Why has he sent in a parliamentary secretary who has nothing to do with taxation or Treasury matters?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not what you are doing. There was no mention of one year in that particular comment, nor was there any mention of one year in any subsequent public comments which were made by members of the then opposition frontbench. This was their solemn promise. Of course, to all those 800,000 small businesses and self-funded retirees, this was a promise worthy of some consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the following day in the campaign, the then shadow Treasurer on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program said to Fran Kelly that the provisional tax uplift factor needed to be reduced, and that he <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2596"> would set a proper rate `at some kind of average that you would expect incomes to go up, bearing in mind economic growth and the CPI'. So while not mentioning in any form once again the six per cent, he said that their policy structure would be linked to the rate of inflation and growth. That was the only criterion: link it to the rate of inflation and growth. One wonders whether he might expect the rate of inflation in forthcoming years to be around 10 per cent if, indeed, that is the figure to which he pegs the uplift factor. If those opposite are not mentioning any notion of the 10 per cent after the next financial year, then let them state what level they will peg it at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, in the detail of its election policy document, the coalition said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under a Liberal&hyphen;National coalition government the provisional tax uplift factor will be reduced by two per cent to six per cent which is more in line with nominal growth in the economy. This measure will have a one-off cost of $180 million.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, it is six per cent&mdash;end of story, sunset, finish. No mention that it would be maintained or pegged at anything other than 10 per cent in years subsequent to the 1996-97 financial year. This is a duplicitous piece of treacherous policy. As the member for Werriwa has so succinctly said, it is a 1977&hyphen;style fistful of dollars snatched back by those snake oil salesmen opposite&mdash;a tax bribe snatched back after a rare coalition victory premised on the sort of broken promises with which this House is becoming all too familiar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition has again squibbed it. It is fortuitous that tonight the member for Braddon (Mr Miles) has had the opportunity to outline what was, indeed, a most cursory second reading speech when he took two minutes of his allotted 30&hyphen;minute time to say nothing at all about uplift factors, and certainly nothing at all about any notion that it would be 10 per cent in years subsequent to 1996&hyphen;97. He had the opportunity to grab the bull by the horns&mdash;and on this occasion, the member for Braddon squibbed it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The six per cent notion was also passed over in a press release on the subject issued on 8 May by the assistant Treasurer, Senator Short. That was another opportunity missed <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to explain to the people who voted for the coalition, including thousands of small business operators and self-funded retirees, the devastating impact of the legislation, being the 10 per cent uplift factor for the assessment of provisional tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will keep those opposite honest. We support a six per cent level in perpetuity, or certainly in years subsequent to 1996-97, at which time it would be reviewed by future ALP governments. Perhaps it should be less than six per cent in perpetuity because, as Access Economics&mdash;your so often quoted economic forecasters&mdash;have said, in 1997-98 the CPI is forecast to be at 3.3 per cent, in 1998&hyphen;99 the CPI is forecast to be at 4.6 per cent, and in 1999&hyphen;2000 the CPI is forecast to be at 3.9 per cent. An uplift factor of 10 per cent is well over double the forecast CPI.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is flying with very few feathers on this argument. As has been clearly pointed out both in this debate and in the previous debate in the House, they gave a clear undertaking in the run&hyphen;up to the election that they would reduce the provisional tax uplift factor to six per cent. I do not necessarily agree with the proposition put by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) that that was to be there for all time, but they do not, and did not, claim a mandate to give them the choice of, some time after the next financial year or two, increasing at their sole discretion, without reference to this parliament, that uplift factor to 10 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said before in the second reading debate&mdash;but I will repeat it&mdash;it is virtually taxation without representation. There is no other single tax levied by the authority of this parliament which gives the government the discretionary right to increase the rate of that tax. I have used the argument before, but it is relevant, that were the government to seek to increase the top marginal tax rate for PAYE earners, as an example, from 47.5 per cent to something like 60 per cent at some time in the future, this House simply would not swallow it. We would not accept it for any <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2597"> reason. It would be breaking ground which has never been ploughed in this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same applies in this case. Unfortunately, the opposition does not come with clean hands in this matter because it has legislated or attempted to legislate in this very same way. There was a time when it struck the uplift factor at eight per cent and wanted to have the right at some time in the future to increase it to 12 per cent without referring it back to the parliament of Australia. The Senate knocked that out, if I recall correctly. The Senate seeks to do exactly the same thing here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say as a member of the coalition parties in opposition at the time that I did not mind, in fact I welcomed, the fact that the Senate did not agree to increase the uplift factor to 12 per cent at the behest of the then Labor government. I welcome the fact this time that the Senate has chosen to send the proposed uplift factor back to this House with the suggestion that it remain at six per cent. If the government chooses next week, next month, next year or in the next millennium to increase that uplift factor, it will have to come back to the parliament and obtain its blessing as it would do for any other tax rate&mdash;marginal tax for PAYE earners, company tax, or whatever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To leave the discretion to increase a rate of tax with the government of the day should be totally unacceptable. As far as I can recall, it is totally unprecedented and it can only be limited to this particular measure because there was some attempt to do it by previous governments. It is totally unacceptable. It is taxation without representation. I support the amendment sent back to this House by the Senate. I congratulate the Senate for taking the stand it has.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before that intervention by the Deputy Prime Minister, I was going to try to strike a deal with the government on this matter. I was going to be good enough to try to strike a deal. I know I cannot do that with the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) because he has no authority or responsibility for taxation matters. But with the Deputy Prime Minister in the chamber we can argue this sound proposition and perhaps come to an agreement. For a government that does not control the Senate, a government which is always concerned about the passage of its legislation through the Senate, it would be fair and reasonable to set an uplift factor for the outyears according to Treasury estimates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Deputy Prime Minister, wouldn't that be a fair deal to strike&mdash;that we would set the permanent rate according to the best Treasury estimates of growth in provisional tax income and nominal GDP for the outyears? It just so happens that I have available some Treasury forecasts to that effect. I have available the best estimates of the Treasury according to the outyears which would indicate a sound permanent rate for this legislation. Let us have a look at those forecasts. I know they will interest the member for Curtin because he has been making these points for many years. Finally I can satisfy him, at least from our side of the House, by revealing the Treasury forecasts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2598"> For 1997&hyphen;98, the income subject to provisional tax in Australia is expected to grow by 7.1 per cent. That is not within cooee of 10 per cent, Deputy Prime Minister, that you have in your legislation. For 1998&hyphen;99, the rate is expected to grow by 6.5 per cent&mdash;again, a long way from 10 per cent. It is much closer to the six per cent you promised the Australian people. For 1999&hyphen;2000, again, the rate is expected to grow by 6.5 per cent. On the evidence from your own Treasury department, according to your own forecasts, the indication is to set the permanent rate at six per cent. Do the thing that 800,000 provision al taxpayers in Australia were expecting you to do on the night of 2 March. Do the thing that you promised them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it gets even more damning, even worse, for the government. When you look at the Treasury forecasts for nominal GDP, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello) and Senator Short aka Mr Williams in the other place have been arguing, `Let's set the rate near the nominal GDP forecast.' So what is Treasury saying for 1997&hyphen;98 on nominal GDP growth? Six and a half per cent, not within cooee of 10&mdash;much closer to the six you promised. For 1998&hyphen;99, the figure is 6&half; per cent; for 1999&hyphen;2000, it is again 6&half; per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a government that does not control the Senate, that belly&hyphen;aches day and night about its legislation and prospects in the Senate, surely it would be reasonable to take the best forecast that you have got from your own Treasury and apply it to the uplift factor for provisional tax. If you were to do those things, to do that honourable and decent thing in this place, then you would support this Senate amendment. You would support the Labor Party in saying that the permanent rate should be six per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mention Senator Short&mdash;he does not have a very good time in the other place; throughout his parliamentary and public service career he has always been much better at leaking policy than making it&mdash;and I note that he was almost in a state of denial in the other place on 19 June when, talking about Senator Sherry, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He knows full well that the government, proposing the bill that we are, is not in any way saying that next year the rate will go back to 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>If you are saying that the rate does not have to be 10 per cent, why not support the Senate amendment? If you are saying the rate will not necessarily go back to 10 per cent, why not do the thing that the Treasury advises you? Why not do the thing according to your own Treasury forecast and put the permanent rate at six per cent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All these things are so logical and plain. You promise six per cent; you seek a three&hyphen;year mandate. People expect a six per cent rate&mdash;a promise fulfilled over three years. The Treasury forecasts it. Senator Short says you <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> do not really mean 10 per cent when he makes his speech in the Senate. The member for Curtin points out how you lied. You had all these things throughout your time in opposition. Set these rates close to nominal GDP and the forecasts for growth in provisional tax. All those things add up to supporting the Senate amendment. It is the fair, decent, honest thing to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I sincerely urge the government to uphold its election promise to be kept honest, to do the thing that 800,000 provisional taxpayers in Australia expect it to do. Support this Labor Party proposition. Support the Senate amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Dressed up in the rhetoric of helping out the small business sector, the coalition made several promises and proposals during the most recent federal election campaign to change the tax system. One of those promises was to ease the burden of capital gains tax on what it deems to be&mdash;perhaps indirectly&mdash;its own constituency of small business and simultaneously leave the burden, as it put it, of fringe benefits tax on that same constituency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of that process of tax reform for small business, the coalition stated categorically&mdash;stated by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on television, stated by the deputy leader of the government on radio and stated by way of a press release issued by the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Short&mdash;that the uplift factor would be reduced from eight per cent to six per cent, giving the clear and distinct impression that this would be reduced in perpetuity. An essential core of its tax reform package was, as it put it, to revitalise small business&mdash;a platform on which it premised much of its re-election hopes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was no mention at any stage of this being for one year only. This was a con and a sham. It enabled the now government to be seen to be committing itself to keeping its promise to reduce the factor from eight to six per cent but for one year while simultaneously weaseling its own way out of it in subsequent years by not legislating to keep it at anything less than a forecast 10 per cent in years subsequent to 1996&hyphen;97. The government <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2599"> simply cannot have it both ways. It simply cannot on the one hand seek to reduce the uplift factor by two per cent but for one year only and simultaneously make no mention whatsoever of any years subsequent to 1996&hyphen;97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's position was clear and unequivocal as far as the perception it keenly fostered for itself among small business was concerned: it would be changing the uplift factor, and this change would be a permanent one. Now we have this legislation which alters the uplift factor for one year only&mdash;the 1996-97 financial year&mdash;but which makes no mention of changes subsequent to that year, nor does it reset the default rate at a lower figure than is presently the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition may make great exhortations about default rates, but the legislation before the House this evening makes no attempt to reset the default rate at a figure other than is presently the case. I note that the member for Braddon (Mr Miles) is leaving the chamber. He was interjecting quite vociferously and vocally on the whole notion of default rates being at lower figures than is presently the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's attempts to fudge its position and back away from its promise are obvious from the words of the member for Braddon. He said in his second reading speech that the bill will give effect to the coalition's promise and election commitment to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor for the next financial year to six per cent. As the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has so succinctly said, there is no mention of anything beyond that. In fact, one could only assume, as did many small business owners and many self-funded retirees in Isaacs, that this would be a policy initiative on which voters based their election choice&mdash;that this would be legislated in perpetuity. We have already heard the forecast CPI figures out to the year 1999-2000. It is for half the projected uplift factor that may well be contained in the silent aspects of this legislation, being some 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a shonky and deceitful attempt to hoodwink the Australian voters in a way that we on this side of the House have come to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> expect. Those of us who have been in this chamber for a lot longer than me know what happened in 1977. This is no better than the deceit which was perpetrated on the Australian people in that instance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>A bill with substantially the same content to this was introduced to the parliament by the previous government in November 1995. However, the bill lapsed due to the prorogation of parliament this year. Today's bill differs in only two respects from the one introduced by the previous government: (i) the title has been altered and (ii) subitem 4(1), schedule 8 has been deleted because the 30 April 1996 deadline for that particular provision has passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government's bill introduced a number of measures which would result in significant savings over the next three years. These savings have already been incorporated in the forward estimates. For this reason, the government is introducing this bill which incorporates these savings measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I would like to make it very clear that this step does not provide any indication about what may or may not be the subject of ongoing budget discussions. The results of these discussions will be made public at a later time&mdash;in fact, on 20 August, which is entirely appropriate; it is when the budget will be announced to the parliament and the nation&mdash;and will not be influenced by our decision to introduce this bill now.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2601">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill reduces the maximum annual grant from $250,000 to $200,000, providing for fairer distribution of the available funding amongst small and medium exporters. This bill introduces the framework for a flexible grants entry test. This will both limit the payment of grants to claimants who are least likely to succeed and increase the guidance provided to Australia's smaller exporters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The accountability and risk management aspects of the export market development grants scheme will be improved by the other measures contained in the bill. The amount by which a claim for grant can be increased between the time of lodgement and its assessment will be limited. This will reduce the scope for lodgement of ill&hyphen;prepared or ambit claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A limit will be placed on the number of EMDG approved joint venture and consortiums of which a `person' may be a member. This will reduce the potential for individual organisations to receive very large amounts of EMDG funding through multiple membership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Austrade will be given the power to reduce the grant paid to an AJVC claimant to the extent that the claimant has breached the conditions of approval of its AJVC status. Grants will not be paid where a consultant convicted of fraud or dishonesty offences has prepared the claim or where the expenditure in the claim is related to illegal activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the act will be amended so that the general prohibition on the payment of grants in relation to `in house' expenses cannot be circumvented through the use of interposed companies. I commend this bill to honourable members in this the last sitting week planned for the autumn session.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would add that it is the wish of the government that this bill be passed in accordance with the undertakings that were given by the previous government, so that those who are submitting applications in respect of this financial year, finishing on 30 June, in a few days time, will do so on the basis of having a firm framework with regard to their applications and the processing of those applications. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5V5">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For that reason, the opposition does not oppose the bill. As the Deputy Prime Minister has alluded to in his own speech, other than stylistic changes and a certain commencement date the bill mirrors the previous government's Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995, which was sponsored by the then trade minister, the then Senator Bob McMullan. That bill lapsed with the dissolution of the parliament. I thank the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade for his courtesy in alerting me to his introduction of this bill at an earlier than usual stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill amends the Export Market Development Grants Act to reduce the maximum grant payable in any one year from $250,000 to $200,000 and introduces a range of improved administrative accountability and risk management measures. The legislation also introduces registration and grant entry testing of first&hyphen;time claimants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reading speech of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) together with evidence given to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee on export readiness and administrative burdens, are matters which are worth drawing attention to. I propose to do that in the course of my contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2602"> As I have said, the context of this bill is much more important than the bill itself and it is what is not here rather than what is. That context of course is the continuity of the export market development grants scheme. The current indications are that the government is considering either abolishing or substantially amending or cutting the EMDG scheme in breach of numerous express elec tion commitments. The bill must be examined in that light, namely, whether this government does have a commitment to increasing exports, to keeping jobs and to keeping election commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The attitude of the opposition on this bill is that it is about keeping the government honest and up to the mark as far as its election commitments are concerned. The concerns of the opposition are reflected in an amendment to the motion for the second reading which I will formally move at the conclusion of my remarks. I outline that amendment. It says:</PARA>

<PARA>My colleague the member for Cunningham and shadow minister  for sport and tourism (Mr Martin) will formally move an amendment in the consideration in detail stage to reflect that election commitment on the part of the government so far as the tourism industry is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The EMDG scheme, which is administered by Austrade, was instituted by the Whitlam Labor government in 1974 to encourage Australian businesses to seek out new export markets for Australian goods and services. It <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is worth while referring to a short extract from the second reading speech on its introduction by the then Minister for Overseas Trade, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the emphasis in a new export incentive scheme should be on market development rather than perpetuating payments on exports. Under the previous export incentive arrangements the bulk of the benefits went to a few large companies. Moreover, because the benefits under the schemes took the form of rebates of income tax and payroll tax liability, many small exporting firms and other bodies engaged in export such as statutory marketing authorities and co&hyphen;operatives were disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scheme should not involve rebates of tax and benefits should be in the form of grants; particular encouragement should be given to small and medium sized firms to become involved in exporting; there should be a ceiling limit on the benefits received by any one firm or group of firms; and there should be a better balance established between the costs of revenue and benefits to the exporting sector.</PARA>
<PARA>The limit proposed in the 1974 legislation which instituted the scheme was a maximum of $100,000. In this bill the maximum amount is reduced from $250,000 to $200,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme itself is generally regarded as a successful export incentive scheme. As I have indicated, it currently provides taxable cash grants of up to $250,000 per annum, based on the expenditure incurred by an Australian person or company seeking to create or expand exports of their products in overseas markets. Provided that the person has incurred at least $30,000 of eligible expenditure in one year, they will be entitled to a grant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The grant is calculated at 50 per cent of eligible expenditure after the first $15,000. Claimants can receive up to eight grants that are subject to a performance test after two grants. Eligible expenditure includes upfront marketing costs, such as travel expenses, special promotional literature, and overseas representations. Companies which record export sales above $25 million per annum are ineligible to apply for a grant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The success of this scheme is evidenced by the fact that over 69,000 grants were made <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2603"> between 1974 and 1991. The history and the experience of this scheme are that most grants are in the range of $65,000. In 1994&hyphen;95 approximately 3,400 exporters received a total of over $210 million. Projections made in 1995 expect the scheme to grow to around $290 million by 1998-99. The average grant in the order of $65,000 is one of the reasons why the opposition does not object to the reduction of the maximum grant from $250,000 to $200,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Experience has been that some 70 per cent of all the recipients are small and medium exporters with 25 or fewer employees. That bears out the ambition and aspiration of the then minister for overseas trade when the original legislation was introduced. In 1994, as part of the Working Nation statement, the previous federal government announced the extension of the EMDG scheme for a further five years to 1999, and projections were that, as a consequence, assistance would be afforded to up to 5,000 exporters per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All this detailed information points to a very effective and valuable scheme that continues to significantly assist Australian exporters seeking out new markets for Australian goods. New markets for Australian goods and services mean more jobs for Australians. More jobs mean better living standards and a stronger economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the key benefits of this scheme are that it acts as an incentive for Australian companies to consider and seek out export markets. Increased export activity means increased job opportunities. The scheme returns a high percentage to the Commonwealth through tax receipts, and reviews of this scheme have indicated that that can be in the order of 42 per cent of returns through tax receipts. The scheme has a high multiplier effect&mdash;some estimates are as high as 30 to one&mdash;with usual estimates in the range of $9 to $10 for every dollar granted. The scheme is widely regarded as having helped foster an export culture amongst small and medium sized companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The benefit of the scheme was seen in submissions and in evidence given to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee. This bill was intro duced into the Senate and the Senate, in its wisdom, referred the bill to the Senate legislation committee to consider the content of the bill and also to consider the bill in the context of the continuity of the scheme. A range of parties gave evidence to the Senate committee. I think it is worth while relaying to the House some of the evidence from interested parties. The Australian Publishers Association, through its immediate past president, Ms Susan Donavan, said as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The good news is that, almost as a direct result of the scheme, our industry has seen exports increase by 100% over a four year period. In the period 1990&hyphen;1994, our exports grew from $41 million to over $80 million and we have tabled those figures.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Institute of Exporters, through Mr Russell Chandler, said in evidence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scheme is cheap to administer, with some 95% of its budget going directly to the exporter, and independent research has shown that for each $1 paid in rebate additional export marketing expenditure of $2.60 results and additional exports of between $15 and $25 result. . . . on an after&hyphen;tax basis, it is estimated that the government directly claws back 42% of the scheme's cost and indirectly claws back unidentified additional revenue relating to sales tax, payroll tax et cetera. In summary, of the $196 million paid in rebate in respect of the 1993-94 financial year, the maximum real cost was $114 million.</PARA>
<PARA>Further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the EMDG scheme is focused, efficient and a relevant scheme offering measurable financial benefits to Australia in the short and long term.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are just two examples of many pieces of evidence which go to the success of this particular scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The testament to the scheme's success does not just lie in the evidence of these industry groups to the Senate committee. The scheme has been the subject of a number of reviews, and all those within recent years. All those reviews have concluded that the scheme is successful and achieves what it sets out to do, namely, to encourage Australian business to seek out export markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two key reviews which are referred to so far as the analysis of the EMDG scheme is concerned. In 1994, a review of the scheme involving the Departments of Finance and Treasury was undertaken by Austrade in consultation with Price <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2604"> Waterhouse and Professor Brewley of the University of New South Wales. That review was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Helping to meet the export challenge</EMPHASIS>, and the review found that the scheme was achieving its object of encouraging Australian companies to seek out and develop new export markets. The key findings of that review were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The EMDG Scheme is achieving its objective of assisting Australian businesses&mdash;especially small and medium sized firms&mdash;to seek out and develop new export markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Revenues from taxes on grants receipts and profits on additional exports were estimated to return 42% of the cost of the scheme to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of the growth in the EMDG scheme has come from the services sector, accounting for 45 per cent of all grants at the time of the review, with manufacturers at 37%, traders at 15% and primary producers at 3%.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The minimum level of qualifying expenditure, the grant rate, number of grants and performance test are largely appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">EMDG recipients are highly committed to exporting in terms of exporting and investment. On average exporting activity accounts for 50% of the employment and investment of EMDG recipients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">EMDG recipients increased their own spending on export market promotion by more than the value of the grant.</PARA>
<PARA>The second review of this scheme, which is frequently referred to, is an Auditor&hyphen;General's efficiency audit on the scheme in 1993&hyphen;94&mdash;ANOA <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Audit Report No. 33</EMPHASIS> &mdash;and Austrade has effectively implemented all the recommendations which were made by the audit office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That, I think, is a reasonably accurate analysis of the history of the scheme and its success to date and, as a consequence of that knowledge, it was not surprising in the course of the recent election campaign to see the coalition committing itself to a continuation of the scheme. In the coalition's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting the challenges: Liberal and National Party trade strategies for the future</EMPHASIS>, the coalition expressly committed itself in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's Export Market Development Grants (EMDG) Scheme has been in operation since 1975, and has been supported by Australia's export businesses. The coalition will retain the Scheme but will undertake its review to ensure that it remains <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as a source of assistance to small and medium businesses and look at ways that access to grants can be made more efficient.</PARA>
<PARA>That was on page 3 of the relevant policy document. At page 30 of the same document, under the title `Export incentives', is the bald phrase:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will maintain the Export Market Development Grants (EMDG) Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>Those particular commitments were added to by the then shadow minister for trade and now Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) on 15 February 1996 in the course of a debate with the then Minster for Trade, Mr McMullan, who had by then resigned as a senator to stand as a candidate for the seat of Canberra. In the course of that policy debate at the National Press Club, the now Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . also it is a privilege to present the Coalition trade policy, `Meeting the Challenges' and debate that policy.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And finally, ladies and gentlemen, we of course have as the fifth track in relation to our approach to trade, the promoting and financing of Australian exports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Austrade stays, the EMDG scheme stays . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That was a bald commitment to the continuation of the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It comes as no surprise that consistent speculation that the scheme will either be abolished or have its funding and scope substantially reduced has seen a range of continued expressions of concern from relevant industry sectors about the continuation of this scheme and the danger that the coalition government will not meet its expressed election commitments. As far as industry sectors are concerned, what has been alarming so far has been the deafening silence on the part of relevant ministers to give any sense of continued commitment to those particular commitments I have referred to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this House, in the course of any number of question times, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) has refused to commit and reaffirm himself to those commitments. The Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2605"> likewise refused to commit himself to those commitments. The Minister for Trade, the Deputy Prime Minister, has been deafening by his silence and his refusal to indicate whether the commitments he gave as shadow minister for trade and the commitment he gave at the National Press Club stand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As early as April we saw the threat to this particular program. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 19 April, an article by Tom Burton and Louise Dodson entitled `Razor gang takes aim: export scheme faces abolition under Budget plan' reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government is turning its guns on exporters, with a plan to abolish the $237 million Export Market Development Grants scheme being considered as part of the attack on government spending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The move to abolish the scheme, which is the major assistance program for exporters, would have a major impact on small business&mdash;a key constituency the Coalition appealed to in the recent election.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The abolition of the EMDG scheme would represent a major breach of the Coalition's promise to maintain the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>On page 2 of the same report, in an analysis by David Shires, Mr Shires reminded us that the government has form in this particular matter when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prime Minister Mr John Howard tried to remove it once before: in the 1987 election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The then president of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, Mr Peter Frankel, resigned from the Liberal Party very publicly.</PARA>
<PARA>As we are growing accustomed to with the government, it is one thing in the run&hyphen;up to the election but it is another thing when you now see its natural instincts. The managing director of the Australian Business Chamber, Mr Philip Holt, was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS>  on 20 May this year, and I refer to his reported comments. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian Business Chamber managing director Philip Holt said any attempt to abolish the $237 million export market development grants would be a major backward step for small and medium&hyphen;sized businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Holt said if reports of the abolition were correct, the Government would be breaking an <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> election promise and affect job creation and increase the balance of payments deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"This scheme helps small and medium businesses get into export markets, markets politicians have been telling us for years are vital to the Australian economy,"</PARA>
<PARA>There is an election commitment the coalition made which I have not yet referred to but now will. Page 9 of the coalition trade document states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When all is said and done, the foundations for a successful trade strategy are the export activities of companies and individuals. Accordingly we will welcome the contribution of the business community through Chambers of Manufactures and Chambers of Commerce and Industry, and other similar bodies to improve our international trade performance.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope the Deputy Prime Minister takes note of that particular comment from Mr Holt and also the comments made in evidence to the Senate committee. Those sorts of contributions litter the relevant materials on this particular subject. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS>  of 10 June, an article headed `Will the razor gang slice export grants?' states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A scheme that has helped thousands of companies and generated strong export income is threatened by Canberra cost&hyphen;cutting.</PARA>
<PARA>There are a couple of quotes in this particular article which I will draw the attention of the House to. Trevor Tappenden, responsible for Ernst and Young's national entrepreneurial services divisions, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">EMDG has been a saviour to Australian small business getting into new export markets. It has created an environment for them to increase our exports.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Holt, whom I have referred to, is also included in this article. Mr Holt says he `can't believe any government would be so stupid as to dump the EMDG'. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This country must export and keep increasing its exports, and that growth increasingly is coming from small business, who are the ones who mainly use and must have this support . . . and then this happens . . . it sure isn't what we thought would come from the small business policy that promised to make the climate better for the sector.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Holt goes on to say that `the speculation is that business will fear the worst and be grateful that the scheme is only cut, not dismembered'. I will refer the House shortly <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2606"> to express commitments the Deputy Prime Minister gave in the course of 1995 that the scheme would not be substantially tinkered with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the course of the formal submissions given to the Senate committee to which I have referred, we find a number worth drawing attention to. The MTIA, Australia's manufacturing, engineering and construction industry association, said in its formal submission to the committee&mdash;and this submission is signed by Leigh Purnell, one of its directors:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wanted to take the opportunity presented by the current reference to raise with you MTIA's enormous concerns regarding the mooted abolition of the Export Market Development Grants (EMDG) Scheme. MTIA met with the Prime Minister last month during which we explained our concerns on this matter in detail.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry is totally opposed to any move by the Government to break its election promise to retain the EMDG scheme. It is essential that Australian exporters are provided with both a strong domestic base from which to export and effective forms of export assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any reduction in funding for export assistance schemes would be short-sighted in the extreme, particularly given the level of Australia's current account deficit, and would have the inevitable result of reducing the export promotion activities which industry is able to undertake.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Institute of Export (NSW) Ltd, in the conclusion to its submission, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is that the Coalition Government promised not only to maintain the Scheme in general, but also, to enhance it for the developing tourist industry. It can be presumed that it had good reasons to make this election promise other than to win votes. The promise coincided with the Labor Government policy which had seen the scheme extended to 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clearly demonstrated by independent research that the Scheme repays the nation in employment and taxes via production and exports to a much greater extent than its cost.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major thrust of the Scheme is towards small to medium entrepreneurs and exporters who have been the substantial contributors to recent large improvement in manufacturing and knowledge based exports.</PARA>
<PARA>Those sorts of comments litter the submissions made to the Senate committee.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have referred to the formal submissions, but some of the comments that were made in the course of the Senate committee's public hearing are worth drawing attention to. Mr Peter Campbell, the President of the Australian Publishers Association, gave evidence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We had a meeting last year with the shadow trade minister (Tim Fischer), who gave us his personal and unequivocal commitment to the future of the grants scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>Susan Donavan, the past president, said in evidence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year we studied with great interest the policy statements of both parties and took great comfort from the fact that both the coalition and the Labor Government promised to continue the scheme into the year 1999. As well as that, our industry group had a meeting with the then shadow minister Mr Fischer, who gave us his personal assurance that the scheme would continue to that date.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We received a letter from him last week which concluded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The process, as you say, has still not been resolved and will be an ongoing process. Consequently I am not able to comment on the future of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>This is from the man who told the National Press Club `EMDG stays'. Susan Donavan completed her evidence by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As people committing large amounts of money to export, this fills us with terror, particularly at a time when all publishers are putting together their budgets for the next financial year and making very strong commitments, both in developing products that will not be able to proceed if the scheme is abolished.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Cook, in the other place, put some questions on notice to the Australian Publishers Association because he was not able to get all his questions in in the allotted time. One of the questions which the Australian Publishers Association, Sue Donavan, took on notice was the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How does the Association view the widely reported rumours that the ERC has decided to abolish the EMDG Scheme?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer was provided as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Association is extremely concerned about the threat to the future of the Scheme, especially in view of the Government's election commitment to maintain it. This commitment was contained in the presentation of the Coalition's trade policy by Hon. Tim Fischer MP, as Shadow Minister for Trade to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2607"> the National Press Club on 15 February 1996, and repeated on Pages 1 &amp; 8 of the Coalition's Industry and Commerce Policy document released by Hon. John Moore MP (Shadow Minister for Industry, Commerce and Public Administration). These pronouncements reinforce the clear and unequivocal commitment to continue the Scheme, without fiddling amendments, until 1999. This was also given to me by Mr Fischer at a meeting in his office on 29 June 1995. At this meeting, Mr Fischer acknowledged the concerns put to him that frequent adjustments to EMDG confused exporters, complicated the claiming process and undermined the financial reliability of the Scheme as an aid in planning future promotional efforts.</PARA>
<PARA> I leave to one side the question of whether the introduction of this bill by the minister is in breach of that personal assurance. Certainly, what we find in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  of Monday, 17 June is in breach of that. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  entitled `Funding cuts hit export scheme' reports:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Federal Cabinet's razor gang has retreated from a threat to abolish a $240 million trade promotion scheme in this year's Budget . . . In the first round of Budget planning, the Expenditure Review Committee has decided to cut funding to the Export Market Development Grants scheme&mdash;the leading program for assisting exporters&mdash;by about 50 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senior government sources said the trade promotion agency, Austrade, had been asked to examine how the spending cap placed on the EMDG could be implemented and returned to the ERC with proposals when the second round of Budget meetings starts on July 2.</PARA>
<PARA>Given the evidence of the Australian Publishers Association, the government will not be able to slide out of this election commitment by slashing the scheme and then saying that it has continued the scheme by not abolishing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee recommended in its majority report to the Senate that the bill be enacted in its current form. Senator Cook produced a minority report, and I will read the recommendations of Senator Cook's minority report. He recommended that the bill as introduced be amended in the following areas:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.1<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a transitional provision is included to phase in the reduction of the grant ceiling of $250,000 to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $200,000, so that firms are not <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> commercially disadvantaged; and,</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.3<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the government consults with industry on the new accountability and risk management measures with a view to reducing the complexity and red tape involved.</PARA>
<PARA>In addition to those very grave concerns about the continuity of the scheme, much of the evidence that was given to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee was in respect of the export ready test and the administrative burden that, according to industry, measures in this bill will impose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Brownhill, representing the Minister for Trade in the Senate, gave a number of undertakings in the course of debate about technical and other matters which other senators placed him on notice they would certainly monitor. Without going through the detail of those, that is the attitude of the opposition in this House as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This bill is important for what is not contained in it as much as for what is there. The opposition does not oppose the bill. We do oppose the government's continuing deafening silence in respect of the continuation of the scheme. Whilst the Minister for Trade may well be silent at this stage, we will be doing our best to ensure that if we discover, as we expect, in the course of the budget on 20 August that the scheme is abolished or gutted, then we will be drawing attention to the personal assurances that have been given.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise tonight to speak on the government's Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. I found that at the end of his remarks the shadow minister, the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), was somewhat confused. He spoke of concerns that the opposition has about some of the detailed points of this bill and whether they will disadvantage or hurt industry. The reason I had some difficulty with that is that this bill was essentially produced by the former ALP government, those people who are now sitting in opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the shadow minister was sitting on this side of the House last year when the government introduced almost the same bill. There are a couple of very minor changes. One is the name of the bill; the other is the elimination of a minor bit of the earlier bill which, because of the time that has elapsed since it was introduced, is no longer applicable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, the changes that this bill introduces to the export market development grants scheme are changes which will clean up the act and make it applicable to a greater number and a greater range of small <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and medium&hyphen;sized businesses. The act has undergone a great number of changes throughout its life since 1975. I have spoken in this House on no less than four occasions on changes to the export market development grants scheme and on changes that should have occurred to that scheme a long time ago but which we still have not caught up with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill which, as I said, is a former ALP government bill, was introduced in the Senate in order to get these changes through because the parliament was running out of time. We had no real problem with the then Labor government's bill so we picked it up and reintroduced it and are now debating it in the House of Representatives. It is a mark of how confused and how uncomfortable these people who belong to the Australian Labor Party are in opposition that they find that they must take exception to and argue with a piece of legislation which they initiated in this place at another time. They are a very confused lot. They have not yet settled into their role as an opposition.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MARTIN" NAMEID="8I4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr Martin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are not opposing it, Bob.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OT4">Mr CHARLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Then the member for Perth should listen to your words. The opposition thinks that being in opposition means that they should oppose everything that happens simply for the sake of it. That seems to indicate their attitude to most things in this place recently&mdash;whether reasonable or unreasonable does not really seem to matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of major points to this bill about which I would like to speak briefly. Firstly, the bill will reduce the maximum annual grant from $250,000 to $200,000. That will spread the available funds around a bit more and allow a bit more participation by small and medium&hyphen;sized businesses. After all, the original purpose of the EMDGS was to encourage small and medium&hyphen;sized businesses to get into the business of export.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government had no overall, integrated plan about how industry should develop or how government should help it to develop or restructure. It had no plans for industry, just a hodgepodge of shotgun approaches. This scheme was one of them. The former government thought it might be a good idea if they gave industry some money <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2609"> to help itself. It thought that would do a bit to improve exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This scheme has helped; there is no question about that. It is one of a range of the former government's grants and development programs which has had a positive effect in encouraging Australian business to export. But its original purpose was to encourage small and medium&hyphen;sized businesses to export. That is why I have no problem with reducing the maximum annual grant from $250,000 to $200,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other major point is that the bill introduces the framework for a flexible grants entry test. Presently, the rules are so rigid that many small and medium&hyphen;sized businesses have difficulty understanding let alone meeting the criteria without hiring consultants to help them apply. This new mechanism will allow Austrade some flexibility. For those companies which clearly have a future, which have a good show of achieving their objectives&mdash;which have products and services for export, not just this year but next year&mdash;Austrade has the opportunity to approve their applications without overly burdening them with bureaucratic procedure, such as forms, filing and all the rest of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it was last year or the year before that I noted in a speech on the export market development grants scheme that far too many companies applied for grants, got the grants, were successful in the first year and fell over in year two or three or four or five. They had one shot. They spent their $30,000. They got their grant and something happened, but obviously it did not do very much to improve Australian exports because they did not continue with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is one of the complaints I have had about the scheme for a long time. We want to make sure this thing is targeted to those companies who really use it to benefit Australia. That is what it is all about, isn't it? It is not about handing out taxpayers' money to companies so they can get on a bit of a gravy train. The scheme is about encouraging those companies that otherwise might not market their products or services in another country, to help us with our balance of payments problem, to help us try to eliminate the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> current account deficit and to do something about the horrible deficit we have in our terms of international trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The grants scheme is about encouraging companies to develop marketing programs to take their products and services offshore. I think it is a fine objective. The amendments to this bill will help make it easier for some small businesses to be successful in applying to be registered under the scheme, whereas prior to these amendments they might not have been successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another major point the bill addresses is the fact that the amount by which a grant can be increased between the time of lodgment and the time of assessment will be limited. I am advised that some companies make a regular practice of putting in an ambit claim, except not a high ambit claim like the unions but perhaps a low ambit claim. Then, through the course of the year, they decide to spend up big but not notify the department so, when it comes time to put in the paperwork for the grant, all of a sudden the department receives a very large request for funds when it had expected something more modest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment essentially says that you ought to know what it is you are going to do and that you ought to have a program in advance of making your first claim so you know exactly what you are going to do. The amendment will let you increase your claim by 10 per cent between time of lodgment and time of assessment by the department and you can decrease it, if necessary. That seems totally reasonable to me. I am aware of the fact that it is based on experience, rather than on some ideological concept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another of the major points the bill addresses is the number of approved joint ventures. The bill will limit the number of approvals. Some problems generated by joint ventures have been reported. Some companies have decided to make a regular practice out of joining joint ventures. One single company joins one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine&mdash;heaps of joint ventures. They all get a piece of the action and it sort of leapfrogs. They beat what was a $250,000 maximum grant and the now $200,000 maximum grant by adding claim on to claim on to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2610"> claim. I suspect that at the same time some of these companies are also receiving other government grants and benefits for industry which involve research and development and perhaps some of the other programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps this is the appropriate time. The former government generally relied on five major programs to try to encourage industry to develop in Australia and to export. These five major programs were not integrated with an overall macro-economic policy that was designed to encourage Australian manufacturing and development of Australian industry, nor was it associated with micro-economic policy which sought to improve cost&hyphen;effectiveness to Australian industry by reducing the costs of transport, power and all the rest of the utilities to companies, by reducing the cost of government regulation. The former Labor government attacked each of these areas as an issue on its own. The program, to my mind, was never integrated. It was never designed to achieve an overall outcome, but each of the programs was set aside on its own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of these major programs is the one we are debating here tonight&mdash;the export market development grants scheme. Another is the government's 150 per cent taxation benefit for research and development programs. The third one is the computer bounty which we debated in this House last year and which the former government sought to change dramatically and which ultimately was brought back more closely to what the program originally contained because it was found that many companies which had moved to manufacture printed circuit boards in Australia would have been dramatically disadvantaged had that scheme just been cancelled without access to any other government benefit at the same time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A fourth major government program has been the factor F pharmaceutical scheme, which has sought to encourage pharmaceutical companies to develop their research and development efforts and to produce drugs in Australia for both the Australian market and for export, and to do this by giving them grants which really offset some of the price differential between the low price that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian government sets for its pharmaceuticals through the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and the much higher average general price that those pharmaceuticals would attain in the international marketplace&mdash;in other words, the average wholesale selling price on the international market. That latter price is most generally very much higher than what the Australian government will pay pharmaceutical companies for their products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was a temporary, interim measure brought in by former Senator John Button when he was industry minister. It has had a huge impact on a number of pharmaceutical companies, including Glaxo, which is headquartered in my electorate and which has become a major producer of pharmaceuticals in the Australian context and exporter and is doing heaps of research and development. This program, together with the 150 per cent R&amp;D, was a factor in helping to kick-start them, to get them going from a low base to up the ante. That has been true of a number of other pharmaceutical companies as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today we have a pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. When I entered this parliament in 1990 I was concerned that our pharmaceutical industry was headed towards zero and we looked like importing just about the lot. That has been turned around, and that is good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government had two other programs of which bits and pieces are continuing. One of those is the automotive plan and the other is the textile, clothing and footwear plan, which offers a number of incentives to companies if they take into account a number of factors and reduce their staff and  try to hang on producing in Australia rather than giving up as tariffs came down rather rapidly over a reasonably short period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another major point of this bill is that Austrade will now have the power to reduce grants to a claimant where the condition of approval or its status have been breached. In other words, if the company has done the wrong thing, Austrade will have the power to reduce the grant in the areas where the company has done the wrong thing. I see no problem with that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2611">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another point is that grants will not be paid when a consultant to a company preparing a claim for the company is found to have been convicted of fraud. This clause does not delete the company's entire claim; it would simply delete the portion that was affected by the individual who had been convicted of fraud. Without having any knowledge, I suspect that this amendment was brought into the act because of experience over time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last major item that I believe the bill addresses is that there is now a prohibition on payments of grants to prevent payments for in-house expenses, which have not always been allowable, but to prevent companies from circumventing the rules by the use of interposed companies. For instance, when calling an outside consultant `a consultant' in order to try to build up expense where it is simply transferring expense from general company overheads to an outside consultant, the amount of money transferred through that artificial accounting practice would be disallowable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The export market development grants scheme has been a good scheme for industry. It has encouraged export. One of the things that the former government never did, which I was highly critical of for a long period, was that it treated the tourism industry differently from every other kind of industry. For some reason it had this ideological hang&hyphen;up that because there was a whole separate grants mechanism for the tourist industry, which financed generic advertising of Australia in overseas markets, because we spent that money, somehow the ALP had a hang&hyphen;up that we should not treat our tourism operators in this country the same as manufacturers or other service providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a very long time&mdash;in fact, until last year&mdash;the government refused to consider tourism at all. It has been in and out of these kinds of schemes for a long time. They finally decided that, if you were an inbound tourism operator and you offered a whole range of services, you might satisfy the requirements of the act, but you would only get paid 50 per cent of what everybody else got, being 25 per cent of your eligible expenditure. I always thought that that was wrong. As a member of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, which inquired into that aspect of the EMDG scheme, I strongly supported a finding that it was inequitable and we were treating some Australian businesses differently from other Australian businesses. I have always deplored that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a great range of small tourism operators in my electorate who are very important. Business is important nationally. With over three million tourist visitors to the electorate of La Trobe every year, I speak with some power of influence in this area. I encourage the government to rectify this anomaly at the earliest possible moment. I recommend the bill to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to let the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) know that he will get that opportunity by supporting an amendment which I am foreshadowing, which will hopefully pick up exactly the sentiments he most recently expressed&mdash;that is, that the EMDG scheme is fully extended to the tourism industry. Not only does it do that, but it extends it in light of the then opposition, now government, policy that they went to the election with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be no doubt that the amendment which my colleague the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) has already indicated he is moving as part of this legislation is a very significant and important one. Despite what was said, we on the opposition side are not opposing this piece of legislation. What we want to do is make sure that the government stays true to itself in adopting its own policy in respect of the EMDG scheme and, in particular, in respect of tourism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third part of the amendment moved by my colleague the member for Perth specifically talks about the tourism industry and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) condemns the Government for its failure to meet its election commitment to extend the Scheme by making full Export Market Development grants of 50% available to the tourism industry.</PARA>
<PARA>People might ask: why is there concentration on the tourism industry with this particular legislation? It is quite obvious. The tourism <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2612"> industry now is Australia's leading export earner. It is as simple as that. We should be encouraging opportunities to be made for people in employment, particularly those in small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I remarked in a matter of public importance in this place some time ago on the export market development grants scheme, small businesses are the driving force behind many of the activities of the tourism industry. It is something the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) himself agrees with. During the election campaign the Prime Minister said he had this obsession: an embracing of the small business sector of the economy and he wanted to see it succeed. In tourism that is exactly what many of the operators are&mdash;small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth report of the Tourism Forecasting Council&mdash;a great publication from a very well respected organisation that the former Minister for Tourism, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), sought to establish and was successful in establishing&mdash;gives an immediate picture of how important the tourism industry is. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, you were in the chair when we were debating the MPI: the EMDG scheme is important to small businesses and to the regions that both you and I represent where tourism is an important component of our economic wellbeing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By looking at the document to which I have referred&mdash;the fourth report of the Tourism Forecasting Council&mdash;you find, in a national sense, how important tourism is. For example, it is forecast that inbound international tourist arrivals will grow by nine per cent a year to 8.8 million by the year 2005. Expected growth in 1996 of 11.8 per cent will slow, except in the Sydney Olympics year. The fastest growth is to be from Asian countries other than Japan. We find that real tourism export earnings will reach $30.6 billion in the year 2005, up from $13.1 billion in 1995. What a phenomenal rate of growth! What a phenomenal return! This represents an average annual growth rate of 8.8 per cent. In terms of accommodation, we find that 36 million room nights in hotels, motels and guesthouses were sold in 1995, up 3.9 per cent on 1994, takings were up by 11 per cent to $3.26 billion and the national average occupancy <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rate reached 58.5 per cent. And on it goes. If there is any reason why this particular scheme should be supported and why it should not be affected by any of the government's cost cutting measures and should be extended to the tourism industry, I think those statistics point to it straightaway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did indicate that we will take the opportunity during the consideration in detail stage to move an amendment to extend the scheme fully to tourism operators&mdash;a commitment which was given by the coalition during the recent election campaign. The amendment has the effect of removing the provision from the bill that allows tourism providers to claim only 25 per cent of eligible expenditure rather than 50 per cent. The amendment that I will be proposing in the consideration in detail stage has been circulated in the chamber tonight so that honourable members will have a chance to look at it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want again to reinforce the point that in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Destination Australia</EMPHASIS> document, the coalition policy on tourism, which was prepared and spoken to by Senator Warwick Parer, the then shadow spokesman on tourism, dated 13 March 1996 at pages 11 and 12, there is no clearer statement of the then coalition opposition's support for the EMDG scheme and its extension, particularly to tourism. There it was for all to see in black and white. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition will end Labor's deliberate discrimination against the tourism industry and its operators under the Export Market Development Grants Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition will end Labor's discrimination by removing the provision that discounts applications of tourism operators to give them equity with all other EMDG applicants from all other industries.</PARA>
<PARA>It can be no clearer than that. Here it is in black and white. The Prime Minister trades much on his integrity, and this government trades much on its integrity, in wanting to adhere to all the election promises. The Prime Minister has said that he would much rather commit and keep election promises than fight the deficit. Well, here is an opportunity for him to prove it and here is an opportunity for members on the other side, such as our <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2613"> colleague the honourable member for La Trobe, to come and do what he said he wanted&mdash;to see this extended to the tourism industry because of the benefit that would come to his own electorate. He can do that in the consideration in detail stage, because he can support all of the amendments I will be moving at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that time is fast running out this evening to deal with this matter, but I am indicating that I will continue my remarks when we come back to this particular bill. I want to say one or two other things. My colleague the member for Perth very adequately I thought went to the rationale for the export markets development grants scheme and why it needed to be kept. What he also did was quote a number of representatives from broad industry that had expressed their concern about stories appearing in the media about what might happen to that particular program. It is not surprising that, when it comes to the actual tourism side of this, those sorts of reservations have been expressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to a speech I gave in this place on 7 May 1996 where I quoted a number of those peak tourism organisations and what they had to say about extending this particular grants scheme to tourism. They all believed what the coalition, then in opposition, had to say. For example, a press release from the Tourism Council of Australia headed `EMDG Scheme must stay&mdash;Tourism industry' dated 19 April stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Managing director of Australia's peak tourism body, Tourism Council of Australia, Bruce Baird today expressed grave concern about reports the Federal Government was planning to scrap the Export Market Development Grants (EMDG) Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Reports in today's press that the EMDG scheme may be abolished are of great concern to the tourism industry nationally,' Mr Baird said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition gave a commitment to the industry that all operators would be eligible to receive the full grant of 50 per cent rebates under the scheme. . . '</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The EMDG scheme greatly assists small to medium tourism operators in Australia to compete internationally.  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>Bruce Baird is the representative of one of the major peak tourism organisations in this country. He has been travelling the length and breadth of Australia speaking about this issue. He has been down here. He has spoken to his former colleagues in the Liberal Party down here. I do not think they are formerly colleagues; they may even offer him the presidency of the New South Wales branch. I am not sure what he is going to do about that. In any case, he is using his influence to go and chat to these people, particularly the minister, to see whether or not his minister is prepared to listen to what he has to say&mdash;in fact, adhere to his own party's policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Baird knows why this particular program is so important for the tourism industry. It goes to what my colleague the member for Perth said also. He also knows that the coalition, when in opposition, made a promise, gave an ironclad guarantee on the tourism industry. There is no point people in this chamber shaking their heads and saying, `Well, that was when we were in opposition. Now we are in government it is all getting a bit hard. The tourism industry is important, but it is all a bit hard now that we've got financial control of this nation.' We will come back to this when the debate on this bill resumes tomorrow. I will make another couple of comments about some other people who want to see this grants scheme apply to the tourism industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A petition was tabled in the House today, not on its face a very remarkable petition&mdash;it was a small petition about gun control with 60 signatures. But it is a petition with a very fine story behind it, which I would like to draw to the attention of the House. The petition was organised by a grade 4 student at Holy Trinity School in Curtin, in my electorate. The student, Niamh Dobson, is nine years old.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2614">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A letter from the school drew to my attention that this petition was coming. Niamh Dobson wrote to me asking me if I would present the petition. In her letter she said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will you please present this petition regarding gun control laws to Parliament as soon as possible. When our teacher explained about gun control laws after the terrible shooting in Tasmania I decided to have a petition in our school.</PARA>
<PARA>I was, of course, struck by that letter. Who could have received it and not been struck by it? It is a remarkable story.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I therefore got my office to get in contact with the class teacher. She told me that they had a class discussion during a religion lesson about how hard it is sometimes to deal with injustices in the community, and how an individual acting alone can find social change difficult but how working together people can make a difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was a generalised discussion, not specifically related to the issue of gun control. But the teacher tells me that after the class Niamh asked how people working together could do something to achieve stronger gun laws. The teacher, being a responsible citizen, tried to put a series of options, saying that there are various things one can do. She mentioned the option of petitioning the parliament, how citizens can express their points of view collectively to the parliament through a petition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Possibly to the teacher's very pleasant surprise, this was not the end of the matter. It was not then forgotten. Niamh decided that this was the method she would use. A delegation from the class approached the principal and obtained the principal's approval to persist with this idea, to develop it further and to petition the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal suggested, probably quite appropriately, that it might not be appropriate for all the children to sign, as some may not fully understand the implications of what they were signing. So they put an advertisement in the school newsletter and sought and received the support of many of the parents. Therefore, we have the petition which was tabled today, a petition from citizens in my electorate and in the ACT generally, with 60 signatures.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The teacher advised me that young Niamh Dobson saw this project through from beginning to end virtually on her own: from the original discussion which sparked her thought, to the delegation to the principal, to the advertisement in the school newsletter, to the collection of the signatures and to the letter to me, which led ultimately to its presentation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The teacher also said to my staff that we should keep this young student's name in mind&mdash;with that record of organisation, we might see her in this place one day. Given that she is about 40 years younger than me and she lives in my electorate, I am not too worried about that. It will be quite a long time before she is likely to be a serious threat to my personal circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This says some very good things not just about this young woman&mdash;about whom it says admirable things&mdash;but about our society: that from such a small but important discussion, positive action can flow, and that in our democracy the opportunity does exist for people, when they get an idea, to give it effective representation here in the highest forum of the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am delighted to have the opportunity on behalf of everybody in the House&mdash;and I appreciate the positive responses of members opposite to this initiative&mdash;to say to Niamh Dobson, to the teachers who helped her and to everybody at Holy Trinity School in Curtin how impressed we are with the initiative and how pleased we are with the actions she has taken and that she has been able to see it through to its successful fulfilment today.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

It is a sad indictment of its military masters that a country nominated as one of the most resource rich in the South&hyphen;East Asian region should be classified as one of the poorest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Historically, the majority of Burmese people are deeply religious and follow the path taught by Buddhism, a code of passive coexistence. However, it is this very passiveness that has opened the way for and fuelled the greed and ruthlessness of its present rulers&mdash;the greed to encourage foreign investment at any cost to the environment and even the inhumane use of slave labour to provide the infrastructure for the development by multinational companies of projects, projects that have spawned many freshly minted millionaires in the ruling party and among their friends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in my opening remarks, the situation is deteriorating and the repression of the ordinary citizens and the continuing harassment of the members of the National League of Democracy and its leader are escalating. I do not need to remind members of the courage displayed by that brave, petite symbol of Burmese democracy and her legitimate defiance of the military rulers. We should heed her message when she says that the policy of constructive engagement by some of the region's governments is doomed to failure. We should also note her plea to foreign companies to curtail investment in Burma on the grounds that no substantial <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> growth can be expected until democratic reforms are effected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can growth be achieved when the very fabric of Burmese society is being torn apart by the greed of the present rulers and their subjugation of its people's minds and pockets? As a Burmese friend said, `Foreign investment in my country is as oil on water. It floats on the surface but never filters down to the bottom.' It is a pity that our former Prime Minister, in undertaking his brief flirtation with the military rulers, did not seek to look below the oil. I shall close with a quote from a recent interview by Aung San Suu Kyi with an Australian journalist:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have always appreciated any support from Australia. Australia needs to be involved because it is really part of the Asian Region now and one of the strong democracies in Asia.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, members of the House: the people of Burma deserve better. They need our support in their quest for a peaceful future with a democratic government.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<ELECTORATE> (Werriwa)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.39 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to ask: why has the south&hyphen;west of Sydney been identified for the harshest budget cuts under this government? Why is it that the south&hyphen;west of Sydney is receiving the sharpest end of the scalpel of the member for Macarthur, the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey)? It is ironic indeed, because the Minister for Finance has just been elected to this place as the member for Macarthur, but now he is fouling his own nest by placing the harshest budget cuts in his own backyard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also ironic because the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) made special mention of Campbelltown in my electorate throughout the course of the election campaign. In his second television debate with Mr Keating, he said, `I will ensure that hope is offered to young people in Campbelltown that are without a job.' Of course, there is no hope when the budget is likely to cut back so harshly on labour market and employment programs. This government is engaging in an exercise of misguided budget cuts to the tune of $10 billion&mdash;$2 billion promised during the election campaign and $8 billion promised since&mdash;as it seeks an alibi to resurrect <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2616"> Fightback. My electorate will feel the harshest consequences of these misguided policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On average, each electorate in Australia should suffer $67 million in cuts. That is, for the electorates of Werriwa and Macarthur in the south&hyphen;west of Sydney, one would reasonably expect, on the national average, cuts approximating $134 million. But the cuts are far higher than that. In fact, those two electorates are suffering cuts&mdash;even before the budget&mdash;to the tune of half a billion dollars. Why is it that the member for Macarthur is cutting hardest in his own backyard? Why is he slashing programs, hurting the people who, just three months ago, elected him to the House of Representatives?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at the cuts. Four hundred and eighty million dollars has been withdrawn from the orbital road project&mdash;a great initiative of the former government to bypass Sydney with heavy traffic, running from the Crossroads to Hornsby. That project would have induced $1.2 billion of economic benefits for western and south&hyphen;western Sydney. Because of this government's mismanagement of the second Sydney airport issue in the Greater West and the crazy option of Holsworthy, that $480 million of road funding has now been withdrawn, and that hurts the economic prospects of south&hyphen;west Sydney, including Campbelltown and Liverpool in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further cuts of $20 million have been made to the better cities program. The member for Macarthur is withdrawing public housing redevelopment funding from his own electorate for the suburbs of Ambarvale and Rosemeadow. It is also being withdrawn for crucial housing redevelopment projects throughout the public housing estates in the seat of Werriwa. Further cuts by the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, the member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith)&mdash;who is at the table&mdash;were announced to an Institute of Municipal Management conference. It was indicated that real funding would not be increased for 1996&hyphen;97, producing a four per cent real cut in funding which will hurt social and municipal programs of the Liverpool and Campbelltown councils.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further employment programs are being cut. The Macarthur Skillshare had its funding cut by 33 per cent. There is the abolition of future funding for new work opportunities program and massive cuts to the case management of long&hyphen;term unemployed people in Campbelltown and Liverpool. There are estimated labour market cuts already&mdash;this is before the budget&mdash;of $5 million. So much for offering hope for young unemployed people in the south&hyphen;west of Sydney! They are the people who will suffer most out of this government's budget cuts to labour market programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It goes on: cuts to the University of Western Sydney, Macarthur. A 12 per cent cut in funding would lop $7 million per annum off the funding of that university, dashing the hopes and aspirations of young people who look to that institution for a decent opportunity&mdash;a decent tertiary education&mdash;in life. It will deny a generation of young people their only chance at higher education in the south&hyphen;west of Sydney. Of course, on top of that additional cuts will be made through the New South Wales budget and there will be higher taxes as a product of the mishandling of the recent Premiers Conference by the Treasurer (Mr Costello).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in total, we have budget cuts for Macarthur and Werriwa of $515 million before the budget. We are getting our dose even before budget night, and it is well above the national average. Of course, the member for Macarthur is breaking a whole host of election promises in the process. He should not foul his own nest. He should not cut hardest in his own backyard. He should give our area the best possible consideration in the budget instead of making sure that we are getting the worst possible treatment in any part of the nation.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(10.44 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I rise to talk about the 1st Military Hospital at Yeronga, in my electorate. The present federal government is proceeding with the plans first laid out by the previous government&mdash;as a result of rationalisation of medical facilities within the ADF&mdash;to close and dispose of the 1st Military Hospital at Yeronga. The military hospital at <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2617"> Yeronga was established during the Second World War on the grounds of the Victorian villa `Rhyndarra'. The house and the grounds are included, in fact, in the Register of the National Estate and listed by the Queensland Heritage Council and the National Trust of Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has just announced the second stage of the planning study to ensure the site is sold to give the optimum return to the Commonwealth and the community. It is on something like this, which both sides of this place do agree, but what is particularly good is this announcement has finally ended many years of uncertainty about what is going to happen to the site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party government preceding this government had failed to consult with people in the local area. My predecessor in this place had perpetuated the problem in the local area and people did not know what was actually going to happen. As you would appreciate, Mr Speaker, the army has been an especially good neighbour to the people who surround this particular 12&hyphen;acre site, and they have been gravely concerned as to what will occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the interest of the House, I would like to run through a bit more of the history of the villa Rhyndarra. It was constructed in 1889 by a Brisbane businessman, William Williams, and was designed by an architect called Andreo Stombuco. The building provided horse stables and so forth which were constructed in association with the house. When Rhyndarra was constructed, Williams owned some 140 acres of land at Yeronga&mdash;a tremendous part of Brisbane&mdash;which were surrounded on three sides by the Brisbane River. At this time the suburb of Yeronga was a mixture of large farming estates and smaller subdivisions for housing. Rhyndarra was typical of the large and pretentious houses constructed by many members of Brisbane's upper middle classes in the late 19th century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ten years after the construction of this National Trust listed house, Williams relinquished the property and moved to Western Australia, where he died in the early 20th century. The place remained unoccupied until the AMP Society as the mortgagor organised the sale of the estate. The estate was divided <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> into a number of sites, with Rhyndarra and an area of 12 acres later being bought by William Booth and the Salvation Army. The Salvation Army operated a home on the site for orphaned and other young girls from Rhyndarra. The stables were converted for use as a schoolroom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rhyndarra was later adapted to accommodate a large number of young women who were resident in the institution. In the early 1930s there were more than 60 girls in the home, ranging in age from babies to early teenagers. The Salvation Army ran the home until the 1940s, when the army took over the site as part of the wartime mobilisation. The Allied Works Council, responsible for the coordination of the building infrastructure associated with the war effort, converted the place into a women's hospital. In 1946 the Rhyndarra site was purchased by the Commonwealth and was used for the recuperation of servicewomen and for medical check&hyphen;ups before they were demobbed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Initially after the war it was allocated to the Department of Social Services as a civilian rehabilitation centre, with Immigration and Health departments also interested in the site. In the 1950s, the facility had buildings which could be cheaply and easily adapted to accommodate national service recruits and trainees and in 1951 became known as the National Service Training Hospital. In the 1960s it was known as 1 Camp Hospital. More recently, as 1 Military Hospital it has provided a minor medical facility for soldiers who are injured or fall sick as a result of training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now the site is going to change hands yet again and the next stage of the disposal process, which is about to commence, will address the site's heritage value more closely, addressing such issues as the significance of the World War II elements, the social importance of the facility within the community, conservation and landscape matters, and recommendations on conservation and possible future uses for the site. I am delighted the minister has recognised that, like me, many locals are concerned about what does happen to this site. He has gladly agreed to community consultation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2618">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My only concern is that a lot of what will eventually happen there rests with the Brisbane City Council as the planning authority. I certainly hope the Brisbane City Council does not go down the ideological path of high density housing on the site, which is something the local residents do not want. The Brisbane City Council may be very tempted to go down this path, given their particular bent in other areas of my electorate. High density housing would be a disaster for the local residents, who have enjoyed the army as good neighbours for so many years. It would not be in keeping with the prestige and history of Rhyndarra as a heritage building; in fact, it would detract greatly from its value as a heritage site. I for one will be working very hard with the minister to make sure locals get their way on the future of the Rhyndarra property.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One thing I will say about this Howard government is that by coming up with a new, more objectionable policy with each passing day it makes it increasingly difficult to find enough rage now to cover all the offensive proposals it has made in previous weeks. The case in point is the 12 per cent cut that waits in the wings for the higher education sector. After the uproar following Senator Vanstone's slip&mdash;she thought a 12 per cent cut would do for starters&mdash;the issue seems to have gone off the boil. That is not to say that Australians have resigned themselves to the cuts; it is more that we have had our attention now grabbed by a number of the government's other almost equally reprehensible policies and proposals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to place the issue back on the boil and, in particular, to point out to the House what cuts of that magnitude would do to the university in my area, the University of Western Sydney. As a person who has served my area of western Sydney since 1971 at all levels of government, I have watched the University of Western Sydney grow from being merely a glint in the eye of the Hawke government to the internationally acclaimed institution that it has now become.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me acquaint the House of the University of Western Sydney's importance for the rest of western Sydney, via a few facts and figures. The University of Western Sydney is the region's second biggest employer, and one of the main users of local businesses and industry. As such, it contributes greatly to local economic and social growth. In its first six years it produced 25,000 graduates&mdash;a trained work force for Sydney's west.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The University of Western Sydney serves 40 per cent of Sydney's population and nearly 10 per cent of Australia's population. Because of the size of the population it serves, the University of Western Sydney can only offer students in the west eight places per 1,000 inhabitants, whereas the rest of Sydney can offer 32 places per 1,000 people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some 58 per cent of University of Western Sydney students are the first in their family ever to attend university. At 7,393 students, it has the largest number of undergraduates new to higher education than any other university in Australia. More than 25 per cent of University of Western Sydney students come from non-English speaking backgrounds. More than 55 per cent of its students are women. Of the University of Western Sydney's 23,000 students, 65 per cent live in the Greater Western Sydney region and 50 per cent of all students find work in the area upon graduation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any cuts, whether they be five per cent, 10 per cent or 12 per cent, will cut deep into the heart of the educational services which the university now offers to the people of western Sydney. It will not only rob the rest of university places, which are already as scarce as hen's teeth compared to the rest of Sydney, but also impact disastrously on jobs and the economy which surrounds the university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the second largest employer, possibly now even the largest, in western Sydney, I think a 12 per cent cut in the University of Western Sydney's funding would be like stabbing the economic heart of the region itself. A 12 per cent cut in the University of Western Sydney's Commonwealth funding would translate to a loss of $24 million, or 2,000 students.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2619">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will not accept such a vindictive attack on the families and children of ordinary working class Australians. If we are to maintain people's dignity, if we are to preserve the undeniable right of the people of western Sydney to obtain higher levels of education, we cannot and will not accept such an attack.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Greater Western Sydney traditionally has been a region underresourced in higher education&mdash;a situation which has not been completely corrected. Yet we have come so far. Why is the government intent on slapping down the achievements and the work of so many people from western Sydney? Why is it determined to frustrate the dreams of so many young people in my area who, after such cuts, will no longer be able to gain a university place and, as such, will have their career expectations thwarted?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a perfect world, education would be completely free. We all know that, but we all know that that is not possible. Yet education need not be wrenched from the grasp of people who traditionally cannot afford university fees and charges. We need not return to the days when higher education was a privilege of the rich. Or is that the government's true desire? It seems as though it might be, because that is where its ideology of cuts to higher education is leading it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cuts of 12 per cent will severely retard the growth of the University of Western Sydney, and a similar flow&hyphen;on effect will be felt throughout the entire western Sydney region. I strongly advise the new member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly), the new member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron), who is in the House tonight, the new member for Macquarie (Mr Bartlett), and even the new member for Macarthur (Mr Fahey), the Minister for Finance, to think again. I advise them to think of the needs of the people they now serve and to go into bat for the University of Western Sydney. At the very least, they should think how, three years from now, they could live to regret their lack of action today.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak on the urgent need for a 40&hyphen;bed nursing home in the city of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Armadale in my electorate of Canning. I raised this issue in my first speech when I came here. I stated then that appropriate facilities for the elderly in my electorate are acutely scarce and I identified the need for more nursing home beds as well as alternative accommodation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no secret that Australia has an ageing population. In fact, Western Australia's number of seniors as a proportion of the population is expected to grow to more than 22 per cent in the year 2021. This figure was only 14 per cent in 1991. This will see the number of persons aged 65 and over increasing from just under 160,000 to 460,000 persons. This is a major challenge for both the state and federal governments. We need to have plans in place to ensure that health and aged care provision are dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Western Australian state government has estimated that the state may require an additional 39,400 nursing beds by the year 2026. With respect to my electorate of Canning, and in particular the city of Armadale, there has been a dire need for many years to build a nursing home in that area. Figures show that currently 25 per cent of persons residing in the south&hyphen;east corridor of the Perth metropolitan area&mdash;of which Armadale comprises a major area&mdash;are over the age of 60 years, and this figure is growing steadily. A projected figure indicates that a 31 per cent increase in the number of aged persons living within the Armadale area over the next 10 years can be expected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dale Cottages, a non-profit organisation dedicated to caring for the aged, have been pushing for a new nursing home since 1990. Dale Cottages management has predicted that 30 additional jobs will be created by building this new nursing home, with obvious ongoing economic and social spin-offs for local industry. Dale Cottages already have the land set aside with all the necessary infrastructure, such as sewerage and power, and preliminary plans for a possible new nursing home have also already been made by them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A planning seminar examining future trends in relation to an ageing population in the city of Armadale found that, notwithstanding the trend for seniors to remain in their own <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2620"> homes for longer, Armadale was in urgent need of a nursing home. This planning seminar indicated that it would press for funds from the federal government and press government to change its policy on bed allocations per head of population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since becoming the member for Canning in March this year, I have been lobbied intensely by a wide variety of individuals and interested parties on the need for a nursing home in this area. I believe that this need is extreme and urgent, and I will do my utmost as the people's representative for Canning to ensure that this need is met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Council of Australian Governments met in Canberra earlier this month, it agreed that there is an urgent need to shift the focus of health and community services from programs to people through a partnership between the Commonwealth and states. I hope that, as the responsibility for aged care services is devolved to the states, I will continue to play an active and constructive role regarding this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe Dale Cottages to be uniquely placed. As I have already mentioned, they have the land and the infrastructure, and preliminary planning is already in place. They are also willing to help with funding, if possible. They have demonstrated that they are also willing to do something for the aged in the city of Armadale. I hope the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) and her department look favourably on the need for a nursing home in the city of Armadale during their budget deliberations.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this week of national action about skillshare, I wish to place on record my support for the program. There is no clearer evidence of the total policy disarray of this government than the savage treatment that has been handed out to skillshare projects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must remember that skillshare is acknowledged to be a cost effective program that gets results. In the past the effectiveness and success of this program has been acknowledged, almost on a bipartisan basis. One only has to look back to Fightback, the most <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pernicious manifesto ever put before an Australian electorate, for evidence of this. Fightback praised skillshare:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Skillshare type training programs, which encourage strong community based/non-government sector involvement will form a key part of the coalition's approach to training.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a quote from Fightback.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Skillshare Association has stated that it was assured by the coalition before the election that skillshare was not going to be cut. Following the election, the effectiveness of skillshare was acknowledged by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now skillshares are having to deal with a savage unilateral cut of one-third in their funding. Despite the most recent announcements on funding of last week that indicate it is only a 20 per cent cut, it must be remembered that the additional funds that were found last week are not for the skillshare program but for job clubs to be conducted by skillshares. This one-third funding cut is an appalling decision. It combines the worst elements of bad policy and bad process, and exposes the government's total lack of understanding of the community's needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians did not vote for this. There is no mandate for this. There is no need for it. The people this decision hurts the most are the unemployed&mdash;those least able to defend themselves. It is so easy to work out who the winners and losers are under a coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The authors of this decision have clearly never attended a skillshare graduation cere&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2621"> mony. Three skillshares that operate in my electorate&mdash;Mature Action, Skillseekers and Employment 2000 Plenty Valley&mdash;have a longstanding record for providing effective and efficient services.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lists of all grants made by the Department from 1 July 1993&hyphen;30 June 1995 have been maintained, and a copy of this information has been provided to the honourable member. Information relating to grants made by the department in 1995&hyphen;96 will not be available until after the end of the financial year. This information partially answers part (A) and answers all of parts (B), (C) and (D) of question (1) as it applies to the Department. To assemble the remaining Departmental information for the purpose of answering the question would be a major diversion of resources which I am not prepared, at this time, to authorise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission does not have the information requested in a readily accessible form. The ATSIC Annual Reports for 1993&hyphen;94 and 1994&hyphen;95 do, however, provide Appendices which aggregate the grant payments by programme component. A copy of these Appendices has been provided to the honourable member. To collect and assemble the information requested in respect of ATSIC solely for the purpose of answering the honourable member's question would be a major task and I am not prepared to authorise the expenditure and diversion of resources that would be involved.</PARA>
