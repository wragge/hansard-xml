<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LL6">Mr BOB BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to a very serious allegation made before this House last night by the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), I wish to respond as follows. In early July 1996 I was contacted by Mr John Harman regarding a problem concerning his daughter Danielle Harman, her ex-de facto, Mr Darren Barrett, and the Williamtown RAAF base, and requested that I assist to resolve this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Harman is an associate of mine who at one stage worked on my campaign when I contested the seat of Dobell in the 1993 federal election. In accordance with the accepted procedure in my office, I passed this matter to one of my electorate officers, Mr Tony McCormack, to follow up. I was particularly concerned to do so as I did not wish to be personally involved because of my association with Mr Harman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tony McCormack then contacted Mr Harman to obtain Danielle's phone number. As a result of his discussions with Danielle, he discovered the following allegations. Danielle has actually been living in fear of her life. Her relationship of 10 years with Darren Barrett, which included her son, Joshua, aged four, concluded on 13 February 1996 when Danielle and her son were forced to leave him. Her reason for leaving followed months of occasional assault, including being pushed down a flight of stairs and being dragged around by the hair, in addition to repeated exposure to events of emotional abuse and intimidation and refusal to be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provided with money for simple housekeeping. Miss Harman also feared that her son possibly may have been assaulted by Mr Barrett at some point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 13 February the mother of Darren Barrett rang Miss Harman to state that her son had threatened to get a gun. Further to this, Joshua told his mother that his father had told him, `He was going to get a gun and shoot her.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The young boy, who suffers from a condition known as hole in the heart, is now receiving counselling. Following this incident, Miss Harman and her son left her husband with belongings in two suitcases and went to the Toukley Women's Refuge on the Central Coast. Their stay lasted between five and six days, after which they moved to Warwick in Queensland to stay with her parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 4 April 1996 at the Warwick courthouse Miss Harman took out a domestic violence order against Mr Barrett. Since the domestic violence order, Mr Barrett has resorted to writing inflammatory letters to his wife and has also undertaken telephone harassment&mdash;actions in breach of the order. On one occasion Mr Barrett called and claimed that he would get the RAAF police on to Miss Harman and her parents. On another occasion&mdash;approximately two weeks ago&mdash;</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LS4">Mr Martin Ferguson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. As I understand it, the member ought to be addressing where he believes he has been wronged. I do not think it is appropriate that he go into the personal circumstances of the people concerned. He ought to be required to address the House with respect to where he believes he has been wronged in the House.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr SPEAKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am listening very carefully to the response of the member for Paterson. The issue debated last night on the adjournment is a very serious one and we are seeking an opportunity to see the other side of the coin. I will allow the honourable member to proceed, taking very careful cognisance of the well-established precedents of this House.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LL6">Mr BOB BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker. On another occasion&mdash;approximately <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> two weeks ago&mdash;he rang four times between 1 a.m. and 1.45 a.m. in a drunken state, making  threatening remarks. Speaking to John Harman, he said that he was going to take the events of the whole matter to Bob Brown, the federal member for Charlton.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the underlying problem which started this whole matter is that on repeated occasions Miss Harman tried to contact the Williamtown RAAF base to see what her rights were to gain access to furniture and remaining belongings and transportation of such on the base. Miss Harman's calls were not returned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 16 July 1996, while visiting the Williamtown RAAF base with Mr McCormack regarding another matter involving the RAAF base, I knew that Mr McCormack would discuss Danielle's case and management of it with Group Captain John Riches, who is the commanding officer of Mr Barrett's unit. I made it clear to both Group Captain Riches and Tony McCormack that I would not be involved in this matter&mdash;</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7T4">Mrs Crosio</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On a point of order, Mr Speaker: I was in the House when that statutory declaration was read out last night. I believe that a precedent has been established here and the honourable member is going well past saying where he believes he has been personally affected. While the seriousness of the case is not being denied, I believe you should pull him to order. His explanation here should be where he feels the honourable member for Charlton has in some way misnamed him.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LL6">Mr BOB BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I knew that Mr McCormack would be discussing the case with Group Captain John Riches, who is the commanding officer of Mr Barrett's unit. I made it clear to both Group Captain Riches and Tony McCormack that I would not be involved in this matter because of my personal association with John Harman. Following discussions with John Riches and Tony McCormack, I was led to believe that this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3524"> situation was being resolved. So it was with utter shock that I learned that in this House at 7.37 p.m. on 21 August 1996 the member for Charlton made allegations that I was personally involved in threatening Darren Barrett and using my position as a federal member.</PARA></TALK.START>

I indicated that I was making no personal judgment about the claims in that statutory declaration.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The preservation of our history has become an increasingly complex and important issue over the last two decades. I would like to put on the record of this House, with all the cuts now being undertaken by this dreadful, disastrous budget, that I compliment and congratulate the Friends of the Fairfield Heritage Centre, which was previously called the Fairfield Museum, who have worked very hard to turn that new museum into a reality. And it has been worth it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our history, which is now contained within the walls of this wonderful building, has become a tool by which our community has increased its knowledge of our past. Our schools are now visiting regularly. Our arts and community groups are using the exhibition spaces and the facilities, which I believe would not have been possible without the $100,000 grant of a former minister for sport and recreation, Hon. Ros Kelly, and the federal government, the assistance of Fairfield Council and the excellent work that the Friends did in raising money to meet their part of the obligation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to put on the record in this House our congratulations to the staff and to those Friends, who are all volunteers, for a job well done. This museum stands proudly now as a reminder of what can be achieved in a community by hard work and determination and, most particularly, a federal government that has heart&mdash;which this government now has not.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On budget night, as part of my duty to my constituents, I sent an e&hyphen;mail message to all 7,500 students at Townsville's James Cook University.

The recent announcement of Kodak's plans to expand its Coburg plant is a vindication of the faith the federal Labor government showed in Kodak in 1989 when it faced major difficulties and possible closure. The Labor government was prepared to intervene to provide a subsidy to help overcome the company's problems, protect the jobs of its workers and ensure its future operations.

<TIME.STAMP>(9.45 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance is with the Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard. He promised Tasmania that he would provide assistance under a Tasmanian package to the tourist industry, especially in assisting us to attract more tourists to Tasmania. This was also in response to the terrible tragedy at Port Arthur and all the tourism businesses that were <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3526"> suffering in Tasmania because of the impact of those events. He promised that $49 million would be made available over three years to assist potential tourists to travel to Tasmania on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Spirit of Tasmania</EMPHASIS> . This was announced in June. As yet, not one cent has been spent in Tasmania. Although the number of visitors to Port Arthur is recovering, it will take years before the businesses themselves will be able to boast a healthy result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The $33 million that was offered belatedly in the budget, which is over four years and not over three, will barely cover the cost of subsidising a year of existing car travel on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Spirit</EMPHASIS>, let alone encourage additional people to travel to Tasmania and to assist our tourist industry, especially seeing that the ship lost $50 million last year. In fact, I believe this will probably work against an increase in the number of visitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The TT Line offered 500 free holidays if people paid a minimum of $100 to the Port Arthur appeal earlier this year. This offer was taken up within two hours of announcement. It was a nice offer, and was appreciated by those at Port Arthur, but it was only 500 visitors, and that barely filled half a ship. Many people postponed their trip because the subsidy had been announced by the Prime Minister. When they heard that all the tickets had been taken up, they decided not to come to Tasmania after all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This may well work in the same way for the Bass Strait passenger vehicle equalisation scheme. If there is not a subsidy for everyone, only the ones who get assistance will travel and others will stay on the mainland. Besides, the cost of return travel for a family of two parents and two children would average $1,230. A subsidy of $300 would not really make that much difference to people deciding whether or not to come to Tasmania. It is more likely to mean they would have to decide whether to fly and hire a car, or come by boat. How is this going to help to increase tourist traffic to Tasmania?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the figures more closely. Last year's TT Line figures showed that 70,000 cars travelled on the ship. If you divide the first year take&hyphen;up allocation, which we are told is $7.5 million, into the actual per car <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> subsidy, you get 50,000 cars. So if they keep the unlikely promise that they are not going to cap the funds, the whole $33 million will be taken up in less than three years. That is only subsidising existing passenger numbers. What about the new people who want to come to Tasmania and whom this subsidy is supposed to attract? If there is more advertising by the state department of tourism, which they have now started to do, there may be an increase in tourist numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the Prime Minister: come on, Mr Howard, you have got to really think this out and give us an opportunity to achieve something from this promise that you made. I believe it would be better to spend $44 million, which was the previous Labor government's promise, on getting an additional ship, a Seacat, for Tasmania. Fares could then be reduced to around $50 to $80 return and I am sure the numbers of people travelling would increase. Also, it would be a quicker trip&mdash;four hours instead of overnight. The ship could turn around and bring more people per day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was very interesting to note on a recent study tour that everywhere I went that had a harbour I saw a Seacat&mdash;Seacats made in Tasmania. The ironic thing is that we do not have one in Tasmania. The previous government promised $44 million to the state government to have a Seacat link with the state. It is a shame that we do not have a flagship made in Tasmania operating from Tasmania; our flagship is not seen on the shores of Tasmania. It is a shame that we do not have one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tourism in Tasmania has suffered greatly. It is down by over 40 per cent all over the state. Some of our leading hotels are down 20 per cent on their bed occupancy rates. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Spirit</EMPHASIS> was sometimes sailing with as few as 200 people on board and the average is around 600 per sailing&mdash;half capacity in the slightly better sailing times. It is not just because of the Port Arthur tragedy, although this has not helped, of course; it is the fact that the state has not had any destination marketing campaigns for four years under state Liberal governments. The previous state Liberal government did not have a clue and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3527"> the current one is struggling to make some changes, to put money into this destination advertising. But it is too late, unless there is a massive kick&hyphen;start, which we thought might occur because of this promise by both major parties at the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was hopeful that when the Prime Minister made the commitment to help the state after the tragedy, politics was not going to enter into it; there were going to be compassion and a desire to assist. Political memories are short, and I was obviously too optimistic. It has been a cynical exercise to promise help and then defer it until most of those who could have been assisted have gone to the wall. Tasmania is very vulnerable to disaster, particularly when our winter approaches. Our population is small and scattered. Tourism businesses have to rely on visitors to the island to make an impact on their turnover. When the visitors do not come for whatever reason it is a disaster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Maybe the TT line will have to look at a stand-by fare or no frills fare to try to encourage people to travel. Bums on seats is what it is all about. We need them desperately. The management opposed a proposal made by the National Sea Highway Committee to offer stay-up places for between $40 and $50 per person during the winter months. They said that `to make travel across Bass Strait as cheap as bus travel was unrealistic.' Mr Simmons, the Chief Executive at the time, said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury </EMPHASIS>of 30 May that the capital cost for buses to carry the same number of passengers would be $10 million but the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Spirit of Tasmania</EMPHASIS> cost is $150 million. He went on to say that the total staffing for the fleet of buses would be 20, but they had to have a minimum of 84, four times the labour cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think the National Sea Highway Committee was proposing that all passengers pay the lower fares; I believe they were keen to fill up the empty seats and give some incentive for the ones that were not being used during the winter months. It was an idea that needed more investigation than it got. It would mean that people may be restricted to certain areas on the ship, receive a lesser service or pay their own way for food, et <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cetera. It would mean that people could cater for themselves and that those who do not mind sitting up could have done so, just like in the old days in the old Empress and Princess of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People have been hard hit this year, and now the government has offered them this horror budget. I quote the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS>'s headline yesterday, `Costello's bitter pill.' It is a bitter pill. It is so bitter that I hope Tasmanians spit it out, and very soon. Let us hope that at least they look at the finances of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Spirit</EMPHASIS> and say: `Yes, we need another ship. Yes, the federal government will help Tasmania achieve a healthier tourist industry.' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the past month the constant media chatter about the budget has obscured some good news for those who wish to see Australia's indigenous people attain a full share in our nation's future. If the commonly held maxim is true that an education is the key to one's future, then the initiatives announced recently by the coalition government will indeed be welcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government involves compromise and choice. In addition to abetting the wealth of a nation and its individuals, governments must by nature also redistribute it. To expend money on one group within our society might mean taking from another. Though money is never an answer in itself, when spent wisely it can certainly help. No-one would argue that some groups are in greater need of education assistance than others. Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders are certainly in that category. For nearly 200 years following James Cook's arrival in Botany Bay, Australia's indigenous people were regarded, to put it kindly, as second-class citizens. Only in the last 30 years has there really been an increased awareness of and a sense of national shame at the atrocious treatment they received. While many aspects of this treatment could be categorised as neglect, that has not been the case with education, where neglect might have been a preferable option to some of the past curricula on offer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3528"> As far back as the 1830s there were government schools open in coastal areas specifical ly for the purpose of educating the nation's indigenous young. The times were different and so were the motives. I am sure there was little mention of Aboriginal culture as the teachers, many of whom were British clerics, attempted with fire and brimstone to impart their vision of the world as it stood and the benefits of assimilation. Their methods caused great anguish in the native communities, though there were those who learned that an education proved no ramrod through the barrier of racism. After a period of about 20 years, the declining Aboriginal population meant a decline in the need for these schools. I suspect there was little need ever expressed by the indigenous community. That these schools ever existed was a product of the paternalistic nature of the European settlers. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The schooling experience of our indigenous people on the missions and reserves was scarcely a step forward. This practice began in the middle of the last century and prevailed until the middle of this century. While methods varied from place to place, the tone was just as paternalistic. There was little understanding or attempt to understand the culture of the students. The values of the white man were pushed: reading, `ritin' and `rithmetic', with a very large dose of Christianity thrown in for good measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the population of full-blooded Aborigines dwindled, the assimilation campaign stepped up. Many children were stolen from their families in an attempt to teach them the ways of the West. Various psychologists did the Aboriginal education cause no favours at all with their findings that indigenous people were of inferior intellect to the white population. This shameful misdiagnosis resulted in many questioning the work of our native people attempting any real education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has changed since those days. There is a greater and wider appreciation of the importance of indigenous people understanding their own customs, rituals and beliefs. There no longer exists the view that the history of the white man is the only history and it is vital for Aboriginal people to feel a sense of pride in their traditions. Education is no longer imposed; rather it is made available by communities, changing forever some of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> old notions about intellectual capacities. While there is still, unfortunately, some overt racism in the community at large, many of the barriers that kept indigenous people from claiming their full share in Australian society are coming down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) announced that an extra $72 million has been allocated for the tertiary education of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. The major part of this will go to the Aboriginal support funding program, which will provide funding to universities based on their capacity to provide quality outcomes for indigenous students. It is not only the tertiary students who will be catered for. Three&hyphen;quarters of a million dollars will be put forward to a controlled trial to determine the merits of providing open learning to indigenous people in correctional institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In another initiative, nearly $160,000 will be granted to the Tangentyere Council to fund an alternative education program for indigenous people who have dropped out of school. Despite the advances made in indigenous education, poor attendance and early exit from the education system are still a problem. This program will help 12- to 18&hyphen;year-olds who have already left school. Among its aims will be literacy and numeracy, crime and suicide prevention, training and, eventually, jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recently announced higher education budget contains scholarships for indigenous people who will attend Australian tertiary institutions without paying HECS. The recently amended Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1996 will not only preserve funding previously promised, but also will provide an increase until the turn of this century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One aspect that strikes me as ironic is that this program seeks the involvement of parents in the education of their children. A century ago, young indigenous children were being given haircuts forcibly by European settlers over the vehement objections of their parents. Now, parents are being encouraged to have their say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the final report of the Aboriginal education policy task force in 1988, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3529"> Aboriginal people place a higher priority on education, wanting the same opportunities enjoyed by all Australians. They look to education as a means of ending the cycle of welfare dependency and poverty, as a tool to help them earn a decent living and to help them manage the development of their communities. This is quite a turnaround from the days when indigenous parents and children were terrified, and understandably so, by schooling at the hands of the European settlers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To be fair, the Labor Party did attempt to improve the conditions of education amongst our native people, but too much time has already been wasted; too many opportunities have already been missed because the issues have been politicised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all that has been accomplished, however, there is still much to be done. In 1994, a review of measurable education outcomes found a big disparity between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. It is a divergence that begins at an early age and continues through the educative years: 13.2 per cent of five-year&hyphen;old indigenous Australians are not in formal education as compared with 5.9 per cent of non-indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indigenous primary school students with significant literacy or numeracy problems amount to 45 per cent&mdash;nearly three times the percentage of non-indigenous Australians. Twenty&hyphen;five per cent of our indigenous students quit before year 10, while only two per cent of the wider population leave so young. As to the year 12 retention rate, 73 per cent of non-indigenous students remain and only 31 per cent of indigenous students remain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The differences in outcomes continue to be reflected in post-secondary years, where only 16 per cent of non-indigenous students at TAFE are enrolled in basic education or preparatory, non-award courses; the percentage for our non-indigenous people is 43. While 31 per cent of non-indigenous Australians enter universities from year 12, only 22 per cent of our indigenous peoples go on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> As one who is vitally interested in Aboriginal affairs,  I am pleased to see that this government&mdash;in particular, Ministers Vans tone and Kemp&mdash;recognises the need to improve education opportunities and outcomes for indigenous people. They realise that the job ahead will be difficult, but they will meet the challenge head-on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians generally are concerned with social justice and imbued with a sense of it. The term might mean different things to different people, but most would agree that the nation's track record on indigenous education has served to limit opportunities for far too many, and that is not justice. Two passages from a 1989 joint policy statement on national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy catch the eye:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This purpose assumes that Aboriginal people are entitled to no less opportunity than is available for all other Australians, and that they should have the opportunity to achieve at least at the levels of attainment of the Australian population as a whole. The potential exists for much greater than average achievement. The promotion of excellence and the development of exceptional talent are also important policy issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In pursuit of educational equity, the National Policy recognises the diversity that exists in terms of Aboriginal socio-economic circumstances, cultural values and educational  aspirations. These environmental factors have to be taken into account in the design and delivery of educational services and in the assessment of individual and student group performance.</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure there are few honourable members who would disagree with those sentiments. Certainly, indigenous Australians should know that this coalition government has taken good heed and will be doing all it can to improve education opportunity and the benefits that flow from it.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(10.05 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This budget will have a devastating impact on Canberra. One has the impression of a whole series of ministers with strong anti-government prejudices who have made decisions, all of which will damage the wellbeing of the people of Canberra, without being aware that the cumulative impact of what they are doing will be to devastate the whole region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go through some of the policy decisions that have been made because, when <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3530"> they are all faced together, it is quite easy to see that major damage will be caused to the Canberra economy and to Canberra society. The most obvious cut, which goes to the heart of the problem and which symbolises this damage, is the cut of the payment by the Commonwealth government to the ACT government. All state and territory governments in Australia, of course, are being cut by this national government and that is extremely damaging to every part of Australia. But the ACT is a particularly clear example of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Eighteen million dollars is being cut out of the Commonwealth government's general funding grant to the ACT government and, in real per capita terms, that is 7.3 per cent&mdash;a massive reduction in one year. The effect of that, of course, will be to force the ACT government to reduce the extent and quality of health services, of education services, of policing in the town, of care for the environment, of welfare services, of support for the arts&mdash;all the tasks for which the territory and all other state governments are responsible. That will greatly damage the services available to every person in Canberra. That is only one example, though.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another very serious example is that public service employment has been severely cut. It is now quite clear from the budget papers that in this financial year the total cut to the Commonwealth Public Service throughout Australia will be about 10,500. Officials tell me that there will be a reduction of about the same number of positions in the next financial year. So that means that 21,000 positions are now budgeted to be cut out of the Commonwealth Public Service around the country. Before the end of the last financial year, already 1,400 positions had gone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that about a quarter of all Commonwealth public servants work in the ACT. Therefore, 5,600 positions which at present exist here will be cut out of the Commonwealth Public Service. We also know that about 50,000 Commonwealth public servants are at present employed in Canberra. That means that about 12 per cent of those positions will be reduced over the next two years.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a massive reduction. Does it matter? It matters enormously because it means that the services those people provide&mdash;the policy advice they give to government, the collective memory which they offer to governments when they come in&mdash;will no longer be available. That will damage the quality of the Commonwealth Public Service. It will also damage morale within those organisations. Initiative and dynamism will be reduced or undermined in the way it is in private sector organisations when they are downsized. It will cause severe damage to the professionalism and high quality of the Australian Public Service but, as well as that, it will damage the private sector in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are to be cuts not only in the Commonwealth Public Service but also in many of the statutory authorities. Telstra, we know, is going to cut out 9,000 people around Australia, some of whom are in Canberra. We know the ABC is going to be forced to make major reductions; some of those will be in Canberra. We know that the universities have been severely cut, and not only has their general funding been cut but the fees that students pay will be increased and the support they receive will be reduced. So there will be fewer students and fewer academic staff and general staff employed in the three universities in Canberra. The Australian Defence Force Academy, the fourth university, has been protected from those cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as these major cuts to the Public Service, three buildings for which planning was well advanced have been abandoned. That will have the effect of depressing the construction industry even further. We know that there have been major reductions in funding for training programs and work experience programs. Those programs, quite clearly, were of real benefit, particularly to the long&hyphen;term unemployed, because they gave them the hope that they could get back into the work force by preparing them for that adjustment from unemployment to full-time work again. They were effective in many cases in helping those people get back into employment. Those programs have been greatly reduced and the dedicated staff who were working on them are also losing their <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3531"> jobs, so they will be forced into unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as those cuts, there have been other cuts in funding for the arts and the environment. The nursery project at the National Botanic Gardens has been abandoned. Baseline funding for the Australian Sports Commission has been cut by $5 million, despite the promise made by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to support sports training. Improvements to the National Portrait Gallery have been abandoned. The National Capital Planning Authority, which is responsible for national land in the ACT, is having its running costs reduced by a third this year, from just over $9 million to just over $6 million, and more savage cuts have been forecast for next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there are major cuts that will directly damage people in employment in the public sector in the ACT, but as well they will damage their families, the people who are dependent on them. They will damage the organisations within which they work. They will also have a major damaging impact on the business sector in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business people in Canberra can see no benefit in this government. They tell me that their turnover is flatter than they can ever remember. They know that people who are threatened with unemployment have to cut back on their outlays, have to save as much as they can. Now the threat of insecurity is so widespread in the public sector that turnover, purchases and sales have gone down sharply. The private sector is in severe recession in Canberra, and it is not only those parts of it that are involved in retailing that are affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The home building sector is in a state of collapse. The construction industry is deeply depressed. Even the high-tech sector, which was one of the major growth areas in Canberra, is feeling very threatened because of the plans to cut back government spending on high technology activities. So every area of the ACT economy is being deeply damaged by these cuts. This is impossible to portray as anything else but absolutely irresponsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the effect is very severe in Canberra, we are not untypical of other regions of Australia. Similar kinds of cuts are having an <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> impact in many parts of rural and regional Australia. We know that Commonwealth Employment Service offices are being closed, that Family Court offices and tax offices are being closed and that the number of people employed in offices that are going to be kept open will be reduced. All of this has the same kind of direct damaging impact on employment, on business turnover, on house prices and on the quality of service available to people in the regions of Australia in exactly the same way as it does in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One very specific decision which makes no sense at all is the plan to sell the Canberra tax office building in Belconnen. We know that the tax office is planning to reduce the number of staff in Canberra by about 800. The rationale given by the tax commissioner for doing that is he wants to reduce the amount of money he spends on rent, but they are planning to sell one of the only major buildings which they own, which will have the effect of increasing rent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That cannot be seen as, in any sense, a responsible policy. It will have the effect of increasing rental costs, and that will add even further to pressure to reduce costs and it may even contribute to reducing even further the number of staff. It is impossible for one organisation to take 800 people out of an area without there being great damage to the quality of the work of that organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are devastating policies. They can only be seen as the result of a deeply prejudiced government. It is very important that people absorb what has happened and protest loudly about it.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Briefly, in response to the previous speaker: rent can be cheap and it can be expensive. It has always amazed me that people giving basic services, such as the Taxation Office, where only a very small number of their people are in fact required to deal directly with the public, always find themselves in some multi&hyphen;storey building in the most expensive part of Canberra, Perth or Sydney&mdash;you name it. It is about time that, in terms of the buildings that these departments use, they <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3532"> looked even to our regional centres, where they would create good employment growth and where they can use today's extensive and very effective communication systems to communicate anywhere in the country. They can get the rent down, and they can get the buildings on the ground floor&mdash;half of them are only full of computers, anyway. Let us get on with developing regional Australia with some of these services that people believe have to be provided only in capital cities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another aspect of my grievance that I wish to deal with briefly. I have just had the opportunity to look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> in regard to the matter that was raised concerning the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin). I notice that the first 11 lines of that was the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) covering his backside before he delivered this disgraceful issue. He had a simple opportunity to ring the base commander at Williamtown and get the facts straightened out privately before he dragged the private and personal issues related to this family dispute into this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason for my attending in the parliament today is to raise a matter specifically of interest to my electorate, and that, of course, is the devastating circumstances confronting wool growers around Australia. It is devastating, and it is an issue that, in my mind, has been worsened by the activities of those who are charged with administering the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are all well aware that the reserve price scheme collapsed some years ago due to foolish administration, allowing the reserve price to get above certain levels, and the parliament had to intervene at the time to try to find a solution. Its solution was to create what was basically a liquidator by way of a structure called Wool International.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wool International originally, in attempting to dispose of the stockpile, did so by making sales on an ad hoc basis and did so at a price that generally was above the then auction market. This created a huge amount of uncertainty because the industry became very fearful that there might be a panic and a dumping of this stockpile, so everybody started to restrict their buying.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to remind the House of the most significant words I have ever heard spoken on the wool industry, and that was when a large buyer at a meeting that I was attending said that he never worried to the extent that the price of wool escalated, but he was desperately concerned about the price his competitors paid for wool tomorrow. That particular fundamental point is so important in terms of creating and maintaining confidence in the wool industry. There was no confidence because there was a fear as to how the stockpile might be disposed of, and there were articles in the paper suggesting all sorts of options.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government of the time therefore quite properly instituted the Garnaut inquiry. Basically, Garnaut came back with a recommendation that there should be a fixed release schedule of between 180,000 and 190,000 bales a quarter so that the stockpile would be disposed of and there would be certainty in the industry as to the rate of the unloading of this stockpile onto the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That worked particularly well for a period of time until, unfortunately, we had in our major buying countries a minor recession. People stopped buying higher quality garments and there was a major decline. This made it extremely difficult for Wool International to get rid of that 180,000 bales a quarter. The process they selected was to offer private treaty forward selling arrangements, and, of course, under these circumstances, always at a discount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with that process was that it simply was not transparent. The deals were done privately; the outcome was announced after the event. Of course, while that was going on, we literally had buyers trying to buy wool in the fresh wool market on the auction floor, not knowing what was going on on the telephone back at Wool International.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has proved to be a disaster because, as the buyers took their insurance on the auction floor by bidding less, Wool International was then obliged to sell for less. Then, of course, the buyers bid for less, and we have had this ratcheting down, at a very rapid rate, of the price of wool. This has been quite a tragedy and created huge difficulty, particularly for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3533"> specialist wool growers, many of whom on this side of the country have also had the grave difficulty of drought; and it has not worked well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, nobody seemed to be prepared to come up with a solution, and that included our side of politics. There was a lot of dispute as to what the solution was within the industry, and politicians generally said, `Well, until you make up your mind, then we're not doing anything.' I criticise them for that. After all, we are charged with running the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The outcome of all this is that, in the end, the wool growers did take the issue up under the initiative of the Stud Merino Breeders Association. They came forward&mdash;notwithstanding that bodies like the Wool Council and the major farmer organisations in each state could not resolve it&mdash;and had very large meetings. Tens of thousands turned up to those meetings and about 95 per cent of them voted for change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The change that has to occur, in my opinion, is twofold. There must be a retention of the fixed release, but I support wholeheartedly the view that it could be reduced from 180,000 a quarter to 90,000 a quarter. Furthermore, there must be a transparency totally in that release.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That can be done in a couple of ways. One, of course, is to put all the wool on auction at no reserve. That, I think, is too dangerous. One of the propositions I have put to Wool International is that they should in fact be prepared to follow a practice of the Australian Wheat Board in its domestic sales from pooled wheat, which primarily goes to export&mdash;that is, they call an open tender for people to buy out of those pools. The tenders are dealt with by a leading accountancy firm to guarantee the complete integrity of the system. I believe Wool International could offer their fixed release in one quarter for release in the next quarter on a similar basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the way, the Australian Wheat Board&mdash;I would encourage Wool International in this regard&mdash;reserves the right not to accept any tender. They are not locked into it, it is not a `no reserve' situation: they are entitled to reject them. Wool International could then, having offered it on tender, accept some <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tenders, which would tend to set the market openly a quarter before the wool is actually disposed of. What is more, they could then say that they will trade privately, but only at prices above that tender price so the traders know they cannot come in after the event of the tender and get wool at the same price or less. The reality is that that would give transparency. It is a suggestion towards a solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will use my last couple of minutes criticising legislation passed in this place the other day. It originated with the Labor Party. That legislation was to allow Wool International to create a firm called Wool International Holdings for the purpose of spending $24 million of woolgrowers' money in a fashion that we still do not know about. We passed the legislation. The minister is yet to bring to the parliament the detail, the business plan, of how this process might work. It is indicated to me that they might be looking at some new form of forward marketing arrangements for wool, which they will administer with the woolgrowers' $24 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I protested in the early stage to the head of Wool International holdings on this matter he said, `Mr Tuckey, don't worry too much. If we lose the $24 million we won't go any further.' This is woolgrowers' money. There is no need. I looked at an advertisement from West Farmers Dalgety the other day which said, `Come sell your wool through us,' and they listed 10 different options by which a woolgrower might dispose of their wool. There was auction. There was a series of forward selling arrangements that have existed, such as the futures exchange. Macquarie Bank have recently brought in an insurance process that you can follow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are at least 10 different options for woolgrowers to dispose of wool. We don't need a woolgrower financed 11th option which, as far as I can see, will not improve the well-being of woolgrowers. They would be much better off getting the money back. That is what they want and I implore members to look at the other proposal which will come before us with one question in mind: will this help woolgrowers or will it just keep the operatives at Wool International in a job <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3534"> after the stockpile is disposed of? The question for us to answer is: will it help woolgrowers? If it does, it will get my support. I just cannot see, for the life of me, how the expenditure of that amount of money will do anything for woolgrowers or the wool industry.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too have to grieve today. I am sure that talking of great flooding disasters which have befallen this country over the last 50 years conjures up images to most Australians of Nyngan in the 1990s, or perhaps even Brisbane in 1974 in the wake of tropical cyclone Wanda.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not surprising that people's memories stem from the images captured by the television news or newspapers of the time. They remember those thousands of square kilometres that were covered by water, the hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damage and the tragic stories of lives lost and families ruined. It is a fact of life in this country that truly great disasters hang on longer in people's memories. The hundreds of other smaller ones, which impact just as hard on people but on a much smaller scale, gradually fall out of the nation's consciousness, which has neither the room nor the desire, I am ashamed to say, to keep them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, not many people outside my own electorate remember the flooding disasters that occurred there in August 1986 and in April and May 1988, which affected so much of south western Sydney. There weren't any heroic pictures of people in sandbag lines for the television news and there weren't any fatalities to warrant the prolonged attention of the editors of our daily newspapers, yet there was the abject misery and helplessness that comes from watching all of one's worldly possessions and a lifetime of memories being swept away by a wall of dirty, brown water. To those that suffered and to the hundreds of people in my community that may not have directly experienced that tragedy but suffered along with those who did, these floods were as great as any included in the annals of Australia's worst natural disasters.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make this point about the shortness of memory because it seems to me now that the federal government is suffering the same `inadequacy in the recollection department' by scrapping federal funding for the urban flood mitigation program. However, as much as I would like to pass off their lack of ingenuity and foresight in cutting their contributions as an example of just a brief lapse in memory, the consequences of their actions are far more serious and wide ranging. Their lack of commitment has completely disrupted the entire program, the effect of which is that people's homes and businesses, perhaps even their lives, stand a greater chance now of being threatened by flooding the longer this federal government withholds its financial support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the New South Wales minister for water resources between 1984 and 1988, I pushed long and hard for both state and federal governments to come to the aid of councils in western Sydney to improve their flood mitigation programs and, most particularly, to formulate an ongoing program of funding commitment. I was extremely pleased when, under the Hawke government, the urban flood mitigation program was finally completed. Under this partnership the New South Wales state government would match, dollar for dollar, money contributed by the federal government to provide for flood mitigation works. Local governments, in my case Fairfield City Council and Holroyd City Council, would then contribute 50c in each dollar based on a two by two by one funding ratio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the late 1980s, much had been achieved in my area. We have now seen roads raised, houses raised, bridges constructed and flood walls built, but there is still a long way to go. The scale of the flooding problem facing the Fairfield city area is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that $33 million is still required over the next 15 years to complete the works identified in Fairfield City Council's approved flood plain management plans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think most members, perhaps not those new to this House but those of us who have been here for a while, will have experienced local councils in their electorates voicing their concerns over federal government funding&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3535">that they were not getting enough and how this affected their ratepayers. On occasions I have had the pleasure of making representations both on behalf of Fairfield City Council and Holroyd City Council, who were anxious about federal government funding in the past re flood mitigation, and organising several ministerial visits to the area to check on how this money was being spent. Despite the ups and downs, the funding was always there. There was never any question of the federal government's shrugging off its responsibilities in this particular area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fairfield City Council and the people in my electorate of Prospect anticipated receiving an extra $1.16 million from the federal government this year, based on previous urban flood mitigation arrangements. When combined with state and local government money this would have provided the residents of Fairfield City with $2.9 million to contribute to its flood mitigation program. And that is where the Howard government comes in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 17 July this year, the federal Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp)&mdash;perhaps we had better call him the minister for no regional development because there is no regional development&mdash;announced that the federal government would abolish the division of regional development in the transport department as part of its deficit reduction strategy, putting 220 public servants out of work and saving $150 million. As part of the decision, Mr Sharp also announced that the federal government would no longer fund any of the initiatives started by the previous government under its better cities program. That is where the rub is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The money contributed by the federal government to meet its responsibilities under the urban flood mitigation program had prior to the election been moved across to come under the better cities campaign. Flood mitigation work in my electorate&mdash;indeed across the whole western Sydney region&mdash;has instantly gone on hold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as with most of the cost cutting measures undertaken by this government, there seems to be no indication that cuts have been approached with any of the thought, any of the intellectual rigour, necessary for them to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> avoid causing widespread hardship. For this government a cut is a cut is a cut. I say to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), his Treasurer (Mr Costello), the member for Hume (Mr Sharp) and all the ministers in the cabinet that a flood is a flood is a flood. Flood mitigation is not a glamour story. It is hard to get the headlines for cuts to flood mitigation funding when at the same time the government is hacking into education, legal aid and employment programs, yet the implications could be far greater.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would remind my honourable colleagues that, whereas cuts to education funding and labour market programs directly impact on a person's life and lifestyle choices, cuts to flood mitigation funding could lead to a situation where the next great flood actually takes lives because the infrastructure to combat the floods is not in place due to lack of funding. Until you return funding to these projects, until you wake up to your responsibility and until you wake up to what the widespread consequences will be, you must bear and honour as a government the commitments that have been made in the past to this particular program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When flooding comes to south western Sydney, as indeed it will come again, and when it destroys houses and destroys lives, we all know where we will be pointing the finger. The damage will be on the government's head. It does not give me great delight to say that because I have gone through year after year of experiencing the trauma and torment that have occurred when constituents of mine have been flooded out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The members on the other side may find this comical. They may even think it is an empty threat. I suppose on one level they should be smiling. They came to serve their fellow Australians and now here they are, each and every one of them party to a budget which serves it to the Australian public like never before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I kid you not. When, not if, my community is subjected once again to the disastrous floodwaters that we experienced in 1986 and 1988, without the federal government reaffirming its commitment to urban flood mitigation funding, I will be telling those <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3536"> constituents of mine the reason there was no flood wall built at the creek at the end of their street, why the proposed flood catchment area was never finished, why  their roads were never raised, and why the commitment to those who had been given the authority to raise their houses so that they could come out of the one in 20 or one in 30 year flood will not be honoured, because the funding is not there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will tell them that it is because the Howard government has run out on them. It has given no thought or consideration to the consequences of what will take place in metropolitan communities that still experience, through drainage problems and creek problems, flooding of untold proportions. We have seen in a community like mine, as I have stated, year after year the destruction of houses falling into creeks and rivers. We as a community should not see this happen in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These programs and commitments have been provided now on a regular basis since 1985. The federal government should at least honour the councils that have half completed programs&mdash;half a drainage channel is done, half a bridge is built. The councils were given a commitment to ongoing funding so you as a federal government should meet that commitment. The government has said not once since July but repeatedly and again in the budget the other night, `We as a federal government will not meet that commitment. You as the council and you as the ratepayers find the money or else.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Naturally in a large city like mine, when there are so many other things that have to be achieved, flood mitigation seems to be always at the end of the cost estimates when councils are preparing their budgets. When the councils have a commitment of funding from federal and state government, the obligation is on the government to meet that commitment. The Howard government has left Fairfield city financially high and dry. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This budget week will be long remem <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> bered as a result of the unprecedented wild scenes witnessed here at Parliament House. The violence flowing from the ACTU rally against the Howard government's industrial relations reform saw acid and paint thrown at Parliament House staff, 60 police injured, 49 protesters arrested, the souvenir shop looted and glass broken with sledgehammers in what the ACTU Secretary, Bill Kelty, later described as the most successful rally ever seen in Canberra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be no doubt that Australia needs to depart from the centralised union dominated system of industrial relations. This week's ugly struggle highlights the need to move away from the old conflict based mentality of the workplace relations dominated by outdated notions of class struggle instead of productivity and constructive agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the Labor Party and minority parties in the Senate continue to bow to the loud antics of the trade union movement, in Geelong recent industrial disputes highlight the pressing need to reform industrial relations against union opposition. We need a system that puts productivity and flexibility first.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the approach taken by Shell Australia currently locked in a dispute with the Australian Workers Union at the Corio Refinery in Geelong. Shell wanted workers to perform simple maintenance tasks as part of their daily duties to enhance productivity and the competitiveness of the Corio plant. The company was prepared to discuss an attractive pay increase in connection with these duties, but the Australian  Workers Union, which represents only 240 of the 700 workers at that plant, refused to discuss the issues of maintenance. The union went on strike in support of a 13 per cent pay claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3537"> These operators are already very highly paid, as the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) would understand; they average about $50,000 to $65,000 a year. The maintenance tasks involved are quite simple procedures requiring a tool kit of ring spanners and screwdrivers. That is all they need to help maintain the plant on a day by day basis. These procedures are standard for other refineries, including Shell's Clyde refinery in Sydney, but the union refused to consider the issue, jeopardis ing the long&hyphen;term competitiveness of the very enterprise which employs them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Corio refinery, as the member for Corio would fully understand, has now been picketed since 12 August. The country rail cars are being prevented from transporting fuel to country Victorians. Shell supplies 60 per cent of Victoria's petrol and there have been grave fears of shortages, both in Geelong and throughout the state, because of this strike. Distribution centres at Newport and Lara were also picketed, as was the berth used by Shell at the Port of Geelong, now owned by TNT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dispute has also prevented petrol reaching destinations in the Pacific Islands, New Zealand and Tasmania, and other parties have been dragged into the dispute, such as Terminals Ltd at the Port of Geelong, who have been unable to receive shipping because of the picket at the refinery pier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Shell applied to the Industrial Relations Commission for a bans clause to prevent further strike action. The application was granted, but the AWU continued to ignore calls to return to work. Last Friday, the refinery manager, Mr Andrew Jamieson, wrote a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Geelong Advertiser</EMPHASIS> saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employees should be aware that the action taken to date, including pickets at the Newport Terminal, the TNT jetty, rail tank cars and the Lara gas facility, constitutes illegal action which is unprotected. I urge you to stop this action and prevent your exposure to severe financial penalties.</PARA>
<PARA>To date, the union has not returned to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The union movement oppose the Reith industrial relation reforms because they insist the Industrial Relations Commission needs to play a strong role as the neutral umpire in industrial matters. Yet, when the unions do not like the decisions of the neutral umpire, they simply disregard them, as they have done in this dispute. In this case, the AWU has ignored the ruling of the IRC that the workers should return to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Shell conflict comes just a few months after one of the most disastrous industrial disputes seen in Geelong for a long time. The honourable member for Corio would be aware of the details of this dispute, which was in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wool scouring industry. On Thursday 20 June, I told this House that the manager of a prominent wool scouring plant, Mr Jim Robinson, had his car torched and destroyed. That is on the public record; it was the final result of this ongoing dispute which I will describe in some detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This dispute has been going on since March. The story began with E.P. Robinson, a wool scouring plant located in the suburb of Newtown in Geelong, in the heart of the electorate of Corio. Until early this year, the plant employed 46 full&hyphen;time staff and 20 casuals, all covered by the wool scourers and carbonisers award. E.P. Robinson was a closed shop; we are not too happy about that, but that was the situation. All of the wool scourers employed there were AWU members, by virtue of the preference clause in the award.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A few years ago, Mr Steven Roach set up a rebel union called the Shearers and Rural Workers Union. Earlier this year, Mr Roach and his offsider, John Morgan, sought members at the E.P. Robinson plant in Geelong, trying to persuade the workers to quit the AWU and join the rebel union that Mr Roach was trying to set up. On 6 March, the workers at E.P. Robinson resigned en masse from the AWU and joined Steven Roach's rebel SRWU. It is understood that part of the reason for this mass defection was that the company intended to install new equipment, with more up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date technology, and some workers felt that that might jeopardise their jobs. That was their understanding; they did not really look at it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They looked to Mr Roach's union to fight these technological changes because they did not want to have any progress. The management stated clearly that they would not give the SRWU any of the rights which had been granted to the AWU under the award: rights of entry, automatic pay deduction and all those sorts of things. In response, the workers refused to load the wool of one of the firm's major suppliers, Mr Ian Laycock. It was a clear case of secondary boycott, but the supplier had virtually no recourse to any legal remedy under the current state of law because <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3538"> the previous Labor government had removed the secondary boycott legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The workers were stood down and immediately went on strike and began a picket line outside the firm. For months afterwards, there was a full&hyphen;time rotation of rowdy picketers, with Mr Steven Roach and John Morgan ever present. Five brave workers refused to join the picket line and continued to work at the firm, despite unimaginable harassment and intimidation. Another employee told management that he wanted to work, but was too fearful to pass the picket line. The management employees were threatened, harassed and bullied as they came to work and left again in the evening. Threatening telephone calls were also recorded. I spoke to transport operators who reported their experiences trying to get goods in and out of the firm: they were harassed, their drivers were harassed and they virtually gave up transporting wool to and from the company's operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Police and extra security were required to provide protection to people that were doing no more than going to work each day. Meanwhile, the major left&hyphen;wing unions in Geelong, the CFMEU and the AMWU, relished the opportunity to stick the boot into the AWU. The hat was passed around the building sites throughout Geelong and the CFMEU members held stop work meetings to physically support the picket at the Robinson plant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 9 May, a day of action was held, including a mass meeting at which free alcohol was provided. There were a number of left&hyphen;wing unions, including ex&hyphen;BLF elements from Melbourne who declared their intention to close down E. P. Robinson for good. That was their attitude. They wanted to close it down and that was all part of the union activity. Cases of violence were alleged and no less than 10 cars were damaged during the evening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The firm was forced to shut down indefinitely because of their inability to get products in and out of the factory. E.P. Robinson sought relief from the Victorian Supreme Court, seeking a restraining order against Mr Roach and his rent a crowd. The case was heard by Mr Justice Nathan, who heard the preliminary evidence and had this to say&mdash;and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> members of the House might be interested in the legal comments by his honour:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The plaintiff's action alleges that the Defendants and all of them: induced breaches of its contractual obligations with other corporations and in particular Laycocks; interfered with contracts of employment of other employees; wrongfully interfered with the commercial relations of Robinsons; engaged in acts of unlawful damage to telephone and electricity services, poured sulfuric acid on wool bales and other acts of physical damage were alleged; the defendants or some of them threw missiles, including pasta and eggs at the plaintiff's vehicles and other vehicles; trespassed on the plaintiff's premises; by the acts alleged including behaviour of yelling, dancing and behaving in an agitated way outside the premises, committed acts of nuisance; intimidated other employees and customers; by various ways conspired to injure Robinson and its business.</PARA>
<PARA>His honour went on to conclude the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The right of employees to form association is protected by the common law and international conventions and the Court recognises and accepts this right. But there are many spaces between this right and how associations choose to act or not act.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . employees (exercised) their right to picket outside the premises. Had it stopped at that, there would be nothing to enjoin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am satisfied that the activity has resulted in isolating Robinson from the market place, causing it to cease operations in the short term and suffer as an employer physical damage to some of its plant and equipment . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am satisfied that the level of hostility between Robinson and its former employees has gone beyond picketing in the ordinary sense and resulted in behaviour the object of which was the ruination of Robinson.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a clear case&mdash;both at Shell and at Robinson&mdash;of the activity of the union movement, which is committed to removing jobs from its own fellow unionists.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this place to urge the government to pick up the threads of protection for whistleblowing in the public interest. I refer the House to the reports of the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3539"> of 1994 and 1995 and, in particular, their recommendation that the practice of whistleblowing should be the subject of Commonwealth legislation to facilitate the making of disclosures in the public interest and to ensure protection for those who choose to do so.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In the then government's response of November 1995 that recommendation and quite a few others, let me say, from the Senate select committee were agreed to. This needs to be something that does not drop from sight, particularly in the light of ongoing revelations about the mistreatment of whistleblowers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw the attention of the House to the sad fate of Victorian Constable Karl Konrad. For those who are not aware of this case, Karl Konrad joined the Victorian police force in April 1993. In March 1994 he moved to Moorabbin police station. In September he reported to a superior that police officers were taking kickbacks from shutter companies for tip&hyphen;offs about jobs. He indicates that harassment began the day after he filed his complaint: his car was vandalised in the car park of Moorabbin police station. In March 1995, a year later, Karl Konrad took details of the window shutter scam and harassment to the police ombudsman's office and a month later he was forced to go on stress leave because of harassment. In September he went public with claims of corruption and details of the window shutter affair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Precious little was done in relation to the window shutter affair and in mid&hyphen;January this year Karl Konrad released a tape recording of an interview with the head of the Internal Investigations Department, Chief Superintendent Tom McGrath, who admitted the existence of a `brotherhood' which protected corrupt officers. For his trouble, in February the police laid disciplinary charges against Constable Konrad for speaking to the media! He was fined $1,000 and some three weeks ago he was dismissed from the police force. The fate of Karl Konrad is a salutary reminder that we live in a society in which whistleblowing is a risky business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am indebted to Anthony Forsyth, who is now a staff member of the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), for the work he has done on the need for whistleblower protection, and I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> intend to draw on some of that work. Whistleblowing might conveniently be described as the disclosure by an employee of information relating to some form of wrongdoing by or within the organisation in which the employee is employed, usually in the public sector. It has long been suggested that whistleblowers should, as a matter of public interest, enjoy some form of protection from adverse treatment, retaliation or discrimination by employers about whom the information has been disclosed. This suggestion raises the need for a balancing of the public interest in disclosure of such information, particularly in the context of employment relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to see in this country legislation protecting public interest whistleblowers. The position at common law is that employees have an obligation of confidence to their employer. In the context of any employment relationship, any disclosure of information by an employee acquired during the employee's employment will quite likely constitute a breach of that employee's obligation of confidence. Theoretically, employers can bring a common law action against the employee for breach of that obligation. While the law will protect from disclosure information that is truly confidential, it will allow disclosures in some circumstances in the public interest. To satisfy the public interest test, disclosures have to be considered to relate to a matter of `serious concern and benefit to the public'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation is far from being simple and the possibility of facing an action in civil courts for breach of duty of confidentiality may well be sufficient to prevent many would&hyphen;be Public Service whistleblowers from coming forward. Reliance on that public interest exception to the duty of confidentiality in employment relationships as a basis for going public with revelations of graft, corruption or mismanagement in government is presently fraught with difficulties and uncertainties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are all familiar with the culture of fear and retribution that dominated Queensland's political life until the release of the Fitzgerald report on Public Administration and Criminal <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3540"> Justice back in July 1989. It was a central tenet of the Fitzgerald report that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is an urgent need . . . for legislation which prohibits any person from penalising any other person for making accurate public statements about misconduct, inefficiency or other problems within public instrumentalities.</PARA>
<PARA>Regrettably, Victoria is going the same way. Premier Kennett's speeding at 143 kilometres per hour, which should have resulted in an automatic loss of licence but, instead, resulted only in a fine, demonstrates the slide towards corruption. So does the treatment of Constable Karl Konrad.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is little wonder that public confidence in Victoria's police force has recently been measured at an all&hyphen;time low. The need for a legislative scheme of general application cannot be understated. Not only are there benefits in terms of protection for those who do come forward but benefits also flow from the creation of a culture which encourages rather than suppresses the disclosure of information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Legislation raises a number of practical issues. First, what matters should constitute wrongdoing for the purposes of whistleblowers' protection legislation? They are: an infringement of the law, corruption, misuse or waste of public money, abuse of authority or position, and endangering public health or safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the South Australian Whistleblowers Protection Act, public interest information is described as: illegal conduct; irregular and unauthorised use of public money; substantial mismanagement of public resources; conduct causing a substantial risk to public health or safety or the environment; and, finally, in the case of a public office, maladministration in the performance of public functions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, there are procedural issues. Disclosure needs to be made to a proper authority in order to attract the protection of the legislation. The South Australian Whistleblowers Protection Act also requires the person making the disclosure to believe that the information is true or believe on reasonable grounds that it may be true. The disclosure also has to be made to a person to whom it is reasonable and appropriate to make that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> disclosure. That will generally be a minister of the Crown but, where the information relates to illegal activity, the appropriate authority is the police force; where it relates to irregular or unauthorised use of public money, the Auditor-General; and where it relates to a public employee, the Commissioner of Public Employment, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New South Wales Protected Disclosures Act 1994 offers protection to voluntary disclosures by public officials made to appropriate investigating authorities. So, for disclosures concerning corrupt conduct, the appropriate authority will be the Independent Commission Against Corruption; for those relating to maladministration, the appropriate authority is the Ombudsman; and for those dealing with serious and substantial waste of public money, the appropriate authority is the Auditor-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, what type of protection should be offered? It is my view that the principal protection that any legislative scheme of whistleblowers' protection ought to offer is that against any reprisals or acts of discrimination which might follow the making of disclosure, such as disciplinary action, demotion or termination. The legislation should also provide whistleblowers with a general immunity from civil or criminal liability and protect them from any potential action, claim or demand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would urge the federal government to take action, in light of the Senate committee reports and in light of the government's response of November 1995. I think it is possible to make a more robust response than the government's response. But, in any event, there is plenty in that response for this government to take up and act on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would urge the government to act on the ongoing evidence coming from the Konrad case, which is a Victorian case, and others for the need of this kind of protection. All too often we hear it said that when someone comes forward in the public interest with information about corruption the only person who suffers is the person who makes the disclosure. Many whistleblowers have commented subsequently that they regret having come forward because they are the only <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3541"> people who have suffered for their displays of honesty, integrity and pursuing probity and higher standards of public conduct. So it is necessary that this kind of legislation and change does not slip below the surface, and that the government takes appropriate action at the earliest possible opportunity.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TITLE>Pensioners: Mobile Home Parks</TITLE>

<ELECTORATE> (Richmond)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.55 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak about the plight of pensioners living in mobile home parks in the electorate of Richmond and across the whole of Australia. The points I want to emphasise today are rental assistance and the inequities and discrimination that face pensioners living in mobile home parks versus pensioners living in rental assistance accommodation outside of these parks; that is, living in houses made of bricks and mortar. If time permits, I would also like to discuss a review that the Commonwealth could do in providing a code of conduct for fairness and equity when it comes to rental increases through site fees, which are adjusted after every pension increase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I do that, I would like to mention the executive of CAPPRA, which is the Combined Caravan Park and Relocatable Association and the Combined Pensioners and Superannuation Association. Some of the key players are Rupe Granrott, Don Morgan and Alan Shepard, and there are many others who do valuable work for pensioners in the Tweed area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are over 6,000 people who live in mobile home parks in the electorate of Richmond. Indeed, there are over 55 caravan parks. They are mainly private parks but some are owned by the councils. I will speak about the history of parks. Parks were certainly encouraged in the mid&hyphen;1980s by state and local governments as a way of increasing housing density and providing affordable accommodation particularly for the aged moving up from the western suburbs of Sydney, Melbourne or west of the divide. In many ways it provided a wonderful village atmosphere and affordable accommodation for the aged.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a key difference between those people who live in mobile home parks now as opposed to those people who lived in traditional caravan parks, because they own equity in their own portable prefabricated homes. I might also add that in these mobile home parks there is a much lower rate of crime. Community services are provided due to the closeness of other neighbours, which saves the taxpayer. It saves the taxpayer paying for housing commission homes because it is affordable accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the key difference that needs to be emphasised is that pensioners have equity in their own homes, even though they pay a rental charge when they live in mobile home parks. Pensioners who are renting houses&mdash;that is, bricks and mortar&mdash;are still placed on the government housing list, even though they are utilising government resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to now draw your attention to a case about rental assistance. That is, from March this year, pensioners who live in permanent caravan parks have been significantly disadvantaged when it comes to rental assistance, due to the increase in the minimum threshold for rental assistance. It must be remembered that since December 1986 many of these aged pensioners have spent their life savings to purchase a relocatable home, priced between $50,000 to $100,000. They have also had costs relating to locating the home onto the caravan park, building a carport and verandahs and doing landscaping and gardening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have also had the cost of all the utilities. Likewise, they have the cost of the fittings and furniture. They are responsible for the maintenance of lawns and gardens. If they do not keep these in an adequate state, they could possibly face eviction. This is very different for aged pensioners renting accommodation outside in normal rental accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The continual increase in the minimum threshold level for rental assistance helps those pensioners renting a house or a flat by increasing their rental assistance. However, for aged pensioners who rent a site in a caravan park, the continued government increase in the minimum threshold level for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3542"> rental assistance in real terms decreases their rental assistance each time the threshold is raised. This was particularly emphasised by the previous government. The minimum threshold for rental assistance which was introduced in March 1993 had the following effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will use an example of an individual&mdash;let us say Joe Blow, aged 70, who purchased a relocatable home. In the early 1980s the minimum threshold was $50 per fortnight. In March 1993 it was raised to $100. At the time Joe Blow was paying $120 per fortnight for his site rental. He received 50c in the dollar for $70&mdash;$35&mdash;in rental assistance. This was kept at the same level until March 1993 when the threshold was raised from $50 to $100. In real terms his rental assistance dropped from $35 to $15 per fortnight because of these inequitable changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Department of Social Security recognised this, so they made arrangements within mobile home parks that the threshold would be kept at $35 as a way of compensating those individuals who would face significant financial disadvantage if the threshold was decreased. However, in March this year&mdash;this policy was introduced by the previous government&mdash;the minimum threshold was again raised to $115, but the Department of Social Security advised most people living in mobile home parks that they would not be disadvantaged by the further increase. Indeed, almost 100 per cent of their pension increase, which was $5.80 per individual, or $11.60 per couple, would be taken from them to pay for the increase in rental assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For most people living in mobile home parks this effectively meant that prior to this change they received $35 in rental assistance and now received only $23.80, a loss of $11.20. For most pensioners that is a significant decrease. It brings in the whole question of fairness and equity when you compare pensioners living in mobile home parks to pensioners receiving rental assistance for dwellings of bricks and mortar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that it is essential for the government to readdress the rental assistance criteria to pensioners living in mobile home parks. I invite Alan Shepard to come to Canberra as <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> soon as possible to meet with the minister's advisers in the Department of Social Security and to lobby the government to change the rental assistance criteria for those disadvantaged people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second matter I wish to raise is site fees. Many local councils are now imposing further fee increases on caravan park proprietors and there is a fear that these site fees could be passed on to individuals. I urge the government, in cooperation with the states, to look at bringing in uniform standards for fee increases&mdash;a self-regulated code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recognise that every proprietor has the right to make a profit and, naturally, to secure adequate returns to reflect inflation adjustments after the cost of living. When there is a pension increase on a half-yearly basis&mdash;I am delighted that the government has maintained the commitment to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings&mdash;there is concern in many cases that proprietors will increase the fee to almost the same amount as the pension increase. This will have significant financial consequences for the 6,000 people living in mobile home parks in the electorate of Richmond. I believe there is merit in examining the implementation of a code of self-regulation Australia&hyphen;wide to ensure that when rental increases do occur the full cost is not passed on to the pensioner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, obviously pensioners make up a huge number of Australians. There is an ageing population in the electorate of Richmond. Of the 148 electorates represented in the House, only two other electorates have a higher aged population than that of the Richmond electorate. We have a substantial group of people living in mobile home parks. Many have chosen this way of living not only for its wonderful lifestyle but also for its affordable housing&mdash;and they are saving the taxpayer. We must ensure that rental assistance guidelines are looked at as a matter of urgency before the next pension increase.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I present the following report&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report 345&mdash;Advisory report on the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996, the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Bill 1996 and the Income Tax (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996</EMPHASIS> .</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZT4">Mr SOMLYAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to table Report No. 345, the report of the inquiry of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts into legislation to replace the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. This report details the JCPA's review of three bills currently before the House: the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996, the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Bill 1996 and the Income Tax (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996. The bills are essentially the same as ones introduced and referred to the JCPA in the 37th Parliament. Unfortunately, the committee did not have an opportunity to complete its inquiry before the general election was called. However, the evidence it gathered was not wasted and has been considered by the current committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that these bills rewrite existing law does not diminish their importance. There are few pieces of Commonwealth legislation that affect more Australians than tax laws. It should be a matter of considerable concern, therefore, that the most significant of these laws&mdash;the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936&mdash;is in danger of collapsing under the weight of its own complexity. This problem is recognised by all&mdash;from taxpayers to officers of the ATO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act is in desperate need of a comprehensive overhaul. It is over 5,000 pages long, cannot be easily read or understood, no longer has a recognisable structure and has had amendment piled on top of amendment over the past 60 years. The cost to business and individual taxpayers of trying to understand <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and comply with this law ranges from $3 billion to $6 billion annually. Any reduction in these compliance costs, therefore, will be a significant micro&hyphen;economic reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The defects of the 1936 act have been known for some time. Indeed, in 1993 the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in Report No. 326&mdash;a landmark report on the administration of tax law and the operations of the Australian Tax Office&mdash;recommended that the law be simplified. The then government accepted that recommendation and the tax law improvement project was born. The purpose of this project&mdash;known by all as TLIP&mdash;was, and is, to restructure, renumber and rewrite in plain language the income tax law. The bills before the House essentially provide a new framework for the tax law into which future packages of rewritten law will be slotted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the whole, the new legislation has been well received by the tax and accounting professions, industry groups and academics. It became clear to the committee during the inquiry that any improvements to the bills would represent fine tuning rather than a major rethink. This stands as testimony to the efforts of the bill's drafters and TLIP's extensive and comprehensive consultative review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While there may be general support for the contents of the legislation, there is certainly not support for its scheduled commencement date. As the bills stand, they are due to have effect from 1 July 1996, clearly making them retrospective in application. The committee acknowledges arguments that, in practical terms, the 1996 bills are not retrospective because they are only rewriting existing law and not creating new law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3544"> However, it is unacceptable to the committee that taxation legislation of any form be retrospective. For this reason, the committee has strongly recommended that the commencement date for the legislation be changed to 1 July after enactment. Some argued that the commencement date should simply be moved back a year to 1 July 1997. The committee disagrees, for there is a risk that the legislation will not be passed by that date and become retrospective again. The committee's recommendation removes any possibility of this occurring. I might add that this recom mendation is consistent with a similar recommendation made last year by the JCPA when it reviewed TLIP's progress up until then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has made a number of other recommendations associated with the phase&hyphen;in of the new bills. The committee has recommended that these and subsequent bills by TLIP commence progressively. This will minimise the impact that the transfer to the new law will have on taxpayers. The committee also believes that the ATO needs to make a public commitment to rewrite promptly public rulings that will be affected by the new legislation. Similarly, the ATO will need to ensure that any technical errors or unintended consequences are addressed speedily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the committee has recommended amendments to various clauses that reflect concerns of tax professionals and industry groups. In fact, the process of amending the bills before us still goes on. The committee has recently been briefed on proposed government amendments to the bills concerning company tracing provisions. However, there was not time to consider these in any detail. TLIP has also advised the committee that it will be correcting several technical errors in the bills. The committee looks forward to seeing these changes made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the main objectives of the rewrite process is to reduce long&hyphen;term costs of tax compliance. In the committee's view, it is unlikely that compliance costs will come down significantly until such time as the underlying complexities of tax policy are addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a clear sense of frustration that unworkable sections of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 are being perpetuated in the 1996 bill. Unfortunately, addressing these concerns is beyond TLIP's current mandate. In practice, however, TLIP's mandate could not have been expanded without the rewrite process becoming bogged down in policy debates. Having said that, the committee acknowledges that there needs to be more substantial simplification of the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There remains, therefore, the continuing need to address the `small p' policy complexities being highlighted by TLIP. The success of the committee's review process suggests <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that a parliamentary committee may be an appropriate forum to examine these issues. This is partly in response to a perception that Treasury is unresponsive to concerns about these matters when they are raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, the committee has recommended that the government fund a parliamentary committee to review the unworkable, complex sections of tax law. This could be performed by the JCPA, a joint standing review committee or a joint select committee. In fact, the committee believes that tax simplification requires more than just a rewrite or tidying up of policy complexities. What is ultimately required is a wide&hyphen;ranging review of tax policy at the federal and state level. Only after such a review can compliance costs truly come down. The committee urges the government to consider this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a final note, the committee would like to thank all those individuals and organisations which have provided written and oral evidence and advice to both the previous and current JCPA. Some witnesses have given evidence twice to assist the new committee to come up to speed on the issues. We also thank various officials from TLIP who have briefed the JCPA on a number of occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a personal note, I would like to thank my colleagues on the committee who undertook the inquiry for the efforts they have put in. The committee believes that the efforts of all have generated a sensible and well informed debate and the result should be better legislation. I conclude by saying that the high quality of work produced by the staff of the JCPA has again proven to be the case in this inquiry.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not in the coalition's directory; you are described otherwise.

I simply want to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3545"> comment on one aspect of it and to ask for clarification of another minor matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say at the outset, as one whose career at different times has undoubtedly suffered because I crossed the floor on more than one occasion when retrospective tax measures were introduced in this place, that I am delighted that the committee has restated an earlier expression of principle in another context about opposition to tax laws having retrospective effect. Perhaps I should make my own position clear in that regard. I have no problem with the retrospectivity when it confers an advantage on the taxpayer; none whatsoever. You can go back to 1901, as far as I am concerned, and confer advantage. My objection, for obvious reasons I am sure, involves most essentially a total commitment to the rule of law, which can only be observed if you know the law at the time you commit a particular act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My objection to retrospectivity surrounds an impost having retrospective effect. Of course, I understand that to be what the committee seeks to deal with on this occasion. I look forward to reading the report in detail. I have not yet had that opportunity. I feel certain that I will be better informed for having done that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point of clarification I would like, because the committee has more resources than I, is that I know it is conventional wisdom that the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 is 5,000 pages long. I have tried to get it up to that figure and I have only got to 3,800. I would like to know how that has been counted or, indeed, if conventional wisdom has been repeated. You might be including tax rulings, but I think it would be far more than 5,000 pages if they were being included.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I congratulate the committee. I commend it for its stand on retrospectivity. It is a pleasant change to see members and senators on both sides of the political spectrum looking at that as a matter of principle. I would like to see it writ in stone, if it were possible, but I guess different committees and different parliaments will approach the matter in different ways and will modify them. I have no doubt that when it suits a government to legislate retrospectively <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on some occasions, it will, as I have seen  happen in the past, be mandatory for government members to support that legislation, and I have no doubt it will go through. As in the past, it will probably go through with the support of the majority on both sides of the Houses. I doubt whether I will be amongst the majority on that occasion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (Murray)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(11.20 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 is one of the largest and most complex examples of any Commonwealth legislation. When the act was introduced in 1936 it was less than 100 pages and now it is substantially longer. It has become so complex that the conventional numbering system has broken down. The result is section numbers such as the infamous s.159GZZZZA(2)(b)(iii)(B). The act is extraordinarily difficult for readers to find their way through. Important provisions have simply been tacked onto the end of the act as they have been introduced, without integration back into the rest of the original section.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you have heard, the bills that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts has reviewed are designed to cut through all the unnecessary complexity. In drafting a replacement act, the tax law improvement project needed to create legislation that was easier to read and use. The new law also had to allow for future amendments to be incorporated without distorting the basic structure. To become more user friendly, the 1996 bill uses plain language, shorter sentences, simpler, contemporary words. It uses a new, more flexible numbering system, diagrams and explanatory guides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some commentators giving evidence were concerned that the use of that plain language, while in itself commendable, has sometimes been at the expense of precision. They argued, for example, that words such as `most', `sometimes', `work out' and `some' lack the precision required for fiscal legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As one witness said, what appears to be plain language in a legislative provision may in fact turn out to be anything but that, when it comes under the scrutiny of the courts. The committee acknowledges this concern but believes it misses the essential point of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3546"> legislation. The law should not just be written for the courts but also for other users&mdash;taxpayers and tax professionals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of the committee appreciate any attempts to ease the complexity of the legislation for the sake of those who will use it. The committee was concerned to hear anecdotal evidence about the number of tax agents who have to rely on private sector tax guides because they cannot understand tax law as it is currently written.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee believes that the language of the 1996 bill and, in particular, the core and general provisions should be understandable to all those who need to read it. It is this sentiment that leads the committee to fully support the use of plain language in the bill even for describing the complex provisions. For the same reason the committee has supported the phased introduction of the rewritten law. TLIP is proposing to introduce the rewritten legislation in three stages. Some witnesses have argued that the legislation should be introduced in one big hit or big bang; others that parliament should enact the legislation in stages but implement it in one hit. This option is called warehousing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee supports the phased introduction method. What has reinforced the committee's support for phased introduction is that transition will be easier for small tax practitioners. Tax agents in my electorate of Murray are typically one&hyphen; or two&hyphen;person practices in small country towns, with few opportunities for professional development or peer interaction. Several weeks ago I invited a TLIP representative to brief these agents on the new legislation. Forty of them travelled hundreds of kilometres as tax agents to participate. After working their way through some of the rewritten sections, these very small tax agent businesses felt that this new law would substantially assist them to better serve the needs of their regional clients. They also strongly supported the phased introduction of the rewritten law to give them time to adjust. Thus, for practical reasons, the committee confirms its support for phased introduction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I wish to add my broad support to the legislation. The committee has <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> had some concerns with the 1996 bill's commencement date and several individual clauses, matters which the member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) has already alluded to. However, I believe that this legislation will be a significant improvement, particularly for individual taxpayers, small regional businesses and sole tax agents&mdash;groups that are so often forgotten.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I will come straight to a couple of points I would like to make on this matter and reserve my right, when the bills are before the House, to make further comments. This report is a major response to a major initiative that has implications which will lead to significant changes and improvement in the operation of taxation law in this country. As has been mentioned by earlier speakers, it is based on a recommendation which originally came from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The matter was then taken up by the previous government, of which I was proud to be a member. Following on from initial consideration by the previous JCPA a report has now been brought down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people involved in the taxation law improvement project deserve to be congratulated for endeavouring to undertake this task. I must admit that if I had been defeated at the last election and in search of new employment it is not a job I would have sought because it is certainly a very mind-boggling task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of compliance costs has been mentioned. Compliance costs, as we all know, are a major concern in regard to the operation of taxation law in this country. This process, as it goes on from here, has the scope to lead to significant savings in compliance costs in the operation of the tax system. This is, if you like, the first stage. A number of different bills will come down in what is, in terms of the complexity of the existing taxation law of this country, a very major effort indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Retrospectivity is an issue which other speakers have also mentioned. The bills currently before the House have a retrospective component to them&mdash;their operational date. I note the comments of other coalition and Independent speakers, and I agree with them. In the circumstances, retrospectivity <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3547"> ought not be supported. Given the current government's stand on these issues previously, at least on some occasions, I look forward with some interest to seeing what happens when the bills are further considered. I will certainly be keeping a weather eye from my own point of view on whether they stick to their previous policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The review of taxation policy was a matter of some discussion within the committee. A range of issues relating to the taxation law of this country both in terms of its operation and policy need to be addressed. I think we all agree on that. Where we will disagree is on the question of what that reform should be. I will not make any comment about a GST today other than to say that I still oppose it. I always have and I always will. But certainly the issue of taxation law and what is in operation in those areas is worthy of consideration. I certainly support that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A parliamentary committee to look at these issues is essential to try to avoid some of the problems of a minor but important nature that we have come across within this inquiry. Particularly given the cutbacks that have been imposed by the government on committee secretariats throughout the parliament, funding needs to be provided for that committee. It is a big job. The JCPA secretariat and members of the committee were convinced of that over the conduct of this inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to express my thanks to the members of the committee for the work they did and for the bipartisan and constructive manner in which it was undertaken. I would like to thank the witnesses for the generally constructive approach that was taken to the public hearings in their submissions. I would particularly like to thank James Catchpole and the other members of the JCPA secretariat for the work they did. We have to be honest about this. The committee secretariats are the backbone of the preparation of these reports and do an excellent job in circumstances which have been made more difficult recently. I commend the report to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

I am <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> delighted to have been given the opportunity to participate in this historic rewrite and to be given the opportunity to speak to it today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), has pointed out, the report details the committee's review of three bills currently before the House. The most significant of those, of course, is the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996. The bill will replace the 60-year-old Income Tax Assessment Act 1936&mdash;an act which is now some 5,000 pages long, as I understand it, and which is ridiculously complex and capable of being understood in its entirety by only the most capable of tax professionals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This complexity leads to very high compliance costs not only for business but also for ordinary PAYE taxpayers. Indeed, it is estimated that the annual cost of compliance for all taxpayers could be as high as $6 billion. I am pleased to be able to say that the decision to rewrite the act was an initiative of the former Labor government. I am also happy to recognise the support the now government has given to the rewrite process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate members of the tax law improvement project who were given an enormous and difficult task and who, at times, had to weather the criticisms of tax professionals and industry representatives alike. I must say, however, that I was somewhat surprised, as a new member of the committee, that, despite the fact that the process was very well advanced, so many of the concerns of the industry had still not been resolved. I do recognise, however, that self&hyphen;interest will always be a factor and that we could never hope to get absolute consensus on such a complex process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am delighted that the committee has accepted as valid the concerns of the various industry players about the 1 July 1996 commencement date for the bill. Retrospectivity would indeed be a mistake. I am also pleased with the committee's request that the issue of the implications of the new act for tax rulings be addressed as a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3548"> During the public inquiry process, there was far from consensus within the industry regard ing the way in which the bill should be phased in. I am satisfied with the committee's recommendations in this regard. There will no doubt be some who will have false expectations about this new act and will no doubt be disappointed. But the fact is that the TLIP's brief was to make the act easier to read and not to consider policy change. Post-rewrite, the bill remains outrageously complex and unworkable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I fully support the recommendation that funding be made available to allow for a review of the small `p' policy issues identified by the TLIP. I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the JCPA staff on the wonderful work they have done throughout the process. I commend the report to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 deals with a range of topics. It deals with the fringe benefits tax, the forgiveness of commercial debt, the extended use of tax file numbers for superannuation purposes, offshore banking units, the repeal of section 261, pooled superannuation trusts and deductions for gifts. In that regard, it is a bill of some complexity and a bill that covers a range of matters that are of pretty important significance and of great attention to Australian taxpayers. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the matter of fringe benefits taxes alone, the House will be aware of the growth in complexity of this area under the previous government&mdash;the way in which the previous government used it as a huge resource to increasingly tax those people in Australia that they thought were gaining benefits from their workplace. This government has undertaken to do something about improving the complexity of the fringe benefits taxation system. The compliance costs are far too high, the system must be simplified, and those areas which are not part of a fringe benefits tax process will be removed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill represents a step in the right direction and it gives effect to the coalition election commitment to double the FBT minor benefits exemption. In the debate that took place last night, a number of members said that they thought it could be higher than the government's current limit of $100. But all assessments of what the figure should be are just off the top of the head assessments of what it should be. The previous government said that anything that was less than $50 should be accountable for fringe benefits tax. This government is saying $100 because the bookkeeping compliance costs and the Tom Foolery that the previous government forced taxpayers to go into&mdash;to drain every drop, every halfpenny, every farthing, every cent, out of the taxpayers&mdash;no matter what the cost of doing so, have to be set aside. We are simplifying and improving the tax system.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that the member for Curtin interjected because he has reminded me of the commitments of the current government to small business in particular. Members will be aware of the commitments made by this government during the election campaign and those commitments which were kept and honoured in the budget of last Tuesday night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just run briefly through those because of the encouragement I have received from the House to enunciate some of the commitments that have been kept by the current government. Not only have we kept the commitment that we made in regard to the exemption of minor benefits of less than $100, part of the legislation before the House for fringe benefits, but also we have kept our commitments in regard to capital gains tax relief. And that will be a matter that we will be having legislation on as part of the budgetary process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating members of the Australian Labor Party, those people who made the capital gains tax so complex and so hopeless that, for even minor advisings, firms were seeking advice from legal advisers. The minimum cost, in case you are not aware of it, was $5,000 for advisings on capital gains tax. For the payment of small amounts of capital gains, because of the self&hyphen;assessment process, it was costing firms thousands of dollars just to make sure that they paid the right amount of tax, that they got it right so that they did not find themselves suddenly in an unexpected debt situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Australian Labor Party did in fringe benefits tax and capital gains tax was just an incredible impost on costs right across the whole structure of Australian society. The previous Prime Minister, who, thankfully, is no longer in this place, did not seem to worry about those sorts of things. All he was interested in was dragging as much money, no matter what the cost of compliance was, out of Australian taxpayers, particularly small business, in order to prop up and fill the coffers that he and his party so much wanted <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> filled so they could carry out their most extravagant, and often impractical, schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one makes a comparison of what the Australian Labor Party did, one can see why it is really important for this House to move in and simplify the taxation system and to make changes such as those that are proposed in the bill. If one looks at the impact of the Australian Labor Party on the Australian community, one can see that the foreign debt went from $23 billion to $180 billion in a period of 13 years. The private sector gross fixed capital expenditure averaged 17 per cent under the Fraser government, but it dropped to under 16 per cent under the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If one looks at taxation, the average revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product was 22.9 per cent under Fraser, but under Hawke and Keating it was 24 per cent of gross domestic product. The Australian Labor Party is a big taxing party. The complexity of what they did in order to gain those extra taxes is reflected in taxes such as the fringe benefits tax and the capital gains tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes this legislation makes are a step in the right direction. They may not be complete. Independent members of the House, including the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), have argued that this figure should be $200, but that is easy to pluck out of the air. The fact is this government has moved in the right direction. It has doubled the exemption amount for minor benefits from $50 to $100. This legislation will set that in place. So all employers giving benefits to employees need not keep account of those benefits which are less than $100. That is a significant and important step.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3550">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another part of the changes to the taxation rules relates to the forgiveness of commercial debt. The new measures are based on provisions introduced by the previous government in the last parliament, which lapsed when the parliament was prorogued prior to the election. These measures, in several important respects, depart from those lapsed provisions and take into account public concerns that have been expressed about certain aspects of the lapsed provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments will apply to commercial debts forgiven after 27 June 1996, not from 9 May 1995, which was the proposed commencement date under the Labor Party provisions. Under the revised transitional arrangements, if forgiveness occurs after 27 June 1996, pursuant to an agreement or arrangement entered into on or before 27 June, the forgiveness will not be affected by the amendments. So the commercial forgiveness debt provisions will not affect the creditor's taxation entitlement. Fair attention has been given to these matters. I know there will be a range of technical questions on this and other areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extended use of the tax file number to superannuation accounts is another matter contained in this legislation. It will help beneficiaries by ensuring that their entitlement does not become lost. It follows the amalgamation and transfer of tax file numbers with entitlements when the beneficiary leaves the fund. It will facilitate a more efficient use of tax file numbers to avoid the top rate of tax automatically applying to beneficiaries on the grounds that they quoted their tax file number for a superannuation purpose and not for a taxation purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot say that I am altogether content with the extension of the tax file number in this area. There is always a concern in the community about the extension of supervision or surveillance by tax and other authorities. I am not convinced the Commissioner for Insurance and Superannuation has exercised his judgment to the best degree possible as to the way in which tax file numbers can be used or the way in which small accounts or multiple accounts can be best managed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia today we have many small accounts that should be consolidated. This government is working towards the consolidation of those small accounts but&mdash;particularly in industries where there is a lot of casual employment, transient employment, such as in some of the agricultural industries and building industries&mdash;it is very difficult to keep track of the number of small accounts. The prospect of consolidation by using the tax file number has a number of attractions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that changes to superannuation laws themselves would be an effective way of allowing the consolidation of these small amounts. Instead of going into the surveillance process of a tax file number, which brings a new technological factor of being able with computers to comb the accounts and policies of a large number of superannuation payment makers, we ought to be able to allow the consolidation of the contributions from people who have had amounts paid into accounts on their behalf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of those people who have made contributions would not know how much had been paid in on their behalf or to which accounts or to which companies those funds had been paid. I would have thought that is a matter for the industry to straighten out, particularly the commissioner. This seems to me to be an easy answer for the commissioner to take. I know that in other areas there has been some criticism of the lack of forward thought and movement on the part of the commissioner, and I would like to see perhaps a more dynamic and a better focused attention to some of the needs that are there in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, this legislation does extend that tax file number capacity to the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. I will be watching the way in which that tax file number is used. It will be interesting to see if the full provision of the privacy legislation is observed and whether the use of data matching and other material is allowed to go ahead without proper advice to those concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an extension of, in some instances, government surveillance into private organisations. I would want to know that those private organisations&mdash;the insurance funds themselves <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3551"> and the superannuation bodies&mdash;have in place proper measures for privacy to protect the wellbeing of their members and policy holders. I will be looking forward to comments later on that there will be an application of proper privacy provisions to cover the use of tax file numbers by private organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Offshore banking units are a provision of this legislation. They will provide fund management activities for non-residents to invest in Australian assets. The 10 per cent limit by value will be set on the Australian asset component of each investment portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area of interest that I have been referring to is pooled superannuation trusts. This provision will allow complying superannuation funds and complying approved deposit funds to claim deductions for expenses relating to investments in pooled superannuation trusts and life insurance policies issued by life assurance companies or registered organisations. That is a step in the right direction and one that must be applauded by the House at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude my remarks by stating once more that the changes to taxation are changes in the direction that this government wants to go. We have seen a budget that is strong and fair, and this is the way in which the coalition as a government will operate in the taxation area. It is quite different from the way in which the Labor Party manipulated and adjusted taxation to wring dry the productive sector of our community. What we need is an efficient, dynamic private enterprise sector, and the changes in the budget&mdash;to capital gains tax, getting rid of red tape, lowering interest rates, improving apprenticeships and scraping unfair dismissal laws&mdash;are part of a total package that comes together for private enterprise, particularly small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes, particularly to the fringe benefits tax, are worthwhile changes and are changes that should be applauded. The other measures in the bill are, to varying degrees, of significance. But, in particular, the pooled superannuation trust will help advance the opportunity for people to be more certain of what their superannuation benefits are after a working life which may cover a multiplicity of industries.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr MILES</EMPHASIS> (Braddon&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (11.50 a.m.)&mdash;A number of people have participated in this debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2). This bill, of course, amends the taxation and superannuation laws in a number of significant respects. As part of the debate, I would like to thank those people who have participated in the debate. I understand that more discussion will take place in the consideration in detail stage, so we will look at those details as they arise. During the debate, the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) moved an amendment. We oppose that amendment of course. In that context, comments were made about the general approach of the government in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say again for the record that we came into government and were faced with a massive debt left by the previous government. It is very interesting, when you look into the records of the previous government, to see that over the last 4&half; years when the previous Prime Minister, Mr Keating, was in control he not only did not run balanced budgets but also spent an extra $69 billion over and above that. He actually went and borrowed another $69 billion over and above that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you sit down and calculate that out per man, woman and child in Australia, he ran up over and outside the budget figures around about $400 per man, woman and child&mdash;an extra $69 billion. That is just a massive amount to have been run up by the previous Prime Minister. Maybe it would not have happened if some of the members of the previous government had been able to get to him while he was in the cupboard in the Prime Minister's office, but I guess that is thinking the best of the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This country has a massive problem. One of the great things about the present government's attitude to this is that we know we did not create this problem but we will take the responsibility for fixing it. We will take the responsibility of setting Australia on a more secure future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two or three things in the budget which I think deserve highlighting to the public. The first is the core commitments to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3552"> family, small business and the elderly. There are tremendous initiatives in this particular budget with regard to families. The family tax initiative will deliver tax cuts to families of $200 per year per dependent child from 1 January 1997. Single income families with a young child will get a further one-off tax cut of $500. This initiative will give real assistance to over two million families at a cost of $1 billion over a full year. Putting this into perspective, we are actually giving a tax cut worth $1 billion at the same time as reducing the government's costs by $4 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This change the government has undertaken is a pretty extensive one. The government has not shirked its responsibility. It has the national interest at heart. We are taking responsibility for doing something about the situation. Judging from the headlines in newspapers and so on, and judging from general comments, this government's budget is being perceived within the community as strong, fair and reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only will families receive these tax cuts as already indicated, but a single income family with two young children will also receive an extra $900 tax break. This is an election promise which will be delivered in full, on time and in the budget. We are also delivering on our private health insurance initiative, which will provide families with a $450 incentive to take out private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular legislation does affect small business. Another commitment is being met in the area of fringe benefits tax. We said that we would double the figure of $50 for minor exemptions and raise that to $100. That is what we are doing. Again, we are delivering on a commitment with which we went to the people. Along with that for small business, we are delivering on election commitments to provide capital gains tax rollover relief on the sale of assets of a business or to purchase a like kind business. That is very helpful to the business community and has been very well received. This provides small businesses with a boost of $150 million per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also delivering on our election commitment to provide exemption from capital gains tax where the proceeds of small <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> businesses are used to fund retirement. Again, that is a real boost for people in small business and their families. Self-funded retirees were neglected and forgotten about by the previous government. We are delivering on our election commitment in full in regard to those retirees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All in all, this government has set about the task of redressing the chaos which existed on 2 March in regard to the areas of taxation and the fiscal situation within Australia. We do not accept the amendment which has been moved by the member for Werriwa and we support the bill.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 5, page 99, item 1 (line 6), omit "$100" substitute "$200".</PARA>
<PARA>At the outset I should mention that by way of interjection last night the Chief Government Whip, the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), indicated that he would support this amendment. However, after listening to his speech <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> during the second reading debate this morning, it seems that he has recanted from that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Mitchell may have had a reason for doing that, because last night I did inadvertently say that I had `plucked' the figure of $200 out of the air. Of course that is incorrect. There is a very real logical basis for what I am proposing, and I might convince the House of that by referring to a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A question of balance: The tax treatment of small business</EMPHASIS> issued by the Senate Economics References Committee. The relevant passages are on pages 61 and 62 under the heading `Exemption Threshold'. Section 4.17 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considered that FBT policy and the benefits to revenue from collecting the FBT from the smaller end of the scale should be weighed against the costs incurred by small businesses in preparing and lodging returns relating to small liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA>Section 4.18 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Figures supplied by the ATO and the Treasury reveal that in the year ended 31 March 1994, a total of 71,506 private companies and `other business taxpayers' remitted $696 million in FBT. Just over 20,000 of these taxpayers remitted less than $1,000 each, totalling $10 million, representing 1.42% of revenue collected from this group of taxpayers. Given the extraordinary complexity of the FBT and the very high relative compliance costs associated with their collection from small business, the Committee considers that a threshold exemption should apply to the collection of small amounts. At the least, this threshold should reflect the cost of employing a large accounting firm to prepare an FBT return.</PARA>
<PARA>On the following page, recommendation 4.1 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that small businesses be exempt from annual FBT liabilities of $200 or less.</PARA>
<PARA>The member for Mitchell and other members may be reassured to know that the figure of $200 is not arbitrary&mdash;as are so many figures which appear in legislation in general, and in tax legislation in particular. The fact is that the threshold allowance for these minor benefits should be increased from $50 to $200, not to $100 as the government proposes. That will be in line with the recommendation of the Senate Economics References <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3554"> Committee, which reported on this matter last year and whose report I have cited from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The $100 amount advocated by the government is arbitrary and inadequate. The figure of $200 that I propose has a very sound basis, in that it is associated with the cost of complying with the fringe benefits tax and will be of at least equal value to the amount of tax remitted. In other words, the coalition in opposition were very, very critical of the cost of collecting tax and the cost of complying with tax law. The figure proposed by the government is $100, and the cost of collection will arguably be greater than the tax which is collected. Even if that is not the case, the cost of compliance is obviously far in excess of the liability. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not too often in the House that we find an inkling of tripartisanship on a matter of such critical importance for small business. The Independent member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) has moved an amendment for the $200 exemption for small matters on the FBT. The Labor Party is pleased to support that amendment and, just yesterday, we had an indication from the government&mdash;from no less a government member than the Chief Government Whip, the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman)&mdash;that they too would be supporting the $200 FBT exemption.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the parliamentary debate yesterday, the member for Curtin was quoting from the Senate Economics References Committee report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A question of balance: The tax treatment of small business</EMPHASIS>. He was quoting from that report when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the extraordinary complexity of the FBT, and the very high relative compliance costs associated with their collection from small business, the committee considers that a threshold exemption should apply to the collection of small amounts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the least, this threshold should reflect the cost of employing a large accounting firm to prepare an FBT return.</PARA>
<PARA>The member for Curtin continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee then proceeded to recommend:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that small businesses be exempt from annual FBT liabilities of $200 or less.</PARA>
<PARA>The member for Curtin then asked the House, `What could be more reasonable?' and the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> member for Mitchell interjected, `That's right'&mdash;meaning, `That's right; $200 is the amount we should have in this legislation for the FBT exemption.' What an indication from no less a government powerbroker than the Chief Government Whip. The Chief Government Whip, recorded so accurately by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  in the parliamentary debates, was showing his support for the amendment now put to the House by the member for Curtin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite gratifying, and I am sure small business people around Australia who are listening to these debates would be pleased, that tripartisanship has broken out so effectively and so comprehensively in the House of Representatives. This amendment is supported by the Labor Party. It has been moved by the Independent member for Curtin, and the Chief Government Whip in parliamentary debate just yesterday declared his support for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only one thing, of course, can spoil this for small business, and that is a power struggle between the Chief Government Whip and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) as to what the government should do on this particular amendment. They should support it. It is a very important test of their support for small business. Turn all this rhetoric about small business into reality. Turn all this rhetoric about coalition support for the small business sector into effective public policy. Support the report of the Senate Economic References Committee. It had a number of coalition senators on it, of course. Support the amendment which has now been moved by the member for Curtin. Support the indication yesterday from the member for Mitchell. That is right&mdash;$200 should be the amount in this legislation. Turn your rhetoric into reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government is serious about helping small business, then it will certainly vote for this particular provision. It should try to lower the compliance costs that small business faces in the collection of FBT. The coalition has a big test before it. It does not mind helping big business when it comes to the tax concessions infrastructure bonds on tollways. It does not mind helping the Treasurer's mates in Collins Street, Melbourne. It does not mind helping the big construction and finance companies on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3555"> tollways to the tune of $500 per annum. How about helping small business with FBT exemption?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are touchy&hyphen;touchy this morning. They might not be supporting the member for Mitchell. What will the Chief Government Whip think? Is the parliamentary secretary indicating that it should not be $200, as the member for Mitchell so bravely declared yesterday?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing which is interesting about this of course is that, although the government have spoken of their election commitment&mdash;and it has been included in the budget delivered just two days ago&mdash;when one goes to section 4(7) of the budget papers and looks at the revenue measure for minor benefits for fringe benefits tax there is an asterisk. No dollar amount has been entered in the budget papers to fund this particular policy. Having in the government's own budget not been able to estimate the cost to revenue, they cannot say that $200 is so much worse than $100. If there is no cost to revenue that can be quantified by going from $50 to $100, then you cannot say that the provision put forward by the member for Curtin is going to cost too much on the Commonwealth budget. You cannot quantify the $100 exemption, surely $200 cannot be too bad, so there is no reason to oppose it. It is inexpensive and it has got the bipartisan support of the Labor Party, the Independents and the Liberal member for Mitchell. It is a good provision. Let us vote for it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Any amount less than the $200 I have proposed would result in small business remitting less FBT to the Commonwealth government than the cost of complying with the legislation. It is as simple as that. If the government is really serious about tackling the excessive costs imposed on small businesses&mdash;in this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> case in complying with FBT law&mdash;then the increasing minimum threshold of $200 is at least a good start.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be very surprised if it does not get through the Senate anyway. We might as well do the right thing here and show the House to be the legislative chamber&mdash;the place where government is formed&mdash;that it really is. There were coalition members on that Senate committee and there were Labor party members on that committee. If a coalition senator does not move the amendment, someone from the Labor Party will. I would be very surprised if that does not happen. The argument is almost unassailable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as I know, the report was accepted and endorsed by the Senate. It would be very strange behaviour in that august body if they did not actually move the amendment there. It will come back to us, and you know damn well you will accept it when it does. You might as well do it here. Get it over and done with and we can get on with the rest of the bill.</PARA>

<PARA>After that division, no wonder small business is growing disenchanted with the Howard government. No wonder small business is shifting its support away from a government whose members have come in and voted against the $200 exemption on FBT. There has been all this talk about helping with compliance costs and helping small business. But when it comes to a vote they would not support a $200 exemption. It is no wonder that just one week ago there was a headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  entitled `Small business disenchanted with Howard'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Howard Government's honeymoon with small business has come to an abrupt end, with a new survey revealing the sector is deeply disappointed with the Government and its failure to deliver on election promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The latest Yellow Pages Small Business Index, released yesterday, also shows small firms are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3557"> rapidly losing confidence in the Government's ability to deliver an improved economy . . . </PARA>
<PARA>How much more disenchanted will they be now that the government has chosen to vote down an amendment to lift the exemption on FBT for small items to just $200? How disenchanted will they be now that this government has failed to take a positive initiative on compliance costs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another test for the government would be to support my amendment&mdash;which does not involve $200; it involves the $100 that is in the legislation&mdash;and have the amount indexed against the CPI. Surely the government could not possibly oppose the proposition that we have a $100 exemption for 1996-97, and then for the following financial year $100 plus CPI. Surely that is a sound proposition for this government, even by its low standards of support for small business. If they were serious and sincere in their support for small business, they would be endorsing this proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are now asking the House to take the government's commitment in the legislation&mdash;the $100 exemption&mdash;and index it against movements in inflation so that small business is not trapped in a situation where under this government the $100 stays frozen over time. We do not want small business, with those compliance costs, to be trapped with $100 when inflation is moving forward past 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a fair thing for the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and for this government to index the provision in the legislation. That is the text of my amendment. Not only is it fair but it is so inexpensive. It is so cheap to the Commonwealth budget, yet so important to small business. It is so inexpensive for this government to do, yet so significant for small business to have the concession that the $100 will move forward as inflation moves forward in the out years of the budget. We know it is cheap. Again, I refer to page 4.7 of Budget Paper No. 1. They cannot even quantify the cost of going from $50 to $100 on the exemption for FBT. The Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister, the member for Braddon (Mr Miles), cannot even quantify it. You have put the asterisk in that says it <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cannot even be quantified. It is that inexpensive to this miserly government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You must, by any standard of fairness and equity, support the idea of indexation&mdash;just to kick it up year by year so that small business gets that concession on their compliance costs and their exemption on FBT. This is inexpensive, yet significant&mdash;cheap but worthy. That is the importance of this amendment. They would not support the $200. I am sure the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) shares my disappointment to that effect. What he said was good value; it made good sense. It had been recommended by the Senate. We thought we were on a winner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Chief Government Whip, the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), endorsed the proposal yesterday. He said it was a very desirable proposition&mdash;so desirable that he voted against it in the division. I will be the first one up to the Hills Chamber of Commerce monthly meeting in September to really let them know what sort of member they have in this place. The member for Mitchell says one day that the $200 exemption is desirable and votes against it the next. Small business in the electorate of Mitchell has been sold out by the Chief Government Whip. I would suggest that they have been sold out by just about every government member in this place&mdash;from the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave), who would not vote for the $200 exemption, to the member for Braddon and any another government member. They are all on the public record, all recording their votes in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, voting down the $200. Do not do it on the indexation. Do not vote down the indexation. Do one small yet significant thing off this legislation for small business. Have a heart! How about backing up the rhetoric that you put forward for small business and doing something positive by way of supporting the Labor Party amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr MILES</EMPHASIS> (Braddon&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (12.35 p.m.)&mdash;I hope that the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) will actually back up his rhetoric and be serious and sincere. I suggest to him that next time he might like to stand as a Labor candidate in the electorate of Mitchell. I think that would be an excellent <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3558"> idea for the member for Werriwa. Let us see whether he is really serious and sincere about this issue. He has given the challenge to the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). Maybe we should suggest that he tests it out in the electorate of Mitchell to see whether he is really serious about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us come back to the issue at heart. Here we have the member for Werriwa, a member of the previous government. What was the minor benefit level when Labor was in government? It was $50. He comes in here asking us to do all sorts of other little fiddly bits at the edges, putting in an amendment, when they are saying that we ought to be serious and sincere. We are. We made a promise to the Australian people that we would double the benefit. That is exactly what we are doing here this morning&mdash;bringing in legislation at the first opportunity we have to meet a commitment and double what the previous government set down. We are being sincere and serious about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are delivering on a promise. We have certainly done more in this area than the previous government did, of which the member for Werriwa was a member. We are doing far more than the previous government ever did. Now they are coming in here and trying to complain about little things at the edges of this legislation. We are doing a lot of things for small business. We are opposed to this amendment, and we support the original position.</PARA></SPEECH>

Small business around Australia really should be seeing the con in this. This is an absolute con, as was your policy on the uplift factor on provisional tax. That was frozen for one year only and now you are doing it on the FBT exemption. What you are basically saying is, `We had a policy of $100 but, as inflation moves forward, our policy is frozen by 1996&hyphen;97 dollars.' That is the absolute shame in this.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business around the country should understand this government's hypocrisy; they should understand this government's double standards. In the government's own budget papers, this measure that I am suggesting costs next to nothing&mdash;absolutely so small for outlays and the Commonwealth budget but so significant for small business. Of course, the double standard is that, if they were a big business or one of the mates of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) from Collins Street, Melbourne, they would be in for a big slice of government business welfare; they would be in for a slice of government subsidies. We saw that with the $50 million subsidy that this government is paying to big tollway companies, big banks, big construction companies&mdash;$50 million of benefit on those tollways. Yet for small business, on a measure that is so inexpensive, you won't even give them a cracker. You won't pay a cracker of cross&hyphen;indexation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have several matters of a technical nature on which I seek clarification from the government. I will try to keep the technicalities to a bare minimum. That might be facilitated by the fact that the government is served by a full complement of advisers in the advisers box. So I hope an absence of detail will not make it too difficult for these proceedings to go forth. But if the government should require me to go into more detail on any point in order to form a response, I would be happy to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first matter I wish to raise concerns part 2 of schedule 1, which deals with superannuation amendments. These amendments do not go far enough. We have in existence income tax ruling TR93&hyphen;17, where the Australian Taxation Office, the ATO, details acceptable methods for apportioning expenditure where a superannuation approved deposit fund, which I will refer to as an ADF, or a pooled superannuation trust, a PST, derives assessable and exempt income. Paragraph (8) of that ruling specifies the amounts involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matters I want clarification on are criticisms coming in two broad parts. First, it is argued that the amounts received on the disposal of units in PSTs cannot be exempt from income because they are not income. The definition of `income' in section 6(1) of the act requires an amount to be income before it is exempt income. The second major criticism of that ruling is that the concept of PSTs was to provide an investment vehicle for eligible funds to pool their investment and that the utilisation of PSTs should not be disadvantaged from a tax point of view <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> against direct investment. Under direct investment I understand the income is taxed at 15 per cent. That occurs when invested through a PST. But there is no need to apportion expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments do not go far enough in that there will be an inequitable result in that complying superannuation funds and complying ADFs that invest in policies will not need to apportion their expenses, whereas PSTs that invest in other PSTs or life policies will. That is clearly inequitable. What adds to my concern is that I understand the Australian Taxation Office submitted amendments which would quell my concerns and answer those criticisms but that the Treasury somehow put the kybosh on it. So the provisions are not going to being extended to apply to all entities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The end result is that in limiting the amendment to investments by superannuation funds and ADFs, the effect will be to discourage PSTs from investing in other PSTs. That is despite the fact that PSTs are authorised to invest in that way by regulation 1.045 of the superannuation industry supervision regulations. So we have the strange situation where the Australian Taxation Office has acknowledged that allowing PSTs to invest in others does not cause a loss to the revenue because the 15 per cent tax on income would still be paid by the latter PST. Yet it is overridden by Treasury. (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Extension of time granted</EMPHASIS>).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles). I might add that before we resumed this debate the parliamentary secretary clearly knew that I had other matters to raise and that your predecessor in the chair was being a bit tough, Mr Deputy Speaker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer also to schedule 2, on another matter entirely. It deals with debt release rules. In the first instance I want to make the point that in the explanatory memorandum the compliance interest statement for the forgiveness of commercial debt is made up of 14 lines of text. There are absolutely no figures mentioned. Quite frankly, the compliance cost impact statement for this measure is a piece of nebulous mumbo jumbo.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3561">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time for whoever is responsible to treat these statements not as a sop to professionals but as a real indication of the cost of compliance. Of course, if that is to be done, amounts in dollars and cents are essential. Having said that, I simply want to get onto this matter of probable anomalous tax consequences, where debts have a reduced cost base under provisions such as in sections 160ZP, 160ZZRE, 160ZZRF, and probably others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are certain elements of the debt release rules which are anomalous in their present drafted form. If these are not remedied, or if this bill is enacted as now proposed, the integrity of the tax system will be brought into question and further disrepute and, in particular, the processes adopted in policy making will become very questionable indeed. I want to add in this context that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) acknowledged in an answer to a question without notice that it was his government which was making tax policy. That is relevant to something which I might say later on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My main concerns revolve around the interaction between the debt release rules and the cost base reduction rules for capital gains tax. Without going into chapter and verse, those concerns have been raised, as I understand it, with the debt release rules drafting team. They will be well aware of them. I believe they understand the concerns I am touching upon. It seems to me that their reason for not doing something about them&mdash;and I am quoting someone else who believes this to be the case&mdash;is that that is what the government wants them to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Treasurer is sincere about government policy, he will want to look at that. If he has inherited something from the previous government and the debt release rules drafting team is doing what the government wants it to do, it might very well be doing what the previous government wanted it to do. In any event, it seems to me that it is wrong. It has been submitted to me that the anomalies in the debt release rules are so grossly defective and inequitable that they should not be endorsed by any government, particularly a government which was elected on the platform of looking after the interests of all Australians, especially <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those in small businesses. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One approach to a possible solution to overcome the anomalies with the debt release rules would be to allow company groups the option of electing out of the rules, where the debt which is written off is worthless and the company forgiving the debt either actually incurs a prima facie capital loss or other deduction on forgiving the debt&mdash;as is currently proposed in section 245&hyphen;90&mdash;or would otherwise incur a capital loss on forgiving the debt, were it not for the earlier application of one or more cost base reduction provisions such as sections 160ZP, 160ZZRE and 160ZZRF; that is, where there is a notional capital loss. If the parliamentary secretary is in a position to respond, I will pause there.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition supports this legislation. It is, indeed, a very extreme variation of a series of private members' bills that the then opposition introduced in the past few parliaments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the surface, the Flags Amendment Bill 1996 simply attempts to allow the Australian people a say in any process that might lead to a change of the Australian flag. Obviously that cannot be opposed. However, while supporting the legislation, the opposition has some concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been some indications that the drafting of this legislation leads to questions of validity. Whilst it is highly improbable that anyone would seek to tackle it, the point has been made to the opposition that, essentially, there is an attempt to construct a different legislative power than under section 1 of the constitution by the inclusion of the Australian people over and above the parliament, the Queen and the Senate, and that this legislation purports to set up an additional body in legislative processes.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3563">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not go through the point at length because there have to be grave doubts that anyone would take it up. However, it has been suggested by some constitutional lawyers that a preferable course might have been to provide a section indicating that neither house could debate the bill unless the flag change were approved by the people under the provisions of section 49 regarding the powers, privileges and immunities of the Senate and the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another matter about which the opposition has some concern at the outset is, I think, a matter of clarification rather than any great difficulty. Unfortunately, the problem has been exacerbated by the wording of the explanatory memorandum. I appreciate that, in his speech to the Samuel Griffith Society and in his introduction speech, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) put the matter quite clearly. But the explanatory memorandum could imply an intention that votes by each state separately would have some importance in this. The wording of the explanatory memorandum is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . has been submitted to the electors in each state and territory and a majority have approved the change.</PARA>
<PARA>We may add to that the wording of the provision we have here:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a new flag or flags, and the flag referred to in subsection (1), are submitted in each State and Territory to the electors . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) will develop this point later, perhaps suggesting to the minister that there could be some movement of a phrase there to clarify the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do appreciate that he has indicated at a number of points that this is not a matter for states rights and is not a matter for individual state consideration but is a matter for a simple majority. But, as I have said, on the wording of the explanatory memorandum and the bill itself, there could be some doubts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition can support this legislation because it does indeed represent a significant movement from the position that a number of private members' bills tried to accomplish in previous parliaments. If we take the example of the 1984 Flags Amendment Bill, its movers were at pains to effect a change from a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proclamation of flag changes to a regulation which could be reviewed by the parliament, due to a belief that the government of the time might be able to undermine the current flag by the process of having a proclamation of other flags. It purported to specifically prohibit such action and stop the government from advising the Governor&hyphen;General to make these proclamations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That bill also, as did a number of the opposition members' private bills during that phase, suggested a referendum. If you look through the history of those debates, the history of those bills, some of which were passed by the Senate, the referendum as such was a fairly consistent theme early on. That is why in the 1991 debate the then parliamentary secretary who handled this matter was at pains to indicate to the opposition that requiring a referendum process put an extreme bar in this area. It is interesting to note that in the Samuel Griffith Society speech made by the minister, which has been so vigorously assailed by his friend John Stone, he did make the point, as the previous government did, that there were some dangers in the referendum process. We know that a very small number of referenda have been carried in this country and that there is always the possibility of confused debates about these matters when extraneous issues are dragged into them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we are saying is that the opposition can be far more comfortable with this suggestion than those previous endeavours. We are quite aware that some of those did succeed in the Senate. While some speakers on the other side might lament the attitude of the previous government in not supporting these measures, we should put in context, firstly, the extreme change in what was being suggested, and also the political realities of private members' legislative attempts in this country. If we look through the period 1949 to 1972, for instance, we find that the then opposition and even the then government's private members, such as Mr Wentworth, were quite unsuccessful in persuading the government; I think in that period of time only two bills were passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3564"> Whilst we support the legislation, indicating to the government that we have some con cerns with minor aspects of it, we do at the same time have some concerns with the motivation behind this legislation as far as it affects some government members. I, for one, will not for a moment quibble at many of the speeches that have accompanied these bills during the last decade or so. I might not agree with the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) when he on occasions stated that Australian democracy would collapse if the flag were changed. For instance, on 10 September 1984 he said that he would support and request support of the parliament for the retention of the present design. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is of great concern to me that various sections of the community see this great tradition, the Australian flag, as something to be changed. I am deeply concerned, because in my view the history of attacks on such traditions are always seen as a development in the process towards installation of a totalitarian regime.</PARA>
<PARA>We do understand that many members respect tradition in this country, our connection with the United Kingdom, what it has given us in regards to our court system and our public service traditions and the heritage of large numbers of the Australian population. We do not for one moment decry that aspect. And we appreciate the views expressed by many of those opposite such as the then member for Maranoa who commented in June of 1984 that he treasured and honoured the symbol; that thousands of Australians have fought and many have sacrificed their lives under the flag. That is a legitimate view by people in the Australian electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we do have some concerns about some of the accompanying rhetoric in this area. The most noticeable was from the transitory leader of opposition, Mr Downer, who, on 16 June 1994, said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be a simple choice. A vote for me is a vote for the Australian flag. A vote for Mr Keating is a vote to rip it up.</PARA>
<PARA>If I were not as kind as I am, I might refer to Dr Johnson's comment about patriotism's being the last recourse of scoundrels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that perhaps the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) put Mr Downer's comments in a better context when he responded to Carol Foley, the author of a very <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> worthwhile publication in regard to the history of our flag. Mr Howard stated, in correspondence to her on 5 April 1995, that he thought there were `more substantial issues of greater practical importance to the Australian people'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have got to say that I was not impressed that Anzac Day was used to try and have a fairly partisan division over this matter by, once again, associating one political party with patriotism, truth and the Australian way, and trying to construe those opposite as in some ways undermining that. But, in general, I respect very much the attitudes of the majority of members opposite. They do have the thought or feeling that, in the more extreme sense, there will be great changes to society and there will be great effects upon our democratic institutions caused by the change. I say in passing that changes of flags have not affected Trinidad, Canada or Botswana. They are still democratic nations within the British Commonwealth of Nations. Despite that, it is a legitimate view that is held by some opposite. Others, as I have said, place an emphasis on our heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we do have reservations about some of the more partisan comments made about this matter. On occasion, there was a constant stream of rather bizarre amendments around this area moved by private members opposite, despite reassurances by the then Prime Minister that whilst he personally favoured change&mdash;and he said this on many occasions; the quotes could be brought out&mdash;in reality there could be no movement without substantial change in the views of the Australian public. So any attempt over this past decade to try and say that one party in our system would change such an important national institution without reference to the Australian people is, in fact, a fairly divisive and unnecessary attempt to dirty the waters around this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has to be said that the opposition does recognise some very obvious political realities. As early as 1992, 80 per cent of the Australian people indicated that there should be no change without a referendum. It has also got to be said, at the same time, that there has been a very changing view in regard <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3565"> to the level of support in the Australian electorate for the flag. The reality is that the most recent poll has taken support for the current flag up to 1985 levels, after a period of a drift towards hope for change. In the current environment&mdash;it is worth being honest about it&mdash;support for the current symbol is extremely strong amongst young people and the elderly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might just refer briefly to some of the trends in the polls. I think that the government and the opposition have to be aware of this: the commitment or the opposition to it, or the wish for change or the wish for maintenance, are not in a constant mathematical situation. There have been significant fluctuations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the Morgan poll of 1967, 72 per cent of people wanted to retain the Union Jack. By 1992, that was down to 57 per cent. The McNair polls show the support for change growing from a 1984 level of 34 per cent to a 1995 level of 50 per cent. The Saulwick polls showed by 1994 a 61 to 35 divider. The most recent poll this year shows that 66 per cent, when they are asked the first question, do not want any change and 27 per cent do, but there are variations. People say they do not want change, but when they are asked whether they want the Union Jack in the flag, the level of support goes down to 54 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the one hand, there is understandable support in the Australian electorate for people to be consulted on this matter. On the other hand, we should be aware that this flag is, if we are honest about it, more questioned than many flags around the world. We should be sincere in asking ourselves why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another concern of the opposition is that, whilst the bill cements the idea of a plebiscite, with people being consulted in a manner similar to the consultation on the change to the national anthem, one of the weaknesses of the bill is that it does not set out any long&hyphen;term process for the consideration of change. For practical purposes this bill is set in concrete, but it has been pointed out that, since the government did not double entrench it then, in theory, it is not quite what it is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cracked up to be in so far as, theoretically, a new government can alter it at any stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As organisations such as Ausflag have suggested, there is no consideration for the allocation of money for surveys or for looking at alternative designs or any of that kind of process. I note that the long&hyphen;term process is left in the hands of parliament. I commend that. The government has not, early in the continuing debate about this, set things so that they cannot be varied. However, the opposition would have preferred that, whilst ensuring participation of the electorate in the process, there had been some attempt to formulate a wider consideration of how change can be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also worth putting in context some of the realities rather than the political polemics of this matter. We are told that the absolute be&hyphen;all and end&hyphen;all is that this had to happen. It is quite interesting that the conservative forces in this country saw nothing wrong when the Northern Territory chose a flag. They saw nothing wrong with the Chief Minister going along to Mr Ingpen and saying, `Why do you not draw up a flag for us?' which, in due course, he proceeded to do. That was simply put through the parliament of the Northern Territory with no consideration of the desires of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, if you look at the history of this flag in Foley's books and in other publications, in reality the Australian people have never been consulted on the flag by conservative or Labor governments. The reality was that early this century&mdash;and I question whether this is very democratic&mdash;there was a stipulation in the requirements that the Union Jack had to be part of the final design. So, once again, we had a proclamation from the United Kingdom. I will just go back to that point about the Union Jack. There was a provision that said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The flag should be based on the British ensign, as the flags of the countries added to its folds, signalling to the beholder that it is an imperial union ensign of the British Empire.</PARA>
<PARA>A contest was held and prizes were given. One of the successful entrants was a New Zealander, but the main point I am trying to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3566"> make is that we should not kid ourselves that where we have come to today was achieved through consultation with the Australian people and that this is a continuing trend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the Northern Territory flag is a testimony to that, because there was no consultation there. There was no consultation about the Australian flag. As we read the history of it, it is interesting to note that in actual fact it was only in 1953 that the then Menzies government actually put it through parliament. It is worth noting that throughout that period, whilst the blue ensign might have been the predominant flag, there were situations where the red ensign and the Union Jack were utilised, with the Union Jack being on Australian forts until 1908, long after we supposedly had this Australian flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also worth noting when talking about politicising this&mdash;as a minority of people on the other side do&mdash;that it was a Chifley government that promulgated the priority of the blue ensign to make sure that it was treated with more respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that as late as the 1920s it was regarded by some as disloyal to give preference to the Australian flag above the Union Jack. There is an account in Foley's book of a St Patrick's Day parade in Melbourne where loyalists were criticising the fact that people were carrying only the Australian flag and not the Union Jack at the same time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history is a bit more complex than some of the speakers on previous occasions have made out. People fought under a variety of flags for this country; that is not in any way to denigrate the current flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another point that we would make arises from another drafting problem. Once again it might seem more theoretical than practical but the current wording would, as Ausflag has pointed out, require a referendum to take account of very minimal changes to the Australian political system or the UK political system. There is no provision for making minor variations to the flag. Any changes must go to a plebiscite or to a vote of the Australian people. One of the instances that has been given is the question of the Northern <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Territory's future; the current number of points in the stars is related to the territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a real question of whether we can vary the flag without going to a referendum, the current cost of which is $52 million. Can we change it for this simple provision without having a referendum? I think the Australian people, even those who believe that fundamental changes to our symbol should occasion their consultation, might question whether it might not have been a bit smarter for the government to include a provision to avoid this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly&mdash;this might seem very distant&mdash;with recent events in Belfast and Londonderry; but who knows what is going to happen to the United Kingdom? Who knows the future of Ulster? Who knows whether the British flag itself might have to be modified in the next few decades? Once again, if we look at history, we should not pretend that that flag has been constant. The cross of St Patrick came in in the early 19th century and varied that flag. That is a matter for concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, we might have hoped that the government would take the opportunity to look at section 8 of the act. We saw the results of that in the Queensland parliament where the speaker chose essentially to fly the Union Jack with an equal status to the Australian flag. I have to say that that measure was regarded as so off the beam that the Leader of the National Party, Mr Fischer, chose to admonish the Queensland government over the decision. The current act states that in no way should the importance of the Australian flag undermine people's rights to fly the Union Jack. We have one flag of one nation around the world brought out for special rights within an independent Australian nation. One has to question, `Really, in 1996 what is the sense of that?' As I say, it is perhaps something that should have been looked at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a broad sense, the opposition welcomes the legislation. It is supportive of consultation with the people. Essentially, this is what the previous government undertook to do. There was always an insistence that change would have to be made in consultation with the people. At the same time we say that there <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3567"> should have been efforts made at this stage&mdash;and let us hope that they are made in the future&mdash;to ensure that minor changes can be made without the expense of a referendum. I think one thing we all know is that, if you look at all the polling, the question of the Olympic Games seems to engender more support for change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When people are asked whether they support this flag, whether they want change, obviously at the current stage there are very high levels of support&mdash;higher than for the past few years. But when they are asked, `Do you think we can get an appropriate new design, do you think that we can get a symbol which is recognised by the majority of people as being symbolic of our culture, our history, our nature?', they are more inclined to say, `Yes, there should be change.' The year 2000 is only three years away and this should be a consideration. So, as I say, the opposition would have liked a bit more emphasis on where things might go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I want to come back to the view that changing the flag in some way destroys basic institutions, destroys democracy and destroys parliamentary voting and elections. I referred earlier to the Commonwealth of Nations. I mentioned a few countries that are very clearly parliamentary democracies to this day that have not essentially lost their freedoms because they adopted a symbol that was more appropriate to their own history. There are others that have, of course, moved away from democratic procedures. Ghana chose to change its flag to the Pan African colours of green, yellow and red; Grenada put a pot of nutmeg on its flag because it was symbolic of its main produce and it had the seven stars of its parishes; India's colours relate to courage, truth and faith; and Kenya put a shield on its flag with the previous political flag of the major political party, KANU. Are these things fundamentally related to their descent from democracy, their movement in some cases towards totalitarian or one&hyphen;party states or towards a corrupt public service? It seems to me that they changed their flags to ones more in accordance with their nature and their history and that their relationship with democracy had more to do <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with the nature of their economies, their socio&hyphen;economic patterns and the international pressures they faced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, if we look around the world, are these people lesser members of the Commonwealth of Nations because they have a different flag, because they, unlike us and New Zealand, do not include the Union Jack? Quite frankly, it is a very big attack upon the Commonwealth of Nations and what its purpose is in maintaining that connection with the United Kingdom and our history to say that they are any the less partners in that process because they change flags.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look around the world to the colonies of other countries, in French Africa I cannot see much connection between any of the flags there&mdash;whether it be Niger, Mali, the Ivory Coast or wherever&mdash;and French heritage. But that is not to ignore the reality that the Francophone union is a very strong institution; that France continues to play a big role&mdash;perhaps too big a role&mdash;in the internal affairs of those countries; that French culture is encouraged; and that the French government finances the encouragement of the French language there to this day. If we go to South America, Surinam's flag has no connection with the Netherlands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should not draw too many conclusions about the consequences of changing flags. The opposition certainly strongly supports the idea that this should not be decided by parliamentarians, it should not be decided by the ministry, it should not be decided by a few experts or a few lawyers&mdash;there should be reference to the Australian people. It is a crucial national symbol and the opposition supports the measure.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this Flags Amendment Bill 1996, and in doing so I suspect I will make some remarks which are provocative, at least to some members of the opposition and possibly even to the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill seeks to entrench the Australian flag as being one of the people, for the people, by requiring any proposal to change the flag and the new possibilities to be submitted in each state and territory to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3568"> electors qualified to vote for the election of members of the House of Representatives. It will also ensure that the new flag, or one of the new flags, is chosen by a majority of all of the electors who are voting. The parliament, under this amendment bill, will prescribe the form and the manner for putting any of those proposals to the people and also any arrangements for adopting a new flag as the Australian national flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government was consigned to the opposition benches for many reasons, but central to them was a perception that the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, had a contemptuous disregard for our history and for those symbols of our national development. Whilst many decent Australians argue for a republic, the republican cause was done immeasurable damage, in my opinion, by a prime minister who eschewed the flag under which our ancestors fought and died, celebrated both achievement and failure, and rallied at times of both excitement and of despair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that in the previous parliament the flag was folded in this chamber to conceal the Union Jack. It was not flown from the prime ministerial car and, in some kind of misguided attempt to renounce our British ancestry, the leadership of the previous government seemed more intent on funding banal new flag design competitions than on addressing the economic malaise that had become so deeply entrenched in the national psyche.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the best and simple summaries of the circumstances under which we have laboured for the last decade or so was a bumper sticker I saw on a car in Melbourne three years ago, and it said, `I don't care which flag I'm unemployed under.' These days, however, we are more concerned about rectifying our parlous economic circumstances and creating a future other than that of long&hyphen;term unemployment and crippling debt than financing competitions to design new flags.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the question: if there is no respect at the top of society for our national institutions, how can we expect it to exist throughout broader society generally? During the recent Olympic Games I stopped in at my electorate office to turn on the television to watch Cathy <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Freeman's race. One of the commentators said afterwards, `How can she carry a flag with that Union Jack on it?' As the member for Reid has just said, there has been a lot of discussion about the apparent need for a new flag by 2000. More recently, of course, we have seen the New South Wales Premier discussing the notion of a new national anthem, which reminds me about the last refuge of rogues, to which the member for Reid referred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For some Australians, understandably, our flag is a visual paradox. Many Australians, however, do not seem to understand what the purpose of a flag is. It is not a notice board to which we attach the latest evidence of the most recent fad that is sweeping the country. It is not a mirror of contemporary change or a statement of what we think our country is likely to be, or to become over the next 20 to 30 years. It is not a mirror reflecting our changing circumstances. Instead, it reflects the historical circumstances and values upon which our heritage is based. It reminds us of where we have been as we look to the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be a brave person who would suggest to the French that they change their flag because it is an outdated irrelevancy. Yet the white band on the French flag represents its monarchy, which has not existed in any real sense since 1870. Equally, I suspect, Bill Clinton and Bob Dole will not campaign in the forthcoming US presidential elections for the removal of those famous red stripes which characterise the American flag. Yet the origin of those stripes is the British Red Ensign, which flew over the American colonies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the exception of a single New Zealander, our flag was designed by Australians. It was chosen by Australians, and change, if change is to occur, must similarly be on the basis of a plebiscite to which this amendment gives effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could not let the opportunity of this debate on this very important bill pass without making some remarks on another dimension which is as important as the configuration of the flag itself. Late in 1994 one of the good things the previous Prime Minister did was to support the Economic Planning Advisory <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3569"> Commission to convene a national strategies conference entitled `Shaping our future'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was intended to give Australians, and young people in particular, the opportunity to reflect on a national vision for Australia. Particularly in the third part of that report, there was a disturbing pessimism and fear of the future among many younger contributors. The relative balance of contributions from young people varied from hope and optimism on the one hand, to pessimism and despair on the other. In reflecting on the contributions of young people, it is clear, not only from these but from my own experiences, that strategic vision for Australia would have a catalytic role to play in generating greater optimism and a sense of purpose and belonging for the next generation. Our flag, as a very potent national symbol, is central to that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many comments made about the problems that young Australians face. But I believe the thematic currency for the problems of a growing minority of young people is our failure as a society to transmit a sense of belonging or meaningful purpose to them. In diminishing the importance of our flag and other potent national symbols and institutions, we are failing to give young Australians a confident perspective on who we are and how we see ourselves fitting into the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said recently in a letter to the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, hope is a fragile thing. It may be that the worst thing that has happened to young Australians over the last decade or so is not the disintegration of families nor the scarcity of jobs, as damaging as those things obviously are, but the fact that we have created a culture in Australia in which they feel that they have nothing other than themselves in which to believe. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirty or 40 years ago, there was a mesh of values in this country. It sounds quaint now, but it was `God, king and country'. They were the things that held this society together. They were the things that, essentially, saw us through the ups and downs of the development of this country. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inevitably, these things change, as they must. But, in a superficial push to promote constitutional change, to marginalise the role of churches and to demean the value of community service and selflessness, along <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with the trivialising of the flag, I think we have not only created a vacuum but also sown the seeds for what might be described as a moral crisis, in a sense. It is deeply rooted in a higher priority that is placed these days on people's rights rather than their responsibilities, and on value over values, and a preoccupation with the here and now rather than a respect for the past and any kind of attempt to plan in a meaningful sense for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is not that young people have not learned our values; it is that they have. In many ways, Australia under the previous government, and under the then Prime Minister in particular, had become an `anything goes' kind of society: a people of cultural aimlessness. I think we are becoming increasingly tethered to a value system that is very much based on materialism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leadership is still best done by example. The member for Reid, in putting the support of the opposition to this amendment bill, was referring constantly to polls. As parliamentarians and as politicians, our job is not just to look at polls. Our job is not just to see what percentage of people in the community support certain propositions or otherwise. At times, it requires us to lead. It is populist stuff to simply grab a poll and say enthusiastically that a certain proportion of the community&mdash;and young people, in particular&mdash;might support a change of the flag or anything else. But there comes a time when you actually have to stand up and lead people to where, in their best interests, they need to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the much more challenging duty for us is to instil in each generation the values, the sacrifices and the aspirations of our ancestors, which made the country what it is. A nation's flag is about generational values&mdash;values transferred from one age and one generation to the next. It reflects where we have been, our historical development and our foundation aspirations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know this sounds rather like a paradox, but problems will rarely be solved by politicians. I think our attempts to change our flag at different times represented, in many cases, nothing other than crude attempts to distract us from the big issues. I also considered them, at times, to be a form of cultural abuse, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3570"> removing from young people the fundamental means for us to define who we are and what we believe. It is only in an environment where there is respect for and confidence in our national symbols and institutions, especially among leaders, that young generations are able to have any chance of developing a positive, confident and optimistic outlook on life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am 38 years of age and I suspect that many people in my generation probably do not care too much about whether we become a republic or not. That is a separate issue, as I said earlier. Perhaps we feel a bit more strongly about the flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall that on 24 April 1993, the day before Anzac Day, I was on a plane from Melbourne to Sydney. I read an article such as I usually do at that time of year, a profile piece of a then 99&hyphen;year&hyphen;old man who had landed on the beaches at Gallipoli. Even with the push for euthanasia he said, `I'm glad I'll be dead soon, because I don't want to be alive when Australia becomes a republic and the flag changes.' That struck me; it was there in the back of my mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">About a week later I turned on ABC television in a Brisbane hotel room and I saw the young persons' program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Attitudes</EMPHASIS>, which was an avant&hyphen;garde approach to youth issues but has subsequently been scrapped. Young people of 17, 18 and 19 years of age were being asked whether they thought Australia should become a republic. They all enthusiastically said yes, we should become one. Then they were asked to name one minister in the then federal government. Only a half could do that, and only a quarter of that half could name a second. Not one of them knew what the Australian constitution was, what it does, who designed it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I watched that I thought, `I've never heard Malcolm Turnbull say that he would rather be dead if we don't have an Australian head of state by the turn of the century. I've never heard anyone say that they would rather be dead if we don't change our flag.' But I do know that there is a generation of Australians for whom what we have means much more than I will ever understand&mdash;people whose sacrifices actually made this country what it <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is and whose efforts, I think, all too often we take for granted. While ever there is still very much a section of our community that feels that way, I feel quite reluctant to embrace change, whether it be for the republic or not and most certainly as far as our flag is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose that, in the same way as our children grow up and leave home, there will be eventually some kind of change in Australia&mdash;hopefully, in my opinion, a superficial one&mdash;which reinforces the independence which we already have and unfortunately take for granted. But I remember that after one of my National Press Club addresses I received a letter from a man who described himself as a monarchist. He said that he agreed that eventually Australia might embrace some kind of constitutional change. He went on to argue that he would die before the flag was changed, and I share that latter sentiment. But, he said, `I just want my views to be respected and heard.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there are people on the opposition benches who are going through the reasons why they are now in opposition&mdash;in my case, I hope they will be there for some time&mdash;I can tell them that one of those reasons, one about which they should not be dismissive, is that people in Australia felt very much that they were not being heard. They felt that, if they did not have a view which was fashionably attached to some of the more avant&hyphen;garde things said by the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, there was no place for them. There needs to be a place for all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come back to the question of young people. If you were a 16&hyphen; or a 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;old person growing up in Australia today&mdash;sure, I am ancient in the views of many of those people&mdash;you would have to ask yourself, `What do we believe as a country?' What are our cultural values? What is our identity? How do you feel when you see someone commentating on the Olympic Games, making unsettling remarks about our flag? What sorts of things do we respect? As I said earlier, if there is no respect at the top of society for our institutions and, most importantly, our most potent national symbol, how can we <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3571"> expect young people and those who are not so young to similarly respect them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment bill places the decision for any changes to our flag firmly in the hands of the Australian people. That is where it rightly belongs. Although, as the honourable member for Reid said, a subsequent government may choose to ignore this bill when enacted, to do so would be considered by most Australians an act for which a significant political price would be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In her excellent book, written in 1996 and entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Australian Flag: Colonial Relic or Contemporary Icon</EMPHASIS>&mdash;to which the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) referred&mdash;Carol Foley says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A national flag is symbolic of the cohesion which exists between those individuals and communities and represents the collective ethic which has developed over time. Thus, we need to take care that we do not lose sight of the essence of the nation in the question to satisfy and recognise particular groups within it.</PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, I realise that some of the remarks I have made are provocative, to some people at least. I certainly understand that the issue of the flag and of this amendment bill in particular are separate issues from that of the republic. I know my friend and colleague from North Sydney, whilst a devout republican, is as committed to the flag as any Australian that I know. Those two issues need to be separated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who, whether it be here or in the community, try to diminish the importance of the flag and the importance of removing politicians from decisions about its future, fiddle not only with the configuration and design of that flag but they very much interfere with the development of the values and ideals of young people. I would like to hear much more from both our Prime Minister&mdash;who already does it a great deal&mdash;and the Leader of the Opposition about respect and admiration for those people and for the nation that stood behind the development of the flag. It should be accorded the respect that it deserves. I cannot emphasise the point enough: if we do not respect it, how can we expect others in society to similarly do so?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the meantime, I remind the honourable member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) that, as we stated in the House, the opposition is supporting the bill before the House. What concerns me is the myths associated with the flag. The honourable member for Bradfield mentioned the book written by Carol Foley. If he was being honest, he would have mentioned that she described very fully some of those myths and how they came about, how they grew because of people's imaginations or because of quotes similar to the ones that the honourable member for Bradfield has cited during the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I have a lot to say on this bill. I find it very cynical of the government to introduce a bill like this in the middle of a budget&mdash;and I will go into greater detail later as to why. This government has just brought down one of the most horrific budgets in living memory, one of the most horrific budgets that this country will ever experience, and yet, all of a sudden&mdash;when people demand that politicians should be fighting for them so that unemployment queues do not get longer; so that HECS funding is looked at; so that health programs are contained&mdash;what do we find in the middle of the debate? The government&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;decides to bring forward the debate on the flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this side of the House we have said time and time again that we will not be opposing the legislation but we certainly will be making some comments not only about the cynicism but also about the manipulation of the public at large in this country. This is an indulgence that I would have thought the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), and certainly his manager of government business in this House, could ill afford at this stage, knowing full well the amount of legislation that is mounting up, and knowing full well that they are going to have great difficulty in even <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3572"> attempting to get part of their legislative program through this House before the time for debate expires.</PARA>

He gives us a debate about the flag or, more specifically, about protecting the flag.</PARA>

The government has said that it will extend the present hostel system to the nursing home sector, and that means that a nursing home can charge an entry contribution if it so desires. But we will put into place measures that protect those who cannot afford to make an entry contribution.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can report that in the last decade the only movements in Australia's ratings were down, and it happened twice under the Labor government. This is a turnaround which is a recognition of the way in which this government is repairing the nation's finances. Standard and Poor's said in its statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The outlook change reflects the substantial fiscal tightening implied by the Commonwealth government's budget statement released yesterday and it is Standard and Poor's expectation that Australia's net public external debt burden could decline markedly if this fiscal stance is maintained medium term.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a government which has already had two falls in the variable home mortgage interest rates and one cut in official interest rates. This is a government which has a competitive financial sector. This is a government delivering benefits to home buyers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can report that at the end of May 10&hyphen;year Treasury bonds were at 8.85 per cent, but over the last five days the average yield was down to 7.95 per cent and yesterday fell to 7.8 per cent. We have lower interest rates, business investment and business optimism. I can report that the margins between Australian and US bonds are declining. Over the last 90 days, the average yield on US 10&hyphen;year bonds were 1.92 per cent below those in Australia. Yesterday, the differential was 1.24 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In electorates, such as the member for Kingston's, this means lower interest rates. It means better opportunities. For home buyers it means relief. I can also report that yesterday Aussie Home Loans cut its fixed interest rates across the board by between 0.5 per cent and 0.75 per cent. The managing director, John Symond, said the budget was `very responsible'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeing an economic climate where a government which had the courage to attack the problems it inherited is relieving Australian home buyers of the interest rate burden, relieving future Australians of their debt burden and giving the Australians of the future hope as a result of its budget repair strategy. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The area of nursing homes is a growing area of concern. It is a growing area of cost, like many others to government.

The Liberal&hyphen;National government of that time decided they needed to encourage the development of high quality child&hyphen;care centres in order to meet the growing demands of the many women who began to enter the job marketplace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Things have changed a great deal since then. Today we have 60 per cent of child care being catered to by the private sector. They do so with very high quality care. In fact, the quality accreditation system is now embraced by the vast majority of child&hyphen;care providers in this country. We have made a commitment to extend the accreditation system into the family day care system and into the outside school hours scheme. But what I want to say about this is that there is a lot of scaremongering going on around this country. Again, it is largely coming from those on the opposite side and it is being driven by them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposition is that, because we have removed the operational subsidy from community based day care in this budget&mdash;that is, a $20 per child per week subsidy&mdash;the fees charged to parents in these centres are going to go up by amounts of anything from $28 to $58, as I heard the shadow minister say yesterday. That is a preposterous and outrageous statement. It has no foundation at all. When you consider that the differential in fees between the private sector centres and the community long day care centres is about $4&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, only $4. That is the average difference. That operational subsidy is not in all cases passed on to the parents. We believe that it is important that all child&hyphen;care providers are working on the same basis in fairness to parents and in fairness to providers. There is no reason why those fees should be raised to those very high levels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the government will introduce this measure on 1 July 1997 with plenty of time to assist community based long day care to restructure. We have allowed a substantial amount of money&mdash;$8.3 million over two <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3583"> years&mdash;to ensure that this transition is managed smoothly and that no child or parent will be disadvantaged in accessing affordable child care. In addition to that, we have made $12.5 million available to look after the needs and acknowledge the additional expense of these centres taking in children with disabilities and children with special needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have not just gone along and ripped away the operational subsidy in a callous way. We have gone in there and done it in a structured and proper way, unlike some of the policies we have seen from the other side, and we have allowed enough money to make sure that that transition can be managed in an orderly way.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

But the Tasmanian Liberal government's own figures, current as at 7 August this year, show that there are still some 12,000 of Tasmania's most needy on the waiting list for general treatment and that waiting periods are up to two years in the north of the state and over 20 months in the south in my own electorate.

It is quite different and no matter how much you try to misrepresent it, you will not get away with it. In fact, I have the exact words of your esteemed former Prime Minister when he announced it as a desperate measure in the dying days of the 1993 election. He announced a boost to funding of $247 million for four years and a target was set of 1.5 million people over four years. The four years is up this financial year; the $247 million has been spent; the target of 1.5 million people <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has been met; this guy over here left us a $8 billion black hole; and that is the end of it.</PARA></TALK.START>

In 12 months as shadow minister for health I did not have one single person say a positive thing about it. I had a litany of complaints about waiting times and problems with it. I make no apology.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the majority report which has been tabled in the Senate today together with a supplementary report and a dissenting report from the Liberal senators. Obviously I was very interested in the development of this Senate committee's deliberations. I do not think there is any doubt that in its majority report the Senate committee was entirely predictable. Also I do not think there is any doubt that the majority report will go down as one of the most forgettable pieces of ALP memorabilia that we have ever seen. In fact, one would have to say it was a circus for the four Labor members on that Senate committee to put together this report, which was basically a joint effort with the ACTU. In fact, so joint an effort was it that Tim Pallas, the assistant secretary of the ACTU, effectively launched their report for them today in a committee room in this very parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no surprise in the fact that there should be such close collaboration on this, given the fact that the four members on the ALP committee spent something like 50 years <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3584"> in the trade union movement between them. So interrelated are the Senate majority Labor committee members and the ACTU that at one point in time one of the Labor members on the committee wrote a submission as a union member and submitted it to himself on the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The farce continues, however, because he was then bumped off the committee for Senator Sherry. Last night I heard Senator Sherry talking about the complaints and concerns that he as a member of the committee had heard from thousands and thousands of workers in terms of the implications of this bill. I was very interested to hear this from Senator Sherry because the committee&mdash;and particularly the Liberal senators&mdash;certainly did the hard yards when it came to going around Australia and hearing what people had to say about this particular bill. Could you say that Senator Sherry had done the hard yards when in fact during the committee hearings he had two weeks in Bali? He was not doing the hard yards; he was doing the soft sand in Bali.

Just to cap off a bad week for the Labor Party, the majority recommends that the bill be scrapped. The Labor Party is totally opposed to the bill. The Democrats&mdash;in very sensible and measured remarks made by Senator Murray on radio this afternoon&mdash;made the point that they would like to see the passage of the bill but of course with some amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of some of the amendments, whilst there are a number of genuine issues to be debated with the Democrats, I do welcome the direction in policy and their approach as generally enunciated by them today on some aspects of the policy.

As soon as this bill gets through the Senate and we scrap your scheme, Laurie, the better.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was also pleased to hear that the Democrats accepted in principle the concept of Australian workplace agreements. Whilst there may be much more to be said about that process on their point, I do at least acknowledge the sense that we have come some way in acknowledging that basic principle. I also welcome the Democrat senator stating unequivocally today that they will support the concept of voluntary unionism, the abolition of compulsory unionism and the abolition of the privilege clauses which you put in to look after your mates. That will be one of the many good features of this legislation. I also welcome the Democrat senator suggesting in his remarks that he sees a simplified award system so that workers can actually understand what awards provide them. I thought that was a sensible point to make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, I particularly welcome the statement of principles from the Democrats and, in particular, the third principle where they said that, in their consideration of our bill, they are intent on securing the government's fulfilment of the promises we made at the last election. I do not think we can ask more of the Democrats than to provide support for us to keep us honest in the passage of this legislation, which so fairly encompasses the promises we made at the last election. In that regard, in respect of sections 45D and E, a key promise was to return those provisions to the Trade Practices Act. It is an important provision for a balanced and fair industrial relations system. We look forward to constructive discussions with the Democrats in the month ahead.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, did you hear the way the question was phrased? He asked what our intentions were in relation to the government co&hyphen;contribution. Did you hear that word `co&hyphen;contribution'? Do you know why he uses the word `co&hyphen;contribution'? Because that was a name given in last year's budget to tax cuts which used to be called l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w. They were put into legislation before the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3588"> 1993 election. They were never paid, and then they turned up for 1998 called `co&hyphen;contribution'. We ought to write a book on this: how l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w turned into c&hyphen;o&hyphen;c&hyphen;o&hyphen;n&hyphen;t&hyphen;r&hyphen;i&hyphen;b&hyphen;u&hyphen;t&hyphen;i&hyphen;o&hyphen;n.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ultimate irony of this is: who is going to pay the l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w tax cuts? The coalition. We are going to fund them and we are going to pay them. These were the tax cuts put into l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w before the 1993 election which were never paid, which were not going to be returned, according to you, until the year 2000, after being legislated in 1992. They are now called `co&hyphen;contribution', which the coalition has to fund and the coalition has to pay, and we put them in the forward estimates. You had never funded them, never paid them. We put them in the forward estimates and, as we said in relation to the budget, they will be paid into superannuation or like savings in an equitable way, consistent with our budget strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important thing for the Labor Party to come to grips with is how far it is going to allow our program of deficit and debt reduction to go through; how far it is going to try to frustrate the government's program to bring down interest rates. Don't think it is compassionate to spend money you don't have. All you were doing was loading bills onto future Australians. This was the most anti&hyphen;child policy imaginable&mdash;to load the debts onto future generations, to take the debt, as you did over the last four years, and treble it, to have Australia on a path of deficit and debt into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you were asked what your policy was in relation to this budget, you said it was to balance the budget over three years. What does the budget do? It balances over three years and it does that by making provision for the co&hyphen;contribution as well. It does it by making provision to allow us to pay it in an equitable way, commencing from 1998 to the year 2000. You have no clothes. You have no basis to stand on. You have no budget strategy. You have no coherent position. This is a rabble of an opposition. You are unable to control your front bench. You are unable to announce a fiscal strategy.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we said in the budget, we may not have created the problem, but we will fix it. We have laid down a strategy. We have a strategy to fix this economy over the next three years. We have good investment figures; we have a good inflation position. We have a strong monetary policy. We now have the opportunity to fix the budget. We have delivered to families. We have given hope to small business. We have protected the aged. We have given health incentives. This is a budget for all Australia. This is a budget which this government is proud of.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. He has had a great interest in roads. The member for Parkes, as other members of this House would have experienced over the last couple of days, has heard claims made by those on the Labor side that the new government has somehow or other massively slashed its federal road funding outlays. Indeed, members would have heard this said a number of times over the last few days. So I thought it might be of some interest to members of the House to ascertain the truth as to these claims made by members of the Labor Party. In order to do it, I will go to the official documents. In the last year of the federal Labor government outlays on roads were $1,569.7 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the federal road outlays in this year's budget launched by the Treasurer on Tuesday night?&mdash;$1,603.5 million. Next year it will be $1,625 million and the year after that $1,656.8 million. Is that a massive slash in road funding outlays by the Commonwealth? No, it is not a massive slash. Even if you take out our commitments to local and state governments in these figures, you will find that this year more money is appropriated to the rest of our road funding commitments than was spent in the last year of a Labor government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3589">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is quite clear from those figures that this coalition government is increasing road funding outlays to serve our road needs around Australia. In addition, it is also worth reminding members of the House that it is this government in its first six months of office that is doing things to fix up the Pacific Highway, unlike the previous Labor government, which had 13 years to get that right. It is this government also that is reintroducing the black spots program, an excellent program that will save lives right across Australia, unlike the Labor government, which axed the black spots program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has also reintroduced infrastructure bonds to enable the private sector to fund roads around Australia such as the eastern distributor in Sydney announced by the New South Wales government only last week. What did the previous government do? The previous Labor government axed infrastructure bonds for roads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So when it comes down to who has a higher priority for roads in Australia, compare the figures, compare the infrastructure bonds, compare the black spots program, compare the Pacific Highway and there is no doubt about it whatsoever&mdash;the new coalition government has a higher priority for roads than the Labor government had in its 13 years.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I ask you a question regarding Budget Paper No. 2. In particular, on page 93 of that document, in the legislation entitled `Supply of Parliamentary Departments Act 1996-97' you will notice that there is an appropriation in schedule 3 that apportions a sum of $24,159,000 for the Senate, whereas there is only $23,198,000 appropriated for the House of Representatives. While I recognise and indeed support a bicameral system in Australia, I think we all need to be conscious of the reply given by the Minister for Industrial Relations a little while ago which suggested that perhaps all those who are members of Senate committees do not necessarily devote all their time and attention to the hard yards but rather to the soft sands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In those circumstances I ask: would it be possible for you to have prepared a chart which would set down in broad categories a rough comparison between the areas of expenditure of this House and the other place having in mind that there are 148 members of the House and only 76 members of the Senate? Could I suggest to you that, as the house of the people, it would be appropriate that at least this chamber receives the same amount of money as the other place in any annual appropriation.</PARA></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a constant cry of conservative governments around the world on budgetary matters that there is no alternative: debt, deficit has to be the priority. Cut, slash, burn, don your hairshirts, There Is No Alternative! Margaret Thatcher used to say it so often in Britain she was called TINA&mdash;There Is No Alternative Thatcher.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not very often, however, that there is no alternative for governments in budgetary situations. You may, from time to time, face a situation of inflation exploding out of control or an unmanageable current account deficit which does require the hairshirt to be donned. But, much more often than not, governments have choices. In making those choices, governments are governed by the values they hold: the ideas they have about <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the proper role of government, the ideas they have about what value and weight you should attach to people's direct and immediate interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our central case against this government's budget strategy is that they had a choice and, in failing to put unemployment reduction first as the highest priority, they made absolutely the wrong choice. The  choice that confronted the government had these elements. First of all, they inherited an economy in fundamentally sound shape&mdash;better than good, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) himself conceded; in the last three years, average growth was four per cent, and that was confirmed in the March quarter this year; inflation averaged 2.5 per cent; and unemployment dropped from 11 per cent to 8.5 per cent. We created 700,000 new jobs and we were well on the way to achieving that medium&hyphen;term figure of five per cent that we set as a target. All the available international comparisons show that we were in good shape in terms of the basic things that budget strategies are all about. Our expenditure was not getting out of hand. We had the third lowest expenditure in the OECD, the industrialised world. Government debt was the fourth lowest in the OECD.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overall budget deficit put us as the third lowest of the 24&hyphen;odd countries measured in the OECD calculation, but there were, of course, two continuing significant problems with the Australian economy. As we frankly acknowledge, there was a big and urgent problem with unemployment&mdash;8&half; per cent or 770,000 Australians were still out of work at last count. There was a medium&hyphen;term problem with the Australian economy: our saving ratio was too low and it needed a contribution both from the public sector and from the private sector to turn that around.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our argument in a nutshell is that, faced with this particular situation, this government should have made unemployment its No. 1 priority. It should have aimed at restoring the budget to balance by a program of moderate measures extending over the full three&hyphen;year life of this parliament. It should have aimed from the start for higher growth. It should have aimed for sustainable growth at around four per cent&mdash;recognising that with higher <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3592"> growth you start each year with a lower budget deficit, so you can get to balance as a result with a fraction of the cuts that would otherwise be the case if there were not that higher growth, and also recognising that with higher growth you get higher employment, which in turn adds directly to national saving through more income, more government revenue and fewer government outlays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, if you put the reduction of unemployment as your first priority, you solve both your continuing national economic problems. If you put the budget deficit first, however, not only do you not solve the unemployment problem&mdash;the biggest single problem in the Australia economy&mdash;but you in fact make it worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has this government done? It has made it worse. It has made the wrong choice. In the first place, it has squandered the economic inheritance that we bequeathed it. The growth that ran at two per cent for the first quarter of this year, the March quarter&mdash;and the figures were released on budget night&mdash;became 0.1 per cent for the June quarter. It flattened right out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even capital investment expectations, about which the Treasurer (Mr Costello) was waxing lyrical today, are relatively lower now on today's figures compared with last year when we left office. It is true that investment expectations are reasonably high, objectively speaking, but before we left office they were 27 per cent higher at that stage last year and now they are just 15 per cent higher. So even capital investment expectations have been moderated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every survey that has been published in the last few weeks shows confidence plummeting in the June quarter. The ACCI&hyphen;Westpac index, the NAB index and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS> business index have all showed confidence flattening right out. The anecdotal evidence that we have all heard amply confirms that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The animal spirits that we were supposed to see in the first few months of this government's existence have failed to emerge from their cages, beating on their chests, in the way it was anticipated. It just has not happened. Why has it not happened? Why has growth flattened out? Why has there been that col lapse in business and consumer confidence? It is because of the legitimate and now realised fear of a contractionary budget and its consequences. The first thing the government did was squander the inheritance in those first few months before the budget. The budget itself has totally reinforced the fear that so many people had, and it was reflected in those confidence figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unemployment is now predicted by this government to remain a flat 8&half; per cent. There is to be a minor increase in employment, bringing it to 8&frac14; per cent next year, but no target is set thereafter. The number of unemployment beneficiaries is expected to number 829,000 this year, and it is expected to remain steady at that level for 1997-98. That is in the budget papers. That is the expectation. That is the policy choice that has been made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Growth is predicted to stay at 3&half; per cent&mdash;3&half; per cent this year down to 3&frac14; per cent the year after then another 3&half; per cent and another 3&half; per cent through to the end of the century. We all know that, unless growth gets up to a sustainable four per cent, you simply cannot drag that unemployment figure below its present levels. It will stay at 8&half; per cent in perpetuity so long as growth is targeted at that level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have, moreover, an acknowledgment by the Treasury boffins on page 2&hyphen;21 of statement No. 1 that confidence factors, such as they might be argued to be with the business community, are outweighed by the short&hyphen;term effect of this budget, which will be contractionary. That is exactly what we have been saying all along. The effect of this sort of budget cutback, of taking $8 billion or so out of the economy over this period, will result in half a per cent less growth this year and half a per cent less growth next year than would otherwise have been the case&mdash;with massive unemployment consequences in terms of 40,000 jobs this year and 40,000 jobs next year which would otherwise have been created not occurring. Add that to the 10,000 acknowledged public service jobs that are going&mdash;and the expectations are that that figure will be more like 30,000&mdash;and you <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3593"> have a terrible situation so far as unemployment is concerned in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why has the government done all this? What has been the reason for it? It cannot be to reduce the current account deficit. That cannot be the reason because, if you look at their own predictions for what is going to happen next year as a result of this great effort this year, you see the heroic achievement recorded of the current account deficit coming down from 4.2 per cent to 4.0 per cent. Big deal!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the situation in every other country around the world where an argument has been sought to be made that there is some kind of direct trade-off between reducing deficits and getting improved current account performance, you simply do not see that correlation. You see very often a negative correlation, including across the Tasman in New Zealand. It has had umpteen years of hairshirt budget surplus creation and current account deficit and it is now forecast to get back up to over five per cent, a percentage point higher than us, next year. So the current account deficit cannot be the reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nor could it be the case that this is perceived by the government as the only possible way to reduce government debt. Commonwealth government debt at the moment is running at just under 20 per cent of GDP compared with an average 50 per cent of GDP for full national debt in OECD countries. That is predicted in the government's own budget papers to come down as a percentage of GDP without any policy changes, without any of these contractionary measures, without any of this budgetary slash and burn. It will not be by as much, it is true, as will happen with these particular measures, but look at the graph on page 1&hyphen;14&mdash;it comes down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What sorts of other explanations, then, can there possibly be for this kind of budget? In fact, they are not too easy to ignore. They are not too hard to find. We have had cuts, obviously for ideological reasons, because this is a government that loves slashing and burning. It loves wreaking vengeance. It loves slaughtering the budgetary innocents. It gets <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> its jollies out of doing this sort of thing. The government is on an ideological crusade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another reason, and that is to pay for the pre-election bribes. That is why we have so many of these cuts. There is another reason, and that is to build a war chest over this budget and the next one to pay for the next election's bribes. But the most sinister of all the obvious explanations of this govern</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Other">ment's budgetary strategy is that they like unemployment. They like high unemployment, just as the financial markets like unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why do they like unemployment? Because it tends to keep wages down&mdash;especially, of course, in a poverty-wage, free market environment of the kind that they are now trying to create in this country. With the absence of the accord, with the tearing up of the accord, that is the only kind of course of wage policy they now have. They think that keeping wages down in this way in turn creates downward pressure&mdash;as, of course, it does&mdash;on inflation and interest rates, that it is good for bond prices. That is the reaction of the international markets. It is good for bond prices, but it is not good for people&mdash;and that is the point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What would we have done? I will tell you what we would have done. In the first place, we would have maintained the accord with the prospect of a much earlier achievement of an interest rate cut as a result, because it would have removed that uncertainty about wage increases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing we would have done is that we would not have embarked on a confidence destroying, pre&hyphen;budget campaign, designed to demonstrate to the community that we were determined, as nothing else, to wreak havoc on the government funding of so many different sources of expenditure that people were relying on and contracting the economy in the process. Of course, we would not have gone down the savagely contractionary budgetary path, which has been followed in this instance particularly with cuts to education and labour market programs, which the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) will talk about when he gets up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we would have done, as I have constantly said, is address the budget deficit <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3594"> issue as a medium-term problem, bearing in mind that the task on the government's own March figures was to deal with a budget deficit of only around $3 billion. In fact, on our estimate&mdash;on slightly more optimistic, slightly more generous, growth assumptions&mdash;it is rather better even than $3 billion in 1998-99&mdash;in fact, on Access Economics estimates a few days ago, $1.5 billion being the size of the budgetary task. Without policy change and without any slash and burn, that self-correction factor, to that extent, would have been there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even right now, after the budget, even taking into account the final outcome figures for the last financial year, you need only slightly higher growth assumptions than those contained in the budget itself to make that 1998-99 figure&mdash;three years out, the last year in the life of this parliament without policy change&mdash;just over $3&half; billion. A savings task of $3&half; billion as your objective over the three-year term, the lifetime of this government, is obviously very significantly different and a very much more modest savings task&mdash;one that could be achieved with very much more moderate and balanced budgetary strategies, and cut strategies, than is the case when you set yourself a savings task of achieving a big result, an $8 billion kind of a turnaround in two years, as this government has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the course that I have described is&mdash;and would have been for this government&mdash;the rational, sensible, decent way to go to meet the problem of unemployment. This government stands absolutely condemned for not following that course. It is a government that stands condemned for a lot of other things it has done so far as measures which have an economic impact, not just on interest groups but on the whole economy. It stands condemned for its approach to the whole question of human capital formation, education, labour market programs&mdash;everything that has been done to destroy the capacity of this country to create on the supply side of the equation the human capital we need to remain effective and competitive in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You stand condemned for the mindlessness of what you have done on research and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> development, taking $2.2 billion out of public sector support and replacing it with just a few hundred million dollars in. You stand condemned for the way in which you have cut and slashed so many business support programs, particularly those assisting struggling exporters. There is a mindless ideological approach right across the spectrum which is doing this country no good at all. And above all, it is doing no good at all for the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the message of this budget is: don't be old, don't be black, don't be a migrant, don't be young, certainly don't be good at school but, above all, if you are unemployed, forget it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might just say in opening that I think there is an important debate going on in the Labor Party. I have noticed it between some of the younger members, between the socialist left and the right. It is an interesting debate. I think the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) is putting forward some interesting views about where Labor should go in opposition and the different economic approach it should take. I have noticed that some of the other younger members have also put forward some constructive alternatives as to whether Labor should re&hyphen;pitch itself and re&hyphen;pitch its appeal. I think that is a debate which is interesting and will shape things for the future but, obviously, it is not a debate that the shadow Treasurer is part of, nor is it a debate that he has fully come to grips with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow Treasurer has the legacy of the Keating era, which he feels obliged to defend, but he cannot take to its conclusion the necessary measures which are required to overcome the failures of the Keating era. He may be an interregnum in this debate while the larger issues are debated out, because essentially the proposition that has been put forward, when it all boils down, is that all you had to do really was nothing. If you did nothing, everything would have been all right. Of course, it bears no relation whatsoever to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3595"> the budget, which actually reports what the outcome was last year, what the starting position was without measures.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What would be wrong with running deficits into the next century?

You were leading Australia, as you moved across, in an inexorably growing rate of debt to GDP. You were making no provision for the future. That is why it was important that this government came in and attended to the problem that you could not fix.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go back to 1993. Do you recall the 1993 budget?  The 1993 budget was a determination by Dawkins, to give him his due, to set out a medium&hyphen;term fiscal consolidation to try to get the budget back into balance. It did not work. Labor failed. We were still in the same situation in 1996, and if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), had his way, he would have us in the same situation in the year 2000&mdash;debt to GDP inexorably rising, Australia internationally exposed, and a country which would be more at the whim of international developments than a country with our resources should.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here is what you said on 1 February 1994 in relation to the Dawkins deficit reduction strategy. I think the member for Holt might remember this. In justifying tax increases on 1 February 1994, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increase in fuel excise, which takes place with the routine inflation adjustment, is an important part of the government's deficit reduction program.</PARA>
<PARA>The member for Holt should listen to this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will help preserve the low inflation, low interest rate environment that we obviously have at the moment that is so essential if the recovery is to be sustained. At the moment we are in the middle of a splendid recovery and the maintenance of it is obviously the key to reducing unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me say those words of yours again: `the key to reducing unemployment'. You were arguing, in accordance with the government policy of the day, for a deficit reduction <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3596"> strategy&mdash;a deficit reduction strategy to make inroads into unemployment. This, of course, was back in February of 1994. When you were arguing for that deficit reduction strategy in February of 1994, the unemployment rate was 10.4 per cent. There was an unemployment rate of 10.4 per cent and you were arguing for a deficit reduction strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today you stand up on an unemployment rate of 8.5 per cent and you say that we cannot have a deficit reduction strategy. What has changed? The only thing that has changed is that you failed in your objective. Having failed in your objective, what you are trying to do is to change the objective. Having failed in your objective, you did not sit down and say, `Where did we fail and how do we overcome it?' You changed the objective to meet the failure. This is what you were arguing in February of 1994 on a 10 per cent unemployment rate&mdash;a fiscal reduction strategy. You were arguing to balance the budget on 1 February 1994. Your fiscal deficit reduction strategy was designed to get back to a balance. The fact is it did not.</PARA>

Tony Cole has told us. They were cooked up in the Prime Minister's office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does he say now? He says, `Do nothing, and if you do do nothing try to get some increased growth and balance the budget that way.' In other words, it is an invitation to repeat the cooking of the growth forecasts. The thing about the Labor Party is they always return to the scene of their own crime. Having done it the first time&mdash;cooked the growth estimates to try to show a balance&mdash;what does he say now? `Increase the growth estimates and balance your budget that way.' Having been in the situation of higher unemployment and argued for balance budgets and having failed, you say, `Change the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> targets.' It is like an archer shooting for a target they cannot reach. Instead of proving the shot, they say, `Bring the target forward.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But where would that leave Australia if we left it on Labor's path of deficit and debt? It would leave Australia in the year 2000 with general government net debt at 20 per cent of GDP. Having come off at the start of Labor's term in 1983 at around four per cent of GDP, you would have left it at 20 per cent of GDP after what&mdash;seven years of economic growth?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The absolute irresponsibility of it! This was a government that, for plaudits, for votes, was prepared to spend money it did not have and give debts to our children. Yet it cannot bring itself to admit its failure, nor can it bring itself to get a comprehensive or credible economic strategy as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the Labor Party has an enormous way to go. First of all, it has to face its failure and admit it before it is able to get an economic strategy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You say, `Look, if we could get growth to four per cent we could try to balance the budget on the back of growth.' Growth was at four per cent in 1994 and with an unsustainable current account deficit your government had to have a monetary tightening to wind growth back because it was unsustainable. That is the problem, you see. This is the point you have to understand if you are going to make progress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a speed limit on the Australian economy. Your government experienced it. If you get that growth up around four per cent, if you don't do anything in relation to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3597"> current account deficit, interest rates go up again. It was a policy of your government to put interest rates up because you knew that growth was not sustainable.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very glad to see that you are throwing doubt on the J-curve and the twin deficits theory. I am very glad to see that. Do you know why? It was a Labor theory.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addressing the failure of the government in its budget strategy, its failure to give priority to the reduction of unemployment and support to the unemployed, I want to introduce the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to people like Dean and Julie&mdash;real people, real case studies, that the Treasurer's brother spends his time looking after in Melbourne.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dean is in his 20s, a year 9 high school dropout who has not had a job since he was 15. Julie was a prostitute, with a two-year-old and a partner in gaol. This is the human face of the unemployment problem that the Treasurer barely mentioned in his speech of Tuesday evening. Unemployment is not included as a priority in the Treasurer's activities at the moment. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3598">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both Dean and Julie are graduates of a new work opportunity program down in Melbourne's southern corridor of the Frankston Peninsula. It is an area, interestingly, of mainly Liberal Party electorates, including that of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith). It is, importantly, a project which will now have to shut down next year, thanks to the policies of the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Julie first joined her new work opportunities project, she was interestingly vocal about the uselessness of new work opportunities. As she said, `It is not a real job, just a way of hiding the jobless.' Her language was, naturally, sharp; her tone was dismissive&mdash;a bit like, if anything, the Treasurer's colleague Senator Vanstone when she talks about new work opportunities, LEAP and higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Julie, to her credit, stayed with the project for a little over three months with frequent verbal, abusive outbursts and long periods of absence. Slowly the new work opportunity was able to give her the work discipline. Slowly she was able to resolve some of her personal problems, her angers&mdash;the human face of unemployment that the Prime Minister and Treasurer are not prepared to come to terms with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After some time, with a new sense of herself, she got a part-time job at a lunch shop, which gave her time with her daughter. The next time the new work opportunity people heard from Julie she was ringing up asking the new work opportunity provider if they had an ex&hyphen;unemployed person who was work ready and available for a part-time job. Julie was now the manager of the shop where she had started part-time work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I go to Dean. Dean started the new work opportunity project naturally very depressed&mdash;five years without a job. He thought he would never get a job, even though he had upgraded his high school skills by attending TAFE. Dean had always wanted to work as a carpenter and help his single mum pay the bills. He was angry about not being able to do either. He was angry at society. Finally, to his credit, he started the new work opportunity project. The issues blocking his path to getting work ready were <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> addressed at the project. The project supervisor found him a local truss manufacturer who gave him work experience&mdash;the key to getting work ready. Six months later, Dean had his first job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what have we now? The Prime Minister stands here and claims that he understands Australia. He says that he is the man who has his finger on the Australian pulse. He tells us in this chamber, `I know what Australians are concerned about.' But you don't find concerns from the Treasurer and the Prime Minister about the issue of unemployment in their current budget strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there has always been one big concern&mdash;a concern for Australians which John Howard has always ignored since he was elected to the House of Representatives. It has never been a priority in his political career. He ignored it when he was last Treasurer and he is busy ignoring the issue now&mdash;that is the question of unemployment. Jobs have never been his priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know your rhetoric, but the facts on the ground are that the Prime Minister has never been concerned about unemployment. He suggests you can hide it. But look at the media critics of today, look at what they have said about the budget. They suggest that the one big problem in your budget, Mr Treasurer, is the lack of any commitment to the unemployed. That is what they are saying. More importantly, the wiser, older heads in the media are saying, `Ah, well, that's just John Howard's track record for you.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has never truly been concerned about the Julies and the Deans of the outer suburbs and the regions of Australia. In fact, one budget document which was presented to the parliament on Tuesday evening entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Reforming employment assistance</EMPHASIS> has the hide on page 11 to refer to some unemployed as being `deadweight costs'. That is the view of the current government. Some unemployed are talked about in their own budget documents as `deadweight costs'. That is the accountant in the Prime Minister coming about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To get rid of these deadweight costs the government is proposing to put them through a `capacity to benefit' test. Labour market <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3599"> assistance is no longer a universal right in this nation as of Tuesday evening. If they have drug problems or psychiatric problems the government is prepared to wash its hands of them. They are the deadweight costs in the minds of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer&mdash;the people to be ignored, the people to be forgotten about under the current budget strategy of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far as I am concerned, I don't think this government should adopt the policy which will allow those people, the Deans and the Julies of this world, to live in a ghetto of despair, accepting a proposition by which their advisers suggest that this society does not want to help them get a decent job. Mr Howard suggests that he understands Australians. All I can say is that Australians don't want ghettoes of unemployment. They want proper targeted labour market programs such as those provided through skillshare to assist them in getting job ready and to assist them in getting back to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister might have given the Treasurer seven out of 10 for the budget but the radio public has marked him a failure&mdash;a dismal failure. In the first 18 hours after the budget, what did the radio public have to say? I know the Treasurer does not like to hear this. From the tip of Queensland through to Tasmania and western New South Wales, they have given the Treasurer the thumbs down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, what is one of the top negatives? Eighty per cent have marked him as a failure on unemployment. That is why the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> said today&mdash;and it is front page&mdash;`Prime Minister ducks pledge on jobless'. So far as they are concerned, the horrifying cuts to community&hyphen;run programs, such as skillshare, are an absolute disgrace. There is an absolute unwillingness by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister to invest in getting Australia job ready and invest in getting Australians back to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go to the decisions of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone). What are the real cuts? A cut of $1.8 billion to the Working Nation job ready programs. And she dares to suggest and talk about a cruel hoax! If the minister wants to talk about a cruel <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hoax, then let us look at the cruel hoax of the so-called modern apprenticeship and traineeship scheme. What is the additional money over the next four years? It is $160 million. What a disgrace!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It effectively means for the next financial year there will only be an additional 1,500 apprenticeship and traineeship places. I say to the mums and dads of Australia that you have a right to be disappointed. You know as well as I do that only two per cent of the young unemployed people will benefit as a result of the additional expenditure on MAATS brought forward by the Treasurer on Tuesday evening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a flimsy program pretending to do something for young people. It is like a flea riding on the back of Pharlap. In one fell swoop this government has walked away from its responsibilities to do something about unemployment. Unemployment is not the priority. That is why this afternoon I will seek leave to table the government's communication strategy <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Reforms to labour market assistance and service delivery arrangements.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will tell you why. This document shows their policy for what it is&mdash;a real hoax. It talks about the weaknesses. It talks about the overall fear of unemployment. It talks about the potential for unemployment to rise. It talks about the potential loss of services. It talks about community anger. I seek leave to table this document.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad I am entering this debate because when the shadow Treasurer was speaking he hardly mentioned unemployment once. He was talking about human capital formation. It was good to hear the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) getting on to the topic when he spoke about unemployment, but the key issue that was addressed earlier concerns this budget. I believe it has been a positive budget for Australia and I want to reiterate some of the earlier comments of the Treasurer (Mr Costello).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Credit agencies across the globe are re&hyphen;rating Australia because of the budget that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3600"> was handed down. They are re&hyphen;rating it up, not down, which was the case under 13 years of Labor stewardship. It is important initially to look at interest rates because they are the lifeblood of business, particularly small business. I commend the Treasurer for the fall we have seen in variable home rates and for the two rate reductions. We have seen a fall of half a per cent in fixed interest rates. This is a responsible budget and it is about producing real jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The backdrop that we inherited before this budget was deficit, debt and deceit. I think it is important to recapitulate for the House the exact financial state that we inherited. Through the good policies that we have introduced in the last 24 hours we have, of course, started to tackle one of Australia's major problems, which is the generation of employment. What was our foreign debt? It went from $23 billion to $185 billion. Thank you, Paul. What about the worst recession in 60 years? From 1991 through to today we have seen a Commonwealth debt rate go from $30 billion to $100 billion. We saw a roller&hyphen;coaster of interest rates which you were proud of when they were peaking at 18 per cent. Unemployment peaked at 11.2 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the member for Batman will remember that we had record bankruptcies through the stewardship of the former boss of the ACTU and the previous Prime Minister. Fourteen thousand bankruptcies in small business! This is where employment on a long&hyphen;term sustainable basis is created. There were 14,000 in 1994&hyphen;95 and 17,000 in the depths of the depression in 1991&hyphen;92. But&mdash;and I quote&mdash;`This is as good as it gets.' That was the year that the bacon was to be brought home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We talk about a responsible budget. I am glad that the shadow Treasurer mentioned the deficit, because from 1992 through to 1995 Commonwealth revenue went from $95 billion to $124 billion&mdash;an increase of 30 per cent. Loans for the Commonwealth over the same period from 1991 went from $32 billion to $100 billion. We had asset sales during that period of $8.7 billion. No wonder we ended up with a major budget deficit and a current account deficit. In the 1980s, infrastructure <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was at eight per cent. In 1991 it was at 4.7 per cent and it went to minus 2.3 per cent. Infrastructure is critical for Australia, critical for business and critical for real job creation. Of course, there was also a litany of new taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are so proud of reminding us of the 1991 period during which Working Nation was introduced. During the recession 434,000 jobs were actually lost and 441,000 new full&hyphen;time jobs were created. That is their proud record after $3.5 billion of taxpayers' money. Unfortunately, though, the structural change that should have happened during the stewardship of Labor&mdash;particularly with the labour markets&mdash;did not happen. Indeed, one of the incredible things was when Laurie introduced the Working Nation category. The irony is that the member for Batman speaks about the Deans and the Julies but, for every hundred of them, 70 per cent still have not got a job. Working Nation was your proud moment in Australian history, but two&hyphen;thirds of the long&hyphen;term unemployed that went through Working Nation still have not got a job. They are still unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately what we did see was long&hyphen;term unemployment moving to short&hyphen;term unemployment. We saw the shifting of cheap wage subsidy programs to expensive programs&mdash;which, unfortunately, was not the outcome that you perhaps desired&mdash;and there was no continuing obligation by employers for them. You are right; they did have their place. They raised the esteem of the unemployed and they gave them hope. But unfortunately for the vast majority it was a false hope, because there were no real jobs created in the end. What this budget and this government are about is fundamental: our aim is to create real jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We talk about case management, but unfortunately the two previous speakers did not really concentrate on the subject. The incentive was not there for the case management system to provide real long&hyphen;term jobs. They did a marvellous job under the circumstances, but this government will have a different focus. Unfortunately, what we saw during that period was very much a distortion of the figures. Obviously, as we moved towards the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3601"> 1996 election there was a distortion of the labour market numbers, and that was after 20 quarters of economic growth. They wonder why we are being responsible. We have been handed $69 billion in accumulated debt&mdash;debt which has occurred over the past five years under their stewardship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget is a positive budget. It is about putting this country and this budget back in the black. It is about helping the long&hyphen;term unemployed through small business incentives which are the engine for growth. It is about giving them an incentive, whether through capital gains tax rollover provisions, through reduction in provisional tax or through removing the ridiculous compliance with red tape.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Working Nation was your solution to the unemployment crisis that you created, but the irony is that you whacked in the unfair dismissal law which had exactly the counter effect. Indeed, as I doorknocked the electorate of Richmond on a number of occasions in my quest to enter this parliament, the biggest concern that came through to me was about the draconian unfair dismissal law&mdash;whether it was reality or not. The situation was that they were not prepared to employ people because of the fear of protracted labour market legal cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome the Australian workplace relations bill which will address this matter and also the workplace agreements which will provide a flexible labour market in a changing labour market, which is not the same labour market as when the trade union movement was initiated in this country. Another positive move by this government is the apprenticeship and traineeship scheme, which is different to Working Nation because it is giving people two to three years rather than just six months. Isn't that a good thing? I hope that, with the passing of the Telstra bill and the formation of the Natural Heritage Trust, there will be a huge amount of money&mdash;$7 billion&mdash;coming back into the retiring of debt. When this debt is retired it will put this economy into better shape.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The labour market assistance is still $1.6 billion and is back to the same level that existed pre Working Nation. As we know, Working Nation was not a success. Indeed, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> over this next budget period $5.4 billion will be allocated to labour market assistance. I believe the government has done the right thing in streamlining labour market programs and encouraging those programs that succeed. The government is giving a one&hyphen;stop shop for the CES and the DSS, which is eminently more attractive and useful to those people who are disadvantaged such as the unemployed and those seeking assistance like the Deans and Julies that the member for Batman so eloquently referred to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have provided a safety net for these people, and in regional areas and areas where there is high unemployment extra contributions will be made to help with case management. It is the right mix, it has the right incentive and I believe it will have the right outcomes. It must be remembered that two&hyphen;thirds of Working Nation did not result in the creation of any new jobs at all. This budget provides incentives and long-term hope for the young and the not so young who lost their jobs during Labor's recession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget is about getting this economy back into shape. We have also put a bit of equity back into this country because we have been prepared to hit high income earners through superannuation and Medicare. This is a way of being more equitable and redistributing some of the wealth back to the people in need. As the Treasurer said before, we have seen a 16 per cent growth in investment confidence over the last quarter. The figure was 4.9 per cent when Labor lost office and it was 16 per cent last June.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a smoke and mirrors budget; nor is it a budget about bringing home the bacon or bashing it on bankcard, as the Labor party did in its previous 13 years of stewardship. This budget provides incentive for families and real hope. It will generate savings. Principally, it is about assisting small business and not major corporate enterprises. It will assist small business and achieve lasting employment generation. This will tackle the great legacy Labor left behind which we inherited and which we are taking responsibility for. This is a responsible budget to bring Australia back into the black.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a continuation of the debate on the Flags Amendment Bill 1996. Just before question time when I was interrupted, I was endeavouring to explain why I believe that this is nothing more than a naked manipulation and a cynical, miserable and cheap trick to bring a debate like this on in the middle of budget week. I am saying this because if that lot over there think that the Australian people are really going to be deceived by what I can only say is a limp&hyphen;wristed attempt to divert the attention of the public away from the main game&mdash;that is the effect that this budget will have on the people&mdash;then they are sadly mistaken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the government's tactic is that it wants this debate to degenerate into some sort of an argument over the present status of the Australian flag. It figures that the more controversy it can generate around the debate, the more chance it has of knocking its bad news budget from the nation's front pages. We in the Australian Labor Party will not be giving the government that pleasure. We will not accommodate the government in its plans by getting down into the gutter with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is seeking to rug itself up in the red, white and blue of the Australian flag while at the same time attempting to besmirch any party or organisation which opposes the bill as being anti&hyphen;flag or indeed anti&hyphen;Australian. Again, we will not be giving the government that pleasure. The Labor Party is supporting the bill. What we oppose is the deceit and hypocrisy which drove the government to introduce the legislation in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through this legislation the coalition is implying with its usual bovine grace that the flag is not safe under another government, that the opposition when returned to power would change the flag by stealth and that legislation is needed to protect the flag from <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> any of our evil tricks; yet the facts speak for themselves. The Australian Labor Party has made it clear in this parliament and to the people of Australia time and time again that we would never support the changing of the flag by anything other than the popular support of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at Labor's past record on the question of changing the flag. Former Prime Minister Keating had this to say in this very chamber on 5 May 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have made it clear that the Government will not be seeking to change the flag other than by a clear majority of Australians being in favour of it.</PARA>
<PARA>In answer to a question on notice from the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) on 8 October 1992 regarding plans to change the flag, Mr Keating replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No scheme would be contemplated, however, which did not involve an act of choice by the Australian electorate between the current design and any proposed new design or designs.</PARA>
<PARA>Later still, on 9 June 1994, Mr Keating had this to say on the same question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whatever happens in this matter over time, this is a matter for the public at large to express themselves about.</PARA>
<PARA>Again five days later on 14 June of that same year he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have got an opinion on the flag, but I don't have a plan for the flag.</PARA>
<PARA>So the former Prime Minister and the Labor Party's stance on this question in the past has been unambiguous. We would not agree to there being a change in the flag unless it was a change sanctioned by the majority of Australians, and the present leadership of the party has been equally explicit on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite this, despite the very clear message that we and all other political parties and interested groups have sent to the present coalition government and the people of Australia, the Liberal and National parties have now brought us to this point&mdash;debating this bill during budget week. The government is addressing a threat that never existed. We have an army of backbenchers on a phantom crusade. Even Harold Scruby and AusFlag, that group best known in this country for its efforts to promote a debate on the Australian flag, are in favour of a plebiscite on the issue.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3603">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> If even the most outspoken critics of the present Australian flag strongly believe in the necessity of a plebiscite before there is any change, if there is no real opposition, what is the purpose of this bill? As I have said before, it is a diversion, plain and simple. It is a rather clumsy attempt to create a diversion at that. It would be laughable were it not for the fact that the government are displaying their contempt for our national symbols by using the flag as the basis for their cynical distraction. They have taken the bread away from the people of Australia in a budget. They have taken the teeth and the hearing aids from the pensioners, and here they are now providing us with this circus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is a sign to all Australians of how morally and politically impoverished the government really are. Over the last 13 years we have heard the members of the coalition accuse the Labor Party&mdash;quite wrongly, might I add&mdash;of attempting to use our national symbols for some grubby political ends. Now in their first six months in office they are literally running over each other to do exactly that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the country feels the cold steel of the budgetary acts of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), while thousands more ordinary Australians now pour over the classifieds for jobs, as more Australians needlessly join the snake-like queues at the Department of Social Security, while they suffer the loss of faith and self-worth that comes from being made redundant from their jobs and while they wonder how to pay their bills and look after their families, we are being treated to a chant of hollow patriotism in this parliament. I find it difficult to think of anything more insulting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The members of the government like parading and being seen with their little Australian flag lapel badges. They like turning up to ceremonies on Australia Day or Anzac Day and giving their speeches on the sanctity of the flag and their devotion to it. In past debates in this House just the mere mention of the flag caused them to huff and puff and turn red in the face like a bunch of tired old Colonel Blimps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, it was on Anzac Day when the Prime Minister, with all the swollen patriotic <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pride he could muster, announced his intention to introduce this bill into parliament. His and the government's devotion to the flag extends only so far as it remains politically expedient. This bill exposes them, at the first chance in government, as using our flag as an instrument in a tawdry political game. They have dirtied their hands with the budget and now they are trying to wipe it off with the flag. That is how far their devotion extends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the record and for those people in the gallery&mdash;for the benefit of all Australian people, in fact&mdash;let me say that the only people guilty of changing any of Australia's national flags in the past were the Liberal Party, the exhausted tories at the end of the 1960s. In 1967 Harold Holt, the then Prime Minister of Australia, the head of the Liberal Party and the coalition government, dumped the Royal Australian Navy's white ensign with its red cross of St George in favour of the present flag with the Southern Cross in blue. The Liberal Party dumped a flag under which Australians had fought and died in three previous wars without a single ounce of consultation with the Australian people. There was no plebiscite, there was no vote and there was no prior announcement in order to promote debate. It was just done&mdash;full stop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal Party's track record on this issue stinks to high heaven. They are trying to claim the high moral ground, yet they find it very hard&mdash;and they will continue to find it very hard&mdash;to claim that ground because they are really standing at the bottom of the ditch. Spare us in the debate the hypocrisy&mdash;that fake moral indignation which we have already had to listen to from the honourable member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson)&mdash;and that patriotic breast&hyphen;beating. You do not fool us and you certainly do not fool the Australian public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is all apart from the fact that the contents of the bill itself are completely unconvincing. Not only is their diversion as politically obvious as it is immature, but it is held together by a lick and a promise. It is as flawed as it is flimsy. Let us start by looking at the bill itself and whether or not it is constitutional. Section 1 of chapter 1 of the Commonwealth constitution states:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3604">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislative power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Federal Parliament, which shall consist of the Queen, a Senate, and a House of Representatives, and which is herein-after called "The parliament," or "The Parliament of the Commonwealth."</PARA>
<PARA>The point made by some of Australia's leading experts on constitutional law, including Professor George Winterton, the Professor of Constitutional Law at the University of New South Wales, and Professor Cheryl Saunders, the Director of the Centre for Comparative Constitutional Studies, is that this bill is unconstitutional and it is open to challenge in the High Court because it effectively places a fourth power in the parliament&mdash;the people of Australia, who would vote through a  referendum on the flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the government's rush to beat the patriotic drum and drown out all the budget protest, it has introduced a bill which is legally open to a challenge in the High Court. In introducing a legally questionable piece of legislation, it has discredited this parliament. The hypocrisy continues. Not only is the government not above abusing our national symbols for their own political gain but it has no reservations about dragging the standing and the reputation of the parliament through the mud in the process. Again, this is a crime which the coalition took great pains to accuse Labor of during its 13 years in office. It came to power promising to raise the standards of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me read an extract from the Liberal Party's speaker's notes, published in November 1995. It states that the Liberal Party, once in government, would `restore pride and confidence in parliament and the way it works'. How can a government, which introduces a bill which challenges the very tenets of our constitution, be construed as restoring pride and confidence in our parliament? In the same guide it promised it would `improve scrutiny of legislation'. In this respect the government can have it either way. It has either been so  slipshod in its preparation of this bill that it has completely failed to submit it to a thorough enough inspection or are we to believe that it has intentionally introduced a flawed bill to this House knowing full well that by its unconstitutional nature it would <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> challenge the reputation and standing of this parliament? Which is it to be, or are you saying that there are no weaknesses?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Prime Minister announced his intention to introduce this bill on Anzac Day, he made it quite clear that he would be placing the legislative equivalent of Fort Knox around our flag to make it secure. In reality, this bill protects the flag with the legislative equivalent of a house of cards. Any future parliament, as long as the government at the time can guarantee itself a majority in both houses, can repeal the legislation as easily as it was introduced. Fort Knox this bill is not. It is another sign that the Prime Minister is all about saying one thing to the people of Australia and then just practising another within this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What other mistakes did the Prime Minister make on Anzac Day? He had this to say about the bill: `This will mean that no politician, no political party and no special interest group will be able to tamper with the design of our flag.' Such is the Prime Minister's impressive foresight, as evidenced by this statement, that this bill makes no allowance for the future government to make any small cosmetic and prudent change to the flag, even if national events demand such a change take place, without resorting to a $52 million&mdash;in today's dollars&mdash;national referendum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, when&mdash;and not if&mdash;the Northern Territory achieves statehood, the bill does not allow the government of the time to change the six&hyphen;pointed federation star to a seven&hyphen;pointed symbol without spending that $50 million on a national plebiscite. Quite obviously, this is a ridiculous situation. It is even more ridiculous when it has been brought about by a government which has preached frugality and economy with all the piety of a bunch of Trappist monks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the government in introducing this bill has failed to act on the concerns of many vocal groups in the electorate by making no mention of barring the thousands of British subjects, not yet Australian citizens, who are eligible to vote in a referendum on the flag should it ever be held. It has been estimated that in Australia there are 250,000 British citizens who are eligible to vote but who are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3605"> not Australian citizens. It is impossible to believe that these hundreds and thousands of voting British subjects, who may have a strong allegiance to Australia&mdash;and I do not doubt that&mdash;but still not strong enough to take out our citizenship, would not be torn between the symbols of the country of their birth, of which they remain citizens, and the land in which they now live.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a question which demands attention, but it is not in this one&hyphen;page bill. If the British subjects in Australia have not felt strongly enough to take out our citizenship, if they still value the ties that bind them to their motherland over the ties that would bind them to this land, how can we then expect them to vote without prejudice on the flag of this nation, which could see the abolition of their own flag, the Union Jack, from the corner of our emblem? Do we seriously expect those British citizens in Australia to approach this issue without looking back over their shoulders at the nation to which they still remain loyal, the nation of their birth?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this bill provides no answers to that or to any other question that I have raised. In the government's haste to take the nation's attention away from the inequities of its budget and its litter trail of broken promises, it has paid no heed to the details, to the ramifications, that this bill now throws up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To go back to a previous point, perhaps the government just did not care. For its purposes, any bill was good enough, however flawed, as long as it camouflaged the budget fallout. It was, `Let's get it in, let's get up, let's debate it, get it on the front pages. The Labor Party will get down to the gutter. They will say the flag is no good and then we will take away from the press what is really the hurt being caused by the budget.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever one's personal opinion on the Australian flag, there is one thing we can all agree on: it deserves better treatment than this. It deserves better than to be mistreated by a government more interested in self&hyphen;service than serving the rest of us. It deserves better than to be used as a pawn in a cheap political ploy, a cynical diversion constructed solely for the government's benefit. It deserves better than to be tugged about by a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bunch of hypocrites who for 13 years cried out about the degradation of the flag and then degraded it themselves the first chance they got.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in my opening statement, this bill is a giant waste of the parliament's time and energy. The Australian flag deserves better than this and the Australian people deserve better.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, flags are a part of a strong military tradition that has been an integral part of military forces as far back as the Roman Empire, when elaborate eagles were hoisted above the melee of hand&hyphen;to&hyphen;hand combat and used as rallying points for the Roman military <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3606"> units in battle. The battle was lost when the eagle was captured. The ferocity with which troops defended their eagle is legendary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When another army's standard was raised over land, then that land had been conquered.

This tradition of the flag is alive and well among Australian veterans, ex&hyphen;service personnel and current serving Defence Force personnel. It is merely coincidental to them that the symbol they carried into battle at Gallipoli, the symbol that was raised over New Guinea towns retaken from the Japanese in World War II, the symbol that was flown at Japanese surrender ceremonies and flown with our forces in Korea and Vietnam, happened to have a Union Jack in the top left corner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The original competition to design a flag held in 1901 by the new Commonwealth government did not require the inclusion of a Union Jack in the design as a condition of entry. It was optional. Numerous flags were entered; 32,823 entries were considered and only some had the Union Jack or any reference to the Union Jack on them. Yet the blue ensign was chosen as Australia's official and naval flag. The red ensign was chosen for the merchant navy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The winning choice for the Australian national flag featured the five stars of the Southern Cross, which was an important navigational symbol for early sailors and settlers; the Commonwealth Star, with seven points&mdash;six for the original six states and one for the Australian territories; and the combined crosses of St George, St Andrew and St Patrick, representing the origin of Australia's first immigrants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This happenstance, this incident in history, this competition in 1901, this reflection of tastes in the early 1900s, resulted in the rallying symbol for Australian forces in Gallipoli and diggers who spearheaded victories in France, such as General Monash. On <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 8 August 1918, when his troops broke through the German lines and turned the tide of war, he sought his chief to signal to the Governor&hyphen;General on behalf of the Australian troops that the Australian flag had been hoisted over Harbonnieres at midday that day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The flag was carried into New Guinea at the outbreak of World War I by the naval and military forces which captured German colonies. It was flown on the cruiser <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> in the first naval battle of the war. Again, in World War II, Australian POWs held by the Japanese secretly made Australian ensigns to keep up morale. In fact, in 1945, when Singapore was retaken, the first flag to fly was an Australian ensign made by Australian prisoners of X3 working camp Bukit Panjang. Again, in Kokoda, Korea, Long Tan, Nui Dat, Cambodia, Afghanistan, the Middle East, Somalia and Rwanda, Australian troops have marched beneath the flag of stars, the stars and crosses, the Aussie flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has now acquired a deep and significant meaning for many Australians: 263,000 Veterans' Affairs pensioners; 58,000 serving members; and the wives and families of every person who ever served under the military symbol chosen so long ago but which is now the symbol of parliamentary democracy, rule of law and freedom of speech, and a rallying point in the minds of military personnel who have reason to question why they are in prison, why they are risking life and limb, why they are fighting far from home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That rallying symbol holds incredibly dear and special memories for people like Harry McKay in my electorate of Lindsay. He is a sweet old gentleman who lives in Glenmore Park. He was a sergeant major with 2/6 cavalry commandos. As a young, newly married man in 1939, he carried the Australian flag, as it is today, overseas with him, and he still carries it today. It is a significant symbol for him of his sacrifice and that of his mates&mdash;his best friend, who died beside him and who was buried with the Australian flag. When you realise the depth of feeling and memory that defence personnel have attributed to the flag over the years, it seems quite arbitrary for government to change the flag on a political whim.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3607">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an important symbol for much of Australian society&mdash;monarchists and republicans alike. It is important to distinguish the debate about a new flag from the debate about a new constitution. It is not about a republic; it is about memories and vision. People are passionate about their experiences under the flag, not only in war, but in sporting triumphs. Visions of the Australian flag are synonymous with memories of standing on a podium with the Australian national anthem playing at a presentation ceremony for a gold medal. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, at official occasions, memories of the flag are part and parcel of people's memories of a significant occasion in their lives, when they were present at some occasion with distinguished dignitaries or at burials, or occasions like raising the flag on Mount Everest or on the moon. Occasions throughout history are scattered with images of the flag. That flag has come to mean more than the Union Jack, the Southern Cross and the Commonwealth Star. The flag is now intertwined with people's memories of occasions of patriotism, of war, of sport, of triumphs, of distinguished occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For quite a lot of people, and quite possibly the majority of people in Australia, that flag is of great significance to them. But without a referendum, how would you know? How would you know what the majority of Australians are thinking about their flag, about their rallying point, about their call to arms, if we do not ask them by way of a referendum? That, Mr Deputy Speaker, is perhaps one of the significant reasons, one of the vital flaws in the opposition while it was in government, one of the essential elements of my being here today&mdash;when government got so far from the people that it failed to ask them on matters that counted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The anger in my electorate from monarchists and republicans alike over the treatment by the New South Wales Premier of the Governor of New South Wales was tangible, and they demonstrated it at the polls. The arrogance of Paul Keating in his treatment of the Queen, again, was demonstrated in anger at the polls. People who have attached a special significance to the flag&mdash;for some of them, it could have been any design. It could <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> even have been a can of baked beans, but it is the symbol that is attached to those memories, that is the thing that counts with them. That is the thing that really matters to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a government were to unilaterally change that memory, that symbol of their dedication, their sacrifice and their occasion, that government would be punished at the polls. That is what this legislation is all about. We gave an electoral undertaking not to change the flag without consulting the people of Australia. We gave it on Anzac Day. We gave it to keep faith with the Australian people. That is what we are doing here today with this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any government, as the member for Prospect so tritely puts it, who comes in and seeks to repeal this legislation without a referendum and introduce their own flag will suffer similarly at the polls. The outcry and the ultimate punishment at the polls for changing, for repealing, this legislation will deter future governments from any such action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not patriotic breast beating; this is carrying out an election promise, an election commitment. It is keeping faith with the Australian people. It is honouring our commitment to maintain faith with the Australian people who had lost complete trust in their political leaders, who are totally cynical about the political process and who can identify strongly with the reining in of the budget on Tuesday night, the paying back of the Mastercard. They feel that that is their duty for their country, for their future, for their children. If you spend up big on bankcard this month then you pay it back next month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Well, we have spent up big on bankcard. We have received all the benefits, we have taken all the goodies. Now it is time to pay back the bankcard for our children. Those people going off to war under the flag were not thinking that they would come back alive. They were not thinking that they were going to come out of this with more in their pockets at the end of the week. They were not thinking that this was the right thing for them personally. They were thinking that it was for the betterment of their country, for the future of their children. They marched out to war in full knowledge that they were risking life and limb and they did it for their children. That is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3608"> exactly what we did on Tuesday night&mdash;we brought in a budget for our children. By the year 2000 we will be back in the black, we will have a strong economy and our children will have jobs. Our country will have a future. That is what has always driven Australians, from Gallipoli forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that there may be some alleged constitutional impediment that they can challenge in the High Court sounds familiar. I have heard it over the last few months. That still does not destroy the will of the people. What the people want is significant and they will demonstrate it. If you try to change that, they will demonstrate it to you again and again. The people of Australia want to be consulted on significant issues such as the republic and the flag. And we will consult them. They will have a voice in significant discussions. We are not political leaders who will just unilaterally take action that affects the people of Australia. Once Australian views are known in a referendum then it will be a very game government which subsequently changes that legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Prospect also brought up the point about 250,000 British citizens eligible to vote in Australia who may get to vote in this referendum. Wow! We are going to consider a minority view.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Health and Other Services (Compensation) Amendment Bill 1996 amends the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995, which came into effect on 1 February 1996. The Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995 was passed by parliament last year with coalition support to prevent double dipping through non-reimbursement of costs of services provided by programs subsidised by the Commonwealth. Double dipping generally occurs when a lump sum is paid as compensation costs associated <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with an injury, such as in common law cases and under statutory scheme redemption provisions. The parliament accepts that the taxpayers should not pay twice for the same service&mdash;once through the Medicare and nursing home benefit programs and again through compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act came into effect from 1 February 1996, but no-one could foresee the difficulties and individual hardships which have subsequently emerged. In New South Wales, the Health Insurance Commission predicted 25,000 claims in the first year. In the first three months alone almost twice that number of claims have been received. A similar situation exists in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the existing act, insurers must not pay the client any amount of settlement or judgment until they have repaid to the Health Insurance Commission any Medicare or nursing home benefits that relate to the compensation claim. The amount to be repaid to the commission is often a very small proportion of the total compensation amount. Implementation problems have exacerbated hardship for many claimants and generated complaints from insurers and lawyers about unacceptable delays in people being able to obtain timely payment of compensation settlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some examples of the difficulties being faced include a Brisbane man whose settlement of $1,000,000 was held up for an outstanding amount of $98.00. Another example is a Canberra woman whose settlement of $300,000 was delayed whilst the commission determined that no outstanding Medicare payments were owing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Meetings have taken place with representatives from the insurance industry and the legal profession and I am convinced that many compensable Australians are experiencing genuine hardship as a result of the requirements in the act. Following exhaustive negotiations, government officials and industry representatives have agreed on an approach that will satisfy the needs of government, industry and, most importantly, the claimants. The amendments are straightforward and are supported by the Insurance Council of Australia, the Law Council of Australia, the Law <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3610"> Society of NSW and the NSW Bar Association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Health Insurance Commission has now agreed that if the relevant notices have not been issued by the commission at the time of settlement or judgment, insurers will be able to pay to claimants the major proportion of the settlement or judgment with the balance to be paid to the commission. The claimant would then deal with the commission to settle the Medicare and nursing home repayment. Where the amount held by the commission exceeded the amount of Medicare and/or nursing home benefits to be repaid, the balance would be returned to the claimant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures propose that 10 per cent of the compensation amount be paid in this way to the Health Insurance Commission. The current average repayment paid to date is of the order of 7.5 per cent of the value of compensation amounts. A 10 per cent payment comprises a margin sufficient to ensure that in most cases the amount held by the commission will exceed the debt by the claimant. The actual proportion of the settlement or judgment withheld is critical and needs to be able to be fine tuned in light of experience. Consequently, it is intended that the amendment establish a power to vary this figure through delegated legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other minor amendment will overcome processing problems and reduce much of the unnecessary burden on industry. This amendment will remove the contradiction in provisions which require old claims to be notified to the commission. Cases which were finalised, or where reimbursement arrangements were entered into prior to the act, were never intended to be part of the scheme. They generate no revenue for the government and are unacceptably holding up the processing of other claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While there have been some early administrative problems with the implementation of the legislation, processing problems are now confined to two states and these are being addressed by additional resources and the streamlining of procedures. The most desperate cases are being identified as much as possible and fast&hyphen;tracked. Unfortunately, it is now clear that administrative measures alone <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cannot solve all the problems and some amendments to the act will be required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments will not now require minor consequential amendments to other acts such as the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Care Charges Act 1995. I believe that there should be all&hyphen;party agreement to the proposed amendments which will remove an unintended additional hardship being faced by many Australians.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to give some assurances about recovery of debts by the Commonwealth where the amount owing to the Commonwealth is greater than 10 per cent of the advance payment. Where a compensation payer makes an advance payment to the Health Insurance Commission, the settlement of any additional money owed to the Commonwealth is negotiated between the compensable person and the commission. There are a number of steps in the process that will allow a sensitive approach to the recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, if there is a disagreement about any amount specified as being owed to the Commonwealth, the person has the right to take the matter to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review. The decision of the AAT is binding on both parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is found that there are a substantial number of cases where the amount owing to the Commonwealth is more than the 10 per cent of the advance payment, the minister can determine, by way of a disallowable instrument, a higher percentage. This will ensure in most cases that the amount held by the Commonwealth will cover the debt and not place any additional burden on the person. Of course, if it transpires that the average amount owing to the Commonwealth is less than 10 per cent, the legislation allows the minister to decrease the advance payment percentage to be held.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, this bill will make the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act work as it should. It will ensure that the government is repaid for any Medicare and nursing home benefits which are subsequently covered by a compensation payment. Above all, this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3611"> bill will remove any unnecessary delays in compensating claimants. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to advise the House that the opposition joins with the government in working to provide a speedy passage for this particular piece of legislation&mdash;that is, the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Amendment Bill. As the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) indicated in her second reading speech, the original legislation was passed with the bipartisan support of the then Labor government and the coalition opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During a particularly vigorous exchange in question time earlier this year, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) quite unfairly tried to suggest that in some way the former government was culpable for the delays in the Health Insurance Commission's processing of some of these requests for the release of compensation payments. Given that vigorous exchange earlier this year, I am pleased that the Minister for Family Services said in her second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act came into effect from 1 February 1996, but no-one could foresee the difficulties and individual hardships which have subsequently emerged.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the Minister for Family Services has described this in a much more balanced way than her senior minister, the minister for health. Nevertheless, both sides of politics understand that delays have emerged. Those delays are hurting people who have received compensation payments. I am pleased to welcome the government as it has introduced this legislation in a pretty speedy manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of you with long memories might remember that there is another bill on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> with exactly the same name&mdash;the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Amendment Bill 1996&mdash;that was introduced as a private member's bill by me on 24 June. I am not quite sure that it will have much of a life once this legislation is passed. I have no regrets about that because that bill was introduced with the intention of prodding the government and trying to ensure that the parliament acted as speedily as possible in addressing these delays.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Minister for Family Services has said, these delays have caused hardship. She mentioned a number of cases that demonstrate quite clearly why the parliament needed to act very quickly on this measure. In her second reading speech, she also mentioned that under the current arrangements:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most desperate cases are being identified as much as possible and fast&hyphen;tracked.</PARA>
<PARA>I have to say that, in the several cases that affect constituents in the electorate of Dobell, it has not been possible to have them taken out of the order in which they are received and fast&hyphen;tracked. I am not sure whether other members of parliament have had cases that were worthy of having a consideration fast-tracked but, if it is the case that some claims are being taken out to be fast&hyphen;tracked because of hardship circumstances, I can let the minister's office know that there are one or two that I am aware of that, if they have not been sorted out to date, are really compassionate cases worthy of consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That being the case, the crucial difference between my private member's bill and the legislation which the government has introduced is that my private member's bill sought to simply freeze the total amount of Medicare benefits that are being paid to the individual concerned. The government also seeks to release the overwhelming majority of the compensation payment, but it does it in a different way. The government simply seeks to retain 10 per cent of the compensation sum and release 90 per cent. I think that is an acceptable way to ensure that we are addressing this problem, and one which the opposition will not be seeking to delay, oppose or amend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that the opposition has sought to ensure that this legislation has one of the speediest passages ever seen in the Australian parliament is a fair sign of our good faith on this measure. There aren't too many pieces of legislation that are introduced in the Senate in the morning and passed by the House of Representatives before the House rises. On legislation like this it is understandable and, as I say, that demonstrates our good faith. I am pleased that the suffering, which we believe the current legislation is causing, will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3612"> be addressed by the legislation which is now before the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand the measured and, one might even say, subdued response by the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee). Unlike the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), who was moderate in her language as to the reason these problems have arisen, I am not quite of the same mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act became effective on 1 February 1996. With the election only two months away, of course, the former Labor government did not have to suffer the pain of its ineptitude in this regard. I think the government is quite sensible in not trying to create controversy, but I do not necessarily have to adopt that line, let me tell you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act was constructed in such a way that insurers were able to notify the Health Insurance Commission as soon as a claim was made and obtain a notice of charge before the case was finalised. Where a notice of charge was obtained before a judgment or settlement, there needed to be no delay in the payment of compensation money. It transpired that under the act the insurers were not permitted to pay to their clients any amount of compensation that may have been arrived at&mdash;either by way of agreement between the parties or following the judgment of a court&mdash;until the Commonwealth had been refunded the Medicare or nursing home benefits that may have been paid for the care given to the injured and forming part of the compensation claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that insurance companies&mdash;not being noted for their public spiritedness&mdash;abused the system and delayed claims, it seems to me, unreasonably in so many cases. They put obstacles in the way of claims being settled within the parameters of the act and, by doing so, saved great amounts of money in the hands of those insurers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> We have heard of, and some of us are fully aware of, the Health Insurance Commission's inability to produce a notice of charge in much shorter time frames than those which might have been possible in ordinary circumstances. Processing delays consequently occurred, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland. I think the minister men tioned a figure that the commission had&mdash;and I had this advice in May&mdash;that at that stage it had received 26,000 requests for notices through its New South Wales office alone. That was in May. The estimate of the previous government, demonstrating its ineptitude in this connection, was 25,000 for an entire year. In Queensland, the number of requests received about the same time was over 11,000, compared with an estimate of 14,000 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the government and the previous minister for health do not escape criticism as far as I am concerned. The fact is that the processing pressure caused by that high volume of unexpected requests was exacerbated by settlements and judgments being made without insurers first having obtained current notice of past benefits from the commission prior to settlement or judgment. Another source of pressure was that the insurers&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;were not requesting the notice until just prior to the settlement or judgment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In late March I wrote to several ministers, hoping the shotgun approach would get through to the right one, and one of those was the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman), because it was apparent that people were being denied any income for periods of weeks and, potentially, months. They had no other source of income. The fact was that the commission was unable to cope with the timely issue of certificates. The likely and inevitable consequences of that were that successful claimants were forced into the social security system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the everlasting credit of the Minister for Social Security and her department and all concerned, they got in touch in April&mdash;hopefully as a result of my letter, but who knows?&mdash;with the Health Insurance Commission and raised the sorts of concerns that I had relayed to her. Those concerns dealt specifically with expected delays in the payment of compensation, pending calculation by the HIC of the Medicare recovery amount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The response of the commission at that time was that, if a notice of past benefits was to be completed prior to settlement, the commission would be able to notify the insurer of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3613"> Medicare recovery amount within a few days of being notified of settlement. But if, of course, the notice of past benefits was not to be completed prior to settlement, there could still be a delay. In my opinion, that was when the Department of Social Security came to the fore and determined that, in cases where the commission and an insurance company confirmed that there was to be a delay in the payment of compensation and the claimant was thereby left without income support and in financial hardship, he/she would be able to approach Social Security and obtain payment pending release of the compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amount so claimed was to be recovered by the department from the compensation payment before it was released, which is only fair and reasonable. As an interim measure, while the Department of Health and Family Services came to grips with the problems, the Department of Social Security filled the breach in a very commendable way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that there are some concerns which still remain. Section 32 of the act prevents payment of compensation until the commission issues a notice advising of benefits paid by the commission. This has already been mentioned. Incidentally, the penalty for a breach is 12 months imprisonment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Insurance companies, which find themselves the unsuccessful defendants in claims, were unable to pay until they got the required notice, even though settlements for judgments had been agreed or issued. Under the act as presently constituted that could have taken eight weeks for starters. With the intention of protecting government revenue, the act provided that interest on the amount of any judgment from the day of judgment was not payable. Therein lies my concern and, as I understand this legislation, that concern remains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I went through the exercise of preparing a flow chart to depict the various stages under the present act and came up with sticking points in two of the four possible procedures at either the date of settlement of the claim or where a judgment was issued. It seemed likely to me then&mdash;this was in March&mdash;that the commission would be unable to cope with the timely issue of certificates, regardless of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the unexpected numbers already in the system, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The position previously as to interest occurring on judgments was that, following judgment&mdash;this is prior to the act adopted by the Labor government&mdash;a successful litigant had an immediate right to execute for the recovery of damages. The damages carried interest from the date of judgment, thereby providing an incentive and a compulsion on the insurer to pay the damages as awarded, and promptly. It became readily evident that the insurance companies were provided with an absolute windfall under what I regard, in this aspect of it, as disgraceful legislation enacted by a Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I leave the matter with the question: why should a successful litigant, then or now, who has received no moneys whatever from the Health Insurance Commission have his or her entitlement damages delayed for weeks on end without recourse to interest or execution for recovery of these moneys? I know the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Amendment Bill makes provision for a large percentage of the moneys to be released with 10 per cent retention to cover the costs recoverable by the Commonwealth, but it is the interest factor that still disturbs me. The problem remains that the act, as it will be constituted, does not overcome the principal problem that I see. In effect, the act prevents a successful litigant from pursuing recovery of a judgment, by way of execution, together with interest which, in normal circumstances, is calculated from the day of judgment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Incidentally, a couple of days ago Mr Justice Donald Hill of the Supreme Court ruled that such interest payments are taxable. So it might be to the Commonwealth's advantage to have a look at this again, remembering that they are going to get a slice of the action. There is a good case to be made for reinstating a person's right to proceed to execution, together with interest where it is applicable, as was the case under the legislation of the Supreme Court act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat: the insurers have, whether it is a matter of policy or otherwise, simply utilised the provisions of the act as it is presently <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3614"> constituted to delay payment, and there existed no method of compulsion as was previously the case. This act might go part of the way to remedying that defect, but I still would not like potential claimants and beneficiaries under this legislation to be in any way at the mercy of insurers and to have to fall back on the social security system, as they have had to do in many cases since this act came into effect on 1 February 1996.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in support of the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Amendment Bill. It is important that we understand and remember that hindsight is a wonderful thing. This legislation last year was supported by all of us&mdash;both sides of the parliament. The particular weakness in it was overlooked by all of those who scrutinised it. Those things will happen&mdash;they always have and they always will. Loopholes will not be recognised and weaknesses not picked up. The ongoing need to reconcile the compensation system and the health system is a fundamental one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I well recall that one of my most difficult cases dealt with a quadriplegic, a young man who had been in an accident. His settlement was worked out on the basis&mdash;this was done between his barrister and the insurance company's barrister&mdash;that he would get Medicare support for as long as he lived. That was the basis of his settlement. It never took into account the ongoing medical costs he was going to incur as a quadriplegic. It was enormously difficult to reconcile that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the years I have discovered that it seems that insurance companies quite often happily seem to ignore the fact that costs incurred in compensation cases are being paid by the taxpayers&mdash;either through the public health system or through Medicare. It is extremely important that we differentiate. In the years ahead, I think insurance companies and people who have accidents in this way will clearly differentiate those medical costs which are compensation related from those which are not. That will make life much simpler and much more straightforward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This early stage has been really quite difficult. I just wonder whether or not the assessment done by the department, at the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> time, of the number of cases has been so wrong. I wonder whether or not the actual revenue collected will be equally wrong. In fact, it may be much higher. If that is the case, then that will be to the good because it really is quite unfair if the Medicare system is subsidising insurance companies, which is effectively what is happening in many areas over a very long time. Whilst the legislation originally had some faults, I think it will go a long way towards clearing up and delineating a very important issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This matter came to the attention of all members quite early on. You will recall, I do not doubt, back in late May, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) making some play of it and attacking the previous government for its weaknesses in legislation. You may recall how he quoted that the shadow minister for health had been, in his understanding of it, seeking the approval of the left wing of the Labor Party to bring forward some matter. The fact was that he was wrong. He was quoting notes that someone had read from a folder. I often wonder about my colleagues in this place who will go and open other people's folders and drawers and read private notes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, a committee of this side of the House had been discussing this matter with the shadow minister, who put forward some very good ideas. We all endorsed that at the time and said, `Terrific. Do it as quick as you can.' That resulted in a private member's bill coming in on 24 June. This could have been passed the same day. We could have fixed this up back in June. It is now August&mdash;two months later. For the last two months people have been suffering and we could have had it through in one day&mdash;or even two or three days, but by the end of June it could have been fixed. It is now the end of August.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister, who was so smart on the day and being such a clever little fellow, has delayed this fix, which was available to him before the end of June. In the last week alone I had three constituents who were caught up with this problem. That could have been avoided. All those people who have been caught by it since the end of June should understand that this could have been avoided.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3615">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why we are coming forward today and supporting it, albeit it has been a steal. No-one really minds that in this game. Why didn't you steal it back in June, for God's sake? Why wait until this session? I am sure that the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) would not have minded having his ideas stolen back in June. All we were looking for was a fix for this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is imperative that governments act quickly when obvious mistakes are made in legislation. There is no politics about that. There is no smart game of who wins and who loses. If we make mistakes, particularly on matters where both sides agree on the legislation, then obviously we fix it as quickly as we can&mdash;all of us, in one go. The point I am trying to make is that this could have been fixed sooner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another matter in relation to compensation that we need to look at and which came up yesterday; that is, the question of taxation and income and how compensation is treated by the tax system. For all of my parliamentary life, compensation has been an issue that has been on and off the political agenda. There really does need to be a very close look at whether or not compensation should be taxable in the year it is received in the way that it is being proposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have some real problems with that. It occurs in other areas. I expect that the government will act as promptly on the taxation question as they have on this question, unless they want us to bring forward a private member's bill on that as well. We could. If they do not want to do anything about it, we could bring something forward very quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Right now there are a lot of people, after yesterday's court decision, who will be getting compensation and will have a lot of uncertainty about taxation. I am suggesting to the government right now that we need a comment instantly. We do not want to wait another few months while they think about it. If they do not want to do it, then I am sure one of our shadow ministers can bring forward a private member's bill dealing with the taxation of compensation. I think we need words within days. If they are reluctant, then <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we will bring it forward and they can steal that as well, but I hope they will do it a bit faster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue is one that needs fixing. It is being supported, and I am pleased that it is going through today. In the meantime, I place on record my appreciation&mdash;and, I am sure, that of most members&mdash;to the departmental staff of the HIC. They have come under enormous pressure. I am aware that they have had abusive phone calls. I am aware that it has been extremely difficult. We have dealt with them on a number of occasions. On two days last week we had three cases. We have found them to be very forbearing and very patient and we really appreciate that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who have been affected by that have in the main understood that this was a mistake. It was not intended. They have accepted the reality of it. They are also aware that we were trying to get it adjusted. I am aware that they have exercised some patience with this situation. I particularly place on record my appreciation to the staff of the HIC and the department, who actually dealt with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose in a way, if you think about it, we have done this often with social security in terms of recovering compensation payments. It has been going on for years with social security. It was reasonable to assume we could be equally prompt and expeditious with health. What was not understood was the number of claims people have on Medicare for entirely different matters. The sheer complexity of that system was not understood at the time. As I said, it put the department under enormous pressure. Recently, in the last week, I was talking to my staff about the problems we were having and they were very lauding and praising of the people whom they had been dealing with, as I am sure all members have been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a good move, but there is a signal here for all of us. If there are mistakes in legislation that we all agree with, can we fix them the same day? We have shown it can be done. We are happy to accommodate. Rather than trying to score points, as the minister for health did back in May, it would have been much better to have recognised that there was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3616"> a fix available and do it. This could have been fixed two months earlier. That would have saved literally thousands of people uncertainty and anxiety. It would have saved the departmental staff a lot of pressure. Quite frankly, it would have been much better for all of us. In this situation playing politics, as the minister did at the time, was really quite unfortunate. He deserves to be reprimanded for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other than that, I commend the bill to the House. I am delighted it will go through tonight with the support of both sides. I am delighted for those people who will not be caught up in it. It will be fixed and those who are currently stuck in that queue, certainly in Sydney, will find their issues resolved very quickly.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I was reminded of this last Wednesday when I was in a butcher shop in Lindfield in my electorate. It is bit like the advertisement on television where you see the barber who starts to shave one of his customers with a cutthroat razor and says that his car insurance arrived that day, the registration and all these other things. Well, my butcher said, `Ah, Dr Nelson.' He had a meat cleaver there and he said, `I have a problem. My wife should have had settlement on a compensation claim four months ago but we can't get it because of some nonsense that is going on with the government and the Health Insurance Commission,' with which he rather swiftly and frighteningly put his meat cleaver into his chopping block. Needless to say, I am an xious to see this go through for other reasons as well!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act, as we have heard, was passed last year by the parliament, and it was passed with the best of intentions and with bipartisan support. We have lived through a period in which people have been perfectly entitled to compensation claims for injuries of one form or another but, in the course of receiving their treatment, they have had services provided which are funded by the Commonwealth largely through Medicare benefits but also at times through pharmaceuticals and nursing home care benefits. Of course when the compensation has eventually been paid, in effect, there has been double dipping which in most, but I must say not all, cases has been quite unwittingly done by the patient or the person who sustained that injury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I don't think anyone could have foreseen the circumstances which have arisen whereby we found that in the first few months of this year in New South Wales alone the commission had about 50,000 claims, whilst it was anticipated that in the course of a year we would probably have only 25,000. Under the present circumstances, the insurers are not able to pay the client any amount of settlement or judgment until they have repaid to the Health Insurance Commission any claims for Medicare or nursing home benefits which relate to that claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here now is a sensible resolution. Whether it is a question of the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) or indeed our own Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) and government addressing the problem, it is not a question of people scoring any points over this but rather seeing that we are able to see some settlement which will provide timely payments to people and also return to the Commonwealth moneys to which it is genuinely entitled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the problems that have been encountered have been spectacular. In my butcher's case I don't think there is an enormous sum of money involved but still it is significant to every claimant. At least in one case $1 million was upheld because of an outstanding amount of $98. Of course that is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3617"> an extreme case. But, by definition, people who are awaiting compensation claims are people who are significantly disadvantaged&mdash;people who have suffered, in most cases, horrific injuries for which they often go through the legal system. They wait many months and certainly years for settlement to find that because of some bureaucratic hold-up they are not going to receive that compensation claim for months. Unless we pass this amendment tonight, it will go on indefinitely. I think it is pleasing to see both sides of politics working to expedite the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Health Insurance Commission has agreed that if relevant notices have not been issued by the commission at the time of settlement the insurers will be able to pay to the claimants the major proportion, and that is about 90 per cent, of the settlement or judgment with the balance to be paid to the commission. Given that the average claim is around 7&half; per cent of the total value of compensation claims, a 10 per cent figure is perfectly reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst it is difficult to anticipate in the future just how much moneys will need to be recovered by the commission for services that it may have funded throughout the course of care provided in one form or another to that claimant, I think a 50 per cent margin rate is quite reasonable. I cannot imagine that many of my constituents who are affected by this are likely to be too severely aggrieved by it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) raised the issue of interest. As I sat listening to him make his contribution, which I must say I always find interesting, I reflected from the point of view of the Commonwealth that when services have been funded by the Commonwealth, and in this case where you are waiting for moneys to be recovered, you might well argue that there is an interest component there which has not been covered. I think, to be fair, we need to think of a swings and roundabouts approach to resolving this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other minor amendment that is going to be covered by this act will overcome the processing problems and reduce much of the unnecessary burden on the industry. Again, that has got to be something which ultimately <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is in the interests of those who pay insurance premiums to private insurers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also think that it is important that we, as members of the government, give credit to those officers of the department and the Health Insurance Commission who have worked fairly hard and, I know from the dealings I have had with my constituents who are affected by this, fairly reasonably to see that this is resolved. In a climate where you all too frequently hear people making unkind remarks about those who work in various government agencies, I must say that those with whom I have dealt in my electorate have had nothing but positive things to say about the government employees with whom they have dealt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that I have probably said more than enough. I think it is a pity that more people in the community do not see more cases like this where both sides of the parliament are sincerely trying to address the problems that people face.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I would like to spend a moment or two summing up. I note the concerns of the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). They will be conveyed to the minister I am representing today. I thank all the members for their contribution to the debate. I also thank the opposition for their cooperation in moving the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Amendment Bill through as quickly as possible to alleviate the hardship and the burden that it has created for many people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make note that the government does accept that there are still some problems with this particular act. These amendments address the most pressing of those problems and, as I said, will go a long way toward alleviating much of the hardship that has been caused by these difficulties. When the original act was passed in the Senate late last year all parties in the Senate agreed to review its operation after 12 months. The government does still intend to proceed with that review to make sure that any other difficulties are sorted out. As I said, this will alleviate the hardship that this has caused. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3618">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unfortunate that difficulties were not foreseen and that these hardships have occurred. Unfortunately, in many cases this has been due to the delays at the Health Insurance Commission which have been due in no small measure to the very large volume of claims that were somewhat unexpected. As I said, in New South Wales in the first year there were 25,000 claims&mdash;a much larger volume than was originally expected when the scheme was designed. Some of this increase in volume has been caused by an anomaly in the act which unnecessarily required the notification of a large number of claims which predated the act and were not caught by its repayment provisions. This anomaly is also being addressed by the amendments to this bill. Once again, I thank members for their cooperation.</PARA>

The government has also supported the committee's recommendations referring to the program for rewriting public rulings and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ensuring technical errors are corrected as swiftly as possible. Of course, some of the committee's recommendations will require closer examination by government before a full response can be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In June last year, the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) indicated that the coalition government would establish a stronger committee system to allow parliamentary scrutiny of government legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While I like other members of the opposition do not oppose the Flags Amendment Bill, there are a number of points I would like to make. Essentially, this bill is an insult to our flag. The flag can and does fly on its own. It does not need a life support system, as this bill purports to give it. You would not find any other proud nation&mdash;whether it be the United States, Canada, Japan, Great Britain or any nation you could name&mdash;attempting to introduce these false protections for their own cherished flag. There is no need to belittle our flag with a bill such as this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation is virtually a complete waste of time. There is a non-existent threat to our flag. Even those organisations which are evoking debate on the possible change to our flag in the future do not support any change <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3619"> without an expression of the will of the people by way of referendum or plebiscite. No government would ever contemplate changing the flag without the approval of its citizens. Indeed, no mainstream party in Australia today proposes a change to our flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason most frequently stated for the retention of the Union Jack on our flag is that it symbolises the system of government which we have inherited from Great Britain. It is said that the system followed the Union Jack when it was raised on our shores. With that raising on 26 January 1788, it is said that the common law of England flowed on to the shores of our land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The irony of this bill is that it is completely contrary to those principles which we inherited. It is unconstitutional for any parliament to purport to bind a future parliament. That has been stated in a number of cases, including cases before the High Court of Australia. One such case is Wenn v. the Attorney-General of Victoria, where the High Court said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliament cannot limit the legislative power of Parliament by providing that a statute shall not be amendable or repealable or that it shall operate notwithstanding any subsequent legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>So the irony of this bill is that this act of political gimmickry&mdash;of making a political statement on Anzac Day&mdash;is offending and embarrassing those very principles that we all cherish and that we have all inherited via the Westminster system. That is the unfortunate part of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will as a matter of course be presented to Sir William Deane, the Governor&hyphen;General. We are very fortunate to have him in that role, as he is an eminent and respected constitutional lawyer. One wonders what dilemma he will face when he is asked to give assent to this act of parliament&mdash;as will eventuate from the bill&mdash;even though he is more than aware of the principles to which I have referred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a bill which cannot be said to threaten our constitutional fabric, but it is a shame that, for political purposes, our system has literally been embarrassed by this act of political gimmickry. This is a government which quite frequently preaches with self-righteous tones political propriety. This action <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> does not live up to the standards of political propriety. It is quite unnecessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not propose to embark on the debate either for or against proposals to change our flag. I note that there are arguments both ways. I think over time it is quite possible&mdash;indeed, quite likely&mdash;that that argument will evolve. It is regrettable that the government has seen fit to attempt in some way to limit the argument which will naturally evolve over time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Be that as it may, I am proud of our national symbols&mdash;of our coat of arms and our flag. I, like all members of the opposition, would not even contemplate changing that flag without the will of the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a shame that this government has not converted what is a tokenistic demonstration of a supposed national spirit into action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note, for instance, the contrast between what the government has done here and what it did to the `produce of Australia' symbol and its failure to support the Advance Australia Foundation. That symbol gave meaningful support to our products which were in competition with other countries' products. That would have been a meaningful gesture. This bill is essentially a meaningless act of political gimmickry that demeans our flag and does not serve the government well at all. Nonetheless, I do not oppose the bill as moved because we do not deny that citizens should have a say before the flag is changed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are a more creative nation than this budget recognises or permits. We are a more united community than this budget will encourage. We are a nation of greater integrity than the shattered <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3620"> election pledges this budget contains, pledges that were given so forcefully and in such an unqualified manner by John Howard only a few months ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a budget of betrayal. Not just the betrayal of election promises but the betrayal of the Australian promise itself&mdash;the promise of Australia working always towards a more fair, a more just, a more inclusive and united society.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The message of this budget is don't be sick; don't be old; don't expect to go to university; if you're unemployed, too bad; and if you're young and unemployed, forget it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last election John Howard told Australians they could trust him. He told Australians that, whatever budget numbers he inherited, all promises would be delivered. This budget breaches that trust. A long list of broken promises. Promises made to mainstream Australia and made to battlers. Promises made to students. Promises made to the elderly. Promises made to the state and local governments. No contrived dribbling out of bad news for mainstream Australia and the battlers prior to the budget's presentation can hide that fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new morality of this government is that there are core promises and non&hyphen;core promises, although no such distinction was made before the election. Core honesty; non&hyphen;core honesty. Would you take that from your kids?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Howard inherited an economy that he said `was better than good'. Indeed he did. One with inflation that had been averaging 2&half; per cent. An economy that had been growing four per cent a year. One which created 700,000 jobs over the last three years. One which saw our exports, particularly those of manufactured goods, grow and diversify. He inherited an economy with a very small public sector by international standards and a budget outcome better than any in the industrialised world, bar a couple.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Compare all that with the economy we inherited back when we came into government&mdash;unemployment and inflation over 10 per cent, and a $25 billion budget deficit in today's dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government placed a dead hand on the economy when they took office. A `core' <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reality of this budget is that the dead hand is still there, so much so that the Treasury officials have observed in the budget papers that `possible confidence effects, while significant, do not fully offset the direct short&hyphen;term effects of the measures, resulting in a small net contractionary impact on activity in 1996&hyphen;97'. That's Treasury&hyphen;speak for saying that this budget not only does nothing for growth&mdash;it will reduce it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of undermining growth, the government should be promoting it. And with more growth the budget could be restored to balance without the need for savage cuts to valuable public programs. Higher growth destroys the case for savage budget cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By keeping growth up&mdash;by aiming for sustainable growth at the four per cent we averaged during our last four years in office&mdash;we also bring unemployment down. And unemployment, not the budget, is the No. 1 problem facing Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer (Mr Costello) says that saving is our No. 1 problem. We have no argument that Australia has long had a saving problem&mdash;and we did more to solve it, with the introduction of our national superannuation scheme, than any previous government. And now Mr Costello places a huge question mark over that achievement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have no argument that Australia's longer term economic interests are well served by restoring the budget to balance&mdash;&hyphen; that's why we, alone among postwar Australian governments, delivered successive surpluses in the late 1980s. But we say the best way to restore the budget to balance is through a moderate program of budget cuts, over the whole life of this parliament, which do not harm valuable public programs, and which do not harm growth&mdash;and which provide hope rather than despair for the jobless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Costello makes a virtue of the fact that this budget holds growth back so that in three years time, and with massive budget cuts, the surplus will be $1 billion. It suits the government to have low growth because low growth makes it appear as if bigger cuts are needed to restore the budget to balance. But with average growth close to four per cent it would <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3621"> be possible to achieve balance without savage budget cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the government's own admission, these cuts are not necessary to reduce the debt ratio: that would have happened anyway. And so far as reduction of the current account deficit is concerned, that's hardly going to change next year. These cuts are not being made for genuine reasons of economic necessity&mdash;they are being made to satisfy the Liberals' ideological obsession with reducing the role of government in Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Significantly, the burdens in this budget are not equally shared. It is a wrong&hyphen;headed interpretation of this budget that it soaks the rich as well as the poor. Mr Costello has leaped to the challenge of the Tax Commissioner to collect $800 million of avoided tax by the wealthiest Australians with a slash of his feather duster. $100 million and a bit of a look. Hopefully it will be collected voluntarily, he said. And have a bit of health insurance while you're at it, he invites wealthy Australians, or we'll give you a little snip of a levy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The burden is borne by the battlers, the job seekers, the students, the elderly and middle income Australia. He offers tax cuts. For a dual income family earning up to a total of $79,000, these tax cuts amount to $3.85 a week for each dependent child. But families want to educate their children. They want to use child care. They are worried about their kids getting an opportunity to work. They want to know that if their elderly parents need a nursing home bed, they will be able to afford it. They use public hospitals. They carry the burden of increased taxes and charges when the states are slashed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under successive Labor governments a generation of women has grown up with new expectations and hopes for the future. Meaningful employment, ongoing careers&mdash;a totally different world to their mothers and grandmothers. The female labour force is over 50 per cent larger today than it was in 1983. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) shows no sign of recognising this fact. But this fact is why successive Labor governments made available affordable, high quality child care. This recognised that many families do not have the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> means to allow one partner to leave the work force to care for children, even if they would like to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the last election the Liberals were at pains to promise that this quality child care&mdash;affordable and available on an equal basis to all Australians&mdash;would remain. But what do we find in the budget? We find a range of mean&hyphen;spirited measures which make child care more expensive for all families. For those using community based care, it will be $14 per child per week more. And this won't be all; $500 million is taken out of child care and it will be the parents who make up the difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Families contain people of all ages. What does this budget do for families of older Australians? We see a proposal which may force older Australians who need nursing home care, or their children, to find around $26,000 in entry fees. Nursing home residents also face a new daily fee of up to $34 per day, or $12,000 per year, depending on their income. The Prime Minister says that children should pay for their elderly parents to have a nursing home bed. This is yet another way this government is getting families to pay more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it gets worse. Many older families, frail but still living in their own homes, are dependent on the services, such as Meals on Wheels, provided by the home and community care program. These families are to be stung by greatly increased user fees. That is code for increased charges for Meals on Wheels and the like. The Prime Minister gives with one hand and takes away even more with the other. Like a man that comes up to you in the street and says, `Here's $5, now give me $7.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the health area, the Prime Minister promised to `retain Medicare in its entirety' and to provide a net increase in health funding. Instead, we have indirect cuts through reductions in the financial assistance grants to the states, and direct cuts to hospital funding grants. The combined effect is a cut of around $800 million over four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nastiest, if not the largest, of the government's health cuts is the abolition of the Commonwealth dental health program. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3622"> This program, which spends around $110 million a year, is exclusively directed at the provision of basic and emergency dental services to health card holders. The abolition of this program will reproduce the two to three year waiting lists which prompted the Commonwealth's intervention and which the program has substantially reduced. The budget speech contained the following explanation for the cuts:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As waiting times for public dental health services have now been reduced, funding for the Commonwealth dental programme will cease . . .</PARA>
<PARA>As if your teeth can be fixed once, and that's the only time you will need to go to a dentist!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another of the coalition's major betrayals in health is a big increase in the cost of prescription drugs. For a family with three children&mdash;and we all know how often they get sick at once&mdash;at $20 a script, that's $60 for the family, for just one visit to the chemist. And the increased pharmaceutical charge for pensioners breaks the Prime Minister's explicit promise to `maintain the real value of all pension benefits and other entitlements for low income earners'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But above all, there is the threat to bulk&hyphen;billing. The government says that it will maintain it, yet eliminates the CPI adjustment to doctors' fees. Bulk&hyphen;billing is voluntary. Hundreds of doctors will stop bulk&hyphen;billing with this change.</PARA>
<PARA>With another budget next May, you just have to wonder how many more changes, and how many fee increases, there are going to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We don't equally share the burden of this budget. Those who live in regional Australia carry it disproportionately. Regional communities have already been hit by a round of cuts. Many centres have lost their CES offices and tax offices. And now they lose their local Medicare offices, and they will pay more for the services that continue. They tell us that you don't have to worry about those Medicare offices because `we'll put a service into chemist shops'. What is that? If the chemist buys a fax, they will fax the bills in for you. That is what that means. That is the alternative to the Medicare offices that have proliferated through the country and provide a very important regional service.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the recent election the coalition asserted that regional communities were `Australia's forgotten people' and promised to `revitalise regional Australia'. Betrayal has been as swift as it is comprehensive. This government has abandoned regional Australia. In common with its approach to other issues of national importance, it has abandoned its responsibilities to lead, to coordinate and to cooperate with the people of Australia's heartland. When it comes to regional Australia, this coalition has quickly become a government in exile. They are absentee landlords with a big city focus&mdash;a government of capital city lawyers from leafy suburbs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Roads are regional Australia's vital arteries; something city dwellers often forget. Road funding through the national highway system has been slashed by $620 million. Even with the Pacific Highway and black spots programs, total road funding to the regions has been cut by $150 million over the next three years, and will be hit with an additional $45 million cut the year after that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Infrastructure projects in centres such as Townsville, Moe and Newcastle, with a total value of $150 million, have been abandoned. This signals the end of the effective and community&hyphen;building cooperation between business, all levels of government, local communities and unions that had become the hallmark of regional development under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Savage cuts to education spending and labour market programs will have a more than proportional impact in regional Australia. It is no wonder that the government's own document `Rebuilding Regional Australia' makes no direct mention of education&mdash;a document produced for regional Australia. All the benefits that the government is going to hand out to all its followers in regional Australia and not one mention of education in the entire document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Universities mean jobs and wages in regional areas. The impact of these education cuts on regional economies is huge. Yet this government intends to cut the funding for regional universities for every campus in every region in every state. Slashing labour market programs will have a punitive impact <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3623"> on both the regional unemployed and the local government authorities and organisations that have benefited from the programs under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC will not be able to insulate regional Australia from its massive cuts. National sporting events, news, current affairs and vital local weather and radio services for rural and regional Australians are threatened by the Prime Minister's decision to cut $65 million from the nation's public broadcaster. What a mean&hyphen;spirited decision that one is, despite all the promises given that the government would maintain funding for the ABC. What a vengeful cut. In terms of a budget this size, what a small amount that $65 million is but what a massive amount it is to the operation of that public broadcaster, an operation which gives us the guarantee of diversity in an Australian media becoming increasingly concentrated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) and his National Party have willingly collaborated with the Liberals in the betrayal of what they would have us believe is their constituency. These people are over&hyphen;represented in a ministry in which they lack the clout to stand up to ignorant Liberal colleagues and defend the interests of regional Australia. They deserve to share the retribution that awaits the Liberals in regional seats at the next election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposals for education deserve outright condemnation, not only because they cut off resources but also because they show the barrenness and prejudice of what passes for vision by this government. The government calls them `farsighted' and `equitable'. Those who are on the wrong end of them will call them vandalism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor set up and supported one of the most accessible higher education systems in the world. The government proposes to take so much funding out of universities that they will be harmed for years. Look at what this budget has done to young people, their parents and their expectations. Labor brought higher education within the reach of all young people in Australia, wherever they lived, whatever their circumstances.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has gone. If you or your parents are well&hyphen;off, you are okay. If not, you are not. This vandalism goes on in school and vocational education. Funding for schools will be cut, including resources for capital and literacy programs. That, I might say, applies to private schools as well as government schools. Assistance for students with disabilities will be stopped altogether. Vocational education will be cut and the government has abandoned its agreement to fund growth in the TAFE system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And remember this: we have crossed a line here. Now that universities and schools and TAFE are just other sources of revenue, who can be confident that there is not more of this to come? It's on for young and old. The Prime Minister has asked you to mortgage your kid's university education and he has told you to mortgage your old age accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has abdicated its responsibilities to Australian industry. Think of an industry where Australians have moved to the cutting edge, think of an industry that has made the hard yards in improved productivity and export competitiveness, think of key growth areas for small business and you will be thinking of some sector, enterprise or activity that has been damaged in this budget. The government fails to comprehend the fact that innovative export oriented industries are central to any strategy for future prosperity and jobs growth. Their treatment of the Australian Made Campaign is a powerful sign of the extent to which they have lost the plot. The green and gold logo symbolised the emerging hope for the future of Australian industry, and the government has strangled it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget does not slash programs to end rorts&mdash;it hacks away at success stories, and punishes innovators. Support for the manufacturing sector is to be cut by $336 million, or 60 per cent over the next three years. Exporters&mdash;&hyphen; whose efforts are crucial to our whole economic future&mdash;will lose $500 million over the same period. Industries critical to our export competitiveness and employment growth have been singled out, for example by the removal of the shipbuilding bounty and the abolition of the computer bounty.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3624">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me quote a gentleman who has run one of our several very effective shipbuilding enterprises, Robert Clifford of Incat in Tasmania. What does he say about the Liberal Party's comprehension of his position? I quote him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The modern shipbuilding industry in Australia has prospered with the bounty. The risk is without it we are going to be back the way we were&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't believe the Liberal government understands the economics of the industry. They just don't understand the importance of the bounty to us.</PARA>
<PARA>He concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not saying we will go from Tasmania but we're looking at our options.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an innovative Australian industry savaged by this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Research and development have been heavily set back by at least a decade. The broken promise that has seen the R&amp;D tax concession cut back will cost industry some $1.25 billion. When combined with the abolition of syndicated research, a total of $2.2 billion will be removed from research and development, to be replaced by a paltry $340 million in grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result will see Australian researchers&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I see, the gentleman says we support rorters, so Incat is a rorter. That is the allegation of the honourable member who interjects upon me. So all those magnificent research projects in the universities, all that magnificent encouragement of developing Australian R&amp;D, which usually goes offshore to be developed, developed here&mdash;that is a rort, too, is it?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result will see Australian researchers and Australian ideas move offshore, whilst a range of activities from medical research to information technology and electronics will stall for want of support in this country. Government support for exporters and industry has been crippled by cuts of $100 million from Austrade and $34 million from AusIndustry. These all represent broken promises. They amount to dishonest government and, just as certainly, they amount to foolish government. Manufacturers, exporters and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> researchers have been ill served by this budget and, consequently, so have we all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Above all, this budget betrays the jobless. This is a budget that will commit itself to no jobs targets between now and the end of the century. This budget ends the public labour exchange started by Ben Chifley. It shoves the unemployed into the hands of the inexperienced at the same time that it cuts nearly all of the programs that made the long&hyphen;term unemployed job ready.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sheer, ignorant prejudice has meant that the coalition has torn down the highly successful Working Nation employment and training programs&mdash;the very programs that were regularly praised by major employers groups, local governments and individual Australians who have been assisted back into the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And don't think that unemployment is not a mainstream issue. Three decades of technological change and industrial restructuring have meant that many have experienced the shock of redundancy previously only experienced by few. Since the election of the Howard government, redundancy has been legion in the public sector, in Telstra and in a wide range of industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians expect their Prime Ministers to stand up for the weak and forgotten. To stand above Treasurers and a desire to please the financial markets when necessity dictates. To have a sense of community. The unemployed, Aboriginals, the young, the aged, have always needed it. For Mr Costello's budget, the Prime Minister stood aside.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This isn't a government for communities. It's a government for elite opinion leaders who don't get meals on wheels, or use community child care. Who can afford to pay for tertiary education, dental care, nursing home care. Who won't notice the burden of higher state taxes and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is a cohesive community. We are an egalitarian community. Socially just communities are safe communities. Communities which deny opportunity are in the end denied security. This government attacks security in public sector employment, in the safety net <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3625"> when you are out of work, in effective access to public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget lays down the path to a two&hyphen;tier society. The Prime Minister is driven by division. All that is public, or shared, is cut and will be cut again. The message is, whatever you cannot pay for, you do not deserve. It is an old style tory budget, scapegoating the battlers and with a dead hand on the national tiller. It will be up to business, Australian workers and our community to work their way back to the low inflationary growth they had and the opportunity we provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a budget whose poisonous content day by day is gradually seeping out. Gradually, the press is seeing behind those opaque budget papers and are comprehending exactly what this budget means. Gradually, community groups and community members are beginning to understand exactly what it is that the government has in mind for them. And, as they do, over time, the support for this government's budget is going to gradually whittle away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a responsible opposition, we will subject its meanness to several tests. Where does a measure betray a promise? Where does it damage equity? Where does it fail to contribute to national savings? The community demands no less. Many measures fail these tests. Many are locked away in the appropriations legislation immune in the end to defeat, but not safe from rigorous criticism in our two Houses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Others, however, are about revenue raising or go to the heart of community entitlement programs. The government's measures on the higher education charges, on nursing home contributions and charges, and pharmaceutical benefits for pensioners and families, for example, can be rigorously opposed. We will oppose them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Prime Minister was elected promising Australians that they could be comfortable and relaxed and that he would make their lives more secure. Instead, he has hit them with massive changes, making their lives less secure. He promised a zone of comfort, but has delivered a nation more fearful than ever. Australians now face changes they do not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> need&mdash;changes that hit the family budget and will divide communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget is a mere irritant for the rich&mdash;but a disaster for the disadvantaged, and a matter of despair for the unemployed. It is the first chapter in a story of a new, unfair Australia. For all those who had hoped for a secure future for themselves and their kids, this is a budget of betrayal.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The expenditure within the UN is only audited every biennium. The UN expenditure figures shown, therefore, cover periods of two years. As the UN auditors have not yet produced the report for the biennium 1994&hyphen;95, which concluded on 31 December 1995, I would be happy to provide further details once the figures have been released in September 1996, should they be required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The UN auditors have confirmed that the only reliable source for UN expenditure figures are the financial statements produced on a biennial basis by the Board of Auditors and the figures provided are drawn from these statements. As a result of the high degree of autonomy among UN bodies and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> agencies, there is no consolidated financial statement produced for total UN expenditure by agencies, programs and funds supported by the regular budget or for peacekeeping expenditures. The figures below detail the total all funds expenditure of the UN system, including the UN General Fund, total peacekeeping activities, technical cooperation activities, and General and Other Trust Funds, in each year since 1986, but exclude the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The totals are the  result of an extrapolation of information contained in Reports of the UN Board of Auditors for the biennia ended 31 December 1991 and 31 December 1993:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra has advised me that it does not charge for unsuccessful STD, local or international calls to facsimile machines when the called machine is engaged. Telstra has also advised that it receives very few complaints from customers about charges for unsuccessful calls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of the complaints received, I understand that nearly all are due to the misconception that a customer is being charged for an unsuccessful call when in fact the call has been accepted by customer premises equipment (CPE) at the receiving end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, when a facsimile is attached to a PABX which accepts the call in a central location and then passes it on to the called extension, then the call is perceived as being successful from the point of view of the Telstra network.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A charge may also be incurred if the call is made overseas, where the called country's technology may accept the call before passing it on to its destination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other common sources of this misunderstanding are when a customer has call diversion and the called party does not realise the call has been accepted, the end service is busy or not in service or when a called party quickly hangs up believing it is a call to a wrong number. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3650"> </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) With reference to the accident involving the De Havilland DH&hyphen;104 Dove, VH&hyphen;DHD, at Essendon, Victoria on 3 December 1993, the Minister's office was provided with a copy of the Bureau of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3651"> Air Safety Investigation's final report on 12 April 1996.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) It is normal for an aircraft to take off into the wind. However, aircraft flight manuals may make provision for aircraft to take off with a crosswind or downwind component or a combination of both.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The aircraft involved in the Essendon accident was not instructed to take off to the south.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian tax system does not seek to discriminate between companies on the basis of nationality. Australia follows the accepted international practice of taxing resident companies on their worldwide income (with appropriate recognition of taxes already paid overseas), and taxing non&hyphen;resident companies only on their domestic&hyphen;sourced income. Foreign and domestic companies are subject to the same rate of corporate income tax of 36 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dividend payments by a foreign&hyphen;owned company to its overseas parent are taxed gross at the dividend withholding tax rate of 30 per cent (or generally 15 per cent if Australia has a double taxation agreement with the parent company's country of residence). However, if the dividend is paid out of Australian&hyphen;sourced profits that have already been subject to company tax, the dividend withholding tax is reduced to zero under Australia's dividend imputation system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's tax legislation also includes a range of anti&hyphen;avoidance measures to counter profit shifting and ensure that Australia receives its fair <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> share of revenue from multinational corporations operating in Australia.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr Costello</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Government believes that the banking needs of most rural communities will continue to be met by the mainstream banks and financial service providers, including through services using continuing technological developments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where this is not the case, there is considerable potential for rural communities to assume responsibility for the development of financial services to meet their needs. One such model is the development of community based credit union services. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3659"> The Commonwealth through its credit initiative, Creditcare, is helping rural communities access financial services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Creditcare is a two year pilot project that involves a consortium of departments (Social Security; Primary Industries and Energy; Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs; and Housing and Regional Development) and the Credit Union Services Corporation (Australia) Ltd (CUSCAL).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pilot is targeting communities in rural and remote areas of Australia where there are no basic financial or banking services available. The project involves CUSCAL field staff working with targeted communities to assess their financial services needs and to develop the most appropriate solution to meet those needs. In most cases this will result in providing existing credit union branch facilities or the development of new community&hyphen;based credit unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The project will offset rural bank closures and should have some direct employment benefits for rural and remote communities as local credit union facilities are established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be of particular benefit to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities who often have no local banking facilities of any kind. The project should also assist in improving the operation of regional economies and the creation of regional savings pools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To date 36 communities have been approached by Creditcare, with ten outlets already established and eight others to be operational within two months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">More generally, alternative avenues are increasingly available to access financial institutions as a result of such developments as EFTPOS, ATMs and Girobank facilities at post offices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The Government is mindful of the economic problems that confront many rural communities. It is difficult, however, to isolate the particular economic impact of bank branch closures. As noted above in response to part (1), there are a range of possible channels for delivering financial services to these communities. It is likely, moreover, that branch closures are a symptom of broader underlying economic trends impacting on the affected communities and on the competitive position of banks in the financial system. The latter is a facet that will, of course, be canvassed by the Government's Financial System Inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) No. A banking authority does not include community service obligations. The Government is very conscious, however, of the need for all Australians to have access to efficient and competitive financial services. This is one of the objectives for the establishment of the Financial System Inquiry. Should certain groups in the community <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> experience problems in gaining access to banking services, there may be ways in which this can be addressed, including through such initiatives and developments as those outlined in part (1).</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra has advised that its charging arrangements are not predicated upon electoral boundaries and that the charging arrangements in the electoral division of Werriwa are consistent with those applying to other similar areas throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telephone charges are based on a system known as group charging which groups telephone numbers into zones which in turn are grouped to form charge districts. Both charge zones and charge districts contain a point, known as a Charge Point, from which call charges are calculated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Local call access is available to customers in the same zone or adjoining zones and are generally available within an average radius of 32 km of the zone charge point (although the actual distance called will vary depending on the location of the calling and called customers within their respective zones). Trunk rates, based on the radial distance between zone charging centres, apply to other calls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the division of Werriwa comprises the charging zones of Liverpool, Campbelltown and part of the Engadine zone, call charges to a particular destination from within the electorate of Werriwa will vary, depending on the distance to the destination of the call.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Community Call rates are a concessional call which provides a low cost link between customers in specific outer metropolitan zones for calls to the metropolitan area, or parts of the metropolitan area which resulted from the 1988 Parliamentary Inquiry into Telstra's charging policies around capital cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Community Call rate is currently 25 cents for 3 to 4&half; minutes depending on the time of day and the day of the week that the call is made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Community Calls are itemised on accounts just as STD calls are, except in the few instances where exchanges have not yet been upgraded to permit calling line identification (CLI).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Liverpool and Engadine charge zones have local call access to the Sydney charge zone. Calls from Campbelltown zone to Sydney are charged at the concessional Community Call rate which is currently 25 cents for 3 to 4&half; minutes depending on the time of day the call is made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Optus advises that it follows Telstra's boundaries for simplicity and that it does not define the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> community call rate separately but classes these calls as long distance calls.
