<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill essentially puts in place measures which were announced by Labor in the innovation statement in December of last year. Those changes seek to limit the ability of companies to obtain the concession for past expenditure&mdash;the so-called gravedigging.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main effect of this bill is to insert new provisions into the Industry Research and Development Act, allowing a company to register prospectively for the R&amp;D tax concession; to provide new format and content requirements for applications for registration for the concession; to provide for the validation of certain decisions of the IR&amp;D Board made under the IR&amp;D legislation, subject to the exercise by applicants of their administrative review rights; and to limit the concession obtainable under section 73B of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to activities registered by the IR&amp;D Board for a particular year of income. Activities not registered by the board for the year of income in which they were undertaken will not be eligible for the concession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Principally, the bill closes off access to the concession for research conducted well into the past. Companies must lodge applications for registration for the concession within six months of the end of the income year in which the research and development expenditure was incurred. Under transitional arrangements in the bill, no registrations may be made in respect of the 1993-94 and 1994-95 income years if the applications were received after 7 June 1996. No registrations for research and development expenditure incurred in the 1992-93 and earlier income years may be made after 6 December 1995, even if those applications were lodged prior to that date.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have already said, the bill is essentially Labor's bill, and Labor will therefore support its passage in the House. However, we do have concerns in relation to one provision and have therefore supported reference of the bill to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have received a number of representations from companies, which benefit from the concession, about the anomalous effect of this provision. These companies have engaged in genuine research and development activities in 1992-93 or earlier income years and had lodged applications with the Industry Research and Development Board on or before the cut-off date&mdash;6 December 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, if the board has not processed those applications and registered such companies for the concession by 6 December, they will not be eligible to claim the tax concession. Through no fault of their own, they have done all that was required of them. On the surface at least, this appears to be an unfair application of the innovation statement decision, and it accordingly bears further investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have asked the Senate committee to look at the issue and, in particular, to look at the revenue implications of an amendment to the bill which would rectify this anomaly by allowing those companies which had lodged their applications by 6 December to be considered by the Industrial Research and Development Board for the concession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> So, overall, subject to that point, Labor will support the bill. However, we strongly oppose a number of other measures taken in the budget on research and development: namely, the reduction of the level of concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent and the abolition of research and development syndication. Taken together, these two measures will rip $2.2 billion from the clever country over the next four years in what must constitute the most massive assault on our national research effort in living memory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that mouths the cliches of industry support, that pretends to support small business but which has cut away at the support that underpins the growth of small, clever, export oriented firms. To <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4506"> give one example, Flexichem is a small Adelaide based chemical company with exports to the value of half a million dollars, import replacement worth $400,000 and which employs six full&hyphen;time people. The company claims concessions worth around $25,000 per year. According to their managing director, Dr Geoffrey Swincer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can say first hand that innovative businesses are feeling very uncertain about their future and there is a great reluctance to invest in anything beyond necessities until this matter is resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that the 150% tax deduction scheme is the most efficient industrial research scheme of recent years.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Other">If the current policy direction is not reversed, it will be necessary for companies like ours to employ less staff [and] stop doing R&amp;D . . . which will mean less exports and less import replacement.</PARA>
<PARA>This encapsulates the problem with the budget. The budget has cut for the sake of it, cut regardless of the consequences and cut into programs which do not cost the nation but which are investments for the nation. They produce dividends for the nation&mdash;dividends in exports, import replacement, diversified industry and jobs. Why would you get rid of something that was as successful as that? Why would you be so myopic in the search for the budget bottom line that you would cut the capacity for this country to be clever, innovative and to produce and expand? Why would you do it in a way that will impact negatively on what could otherwise be a higher growth outcome?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget decision to cut the research and development tax concession is a particularly cynical move because it breaches a specific election commitment. I see both the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) at the table. The minister for science, as the then shadow minister, ran around the country telling businesses all over the place that they were committed to science, that they were committed to research and development and that under them, once elected, the 150 per cent tax concession would stay.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He went to the electorate and said, `Under us, have no doubt at all: the 150 per cent tax concession will remain.' It could not have been a clearer commitment. It was repeated often because industry knew that these programs work, that Labor had introduced them and that Labor had continued to stick with them despite pressures from time to time to reduce them. We knew they worked and we were prepared to back industry. We were prepared to back clever industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was one of those promises that we now have to accept did not qualify as a core promise. I am not too sure whether the minister went out and told these companies, `It is just a promise that we will give you research and development and keep the 150 per cent. It is not&mdash;wink, wink&mdash;a core promise, though.' Do you think they understood the code? Well, they will understand it next time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This decision is cynical because little effort has been made to justify the decision as anything but a revenue grab. Again, according to a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>, when asked why he broke his promise and ratted on industry the science minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It had to be reduced to 125 per cent in the budget to enable retention of the diesel fuel rebate.</PARA>
<PARA>It was the trade&hyphen;off for the diesel fuel rebate. So understand this connection: the 150 per cent R&amp;D tax concession was the price for propping up Tim Fischer's leadership of the National Party. Not a very clever investment, I would suggest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4507"> Last year more than 3,000 companies claimed against the tax concession for their research. I wonder whether they think it was a clever investment. Is propping up the failing leadership of the National Party more important than advancing the clever country? Is propping up the National Party leadership the price we have to pay for seeing innovation go backwards; for seeing production, diversity and jobs go backwards? Do the Australian people think Tim Fischer is worth that much? I doubt it very much, but they need to understand the connection. The only basis upon which the 150 per cent went to 125 per cent&mdash;and we know it occurred in the last week of budget deliberations&mdash;was the insis tence by the National Party on the retention of the diesel fuel rebate. They won that but at the cost of the clever country. A disgraceful outcome!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the decision was more than cynical; it was also not clever. The research and development tax concession has had an enormous positive impact on Australia's employment and on our international competitiveness. The concession was introduced in 1986. It was specifically designed to address the key weakness of Australia's research effort: the appallingly low level of business sector research. Its success was almost instantaneous because, from 1987-88 when Labor introduced it to 1994-95, total business spending on research and development almost doubled. It now stands at $3.4 billion. It would not have happened to that extent but for this concession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995 a report by the Industry Commission, which the government of the day is very fond of quoting when it suits it, concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 150 per cent tax concession has brought net benefits to the Australian economy. The commission recommends that the 150 per cent tax concession be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA>The problem with this government is that it commissions reports but takes no notice of them, or it takes account of reports and then implements decisions which are clearly contrary to them. It uses the reports only when it suits it. But I go further. The report by the Bureau of Industry Economics found that 23 per cent of companies surveyed reported that the concession had been critical to their decision to proceed with research and development projects. One of those you might have seen reference to today on the front page of the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  concerns the breakthrough on salmonella. That research would not have been undertaken if they could not have got the 150 per cent. They say, speaking to them today, that they will continue that research but, no doubt, it will be at a lesser level. It never would have got started without the 150 per cent. The 150 per cent tax concession was critical as an incentive up-front as there are all sorts of risks associated with getting these things going. This occurred some years ago. If the 150 per cent had not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been there, we would not have this breakthrough today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to ask yourself, now that the 150 per cent concession has been cut to 125 per cent, how many decisions are being put on ice. How many people are saying to themselves, `This is very risky business, and although we believe we have something here, we are not prepared to do it here if we can get bigger incentives overseas'? In countries overseas it is not just 125 per cent some of them pay; some of them pay 200 per cent. We were often as a government under pressure to review whether the amount should be 150 versus 125, but we never looked at it from the perspective of the budget bottom line. We looked at it from the point of view of what makes Australian industry get into the game. What gives them a chance to compete against those countries that do not operate on a level playing field, that have access to these incentives?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Research and development can travel. If some other country is offering a better deal overall&mdash;a better incentive is not the only thing that comes into it; the incentive is only an important component&mdash;why would they do it here? This is the problem. We will see more research and development going offshore because of this government's short-sighted decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These companies said that the 150 per cent concession was critical to their decision to proceed with research and development projects, and 50 per cent of companies surveyed by the Bureau of Industry Economics said that their research and development would have been lower if research and development deductibility were reduced. This Bureau of Industry Economics report also found that the concession benefits flow beyond the firms undertaking the research and development. It has a flow-on effect. It spills over to other companies that can draw off the technology and develop it. The report also found that the estimated net social return was positive in respect of the Australian owned company. In other words, these commitments, these incentives, are not costs to the budget; they return benefits to the nation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4508">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what government should be about. It should be about stimulating industry, stimulating innovation, getting economic growth going, being prepared to work in partnership with industry, providing these sorts of incentives to try to match the sorts of things that are being done overseas and to make sure that we keep in this country what we are good at. What we are very good at is extraction of the natural resources. We also have a very high skill base. The trick is combining them, putting clever people with natural resources. But you do not do that unless you are prepared to encourage research and development, and that is why Labor did commit heavily to these programs. That is why it is a tragedy that this budget now sees them cut&mdash;one cut, one abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government fails to understand is that the job is far from over. While our business spending on research and development compared with international standards is significantly better than it was because of the Labor programs that doubled it, we still have a long way to go. We are only 19th on the international league table of 24 when it comes to business investment in research and development. We are at the top of the tree in terms of public expenditure but when it comes to business investment we are always at the bottom. Labor has dragged us up towards a better position but we have to persist with these programs if we want to make further inroads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat: these programs are an investment; they are not a cost. As a result of these cuts we will see growth held back. The budget acknowledges that. The budget says that we will only grow this year at best 3&half; per cent and 3&half; per cent for every other year. Labor in its last three years grew at 4.2 per cent because it supported programs like this. It was prepared to make the investment off the budget. Because it was prepared to make the investment, we got better economic growth. We know what comes from better economic growth&mdash;more jobs. That is what the prime issue has to be about. But they have to be not just any sorts of jobs; they have to be the clever jobs, they have to be jobs associated with innovation and value adding and natural <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> resources, not moving away from a commodity base but doing more with the commodities before they leave the country. You cannot do that unless you are prepared to invest in research and development. Now is not the time to drop the momentum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the syndication aspect of the research and development cuts. Like the cut to the tax concession from 150 to 125 per cent, which I have just been talking about, the complete abolition of research and development syndication is an exercise in political cynicism. Not only did the coalition promise to retain syndication during the election campaign; they consistently opposed measures taken by Labor to tighten up on applications to ensure that only genuine research was approved. In the 1995 budget, Labor moved to close off access to the 150 per cent R&amp;D tax concession for private sector tax exempt bodies. The coalition&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;opposed those elements, claiming it was being applied retrospectively. They cited in support of their position syndicates such as the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute. The institute submitted their application before the 9 May deadline and was advised it would be considered at the June Industry Research and Development Board meeting but that, under transitional arrangements, they would no longer have their application considered. What do we have now? We have a list of syndicates which submitted applications to the IR&amp;D Board and were told by the board that their applications would, in all likelihood, be approved. All of them were cut off without notice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4509"> Effectively there are three stages of approval for syndication. We are saying that, if any one of those stages has been approved, that should be sufficient to keep these syndicates in the race. Otherwise you are doing nothing more than retrospectively applying your decision. We all know you opposed retrospectivity when you were in opposition. If you are to be consistent at all you have got to ensure that those applications that were submitted and which have gone through some stage of approval still have the opportunity to be considered and fully approved. That means that you have got to make the money avail able. There is no point in the IR&amp;D Board going on to ultimate approval&mdash;which it would have done in these cases&mdash;if it has not got the money to do it. We are saying that it should be given the chance to be heard and that it should be given the opportunity for approval to be finalised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting that the minister wrote to a number of these syndicates on 22 July and told them that their applications were still being considered&mdash;he could not interfere in them, of course&mdash;and that they should persist with the IR&amp;D approval process. The very next day the scheme was abolished. What sort of minister writes one day telling people they are still in the game and abolishes the scheme the next day? He either does not know what he is signing or he is being rolled over by Treasury. He is having the decision imposed on him, even though he told industry the day before that they could still have their syndicates considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a retrospective application. It is not just a broken promise; it is a retrospective application. Why do you encourage people to expend time, effort and money putting these proposals forward and then abolish the scheme? You abolished it with no notice; you abolished it with a press release. That is what you did. There are something like 46 companies on what has been termed in the industry as the `A' list of syndicates. They must be allowed to proceed unless the government can produce new information to show otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from the budget measures which the coalition opposed and which I referred to earlier, Labor went further to tighten syndication in the innovation statement last year. We announced new and more strict finance scheme guidelines for R&amp;D syndication. Again, the coalition opposed the tightening measures. Its science policy for the 1996 election stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changes to the syndicated research and development tax concession guidelines may well result in the drying up of one of the few effective forms of venture capital available in Australia to fund research and development.</PARA>
<PARA>What cant! What hypocrisy! You were out there telling people in the election campaign, `We'll keep 150 per cent. We won't tighten <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the R&amp;D guidelines for syndication.' As soon as the coalition were in government&mdash;and without any discussion with the industry&mdash;they abolished one scheme and cut the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that the checks and balances were in place for the research and development scheme. We put them in place last year in the tightening up process, together with the appointment of Mr Trevor Boucher. Mr Trevor Boucher is the former distinguished taxation commissioner.</PARA>

For the government to accuse Labor of supporting the rorters is gross hypocrisy. Why? We tightened the system. We appointed Trevor Boucher, and essentially the system became foolproof.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4510">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My challenge to the minister is: show us where, in any of the `A' list companies, rorting is apparent. Demonstrate that. I know you put out a press release with four examples in it when you abolished the scheme saying, `This is the reason we abolished it.' Not one of those four got money. Yet this is the basis on which you scrap the scheme. But my challenge is different. Go to the 46 that are on the list now. Go to the 46 that you have retrospectively wiped off the books and tell us where they have rorted. If not, you have got to allow them to proceed in all good faith and in all good interests of the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make our position crystal clear. We, as an opposition, support the removal of rorts where the existence is proved. If there are loopholes in syndication which allow rorts, they should be closed off. That was always our practice in government, a practice which the coalition opposed. I am happy, at any time, to receive a briefing from the minister about the loopholes, if they still exist. I would also be interested to hear why such loopholes, if they still exist according to him, cannot be closed off. Until strong evidence is shown to the contrary, we will continue to oppose throwing out the baby with the bathwater because that is what is involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are saying, without any evidence, that there are rorts but, instead of producing the evidence, you abolish the scheme. By all means close the rorts, but do not abolish the scheme. This is an approach which is favoured by eminent Australians such as Sir Gustav Nossal. Writing with characteristic understatement in the international science journal <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nature</EMPHASIS>, he described the decision to abolish syndication as `a pity', but he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would have been fairly straightforward to close the tax loopholes without axing the scheme altogether.</PARA>
<PARA>If this had been a genuine attempt to support research, rather than a blatant revenue grab, the government would have replaced syndication with a scheme of equal value. Instead, it has cut $2.2 billion from the research effort and replaced it with a grants scheme called <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> START worth $340 million. It should be renamed `finish', because that is what will happen to research and development in this country. From $2.2 billion down to $340 million, and you expect us to become a clever country! I quote Gustav Nossal again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sums foreseen for Start are much smaller than those saved on syndication. The scheme will also take some time to get going, and in the meantime much momentum will be lost.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think those members of the backbench who are concerned about this debate can have a better authority. Don't just take it from us. Don't just take it from the industry which, you might say, is a special pleader. Go to the people who have been involved in research in this country throughout its history. Go to the people who have made it eminent. Go to the people who have put us on the world stage because of what we have been able to develop because, as a government, we have supported research; but take away the programs and it simply will not happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the very least, the proposals on the IR&amp;D Board's `A' list&mdash;approved by Trevor Boucher but retrospectively shelved&mdash;should be allowed to proceed. We will essentially support the bill, but I can promise a rougher road for job destroying industrial research and development cuts. How many jobs will have to be lost overseas before the government wakes up to the damage it is doing? This is another reason why the predictions are that unemployment will rise to nine per cent under this government's budget policy, and we will seek to prevent it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

The government has, as its brief, to fix up the problems that you created and that you started to improve but did not go far enough in the direction of improving in the system. That has been left to us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4511">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government recognises the effect and the positive impact of R&amp;D for business and technology and, when applied appropriately, R&amp;D is to be restored to its primary purpose: support for business and innovation. This government will put into action the words and the empty rhetoric that we were left with in December 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this bill addresses is the slothful way the previous government moved in doing something about making R&amp;D better value. What did it do? The previous speaker spoke of statistics. They doubled, but I will address the dollars and cents issue later on. The previous speaker used statistics, but really statistics can hide and mask a measure of sins. I have a positive outlook for R&amp;D under the auspices of this government, not the doom and gloom perceived by the previous speaker. No growth: I think not. If anything, our policies will be designed for growth and, putting it in its proper perspective, good value for taxpayers' money, not what we got before&mdash;a rorted system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that we, the current government, will put R&amp;D into an accountable perspective. We agree with your sentiment on the importance of R&amp;D and we acknowledge the attempts by you to address this in government. But it was too late. And what happened? We are now on the government side of the House and you are on the other. Who put us in the 19th position? Labor put us in the 19th position as far as the estimates of value and the effort that we put into R&amp;D are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Industry and research development is what this government is committed to. This bill proposes the changes and we are going to deliver them. We will do this by both stopping the unintended use of the concession and making the administrative procedures better suited to the needs of industry. The amendments bring the R&amp;D tax concession program closer to its aim of stimulating the performance of R&amp;D which, in the absence of a government subsidy, would not be undertaken. This is achieved, as has been stated by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), by reducing retrospective access to the subsidy under section 39J to a reason able period after the end of the year of income in which the R&amp;D activities are conducted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In speaking to this bill, Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the fact that during the election campaign the coalition endorsed the revenue protection measures proposed by the previous government with respect to the operation of the 150 per cent R&amp;D tax concession policy. The government will implement these measures, subject to minor modifications which will improve the operation of the tax concession. This bill confirms measures the previous government announced in their innovation statement in December 1995 and endorsed by the coalition prior to the March federal election. Our government is, in effect, meeting our election commitments and at the same time putting into place changes proposed by the former administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, while the previous government proposed changes to the IR&amp;D legislation, they have since walked away from these measures. Under the previous government the administration of R&amp;D was in a parlous state. Once again, it has been left up to the coalition government to take the initiative and turn words into action. It has been the job of this government to act in the most responsible and accountable way with respect to R&amp;D programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the aims of this bill is to address the proliferation of gravedigging, not to be confused with the opposition's current scaremongering of elderly and frail nursing home clients. Gravedigging was the practice of consultants ploughing through years of companies' accounts looking for a tax sweetener for their clients. This practice generates no additional R&amp;D but results in significant cost to revenue and runs counter to the intention of the concession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A secondary industry has developed around this retrospective access to R&amp;D tax concession whereby a consultant approaches a company and offers to identify activities conducted as early as 1985 which qualify for the concession in return for a percentage of the obtained deduction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The intent of this bill is to end gravedigging. This will be manifest by requiring <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4512"> the companies to lodge their application for registration with the IR&amp;D Board within six months of the end of the relevant income year. The scope of this activity is so extensive that measures are expected to result in revenue protection totalling $235 million over the next three financial years. What a saving!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has stated that other advantages and improvements will be made to the registration process, such as advanced registration and registration of activities which also encourage companies to direct their creativity towards new technologies and new markets. The specific measures which will improve the operation of tax concessions were released in a joint statement by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism on 3 June this year. The statement said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures, which are to operate from the time of the original announcement, 2.30 PM EST 6 December 1995 are to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> apply the measures on the basis of a year of income rather than a financial year. This is the basis of registration under the current law and is practical for different tax accounting periods;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> affirm the announcement of the former Government that there be no new registrations for expenditures incurred in the 1992&hyphen;93 and earlier income years, irrespective of when applications for such registration may have been made;</PARA>
<PARA>The statement goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> allow time for registration for expenditures incurred in the 1993-94, 1994-95 and subsequent income years to apply on the basis of lodgement of application for registration and not actual registration. That is</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> in respect of years of income ending after 6 December 1995, taxpayers may lodge applications up to six months following the income year in which the expenditure was incurred; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> taxpayers may also lodge applications for registration in respect of the 1993-94 and 1994-95 transitional years of income at any time before 7 June 1996 (within six months following the former Government's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Innovate Australia</EMPHASIS>  announcement); and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> an application cannot be amended after the lodgement time for the application has expired.</PARA>
<PARA>The government has already allowed for a one-off transitional period of six months, ending on 7 June 1996, during which com <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> panies could continue to submit applications for registration, in respect of the tax concession, for the 1993-94 and 1994-95 income years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of changes have been introduced to bring the administration of the research and development tax concession into line with the self-assessment principles of taxation administration. These include reducing the obligations of the research and development board prior to registering a company and introducing the ability to set fees by regulation in relation to applications and requests to the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill represents a huge boost to the integrity of the research and development tax concession which is long overdue. This amendment begins the process of returning the program to its rightful focus of encouraging new research and new development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effectiveness of the scheme has been examined in recent years with various studies by the Industry Commission, the Bureau of Industry Economics and the Australian National Audit Office. The various studies were used by the Treasury, which examined the cost-effectiveness of the tax concession in the winter of 1995 edition of the economic round&hyphen;up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to Chris Field, both the Industry Commission and the Bureau of Industry Economics found that the scheme provided net benefits to Australia. Both sides of the House agree on this point. The Industry Commission found that as much as 90 per cent of R&amp;D investment would have occurred without tax concession, while the Bureau of Industry Economics found that the concession encouraged between 10 per cent and 17 per cent of R&amp;D expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government repeatedly acknowledged the need to encourage Australian firms to increase their expenditure on R&amp;D, yet in 1993 the Bureau of Industry Economics report conceded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amount of additional R&amp;D expenditure induced by the concession appears to be between 10 and 17 per cent of eligible R&amp;D. This implies that 83 to 90 per cent of R&amp;D would be undertaken even in the absence of the concession.</PARA>
<PARA>The Labor opposition boast the statistic that BERD had doubled, as the previous speaker <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4513"> alluded to, in the period 1981 to 1993. What they did not quote was the very low base from which the statistic was generated, making even the smallest increase appear proportionately large. Therein lies the dilemma. It sounds good. Only 20 per cent of R&amp;D expenditure was on genuinely innovative projects&mdash;hardly a high record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here is the significant finding: investment decisions are often based on the tax consequences of the investment rather than the nature of the R&amp;D being undertaken, particularly when investment syndicates are involved. There you have it: a government sponsored taxation benefiting scheme masquerading as a research and development program. One has to wonder, like the previous speaker, how many genuinely innovative ideas and industrial ventures were stifled or put on the backburner because some companies were more interested in the tax concession than promoting employment, fostering manufacturing industry, building an innovative product and strengthening our business edge and wealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government and the former speaker talk about hypocrisy. Here it is, ladies and gentlemen. The former government's response was released on 6 December 1995 and foreshadowed a tightening of certain eligibility criteria, but not before the ramifications of this were leaked and there was a surge of applications submitted to catch the last wave of government assistance for tax concessions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As stated previously, our government recognised the need to close this concession loophole. Here we are today restoring research and development to its proper place&mdash;as an incentive for business and companies to promote innovations, ideas, industry and intellectual property that will truly generate wealth and prosperity in the marketplace and not in the bank accounts of financial advisers and consultants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Details of tax expenditure issued by the Treasury estimate that the scheme cost $400 million in 1992&hyphen;93 and&mdash;it gets better&mdash;$525 million in 1993&hyphen;94. The estimated revenue protection expected as a result of the passage of this measure is $235 million over three <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> years&mdash;good value for the Australian taxpayers. For these reasons I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting that the member for Bowman (Mrs West) spent some time talking about gravedigging this morning. I would have thought that when it comes to the question of research and development the principal gravedigging that seems to be going on is of Liberal Party and coalition election promises. In relation to the question of syndicated research, for example, the policy was quite explicit. The science document states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . changes to the syndicated research and development tax concession guidelines may well result in the drying up of one of the few effective forms of venture capital available in Australia to fund research and development.</PARA>
<PARA>I will come back to that a little later. This legislation, as my colleague the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) has indicated, basically has the support of the opposition inasmuch as it implements announcements made by the former government in the context of the innovation statement of December 1995. The legislation, with one area of exception, which is being looked at by a Senate committee, is consistent with that position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exception the opposition does have significant concerns about relates to a point of difference between the bill and the innovation statement. There is a provision in the bill that closes off access to concessions from applications for the 1992-93 income years and earlier which were not registered prior to 6 December 1995, even if lodged before that date. That is a technical matter that needs to be looked at, in our judgment, in order to ensure that no injustices are done by the creation of an anomaly in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the worst aspect of what the government is about in its approach to research and development is this myopic view of Australia's longer term needs in relation to our positioning on research. The member for Bowman was talking about a number of issues, but companies simply do not have to operate in Australia to carry out research and development if there is not an appropriate environment to  encourage them to do so. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4514"> They can carry out those activities, in many instances, in all sorts of places within our region or elsewhere. In order for this country to achieve and maintain high, sustainable rates of growth, to improve our trading position and to improve our competitiveness in our region, we simply need to be competitive in this area and offer a package of measures and support for our businesses that are competitive elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is, I believe, one of the crucial issues facing the Australian community because I believe there are very few things in Australia now more important than ensuring that this country diversifies its manufacturing base and continues to build on the achievements of the last decade in that respect. That diversification has to be in the areas of production of goods and services which are described as knowledge intensive goods and services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Elaborately transformed manufactures are an important component of what represents the fastest growing area of world trade. They are industries that offer the people of this country opportunities&mdash;provided we are assuming and holding and, in fact, increasing market share&mdash;to achieve significantly increased incomes. Those industries offer the opportunity of stretching out the balance of payments constraint on our growth, which has historically been such a key inhibitor in Australia. Research and development activity is a key in that respect. The budget that is currently before this House is really a disaster in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had the spectacle in the parliament of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) last week really obscuring the key betrayal of trust that this government are carrying out in respect of their reductions in the tax concession on R&amp;D and the abolition of syndication by pretending that they are about some sort of elimination of tax rorts. Even for the Liberals that is a bit rich when one takes account of the fact that it was they in opposition who opposed some of the tightening up measures that the former Labor government had been undertaking with respect to the elimination of rorts.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the member for Hotham again today gave the minister for industry the opportunity to deny that the four examples of alleged rorts that were given by the government in its decision to abolish syndication were actually picked up by the checks and balances in the system that Labor had in place, and did not proceed. Once again in this House this morning Minister Moore has had the opportunity to deny or amplify the comments that he was quoted as making as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 1 August. He was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, they've been knocked back in the research and development committee which do the research and evaluation of the various projects.</PARA>
<PARA>I am referring to the very examples which he and the Treasurer were touting around in this House last week as being some sort of rationale for abolishing syndication and tightening up generally. Yet he has not chosen to amplify his position this morning and has not denied the assertions from the member for Hotham that the four that he was referring to in the House last week are the same ones that he acknowledged on 1 August were knocked back. The government's credibility in this respect is pretty narrow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Hotham indicated, the government really is in the process of throwing out the baby with the bathwater in relation to this. The member for Hotham referred to a very gentle comment by a person who is probably Australia's eminent scientist, Sir Gustav Nossal. Sir Gustav was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian </EMPHASIS>saying somewhat stronger things on 27 August. The article says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nation's leading scientist, Professor Sir Gustav Nossal, warned yesterday that Australia's future&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is very strong&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">had been jeopardised by the federal Budget cuts to tertiary education and incentives for research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sir Gustav, the president of the Australian Academy of Science, said the Budget threatened the gains made in recent years in redressing the traditional imbalance in Australia between fundamental research and applied R&amp;D that led to industrial innovation. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4515"> </PARA>
<PARA>These are very strong words from such an eminent scientist and words that it would appear the government is not heeding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A series of other articles have appeared in the media in relation to the government's budget announcements. There was a particularly interesting article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 27 August, of which I will quote several sections. It is written by Peter Roberts under the `Best practice' section. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australians, and especially those who drafted last week's federal Budget, seem to have a peculiarly dated idea of the role played by science and technology in a modern economy.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on and makes a whole series of points. One very interesting one really goes to some of the points that the member for Bowman was making. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Transnational corporations will rightly see Australia as a less desirable place for R&amp;D which will lead to fewer innovative activities with their potential to generate manufacturing and service industry opportunities. And indigenous small and medium-sized businesses will find the remaining grants and deductions far less easy to access.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a classic case of throwing out the baby with the bathwater.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just so that the discussion does not proceed on too abstract a level, perhaps I can give some examples of the sorts of activities that are highly unlikely to be replicated in future as a result of the approach that this government is taking by its extraordinarily short&hyphen;sighted approach to research and development. In my own city of Melbourne a company called JNA Telecommunications has been involved in the development of the AS200 multiplexers under syndication for supply to telecommunications carriers. That product is expected to generate about $60 million internationally and $30 million domestically over the next three years. A very high-tech, sophisticated technology, commercialised through the operation of R&amp;D syndication, is precisely the sort of activity which is now in serious doubt in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Another Melbourne company, SCITEC, is a communications systems supplier and is listed on the ASX. It employs 176 people. Syndication financed about $17 million investment in R&amp;D at a time when the com pany was severely capital constrained. Nucleus Ltd used syndication to finance the development of the defibrillator, a high technology implantable medical device.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A company in New South Wales, EOS, financed some $19 million of R&amp;D through syndication on fire control, navigation systems, avionics and computer systems. Another company, ABCL, is a manufacturer of advanced laboratory instruments that assists in the processing of tissue and smear samples used to diagnose various illnesses, including cancer. A syndicate formed involving the McFarlane Burnett Centre, the New South Wales Blood Bank and the Amrad Corporation has been making very important gains in AIDS through the syndication process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not talking abstractly; we are talking about tangible, leading edge technologies in which Australia has an outstanding research base, where the opportunities that arise ought to be picked up aggressively and commercialised by any government, given the importance of that type of leading edge industry for Australia's future. What does this government do? It sends all the wrong and inappropriate signals. It tears up its own election commitments. That absolutely ought to be condemned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reference was made earlier to the START scheme as being some sort of substitute. But Mark Abernethy, in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 27 August, put the argument that that particular scheme is going to severely disadvantage small businesses in Australia, as opposed to the existing arrangements that are in the process of being scrapped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4516"> Let me go back to some basics. The critical point needs to be made that Australia under successive governments has always had a fairly enviable record in public sector research, but in the area of business research and development Australia has lagged. But, because of the sorts of policies that the former government put in place, business research and development trebled as a share of gross domestic product in the decade just past under Labor. There has been a sharp rise in Australia in what is regarded as the research and development intensity of Australian manufac ture; that is, Australian manufacture is increasingly emphasising high technology and is increasingly emphasising, and getting into, fields of elaborately transformed manufacturing. R&amp;D is critical to our success in that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is powerful academic evidence which links increased business research and development to increased exports. The Centre for Strategic Economic Studies, which is part of the Victoria University, has carried out some outstanding work over recent years in that area. Without boring you with econometric models, which, frankly, I would struggle with and bore everybody stupid with even if I did understand them, the evidence is nonetheless compelling that increased business research and development translate directly into increased exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final conclusion that that centre has come to in its recent study is that Australia at present is extraordinarily cost competitive internationally as a place for business to carry out research and development. I am saying what the opposition is saying through the words of the member for Hotham; that is, with the short&hyphen;sighted, stupid changes that this government has before the House at the present time, there is a real danger of the baby being thrown out with the bathwater in these important areas of technology, and, frankly, quite unnecessarily so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that syndicated research and development have been found to be a uniquely Australian and uniquely successful means of providing government support to building high-tech businesses. The only economy in the Asia-Pacific area with a comparable level of business research and development is Singapore. But one has to be fearful, as I have indicated already, that our strong position in that respect may well be coming under some question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been some reference by both the member for Hotham and the member for Bowman to the 1994 report of the Bureau of Industry Economics on syndication. Despite the government's rhetoric about tax rorts, that BIE study found that there was a high rate of inducement for new research and development, with about $2.60 additional research and development expenditure being induced <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for every dollar of research undertaken by participants, which would have gone ahead anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frankly, I do not know where the figures that the member for Bowman was touting came from, because the BIE report of 1994 states in black and white that $2.60 of additional R&amp;D was induced for every dollar of research, which would have been undertaken without the government arrangements. The BIE concluded that the syndication program is a unique and highly effective instrument for cheaply stimulating new R&amp;D.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly join other members of the opposition in calling on the government, in the interests of Australia's manufacturing future and other sectors of our economy, to review the decision that they have taken on research and development and to come back to something approximating the sorts of commitments they went to the Australian people with. I believe that they have made a very serious error of judgment in this area.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened with interest to the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe), and I would have to begin by saying that I regard his citing of the research on this subject as somewhat disingenuous, in the similar fashion as I regarded the remarks of the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). In fact, considerable research has been undertaken by a number of organisations on the effectiveness of these programs. I would regard the summation of syndication as `uniquely successful' as being a gross distortion of the facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are speaking about research and development today. Beginning on a matter of definition, the OECD defines research and development as the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge&mdash;including knowledge of man, culture and society&mdash;and the use of this knowledge to devise new applications.</PARA>
<PARA>It is my contention that there are a number of points at which the previous scheme failed that definition; in particular, its failure to solicit creative work, its failure to do so on a systematic basis, and its failure to do so in a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4517"> manner which devised new applications for the knowledge in question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of this bill is to provide for advanced registration of bodies undertaking eligible research and development and to impose restrictions on the time by which the applications for registration must be made. The bill should be understood in the context of the government's total reforms to the R&amp;D sector, including the removal of syndication and the reduction of the concessional R&amp;D rate from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. But, more particularly, it needs to be understood in the context of the government's total commitment to research and development in the wider budget context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at the history of the scheme, it was in May 1995 that the then government introduced the concession as a temporary measure in the hope of stimulating research and development, particularly private business expenditure on research and development. That measure was taken as a recognition of the fact that the unwillingness of the private sector in Australia to invest in research and development was becoming a substantial impediment to economic growth. We need only cite the fact that Australia had fallen to 21st in the world in gross domestic product from 10th in the world a decade previously. So between 1976 and 1986 we fell from 21st to 10th and, at the same time, we witnessed this decline in expenditure in investment in the future of technology in the form of research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was in 1965 that the issue was first brought to the attention of this parliament when the Menzies government established a science committee and recommended the provision of tax incentives for research and development. Prior to 1973, Australia had been just ticking along at roughly the same rate as many of our competitors, but admittedly at a very low rate as the whole region was yet to fully galvanise and appreciate the possibilities of the emerging new global economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1973 we saw our position deteriorate very substantially in terms of business expenditure on research and development. We saw a virtual evacuation of the field by <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> business and we fell to the lowest level ever in Australia's history of 0.23 per cent of GDP in 1978-79 in terms of business expenditure on research and development. We clearly had a major problem to address, and particularly so because our competitors in the OECD were going in exactly the opposite direction. They were massively upgrading their expenditure. They were making the investments. They were spending the money where they needed to in order to enhance the productive capacity of their economies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then in the 1980s there was a welcome change in trend and Australia did begin to finally spend money in this vital area, but it was still well below that of our competitors. We find today that our position is something like 17th out of OECD nations compared to 18th at the beginning of the 1980s. So the bottom line of whether the policy has delivered the intended outcome must be no. In fact, it has not enhanced Australia's competitiveness. That is really what this government and this bill are about. They are about a willingness to go back and assess the performance of policy instruments and not just take it as a given, not just believe that by the recitation of some sort of policy mantra with sufficient frequency and at sufficient volume it must in fact be doing the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now would like to turn to some of the evaluation that has taken place on the effectiveness of the program. The whole syndication initiative was introduced as a sort of turbocharger in recognition of the fact that the existing tax incentive simply was not delivering the outcomes that were required to make Australia competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at what the indications are from the research undertaken by the Industry Commission in its report of May 1995 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Research and development report No. 44</EMPHASIS> and the report of the Bureau of Industry Economics entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">R&amp;D, innovation and competitiveness, research report No. 50 1993</EMPHASIS>. Additional work has been undertaken by Austrade and also by the Australian National Audit Office. I would like to quote from some of those reports I have just mentioned. The Industry Commission and the Bureau of Industry Economics found that the scheme <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4518"> provided some benefit to Australia, but it had not made us more competitive as against our principal OECD partners. Australia's gross expenditure on research and development as a proportion of GDP is 25 per cent lower than both the average of all OECD countries and the median figure for other medium sized R&amp;D performing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industry Commission found that as much as 90 per cent of the R&amp;D investment would have occurred without the tax concession. Somewhere between 10 per cent and 17 per cent was the only new R&amp;D that resulted from the concession. So we are really talking about between 80 per cent and 90 per cent of the government's expenditure on this issue in forgone tax revenue effectively being wasted. It has been flushed down the sink. It has not hit the target to which it was directed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To hear the opposition moaning and bleating about reduced expenditure in this area is somewhat galling. Our task here is not to constantly throw more money at the problem, not to constantly give more and more generous tax incentives, but to ensure that the incentives get to the policy target to which they were originally directed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The BIE's analysis was that only 20 per cent of the R&amp;D expenditure under the scheme was on genuinely innovative projects. One of the explicit policy goals of the concession was to encourage the development of novel industry applications which would enhance our productive capacity. Clearly, only one in five of those bullets were hitting the target; the other four were simply being wasted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, the member for Hotham was complaining, again, in a completely disingenuous way about the importance of the concession to small business. In fact, the Industry Commission reported that the scheme delivered `disproportionate benefits to large companies'. In 1993&hyphen;94, 2,882 companies claimed the concession. The total expenditure claim was approximately $2 billion, but I have to inform the House that the top 10 companies making claims accounted for more than half of the total cost of the scheme. So you have 10 companies averaging $100 million each.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not know what your definition of small business is and I am not sure what the definition of the member for Hotham is, but I suggest, at an average of $100 million each, this scheme is not targeting small business effectively. In fact, what we see is the emergence of a scheme that is pandering to the strongest of the strong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that regard, I note that the Bureau of Industry Economics noted what it calls the `excessively high administrative and transaction costs of the scheme whereby an average syndication costs $195,000 in overheads'. Those funds are not going to small business, they are not going to researchers, they are not going to innovators, they are not going to science. They are going to a small club of bankers and lawyers who will wander around the halls of Grosvenor Place and Collins Street, muttering to one another about this scheme and characterising it as `a nice little earner'. It is widely regarded as a great rort and, at the cost of approximately $190,000 per syndication, it is no wonder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, effectively, here you have a little club made up of Bain and Co., Macquarie Bank and Bankers Trust whose members have built themselves a little industry around this government concession. I do not begrudge them that little industry in the sense that they are acting lawfully within the bounds of an excessively generous and ill-conceived scheme which was created by the previous government. They are simply doing what all market profit seekers will do: they are occupying a niche that has been offered&mdash;and they are doing it very effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I do not believe that it was the purpose of this scheme to fill the pockets of some of Australia's largest and most powerful corporate entities. This demonstrates the duplicity of the Labor Party now: to get up and criticise this scheme on the basis that it is opposed to the battlers or small business, when the ones who are benefiting from it live in these palatial skyscrapers in the central business districts of Sydney and do not get anywhere near the R&amp;D concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The analysis further goes on to explain that business expenditure on research and development&mdash;and that is the key element; not gross <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4519"> expenditure, not state and federal expenditure, but business expenditure on research and development&mdash;grew during the 1980s but continued to remain well below the OECD average. So in 1991&hyphen;92 only 44 per cent of Australia's research and development was undertaken by business, reflecting only 0.71 per cent of the total domestic product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, in the long run, if we take a step back and ask, `Is it enough? Will it do the job for Australia as an economy? Will it give our children better prospects of employment and better prospects of participating in a vibrant, healthy economy?' the answer most certainly is, `No'. Quoting again from the Industry Commission report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of more concern however is the fact that the overall number of registrants has been relatively constant since the inception of the scheme, so that this inflow of new R&amp;D performers has not increased the stock of consistent R&amp;D performers.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, if we go back and ask ourselves the original question, `Is the policy instrument achieving the policy objective?' we have to say on any objective test, `No, it's not.' Any minister, such as the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), is under an obligation in those circumstances&mdash;it is a basic matter of public policy&mdash;to go back, undertake a review and consider ways in which to redirect the resources to achieve the outcomes they were originally created to achieve. I note, likewise, that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For foreign owned companies the net social impact is negative&mdash;often substantially so. This is because the benefits from the concession flow outside Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>So the scheme is doing marvellously well in building up the economies of Malaysia, Singapore, the United States, Germany and Japan; it is just not doing very much for indigenous Australian industry, which I would have thought was a relevant consideration in structuring the policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn again to the comment by the member for Hotham that this government has somehow abandoned its commitment to research because it has introduced reforms to a system which was patently being rorted. I just make the comment that we have to look at the government's commitment to research in the context of its total budget program, not on the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> basis of its reform to an individual, low performing scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at this government's first budget&mdash;a historic budget, a budget that is doing the things that most commentators said have needed to be done for the last 15 years&mdash;we see that the Commonwealth's support for major programs of science and innovation in 1996-97 is estimated to be at $3.75 billion. Total support for industrial research and development and innovation, including both direct support through appropriations and the estimated effects of tax revenue forgone, is expected to be somewhere in the vicinity of $700 million&mdash;not, in my view, an insignificant amount. The industrial component of special purpose grants will increase to $154 million from $126 million in 1995&hyphen;96, a real increase of 19 per cent in support of R&amp;D and innovation in the business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We turn now to the START program, which is delivering strategic assistance for research and development. One of the key features of the program is its flexibility. It goes to the market with a range of different measures: from loans, to interest rate subsidies, to targeted grants. That is a recognition that innovative companies do not have a uniform set of needs. They have different sets of needs, so the policy instrument has to be structured to be flexible enough to respond to those needs. An extra $340 million is provided in this budget, bringing the total funding for the program to $520 million over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Likewise, the government is extending the cooperative research centre program to provide for two additional centres in 1997-98. This initiative will strengthen the ability of the program to develop links between researchers in the CSIRO and universities and users of that research in industry and in the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of those cooperative research centres will take effective control of the Australian space effort, with responsibility to develop a launch capability for small experimental satellites. Likewise, the CSIRO will receive $60 million for research purposes over the 1997&hyphen;2000 triennium. The increase will allow the CSIRO to maintain appropriate priority for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4520"> both its national research objectives and the needs of rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's commitment to the fostering of international collaboration in science, engineering and technology is reflected in its ongoing support for a range of programs which will allow Australian scientists to travel around the world and meet with their colleagues under the international science and technology program. We are providing $16.6 million over the three-year period 1996&hyphen;99.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Likewise, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) is providing funding for research into an alternative equity market for small business. This is one of the challenges that small businesses face: access to capital. We find that small business failure is very often caused not by lack of good ideas or good services but by lack of access to capital in the critical set&hyphen;up phase of business. We are taking positive, constructive steps to try to increase the access to capital of Australians in small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We regard small business not only as the engine room of employment but also as an engine room of innovation. That is why we, unlike the previous government, are not going to allow a rort to continue which just funnels money into the pockets of Australia's largest corporations. We are producing innovative, targeted strategies that ensure that the resources get to the areas that most need them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my contention that it is demonstrably false to suggest that this government is backing away from its commitment to research. In many areas we are increasing it. We are giving taxpayers better value for the research dollar, we are eliminating the rorts and we are eliminating the artificial advisory industry of bankers and lawyers who fed off the previous scheme. We are treating research as a whole of government task and responding in a diversified, flexible manner to help meet the real needs of innovative industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the couple of moments left I just want to touch on some of the future challenges that we face as a nation in this field. In particular, I want to quote from Professor Robert Gregory of the Australian National University, who produced a chapter on Australia's R&amp;D <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> effort in the book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National innovation systems: a comparative analysis</EMPHASIS>. In that book Professor Gregory highlighted the fact that Australia's R&amp;D history had the following features: a low level of science and technology expenditure; a high level of government involvement in financing and undertaking research; a low level of private sector research and development; and an exceptionally high dependence on foreign technology. These are the things that we have to overcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Gregory went on to identify some of the structural impediments to overcoming those problems. If I can just touch on those very briefly. He said that our success historically as a small, highly productive nation in agriculture and in primary products made it difficult for us to appreciate the importance of high technology. In that regard, I remember Lee Kuan Yew saying that the worst thing that ever happened to Australia was Donald Horne's expression `the lucky country' because it lulled us all into this false sense of security that we did not need to innovate, that we did not need to invest and that we did not need to become more clever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Likewise, he identifies as a second structural feature the fact that our small population with a high wage has led to small-scale, simple manufacturing and made it difficult for us to compete against imports. As a result, there has been a low level of private sector investment in research and development. Likewise, the prevalence of institutional wealth in this country as opposed to private wealth is an obstacle that we have to overcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point Professor Gregory mentioned was the high degree of government provision of business and social services which he described as `colonial socialism'. He says that a high degree of government involvement in research financing was to be expected and that right from the days of the First Fleet we have had this distinctive dependence on government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is making decisions which are going to help us overcome those much more fundamental, deep-seated cultural traits. Nothing has been done in the past 15 years to address those needs. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that research and development is an area of great importance to Australia. I find myself a little depressed having listened to the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron). I know nothing of his history, but I will take a punt that he is either a schoolteacher or a lawyer. He had at his fingertips a great number of facts and figures. It seems to me that he has a clear inability to interpret them. To rely on Professor Gregory and Gregory's very flawed analysis is, to say the least, pathetic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that syndicated R&amp;D had become a rort. It was a rort, basically, because brokers were able to take out very high front&hyphen;end fees. Brokers were making as much out of it as was actually going to R&amp;D itself. This legislation could have been amended, but I think the amendments that the Labor Party put in to overcome this simply did not work. Probably the only option was to shut it down, which the government has done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one reflects on history, Lord Allenby was probably one of the more successful generals of the First World War&mdash;certainly in his campaign in the Middle East. Allenby had a view that, if you were confronted with a strategic problem and you simply were not in a position to know the options, the best option was to do nothing. His view was that that was usually best.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the government is acting because it felt it had to do something and did not quite know what to do. History will show that R&amp;D will drop in this country. It was not at a high base. Any drop is significant and any drop will be disastrous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government says it is going to fund R&amp;D directly. What has actually happened? Let us examine the situation. The government's Energy Research and Development Corporation was one body that was handling R&amp;D directly and it was very successful. By any measure, the Energy Research and Development Corporation was a successful organisation. It was getting research done and a lot of it was cutting edge research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were told in the budget that the government was simply removing the ERDC reserves but not affecting its capacity to fund <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> development. The truth is that there is simply no money in the budget for any new projects. The ERDC had committed itself and told people that their projects would be funded. It has now had to go back and write letters stating, `There are simply no funds for this.' I think that gives the lie to the fact that the government is going to look for other methods. I think that is a great sadness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to look at what I call the public perception of R&amp;D. People talk about 150 per cent. A lot of the public actually think that the government is getting 50 per cent more than it spends, which of course is not true. The formula is exactly like this: if a company spend $100, the tax detection is $150. The tax savings at 36c in the dollar&mdash;36 per cent of $150&mdash;is 54c in the dollar. So they are getting a 54c saving for every dollar they spend, or about half of it back as a tax concession. I think that is not generally understood by a lot of the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you reduce this to 25 per cent, it drops significantly. They get 46c back in the dollar; in fact, 9c more than they would normally get in the course of the taxation regime. Given that the minimum entry level is $20,000, the saving on that is $1,800. The fact is that small business is simply not going to spend the time, the energy or the compliance costs to save what is, in fact, a minimal amount of money. It will either bear it itself or it simply will not do the R&amp;D.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at R&amp;D, what we had to do was examine the understanding of it. It seemed to me, having looked at this over a lot of years, that the government or the people in DIST had a view that the methods of R&amp;D had to be novel and innovative. What should have always been the criterion, and clearly was not, was that the outcome was new and innovative. A lot of new, innovative outcomes are arrived at by very regular proven research methods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know of at least one company which was told that because of their good track record with R&amp;D, the fact that their R&amp;D had been very successful, there was really no risk and they therefore should not get the grant. If that occurred in that one company, it was a widespread belief and it was an erroneous belief. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4522"> What it was basically saying was that, if R&amp;D were novel and innovative and competent, you would get the money regardless of the outcome. That is the fact that led to a lot of waste in R&amp;D.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer (Mr Costello) said in the budget that our new rates were still very competitive with those of our competitors. This is a fact that is simply not true. R&amp;D can still be funded very readily in Malaysia and Singapore. Malaysia's regime is 200 per cent, and it was always better than ours. A 200 per cent tax regime basically means R&amp;D does not cost the researcher any cash at all. It is certainly working very well for Malaysia. It is simply not true to say that we are still competitive with our neighbours. I suspect the Treasurer knows this. I suspect he is too locked in by the ideological straitjacket of the people in Treasury. One thing may be said of these people: collectively and individually they have created nothing, and they never will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there has to be a statement of a philosophical point of view, because the Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill that the government has introduced is highly philosophical and ideological. I have a philosophical view that the only future I want for my children is one in a high wage country, a high skill country, a high productivity country. There is no indication at the moment from either side of politics that my children are going to inherit this. It is something that has to be addressed with great urgency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to comment on something the member for Parramatta said about the `lucky country'. When Donald Horne coined that phrase, he was being very cynical. Donald Horne is not a man for whom I have any high regard, but I think his book did serve a useful purpose. It pointed out that what he really should have said is that we should be the lucky country. The reason we are not the lucky country is, in my view, entirely due to the actions of successive governments, going right back to the Menzies government when this country had enormous opportunity. I remember that things were good in those days, but there was no thought for the future. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> We allowed our protectionist regime to lead to sloth and incompetence in industry. It need not have been so. There is nothing inherently wrong with protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be remembered that in 1954 this country made far more and far better motor vehicles than Japan. Last year we made 280,000 and they made over 14 million. They always had a protection regime far more severe than ours, and they still have it. The difference was that they owned their industry; we never owned ours. No matter how much we improved the product&mdash;and we did improve it&mdash;we could not sell it anywhere the masters did not want it sold. The companies, principally General Motors and Ford, were happy to undercapitalise Australian car manufacturing and then to berate Australian workers because they were not getting the same productivity as the Japanese. It was simply impossible. They did not have the capital investment. They did not have the equipment. They did not have the tools to do the job. It is just another example of blaming the victim, which one sees so much in the world today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government have a view that you cannot pick winners. They are not lonely, because it is also the view of the Labor Party. They hold that view despite the fact that there is clear evidence that countries overseas have picked winners. Japan, Germany and Korea have all been quite successful at picking winners. But you do not have to pick winners. You only have to determine areas where you have a natural advantage or a strategic need, and concentrate on those areas&mdash;and that concentrates the mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has said that competition will determine where the new R&amp;D allocations go. It was interesting to hear the member for Parramatta talk about the large percentage that went to the large companies. He is absolutely right&mdash;it did. Where you introduce this concept of competition allocation of funds, the large companies will get an ever increasing amount. The truth is that the large companies are not good at R&amp;D. They are not good at all. That is where a lot of the money was wasted. But, with what the government is doing, we will see an increasing share going to large companies.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4523">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people who need to be encouraged are those in the SMEs, the small and medium enterprises. That is where the true and valuable research and development is done. But they will not be able to compete under this regime, and you will see an ever increasing amount of funds go to the large companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe there have been many cases where very good R&amp;D has been knocked back basically out of fear&mdash;it was seen as too much of a risk. I have heard members speak about the fact that only one in five bullets hits the mark. Quite frankly, in R&amp;D you can operate commercially&mdash;and companies in America do operate commercially&mdash;on the basis that probably one in 10 hits the mark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One in five, in my view, is a very good strike rate. It is not one that should be denigrated. After all, if one out of the five hits the mark and is a great success, two out of the five were probably marginal, leaving two that were significant losers. But we should not be deterred with the strike rate of one in five. If you want to increase that substantially, the simple solution is to not spend your money on anything that requires any real research or development. By doing that, you minimise your risks enormously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we are now in a situation where we have to make a decision about whether we want to be a high wage country, a high productivity country and a high skill country. If we genuinely want that, we have to get a commitment to it&mdash;a commitment which is certainly not in the bill and is, sadly, not in any of the ALP policies that I have seen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the rhetoric of the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), the record of the Labor Party has not been good. I recall being in the Labor Party caucus when Keating said that the future lay in the service industries. Service industries are of course a code for tourism. Tourism, overwhelmingly but not absolutely, means low paid jobs, part-time jobs and jobs for women and kids. It is not jobs for blue-collar workers, but then nobody represents them nowadays, do they?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This country that used to produce arguably the best metal trades apprentices in the world now does not. This country that desperately needs these sorts of people cannot get them. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> In my own electorate of Kalgoorlie, you cannot get a competent boilermaker for love nor money because we as a nation have stopped training them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of the R&amp;D that you see is incremental. That is where the big advances are made; it is not from suddenly getting some brilliant new flash of inspiration out of the ether. It is incremental development&mdash;improvement upon improvement. This is the strategy that has made the French the world leaders in nuclear power generation. They took a technology that certainly was not the best and improved it incrementally. Every reactor has been an improvement on the last.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a bit different from the British policy, where the advanced gas coal reactor was undoubtedly the safest and best in the world but, every time they wanted to build a new one, they put it out for tender and got a new company. So while that method might have meant there were some improvements, it also meant there were some disadvantages, so much so that the British have now abandoned what had the potential to be world leading technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are serious about research and development, we have got to fund it and we have got to find a mechanism for getting that money into the small and medium enterprises. I do not think you can do that with a board. I think DIST was disproportionately overcome with what I call the Indian public service mentality&mdash;the idea that you do nothing, which is one sure way of not making mistakes, and you be very cautious about what you do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4524"> The area that was successful was the ERDC, but we have seen that area of success cut back. Surely, as I said, R&amp;D is incremental&mdash;one should build on one's successes, not throw the baby out with the bathwater. I would urge the government to go back and have another look at what they have done&mdash;to go back and realise that what they have done is retrospective because the ERDC had committed money to new projects. Small companies had already spent money on the basis that they were told they were going to be funded. Now it has all gone. That is a direct cost for those small and medium size com panies. It is money down the drain directly as a result of the ideology that is inherent in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to be in here praising the government for its actions. I certainly believe that the syndicated R&amp;D as it was had to be stopped, but that does not mean that we should not have syndicated R&amp;D. It would seem to me that the part played by brokers would be one very good area to start reform. There is no facility for R&amp;D money from the large corporations in this country, nor is there any facility from superannuation. Superannuation in my view has been a failure. It will not produce the much flaunted rewards, nor will it produce, as we were told, money for research and development. They are universally short term in their actions and are looking for that 90-day return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not like compulsion as a rule, but I would be very happy to legislate to compel large superannuation companies to commit a percentage of their income to genuine R&amp;D. Frankly, I think it would be to their benefit because, if you look at the record, their returns on their investment&mdash;that is, the superannuation of the average Australian&mdash;have been appalling. In many cases, it has been negative. I think a one in five strike rate in new technology might enhance their return to their shareholders. If the government wants to bring in legislation to direct them in that way, I will be very happy to support it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill represents a long overdue boost to the integrity of the research and development tax concession. It will ensure that Australian people get better value for money from their R&amp;D tax concession program. The bill will do this by stopping unintended use of the concession and making the administrative procedures better suited to the needs of industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendments give effect to changes to the research and development tax concession announced by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, the Hon. John Moore, on 3 June 1996. That announcement confirmed that the government would implement measures announced by the previous <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government in its Innovative Australia statement of 6 December 1995 with some minor modifications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The R&amp;D tax concessions have always been intended to encourage firms to undertake more research and development in Australia. One of the principal objectives of this policy is to introduce a higher level of research and development than would otherwise have been undertaken. Unfortunately, the R&amp;D tax concession program has been misused in the past. This legislation will protect some $235 million of taxpayers' revenue over the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over recent years a number of reports, including one from the Industry Commission, have suggested that there is significant scope for the government to improve the efficiency of the R&amp;D tax concession. It was noted in the research that some companies would only undertake R&amp;D to provide themselves with a substantial tax concession. It is estimated that only 15 per cent of the concession is provided to companies venturing into new and innovative research and development. These companies practise what has been commonly known as `gravedigging'. This is where the company uses accountants and financial advisers to sift through old company records seeking out expenditures undertaken in previous years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Bowman (Mrs West) said, sometimes these `sifters' go back as far as 1995 to search out company records which could be classified as eligible for R&amp;D concessions. These companies then receive the tax benefit and the accountant or financial adviser would receive a percentage of the deduction obtained. In short, these companies were driven by tax advantages rather than the goal of pursuing innovative research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments provide for advanced registration of organisations undertaking eligible research and development expenditure. This will put an end to gravedigging because companies will be required to lodge their application with the Industry Research and Development Board within six months of the end of the relevant year. Advance registration of activities will encourage companies to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4525"> direct their creativity towards new technologies and markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consistent with the previous government's announcement on 6 December 1995, there will be no new registrations for expenditure incurred in the 1992-93 and earlier income years, irrespective of when those applications were made. The government has already allowed for a one-off transitional period of six months ending on 7 June 1996. During this time companies can continue to submit applications for registration in respect of the tax concession for 1993-94 and the 1994&hyphen;95 income years. These changes will ensure that retrospective access to the tax concession is curtailed to a reasonable period after the research and development activities have been conducted. This amendment returns the program to its rightful focus of encouraging new research and new development rather than encouraging companies to `trawl' for tax sweeteners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A new provision will set fees for application or request to the board. These specific changes have been introduced to bring the administration of the research and development tax concession into line with the self-assessment principles of tax administration. These include reducing the obligation of the Industry Research and Development Board prior to registering a company and introducing the ability to set fees by regulation in relation to application and request to the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act require a company to register for each year of income those particular R&amp;D activities which it wishes to claim a deduction for with the Industry Research and Development Board. Access to concessions will be confined to a reasonable period after research and development activities have been conducted. This means that the tax concession program can return to its rightful focus of encouraging new research and development. The scope of this misuse of the R&amp;D tax concession program is so extensive that our measures are expected to result in a protection totalling $235 million over the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill introduces a number of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amendments designed to facilitate better administration of the R&amp;D tax concessions. The government remains committed to ensuring that there is support for genuine R&amp;D. The government will ensure that such assistance is delivered in a cost-effective manner and that opportunities for abuse and rorting are eliminated. The aim of the bill is to stimulate the performance of R&amp;D which could not have been undertaken in the absence of government subsidy. I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that the legislation that is before the parliament today, the Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill, is worthy of thorough and in-depth consideration. I would like to respond to a couple of the comments that my friend the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) made in respect of R&amp;D, particularly about apprentices and training and how, regrettably, in Australian manufacturing we have seen almost an absolute tap turn-off in the training of apprentices. I agree with him. I represent the great industrial heartland of the Illawarra. We have had a concern for a number of years now that, regrettably, the major players in the heavy industry environment of the Illawarra have not seen fit, for a variety of reasons, to train apprentices in the numbers which they clearly need.  </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To take the example of big business and BHP, when we came into government in 1983, after a period of some seven years out of government, the Illawarra was faced with a very hard decision. BHP seriously contemplated shutting down steel industry production in this country. It is a well&hyphen;known fact that they were seriously talking about getting out of steel and just being in minerals, energy, oil, gas and so on. It was the former Hawke government which actually stitched up in 100 days the steel industry plan that saw the steel industry in this country saved. Not only was the steel industry saved: the plan has meant that productivity has increased and we are now world competitive. BHP itself has expended billions of dollars on modernising its plants around Australia, particularly at Port Kembla. We have seen pollution levels <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4526"> dramatically reduced in cities like Wollongong in the Illawarra as a result of this expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also seen a reduction in the number of employees directly employed by companies such as BHP. In 1983, 26,000 people were employed by BHP in Wollongong. Today that figure is closer to 6,500. You can imagine the effect that that had in the Illawarra over that period. I have said something about that in speeches in this place in the past. As part of putting in place improved technology, as part of that process of there being an industrial revolution impact on the Illawarra, we have seen the number of people employed drop off dramatically. Regrettably, we have also seen the number of people who were trained as apprentices and who were taking advantage of the R&amp;D programs that might be there to assist drop away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">BHP took decisions in the middle and late 1980s that they needed to downsize their operation, and they offered voluntary retrenchment schemes to people. The people who took those voluntary retrenchments were the skilled craftspeople, those who had been trained as boilermakers and so on&mdash;the people the member for Kalgoorlie mentioned. What we did not see happen was training to replace those sorts of people. Of course, BHP suddenly realised that they needed to do something about it, and we have seen them actively revisiting those programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, there is no doubt that R&amp;D in this country has not led to some of the major benefits that we would like to see. On previous occasions I have heard the member for Kalgoorlie and others in this place talk about the lead time between when somebody invents something&mdash;taking advantage of R&amp;D products that might be around or programs that are in place&mdash;and when you see something manufactured. There is a view within the manufacturing sector in Australia that unless you see a return on investment within a period of 12 months people are not going to take the risk. Australian business people are not prepared to have long vision. They are not prepared to look at the far horizon in terms of the time they carry out R&amp;D; the time when <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the process has been finetuned, the time when the process is put in place; and the time when they start getting a return for capital investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is one of the sad things about this country. I think it says something about the so&hyphen;called entrepreneurial class in Australia that they are not prepared to look at the long&hyphen;term horizon, as they do perhaps in the United States, and as they certainly do in Japan and Korea. People in those countries know that you do not get instant recognition. They know that you do not get an instant return for the capital that you invest. They are prepared to wait to see those processes that are developed through R&amp;D programs come to fruition. As I said, in Australia, regrettably, that simply is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things which is part of this whole area of R&amp;D and which needs to be considered is access to capital for the manufacturing process once R&amp;D has been completed. For the many companies which are prepared to expend funds on R&amp;D processes and the individuals who dream up a brilliant idea in the shower one day and then go about trying to work out how it should be put in place, the next phase is trying to get capital so that the idea goes from R&amp;D to facilitation to manufacture. Regrettably, financial institutions in this country have been very backward in coming forward to give support to Australian industry for that process. This is a simple fact of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going back a few years ago to the depths of the recession in the 1980s, our caucus looked at the available opportunities to provide access to capital for manufacturers. I am pleased that the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) is here, because this goes to his area of responsibility. We suggested that those massive amounts of capital which existed in superannuation funds be directed towards industrial production. When R&amp;D was completed and small and medium sized businesses&mdash;which the member for Kalgoorlie also referred to&mdash;needed to get access to capital, they simply could not get it. The banks were not there, the financial institutions and the financial intermediaries were not there. They were not prepared to take a punt. They were <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4527"> not prepared to give some comfort to industry in the development of those processes and in taking it from the R&amp;D phase through to manufacturing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is something which our side of the House chose not to pursue when we were in government. I honestly think we should have. I was a member of the caucus committee that looked at this. I said at the time that we should look at ways in which superannuation funds could be forced to provide some funds for the manufacturing process after R&amp;D had been completed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will conclude my brief contribution here this afternoon on this very important subject. I am now surrounded by a number of speakers on our side of the House who want to get a turn, and they have prepared speeches. I will just say that this is an area of great significance, particularly to a manufacturing region like the Illawarra. R&amp;D is an area where people think up important and innovative ways in which manufacturing processes particularly might be extended, and it needs support. What they do not need is a government coming along and cutting out funding for R&amp;D programs. They do not want to hear a government saying, `Industry will look after industry.' I am sorry to have to say to the government that that simply is not the case: industry will not look after industry. These are often people in small and medium sized operations who need access to and the support of government funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply commend to this government that they revisit this issue. I think it is part of their overall budget strategy. It is something which may come back to affect them in the future. Our industrial and manufacturing bases are slipping&mdash;there is no question of that. If we are to build on the concept of being the clever country and if we are to revitalise our industrial and manufacturing bases, people need to know that there will be funding and support from the government of the day&mdash;irrespective of political persuasion&mdash;to give support to their endeavours. I ask the government to give consideration to that fact.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted in more ways than one to my friend and colleague the honourable <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) for his very erudite exposition as to the importance of research and development to the Illawarra. While he concentrated on the Illawarra, he did briefly touch upon two very important factors that go to research and development in Australia. One is providing incentives to Australian companies for research and development and the second is access to finance to develop Australian ideas here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having checked that the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton), who follows me, is in the chamber, I am not proposing to go over the ground that the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) covered comprehensively in their contributions to the debate on the Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill. Suffice to say that, on this side of the House, we support the bill in general terms because to a very large extent, subject to one matter, the bill effectively implements measures announced in the previous government's innovation statement. The one matter that we have reservations about we would be happy to see referred to the relevant Senate committee for consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill cannot be viewed in isolation because, viewed in isolation, it would give a massively and comprehensively wrong and incorrect view as to what the government's attitude to research and development is. The government's attitude to research and development needs to be viewed in the context of the measures it has taken in the budget. When you talk about research and development there are two obvious divides that one can draw attention to. One is our public sector research effort and the second is our private sector research effort. This bill goes to our private sector research effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far as our public sector research effort is concerned, Australia has always done, internationally, very well in the public sector research effort that it makes. In particular, that applies to the CSIRO. I was in the chamber when the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron) was making his contribution. He used the word `disingenuous' which, I must confess, is a word I have used in this House before. I must say, so far as public sector <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4528"> research effort was concerned, that the Treasurer (Mr Costello), in his budget speech, gave an entirely disingenuous account about the government's attitude to public sector research. In his speech he said that CSIRO funding had been increased in the order of $114 million, which met the government's commitment to CSIRO triennium funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What he deliberately did not say in his speech was to not advise the House that, when you looked at the fine print of the budget, what you found was that the efficiency dividend applied to CSIRO took off precisely that amount to the dollar and to the cent. So if there have been any disingenuous contributions in this place on research, it has been the Treasurer's and the government's deliberate disinformation so far as their approach to CSIRO funding is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure is about private sector research and our private sector effort. Historically, Australia has made a very poor contribution to private sector research when that is judged internationally or judged against some relevant countries in the OECD. The efforts that the previous government made to try to raise that private sector research effort had, as one of the centrepieces, the R&amp;D 150 per cent tax concession&mdash;that has changed over the years but was effectively made permanent, from memory, in 1992&hyphen;93&mdash;and the introduction of the syndication measures which were introduced, again from memory, in 1987. The effort that the previous government made to try to raise a quite small contribution of private sector research was through the 150 per cent taxation concession measure and, coupled with that, syndication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition, in the course of their election commitments, under the heading `Research and development tax concession', pledged:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changes to the syndicated research and development tax concession scheme guidelines may well result in the drying up of one of the few effective forms of venture capital available in Australia to fund research and development.</PARA>
<PARA>And a separate quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Maintain support for R&amp;D through the 150 per cent tax concession.</PARA>
<PARA>What they have done is reduced the permanent 150 per cent tax concession to 125 per <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cent with no indication whatsoever that that will be permanent. Their commitment&mdash;which I have referred to&mdash;to the drying up of one of the very few forms of venture capital available in Australia to fund research and development has been to knock it off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument that they are using to knock this off is to say, `There's a rort here, so we've got to knock it off.' We have made it very clear on this side of the House, both in government and now, that we are also in favour of ensuring that rorts do not occur. But the notion of knocking off an incentive to the private sector which helps research, which helps development, which helps develop Australian ideas here and which helps our elaborately transformed manufactures production and export&mdash;the notion that there are rorts to be knocked off here&mdash;is also an argument that the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) has used for  knocking off the export market development grants scheme, reducing the funding of the scheme by some $426.3 million over four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade is reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 27 August, a week after the budget, in an article headed `Export aid cuts target rorting', as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need to stamp out rorts and direct funds from professional consultants to small exporters were the motives for big Budget cuts to a key export program, the Minister for Trade, Mr Fischer, said yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Fischer said he was not prepared to let the `open&hyphen;ended feeding of white&hyphen;collar crime' continue under the Export Market Development Grants scheme, which suffered a four&hyphen;year $343 million cut in last week's Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>David McKenzie and Natasha Bita from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  got the $343 million figure wrong but they got the rest of it right. When you actually examine what has occurred in the export market development grants scheme over the period that has been in operation you find that prosecutions for fraud or investigations for fraud have accounted over a sustained period of time for about one per cent of the appropriations in that area. Just as in the export market development scheme you throw the baby out with the bath water, you use <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4529"> rorts as the excuse for cutting a decent program, so they do it here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hotham has consistently raised questions in this House and outside for the government to show where those rorts are occurring, where there are rorts which have not previously been closed off or where there are not commitments on both sides of the House to close them off. So the rort argument is basically an excuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you come to look at the effectiveness of the 150 per cent taxation concession, what is the rationale here? The rationale here is to give Australian companies an incentive to do research, to give Australian companies an incentive to develop Australian ideas here rather than seeing them developed offshore. Why do we do that? If you develop your Australian ideas here, you ensure that you make a positive contribution to growth and you make a positive contribution to Australian jobs. In the end, this is about providing an incentive to Australian companies to ensure that employment in Australia grows and unemployment is reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a range of analyses of the 150 per cent R&amp;D concession over the years. In 1995, the Industry Commission brought down a report on this matter. The member for Cunningham might be able to disabuse me of this, but I have never known the Industry Commission to be soft on an incentive to an Australian company. On the contrary, I have heard from time to time the Industry Commission described as the `industry abolition commission' which, given some of the reports from the Industry Commission I have read, would not be far wide of the mark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the Industry Commission have to say in 1995 about the 150 per cent tax concession? The Industry Commission concluded in its 1995 report that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> "the 150% tax concession has brought net benefits to the Australian economy"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> "removal of the concession would lead to a reduction in GDP"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> "the 150% tax concession be maintained"</PARA>
<PARA>What the Industry Commission is saying is that the maintenance of the 150 per cent taxation concession makes a positive contribu <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> tion to growth and therefore makes a positive contribution to jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993, a couple of years earlier, the Bureau of Industry Economics also did a report on the 150 per cent taxation concession. The BIE came to the following conclusions:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> . . . the concession clearly contributes to increased technological innovativeness, and is likely to contribute to increased competitiveness</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> since the concession was introduced Australia's business expenditure on R&amp;D (BERD) doubled&mdash;the average annual growth rate of 14% between 1981&hyphen;89 was the fastest of any OECD country</PARA>
<PARA>That, in my view, gives the lie to the notion that the 150 per cent has not been an effective or successful incentive. The BIE went on to report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> innovativeness&mdash;the share of innovative products in sales&mdash;increases with R&amp;D intensity</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> 23% of companies surveyed by the BIE reported that the concession had been critical in their decision to proceed with R&amp;D projects in the preceding 3 years</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> 50% said that their R&amp;D expenditure would have been lower if the R&amp;D deductibility were reduced from 150 to 100%</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the estimated net social return was found to be positive in respect of Australian&hyphen;owned companies</PARA>
<PARA>Just as the Industry Commission did, the BIE recommended the retention of the concession. So we have the Industry Commission in 1995 saying that this is helping to produce growth in the economy and helping to produce jobs. We have the BIE saying that this is helping the Australian economy, this is helping to produce jobs, this is helping to produce growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the coalition in the run up to the election committing itself to the retention of the 150 per cent taxation concession for R&amp;D. What do we find? We find a broken promise. Why do we find a broken promise? The truth is that those on the other side do not believe in providing incentives to Australian companies to do research. They do not believe in providing incentives to Australian companies to develop Australian ideas here. In their heart of hearts, they do not believe in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4530"> growth in the economy. In their heart of hearts, they do not care whether there is growth in the economy and therefore jobs or whether unemployment rises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of the House may have seen the budget response by the MTIA, which was issued about nine days after the budget on 29 August. In the MTIA's budget response, under the heading `Risks and Challenges' the MTIA states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the medium term, the challenge for the Budget is to generate higher growth, and through this, more jobs and better living standards. The preponderance of 3 plus forecasts for growth until the end of the century, clearly fall well short of what is possible if we harness more of our resources to the task. 4 plus growth must be our goal.</PARA>
<PARA>That is unambiguously correct. It is clear when you look at the budget forecasts, even if you do not form the view I have, that recent statistics and recent events will knock the budget forecasts for growth and employment down and unemployment up, and that four per cent growth is the minimum you need to ensure that you do get some improvement in employment and unemployment. What is one of the things that can help lead to economic growth? Australian companies developing their ideas here, producing elaborately transferred manufactures and exporting them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The MTIA, in the course of their response, were very critical of the cutting of the range of industry support programs and incentives to industries for trade and export enhancement, because this R&amp;D attack ought not to be viewed in isolation. I have referred to the export market development grant schemes but the litany of sins is long. There is ITES. There is IAMP. There are the Asia business fellowships and Asia business links. There are also the bounty schemes&mdash;the shipbuilding bounty, the computer bounty, the book bounty. All of these things which provide incentives to Australian companies to export are all cast aside and just as the 150 per cent R&amp;D was a broken election commitment, so are they.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The MTIA went on to refer to the quid pro quo of cutting industry programs. This required a range of things, one of which must include a culture that values innovation and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> success in the global marketplace. If you value a culture that values innovation and success in the global marketplace, how can you stand and argue that the 150 per cent incentive for research and development ought to be considerably downgraded? It is a massive downgrade. The cut to research and development in the budget is in the order of $2.2 billion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to follow the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), one of the finer contributors to debate in this House, a man who goes by the initials SS. Contrary to popular belief, that does not stand for `seldom seen'. I rise to join with my colleagues in supporting the Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill. On the surface, the message contained in this legislation may seem to the world to be simply of a housekeeping nature. It is not particularly controversial in any major way and, given the support from both sides of the House, perhaps indicative of the shared philosophy and practice of government between the two parties. However, I believe that the bill we are debating here today and the issues that are involved, their history and future prospects, go to the heart of the difference between the two sides in both philosophy and approach to economic policy and specifically to industry policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 150 per cent research and development tax concession was introduced back in May 1985 by the then Labor government to address concerns that Australia's economic growth rate was suffering due to a less than optimal investment in research and development by Australian businesses. The tax concession scheme was implemented and designed to boost Australia's international competitiveness and innovation through encouraging increased investment by companies in research and development. This was to be done by maximising the use of existing research infrastructure, by improving conditions for commercialising new processes and product technology developed by Australian companies and by developing greater capacity for the adoption of foreign technology.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The R&amp;D tax concession effectively provides firms with a subsidy which they can use either directly or by utilising a syndicate arrangement with other taxpayers. Syndication, which was introduced back in November 1987, was a major and important progression in the development of the tax concession as it allowed groups of companies to form syndicates to undertake projects which would have too high a level of risk or would be beyond the capacity of any single or individual firm to pursue. In fact, a survey by the Bureau of Industry Economics showed that up to 70 per cent of research and development conducted under syndication would not have occurred without this syndication facility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As with any scheme of this nature, its workings and effectiveness have been reviewed over the years. Where appropriate, changes have been implemented to review and improve its functioning. In line with this, the previous Labor government announced in December last year as part of its innovation statement a number of changes to the operation of the scheme and to the eligibility of companies able to apply for this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key changes in the innovation statement included limiting the ability of firms to obtain a concession for previous expenditure, refining the definition of what constitutes eligible research and development to qualify for the concession, and enabling applicants for the concession to register for future research and development projects for up to three years. This, of course, would enable them to more effectively plan their ongoing and future investment in research and development. That was part of the innovation statement, a major document and major initiative of the then Keating government of late last year. These changes were designed to improve the viability of what was widely recognised by businesses of all sizes as a highly beneficial scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill before us today is in the most part based on the refinements suggested by the previous Labor government and, to that extent, naturally earns the support of the opposition. One issue of a somewhat technical nature that does merit further consideration is the amendment proposed by the government to close off access to the concession for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4532"> applicants for the 1992-93 income years and earlier who were not registered prior to 6 December last year, even though they may have lodged their applications before that date with the Industry Research and Development Board. This provision would appear to be grossly unfair and, equally, unjust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that at least one company lodged an application for the tax concession with the IR&amp;D Board at least six months before the proposed cut-off date of 6 December last year. For some reason the IR&amp;D Board did not register the application prior to that date. Even though the application was lodged in accordance with the guidelines set down by the relevant authorities but was not formally registered by the board, the company would be ineligible to receive that tax concession. Clearly, this is a very harsh and unjustifiable position for the government to take when the particular company in question no doubt acted in good faith and has been the victim of nothing less than bureaucratic incompetence. The provision needs considerable examination before it can be passed into law. I certainly support the bill and this particular provision being referred to the appropriate Senate committee for further investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to return to some comments that I made earlier when I spoke of the fundamentally defining nature of this bill and the broader issue of industry policy and how it demarks the underlying thrust to that policy between the opposition and the now government. The Labor government introduced the 150 per cent research and development tax concession in 1995 because we both believed and accepted that there was a strategic role&mdash;a very important role&mdash;for government to play in working with the private sector to develop our industry for the benefit of us all. Research and development play a crucial role in the development of industry per se. No doubt, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) has gone into some detail as to the benefits of R&amp;D in his beloved area of the Illawarra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That role, whether it be in the Illawarra or the broader Australian business community, is not about picking winners. It is not a heavy-handed approach. We believed then and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we still believe now that governments have a pivotal role to play in ensuring that the best economic conditions exist in which our businesses can flourish through building a strong and enduring base from which they can branch out into export markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The analysis of the Metal Trades Industry Association, which the member for Perth has referred to&mdash;he referred at some length to their response to the budget issued some two weeks after the budget was tabled in this place&mdash;stated the need for the government to produce an environment for business in Australia which includes `a culture that values innovation and success in the global marketplace'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether through the provision of high quality infrastructure in transport and communication, through establishing an industrial relations system which encourages harmony and productivity rather than conflict and division or through simply recognising that Australian firms have a competitive advantage over their international rivals through their access to and use of both technology and innovation, government has an obligation to ensure that the conditions that are necessary for a healthy and growing economy are set in place. This is central to the beliefs of those of us in the Labor Party and it is why we are here in the nation's parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the Liberal Party and those opposite have a diametrically opposed view to the one that I have just espoused. It is quite clear that their role of intervention in the economy goes to a question of a labour market division between employees and employers and, of course, withdrawal of many of the tax concessions which thrust Australian businesses headlong into research markets upon which the future of this country so vitally depends. That has become increasingly obvious, even in this government's short time in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4533"> The coalition made it abundantly clear during its recent election campaign, through its industry and commerce policy statement, that it would maintain support for business expenditure on R&amp;D through the 150 per cent tax concession. Unfortunately, the government's penchant for breaking promises includ ed this one. This is one of the many that we can add to the growing list of broken promises&mdash;one of the many acts of betrayal that have been perpetrated on the Australian community by this government. I have no doubt that the views of the Australian electorate in regard to the many broken promises of this nature will be reflected at the ballot box during the next election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we are faced with the prospect of a reduction in the tax concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent, despite a promise being submitted to the electorate by the government during the election campaign. This also goes to the abolition of syndication on the spurious and disproved basis that syndication was being rorted, a claim again made this morning by the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron) and a claim that those on this side refute and those on the government side have yet to substantiate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The lame and rather half-hearted justification of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) for the decision was that the incentive remains among the most effective in the OECD and compares more than favourably with concessions provided to our regional neighbours. Yet, as somewhat of a tax expert, Mr Rudolf Werner makes clear that the reduction from 150 per cent to 125 per cent will have a significant and detrimental impact on the viability of industry to thrust itself into export markets, upon which, as I say, this country will depend to increasing degrees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 22 August this year, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The benefit at 125 per cent is marginal. What industry is saying is that "we'll do what we are going to do anyway but we certainly are not going to do more R&amp;D."</PARA>
<PARA>What is even more strikingly hypocritical about the government's decision is that it will be the smaller companies that spend a greater proportion on R&amp;D than the CRAs and the BHPs that will be the hardest hit. It is this government, of course, which claims to be the protector of the interests of small business&mdash;another one of the many urban myths that is being perpetrated on the Australian electorate, and one that those on this side of the House <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will be actively ensuring is dispelled in ensuing weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) knows perfectly well what goes to the very core of this broken promise; in his own words, he said that the measure will help the government to meet the challenge of reducing the budget deficit. That is what is driving this decision&mdash;nothing more and nothing less&mdash;and that is the basis for the coalition's approach to industry policy. It is the primacy of the fiscal bottom line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  government's economic philosophy goes no further&mdash;not an inch further&mdash;than the simple and discredited view that the only role for government in the economy is to get out of it, leave it alone, let the market prevail. It believes in cutting spending to the bare minimum&mdash;this is seen by the government as one of its reasons to exist&mdash;privatising everything and leaving the market to fend ruthlessly, and in a very much unfettered way, for itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This view is not shared by industry. We have ample evidence of this in the response to the government's proposed changes to the R&amp;D tax concession which have flooded the media since its announcement. The Chairman of the Co&hyphen;operative Research Centres Association, Dr Mark Sceat, made it clear that the reduction in the R&amp;D tax concession would make it very difficult for industry to create both wealth and jobs through innovation. Dr Sceat said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is little in this Budget to indicate that the Government understands the need for policies which encourage investment in high-risk, high-reward ventures . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian industry's investment in R&amp;D is still far below OECD averages and this limits Australian industry's ability to commercialise R&amp;D outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, we still run that very great and ever-threatening risk to commercialise R&amp;D outcomes. These quotes are from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  of 22 August.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The much revered President of the Australian Academy of Science, Sir Gustav Nossal, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 21 August this year, on the government's going back on its promise to maintain the R&amp;D reduction level, said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4534">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 125 per cent is a bad decision which we hope at some later time might be reconsidered</PARA>
<PARA>The vitriolic attack on the changes to the R&amp;D tax concession scheme from Robert Gottliebsen in this week's edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS>  should be sufficient evidence for anyone that the coalition government is sadly out of touch with the needs, particularly the expectations, of Australian business, large and small, in an ever-more complicated, challenging and competitive global environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can assure Sir Gustav Nossal and Australian industry that the Labor opposition will take all necessary steps to ensure the continued functioning of what has been one of the more successful government schemes to assist business of recent times. Whether it be through supporting the measures contained in this bill to tighten up the scheme's administration or through opposing the reduction in the tax concession rank from 150 per cent to 125 per cent and the ludicrous abolition of syndication, the opposition, based on our proven better understanding of the concerns and issues facing our own Australian industries, will not hang businesses out to dry, as this government seems absolutely hell-bent on doing. I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill sets out to deal with several minor anomalies in the principal act, and for that it is unobjectionable. For example, it validates internal review decisions and overseas research and development decisions taken outside the 90-day period prescribed in the act. Given that this mandatory time period is to be made discretionary at the option of the applicant company, there is no reason to oppose the amendment. However, this legislation does fail to  deal with the problems and concerns at the core. No-one disputes that we need to get the most out of our research dollar. What is debatable is how that is to be best achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's objectives, in announcing the axing of the syndication scheme and its talk of reducing the general tax concessions from 150 per cent to 125 per cent, are twofold. The first objective of the Treasurer (Mr <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Costello) is to minimise tax expenditure&mdash;in other words, to enhance the total revenue take. The second is a motivation to crack down on those companies the government believes are legitimately creating wealth for themselves without considering the net benefit of their activities to the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are valid considerations, but there are pressing concerns. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> earlier this year, Ms Vivian McCarron, the research and development tax specialist at Coopers and Lybrand, made the following observation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . history has shown that without some form of tangible government assistance, Australian investors and corporations tend to be unwilling to put money into research and development.</PARA>
<PARA>Ms McCarron's comments, while accurate, are not new. In May 1996, the Warren Centre at Sydney University made a similar observation in its report on the research and development concession. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the tax concession becomes an underpinning program amongst all of the other comparative advantages to carrying out R&amp;D activities in Australia and a critical cost/risk reduction factor for companies in their decision making process and investment strategy development.</PARA>
<PARA>In short, syndication and the general research and development tax concession emerged as the driving force behind innovation in Australia. The research and development syndication scheme was introduced by the previous Labor government in 1987. It was a recognised and sanctioned method for financing new research and development through the transfer and early utilisation of tax losses. The present government defended its decision to shut down the syndication scheme on 23 July this year by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the current arrangements . . . have become focused on tax minimisation rather than the provision of genuine R&amp;D.</PARA>
<PARA>That is at odds with the comment made in an industry publication only one month earlier, in June. The chairman of the IR&amp;D Board said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What was once viewed simply as a tax shelter&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he is talking about syndication&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is now recognised as a bona fide funding mechanism generating valued R&amp;D for Australian industry.  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4535"> </PARA>
<PARA>Many independent industry organisations have championed the success of the syndication scheme while at the same time acknowledging that there were problems in its early stages. The government has made much fanfare in the media with talk about syndicate rorting, yet its own report discloses that only five of the 217 syndicates examined revealed questionable taxation arrangements. Furthermore, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) admitted in an ABC radio interview on 24 July that none of these questionable syndicate arrangements would have been approved under the new guidelines that were introduced in November last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has become obsessed with the so-called rorting of the schemes, or at least it is a smokescreen. Yet the calculations it has used to support its jaundiced view are based on syndicates which would not have been approved under the November 1995 guidelines. This surely makes redundant the government's claims of widespread abuse of the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of rorting also brings into question the credibility of the Industry Research and Development Board and the Australian Taxation Office. If poor legislation and management have allowed a small number of companies to manipulate the scheme, why should all genuine research projects be jeopardised by abandoning all or parts of the concession? Why? Surely the Treasurer will remember criticising the former Labor government on its decision to impose the fringe benefits tax on employee share plans. In November 1994 he told the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if you have a hole in the tax net, you go out and fix the hole and catch the sharks but you do not haul in the dolphins . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This was the Treasurer in another incarnation. Where is the consistency in the Treasurer's policy decisions now? The 1994 report of the Bureau of Industry Economics was, until recently, the only one to have been sponsored by the Commonwealth to specifically focus on the cost and merits of syndication. It endorsed the credibility of the program and it identified a number of key outcomes of syndicated research and development. It said that syndication helped embed a commercial <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> focus in R&amp;D programs and that it was responsible for inducing significant new research and development activity in the companies that use it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Warren Centre study into research and development syndication detailed 21 benefits of the scheme. These included benefits to the researcher, the taxpayer and the investor. It stated that one of the most important roles syndication had played was in the inducement of new research and development. It found that, between 1989 and 1993, syndication was responsible for 23.8 per cent of induced research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has chosen to ignore these findings. Instead, it has bandied about a figure of $1 billion, which it claims will be saved as a result of abandoning syndication. The government has failed to point out that this figure ignores the savings to revenue arising from the tax losses given up by the researcher.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Syndication really only represents a timing difference from a tax revenue perspective. It offers immediate benefit to the investor rather than future relief to the researcher, but the government said that it aims to replace the syndication scheme with a system of loans and grants. This aim is despite the fact that the administrative cost of obtaining grant assistance has proved a barrier to such industry schemes in the past, as highlighted by Ms McCarron. Because grants will not consume existing tax losses, it is also acknowledged that on a dollar-for-dollar basis they are more costly than the current indirect tax incentives offered to industry. In its discussion paper on the possible replacement programs for syndication, the government indicated that under a grants scheme:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Applications would be assessed to direct funds to the best projects.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously neither the Treasurer nor the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism has read or taken any notice of a submission from the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry entitled `Submission on government assistance to industry'. This report quite clearly demonstrates that the government should not attempt to pick win <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4536"> ners when providing assistance to industry. The chamber's report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Picking winners is the central role of business, lending institutions and stock markets . . . It is difficult to envisage a situation in which government ministers, or public servants, will be better able and qualified to assess a business's prospects than the market.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet this is precisely what any number of grants schemes encourage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industry Commission report of 1994 also indicated that syndication brought forward research and development and, therefore, improved the chances of commercial success of an innovation. In other words, by fast tracking innovation and commercialisation, syndication increases the taxable revenue from those involved&mdash;although admittedly later. This would further offset the initial cost to government revenues under the syndication scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The challenge before the government today is how to maximise interest amongst the investment community and increase its commitment to funding research and development in this country. The axing of syndication, the proposal to introduce a grants scheme in place of syndication and an overhaul of the definition of the general concession suggest that the current government is hopelessly out of touch with the needs of industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former shadow minister for small business, the member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan), said in October last year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) would be better advised to focus on Australia's small businesses . . . a good place to start promoting an innovative culture within Australian industry, and small business is right in our own backyard.</PARA>
<PARA>What a pity the coalition is not heeding her pre&hyphen;election words. Syndication allowed several companies to form a commercial alliance for the sake of research and development where the risks were too great for a single entity to take. Small and medium size businesses stood to gain from syndication, along with the big end of town. But the axing of the scheme will adversely affect the ability particularly of small businesses to innovate, expand, employ and invest.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it any wonder that the small business community is `rapidly losing confidence in the government's ability to deliver an improved economy,' as reported in the most recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages Small Business Index</EMPHASIS>? The government should be encouraging a change of mind&hyphen;set in our investment community towards research and development. Claims that Australian business has not contributed to research and development in the past are fallacious. In fact, 92 per cent or $3,136 million of the total funds used for research and development in the year 1994-95 came from business enterprises. By contrast, Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that government expenditure accounted for only $90 million or less than three per cent of the total funds made available for research and development in that year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budgeted figures for 1995-96 indicated that the federal government's $63 million assistance to research and development amounts to only 1.5 per cent of its total spending on assistance to industry. It is worth comparing that figure to the $96 million pledged to sport and recreation and to the $97 million to film and television in the same period. What should be of concern to this government is the low rate of business expenditure on research and development&mdash;BERD, in short&mdash;in Australia compared with the OECD nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the year 1994&hyphen;95 Australia's BERD represented only 0.74 per cent of gross domestic product. This was less than half of that of any one of the following countries: Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Germany, France and Finland. This is not a reflection on the quality of Australian research and researchers, but it does highlight the gulf that exists between the Australian scientific community and the investment community.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Kate Grenot commented on this issue in an interview given to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> in July this year. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Syndication provided one vehicle for funding and reconciliation of startups, but was never built to traverse rough, diverse terrain.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian scientific community, with few exceptions, has little idea about how to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4537"> commercialise its inventions. This is not unique to Australia but, unlike other developed countries, including the United States, little attempt has been made here to bridge the gap between the scientific and investment worlds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Neither the previous Labor government nor the coalition appear to understand that a coordinated business process is necessary to achieve this. Technological advances are essential to ensure that Australia remains competitive in this era of global innovation. Such advances are characterised by lengthy and expensive lead times. Talking still about Australia, Dr Grenot suggests:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tolerance of research and development `failure' is low, investment time horizons are short. The outlook continues to be bleak for high risk, albeit high potential, start ups.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps one exception to this rule has been the Australian mining industry. Australia currently leads the OECD in research and development intensity in the steel and iron business, `intensity' being terminology, I understand, for comparison between industry turnover and research spending. This is a reflection of the commitment the marketers have made to funding research and development in mining on a long&hyphen;term basis. Why we have not been able to replicate this standard in other industries escapes us. Such a possibility will be threatened, of course, by the axing of syndication and talk of redefining the general concession, especially as the government has failed to come up with a viable alternative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The research and development concessions have been plagued by a lack of stability and longevity from the start, because of the short&hyphen;termism of the former government's approach. And yet industry groups, including the Chamber of Mines and Energy and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, have said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government funding for R&amp;D should be predicated on defined long&hyphen;term policies to enable continuity and stability in the research effort. Such stability will assist in providing suitable infrastructure and attracting and retaining the best researchers to the industry.</PARA>
<PARA>Ms McCarron suggested that the glaring omission in the R&amp;D debate is the need for greater stability and a clear and sustainable <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> policy. She also stated that consultation with the relevant parties was the only way to forge a viable long&hyphen;term business plan for Australian research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government should have opted to sit tight for a period of six months before making a decision on syndication and the general research and development concession. That would have allowed all industry participants to have had some semblance of meaningful discussions with the government and to contribute to a long&hyphen;term plan before it took its short&hyphen;term decisions. Instead, the government's actions have been checkered and underhand in this regard. Up until 23 July this year, the minister for industry was still writing to researchers encouraging them to pursue their applications for syndication. In one letter dated 22 July, the minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand that the assessment process for your syndication application has recently commenced . . . I wish you the best of luck with your project.</PARA>
<PARA>Within 24 hours, the minister announced the end of the syndication program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most surprising and unjust aspects of the government's handling of syndication is the retrospective nature of it. I say `surprising' because the Treasurer is on record as saying that he believes retrospective taxes are odious and wrong in principle. Perhaps this is an ominous example of selective application of policy by the Treasurer.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation, the Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill 1996, has been brought forward by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) in relation to R&amp;D research and development concessions from the government and processes and procedures for syndication and the like. I want to use the opportunity to introduce into this debate the whole question of industry policy and particularly, later on in my speech, as it affects steel and iron making.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major issue facing Australia essentially is jobs. Jobs, of course, come from economic activity and economic growth, but only in certain kinds of areas. We have seen in this last decade and more an absolute revolution in the Australian economy. We have seen a more than doubling in exports of mining <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4538"> products, iron ore, coal and the like, but a reduction of 10 per cent in their work force. We have seen a more than doubling of agricultural products with a very slight increase in their work force. We have seen a 400 per cent increase in manufacturing exports with a very slight reduction in their work force. So what has been going on has been an enormous shift in the nature of our economy, and it has been driven by government policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government sat down and tried to work through with the community, with business leaders, with the scientific community, with workers, what we needed to do to change the nature of our economy and the nature of work in Australia. That revolution has had enormous implications. It introduced changes to people's lives, to their work, to the whole nature of awards, of workplace restructuring, right across the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through that process, it undoubtedly undermines to some degree people's stability and their confidence in their long-term future. We saw that insecurity focused on and manipulated in the last election, and that is still being done today. However, what is being done today is even worse. The structure and ethos that was created and developed by the previous government to encourage the restructuring of the Australian economy is now being wound back. It is being reversed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shift in R&amp;D write&hyphen;offs basically says to business, `This is a rort.' We have heard the business rort argument over and over again. These are the people who were supposed to be supporting business. Basically, they are saying to business people, `The concessions that were there to try to shift the nature of investment, the nature of activity, the nature of work, to try to change the business culture in Australia, were all rorts and had to be cut back. The people who were using them were cheats and frauds.' That is what is being put forward. That is the message going out to the community and to business. No wonder they do not have confidence in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly, the R&amp;D tax write&hyphen;offs, the depreciation regimes, the infrastructure bonds, the development tax concessions for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> major developments, together with export market development grants and dozens of other focused and targeted schemes, were aimed at restructuring the nature of the Australian economy. There has not been one complaint from the business community or the economic community about the direction of those policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No&hyphen;one is going to argue that they needed to be applied rigorously and that some people might misuse them and that, whenever that occurred, they should be fixed. No&hyphen;one is going to argue with that. Now there is a massive repudiation of that whole direction. That is going to lead to companies reviewing their corporate strategies in the light of these changes. If the government is going to change all the rules, then companies are going to review their policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to focus on that in what is happening with BHP, iron ore and steel making in Australia. In recent weeks, the minister declined to reissue the terms of reference for the inquiry of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. I have never heard of a minister declining to reissue a reference for an inquiry commenced in a previous parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last parliament, we had initiated an inquiry on major projects. As part of that inquiry, we visited Port Hedland and talked to BHP about its hot briquetted iron development which, incidentally, as a major project is a beneficiary of the development tax concessions. This $1.5 billion plant will produce iron of 94 per cent to 96 per cent purity which is aimed at export but also as a feedstock for the new electric arc furnace that is proposed for Newcastle in 2002.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the new parliament, the parliamentary committee met and resolved to continue that inquiry. We already had submissions from organisations, from the Western Australian government and from a number of other bodies. We had had a hearing in Perth which was very productive. However, the minister has declined to reissue the terms of reference. He has not said he will not, but we resolved before we got up in the last session to ask for those terms of reference to be continued, and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4539"> the message coming through is that that is not being supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why not? What is wrong with this government? The people who have made submissions and who have not yet been able to address the committee are now being wiped out. I raise this issue because a few weeks ago I wrote to the chairman of the committee and suggested that, given the nature of what is occurring, there is a need for us to look more closely as a country at the whole process of iron and steel making in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that at the moment there are five or six companies all looking at adding value to iron ore, particularly in Western Australia, and one of them is BHP. There is no doubt that the Western Australian government welcomed the idea of that inquiry and the fact that at a national level we were considering policies that affected iron and steel making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wrote to the committee and we discussed the need to make sure the inquiry focused on iron and steel making as part of its broader scope of national projects because the iron and steel industry is fundamentally important to this country. We are a major exporter of iron ore, we are a major exporter of gas and we are a major exporter of coal, all of the ingredients that are required for adding value to iron ore and for making iron into steel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are a minor exporter of iron and steel. If one looks at the figures for the last five years, if one looks at the actual shift in exports from Australia into Asia, we find that the increase in Australian exports in recent years into Asia has gone up 400 per cent, which sounds terrific&mdash;from 0.7 million tonnes to 2.8 million tonnes&mdash;but at the same time we find that exports from Latin America into Asia, particularly from Brazil, have gone up 800 per cent to eight million tonnes a year. We are not able to compete with Latin America in a market which is very close to us, the fast&hyphen;growing market of Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should know why that is. We should know how much we are doing to shift our value adding to iron ore. We should know how companies are approaching it. Are national policies appropriate and suitable; and if not, why not? This is a major national issue but we cannot talk about it because the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minister will not re&hyphen;issue the terms of reference. Quite frankly, I am sure that some companies do not want to talk about it either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I focus now on BHP because it is quite possible that what is good for BHP may not be good for Australia. BHP is now a transnational organisation trading globally in a diverse range of products ranging from energy right through to manufactured goods. It is a major supplier of iron ore but it is also a maker of steel and an exporter of steel. The question of compatibility of BHP's interest and the national interest is one that is fundamentally important. It would be beneficial for this country if there was some public discussion and understanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Herald</EMPHASIS> regarding the future of BHP Steel, particularly in Newcastle. Quite frankly, most parliamentarians do not follow the steel or iron industries very closely. They should, because there are few things which are more important to our economy and to the way we do things than our iron and steel making industries and our iron ore exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that almost 1&half; years ago BHP announced that its future in Newcastle involved the building of electric arc furnaces by 2002 and the closing down of the existing blast furnaces. The feedstock for those blast furnaces could likely include hot briquetted iron out of BHP's Port Hedland plant, then on the drawing board. However, just a short time ago we had an announcement by BHP that it would be reviewing its total approach to steel and that Mr Ron McNeilly would undertake that major review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The article in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Herald</EMPHASIS> that I referred to was based on a report from the stockbrokers, McIntosh and Co., and quotes extensively from Mr McNeilly. The analyst involved, Ms Prior, discussed these matters with Mr McNeilly. His comments in that article have cast great doubt on BHP's future development in Newcastle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The BHP of today was built on the basis of the steel plant in Newcastle. It was the first steel plant established in Australia early this century, in 1915. That changed BHP from a miner at Broken Hill to a major national <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4540"> company in manufactured goods. The profits from the BHP Newcastle plant allowed BHP to get into a range of other places and products&mdash;Port Kembla, iron and gas and eventually, as I have said, allowed it to become a major international organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Back in 1982 BHP made its announcement that the future of that plant and the future of steel was in doubt. The incoming Labor government in March 1983 committed itself to a steel plan. Enormous effort went into ensuring the future of the steel industry in Australia and BHP made a major investment in its plants across the country. But a major investment was also made by the BHP work force in Newcastle. If we look back to the late 1970s and through until now, we find that the work force at BHP has reduced from over 11,000 to about 3,000. There has been a massive change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Between 1983 and now there has been enormous industrial harmony. The cooperation of the work force with management on what was good for the company and what was good for all of them has been absolutely superb. Yet we are finding these comments being made by Mr McNeilly which are not being made in conjunction with any other discussion. I think that there is going to be some disillusionment about that approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Newcastle has been very good to BHP. The city has actually responded and cooperated enormously through the company's periods of difficulty. We are prepared to do so again&mdash;if we are consulted and if we are well informed. But what is happening here in terms of these remarks is and must be disturbing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole question of industry policy and steel development is going to plague this government while ever it pursues a path of reduction and sees industry policy in the sense of business rorts or non&hyphen;business rorts. It is going to plague this government while ever this minister refuses to allow inquiries into major projects incorporating iron and steel making. It is going to plague this government whilst it tries to play up industrial relations as being part of our problem or as causing those kinds of problems. BHP Newcastle's downsizing and restructuring and productivity gains have not been done through <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> some new legislation from the conservatives but through cooperation between the work force, the unions and management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not need all this rhetoric from those opposite about creating work through industrial relations change. What we need are decent industry policies where companies are prepared to invest in their future. The fact is that, if BHP goes ahead with what is implied in Mr McNeilly's comments about the future of the Newcastle plant, we can start to wipe out BHP as a major player in steel technology. The technology of the future is with directly reduced iron&mdash;whether it is from BHP or a range of other companies making it&mdash;going into arc furnaces and making high quality steel and thin, flat products. A range of technologies in the rolling area of production is going to transform the nature of steel making worldwide. The integrated plants will be seen in 20 or 30 years time as dinosaurs&mdash;they will have no future. So the future of Port Kembla is going to be very limited. The development of the Newcastle plant which was being proposed was the way that BHP could stay at the leading edge of technology in steel. The size of the plant is important, and the use of HBI and the capacity to produce new steels and steel technology and steel science are fundamentally in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefit of that to this country is of enormous importance. The benefit of it to BHP in the short term may not be that great&mdash;and I am certainly interested in hearing what its views are on that. But, in the long term, it seems to me that BHP would be giving a message to the world if it pursues this strategy that it will eventually move out of steel and pass over to Smorgons or anybody else the steel making via scrap or whatever other method might be available. Looking at that in context, the HBI plant being proposed at Port Hedland by BHP in one sense is relatively small. At 2&half; million tonnes, it sounds big, but when you keep in mind it exports out of the same port 55 million tonnes of iron ore the value adding that is being proposed at Port Hedland is actually for a fairly small amount of its existing production.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4541">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Newcastle has been good to BHP. We have played a strong role because it has been an important part of our own development. We expect BHP to maintain its commitment to Newcastle. Leaving aside the articles, I think that Mr McNeilly has been unfortunate in making those comments because of the interpretation that has been placed on them. But I expect that BHP will keep faith with the people who kept faith with them, not just in Newcastle but in the nation as a whole. Any indication that BHP is backing off in steel science and technology and leading edge technology in Australia would be disastrous to the national interest. Mind you, they could well say the R&amp;D tax write&hyphen;offs have been a major issue to them, and they have been. BHP have used them extensively, and so they should. That is what they were there for. The fact that they have been reduced could be part of the reason for BHP's corporate thinking as to how much they are prepared to invest. The message from the government is that they will be reduced even further in the years ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at what has been put forward by the government in incentives for business to invest in new technology and research and development and depreciation and all the other areas that make up that whole economic investment framework, then BHP may well simply be responding to what is a very clear message. Do BHP see themselves as a business rorter? I do not think so. That is not the message they have ever given. They see themselves as being a good corporate citizen. They pay very high levels of company tax, if not the maximum level. This is not a company that has actually tried to `do it nasty'. Perhaps what they are seeing, and that they need to factor into their corporate strategies, is a change of government policy away from the incentives that changed the nature of our economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation, plus all the other messages from the government in conjunction with BHP's processes, is very threatening not just to Newcastle steel making but to national steel making and I suggest many other industries. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industry, Science and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Tourism (Mr Moore) really does not have his heart in this measure. I was interested in the contribution of the honourable member for Bowman (Mrs West), a member of the Queensland Liberal Party and close to the operation up there. I thought we might see some of the guiding principles behind this move. What we had was a contribution with the usual slogans about Labor's words and the need for deeds, the slothful inaction of the previous government, comments that statistics mask realities, Labor's penchant for doom and gloom, that Labor had done things too late, they had been too slow, et cetera. In actual fact, the minister concerned does not really have his heart in this measure. He is essentially being dictated to by other elements in the government. I think this is part of the image problem he has in a variety of areas where Australian industry needs protection. Steve Lewis in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  comments on another area of portfolio responsibility:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been more than six months since the change of government. While most of the post&hyphen;election focus has been on the budget, suppliers to the Commonwealth can be forgiven for thinking Mr Moore, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism has lost focus on what is considered a central plank of coalition's industry policy.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Lewis concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In any case, Mr Moore and his department still have to run the gauntlet of Treasury and Finance which traditionally resist any attempt to link industry development with the procurement process.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>What we have is a very serious suggestion, which will undermine Australian industry. We can dream about level playing fields; we can dream about spontaneous action by the corporate sector; we can believe that somehow there is venture capital out there. But the sad reality is that, when government members today cite statistics about Australia's lamentable position, I think we have to go back historically and say that in 1985 when these kinds of measures were introduced there was a very real need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are seeing, as other members on this side of the House have commented, is a very worrying departure from the commitment the government gave before the election. We know that in the science and technology policy they said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4542">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changes to the syndicated research and development tax concession scheme guidelines may well result in the drying up of one of the few effective forms of venture capital available to fund research and development.</PARA>
<PARA>If that is not an endorsement of the process, I do not know what is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Back in September last year, we had other statements of support for R&amp;D. In a paper put together by the parliament's research service it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the September 1994 statement, the Opposition has also claimed to have made a big commitment to support basic research and infrastructure. Noting trade opportunities, it stresses the need for a clear, long&hyphen;term strategic approach to S&amp;T. The Opposition proposes to further encourage industry investment in R&amp;D, to ensure world class basic research through better facilities . . . </PARA>
<PARA>They were fine words, but the reality today is that they are condemning Australia to the problems it had before 1985. In 1985 Labor moved towards a variety of measures&mdash;tax concessions, direct grants to industry R&amp;D, concessional loans for commercialisation of innovation, sectoral industry developments in a wide variety of areas such as automotive, textiles, pharmaceuticals, food, IT, aerospace, the national research facilities program, Australian Technology Group, cooperative research centres and AusIndustry&mdash;designed to tackle Australia's lamentable position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Peter Roberts, in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 1 August 1996, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commercially oriented innovation, as measured by business expenditure on R&amp;D (BERD), grew by 12.5 per cent a year between 1981 and 1993, the fastest growth rate in the OECD. BERD is now the equivalent of 0.71 per cent of gross domestic product, close to triple the level of 1981 when it languished at 0.25 per cent of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA>We have a situation where there are obvious problems still with the level in this country. Whether it is to do with a fragmented industry structure, the domestic focus of companies, hangovers from the tariff situation or bad management, the reality is that much research and development essentially depend on finance from outside the country by corporations that might not see it in their interests to undertake that here and, I guess, our long&hyphen;term reliance on minerals. They have been <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> problems that the government faced back in that period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Science and Public Policy</EMPHASIS> in June 1989, Mark Dodgson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both Australian and foreign owned or controlled industries show an R&amp;D intensity well below the median for eight OECD countries: and the three industries with R&amp;D intensities nearest to the eight&hyphen;country median were ferrous metals, paper and printing, and wood and furniture. These are. . . low technology industries.</PARA>
<PARA>Even after changes&mdash;which, I think we all understand, appreciate and agree, improve the performance&mdash;R. Slatyer in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Search</EMPHASIS>  of January&hyphen;February 1992 could still remark:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has been a low performer of R&amp;D in high, medium and low technology sectors, both against OECD performance as a whole, or in relation to specific areas. The rate of increase from 1983&hyphen;89 in real terms compounded has been among the fastest in the OECD and it continued to grow during 1989&hyphen;90. Despite this performance, the growth was from a low base, so that in 1989&hyphen;90 it was still only 0.52 per cent of GDP. Since other countries have also increased their performance, Australia's remains close to the bottom of industrial R&amp;D performance of OECD countries. . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The importance of government support for this progressive improvement should be noted.</PARA>
<PARA>We did have a crisis of lack of effort. We did have a crisis in comparison to OECD countries. We had a situation where, in the context of our having a high proportion of Nobel prize winners, having a high degree of original inventions and having those kinds of advantages, there was still no delivery. Labor initiated a process with this particular scheme back in May 1985 and made it a permanent feature in the 1992&hyphen;93 budget. In the November 1987 syndication processes we see the nub of one aspect of what the government is attempting to change today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a series of investigations which has basically upheld the positive side of these schemes. In a 1994 analysis, the BIE suggested that there was a distortion in regard to syndicates, but it gave an overwhelming endorsement to the broad thrust of the need for these schemes. To give some idea of what is involved here, in a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Future needs 2010</EMPHASIS>, the Australian Science and Technology Council stated that economic growth through R&amp;D could contribute $60 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4543"> billion over 10 years to the Australian economy. We thus are looking at a series of schemes that are crucial to this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry reaction to what the government is doing has been very diverse. Not only people involved at the end which the government questions, and accountancy firms that might be involved in facilitating syndication, but also a wide variety of companies are concerned with where this government is going. The orbital engine was one example that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) was quick to publicise his involvement with. That company has questioned the abolition of syndication. That company has questioned what this is going to do to its future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all right to run around with the Australian flag and give out free photos of the Queen, but Australians are questioning why the government would undermine a company like that. This company has been in the forefront. It is actually sponsored by the minister. Its product is deemed worth while to put into government vehicles. The government has been involved in the road testing. Yet, five minutes later, that same company is saying that this series of decisions is undermining where it is going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Rudolf Werner, a research and development tax specialist, was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 22 August as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your after tax benefit on R &amp; D expenditure now falls from around 18c in the dollar to 9c. The benefit at 125 per cent is marginal. What industry is saying is that `we'll do what we are going to do anyway but we certainly are not going to do more R &amp; D'.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the other end of the spectrum. Technology Resources Australia, in conjunction with the major syndicate financiers&mdash;Bain and Co., Bankers Trust and Macquarie Bank&mdash;found that every $1 spent on the 50 pending syndicate applications would generate $2 of private R&amp;D expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nina Field's article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 19 August 1996 stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Research and development syndicates caught in an administrative backlog when the Government scrapped syndication last month would create about $218 million worth of R&amp;D over the next two years if they were allowed to go ahead, according to analysis released yesterday. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>That analysis was by Technology Resources Australia. Graham Carew, the director of R&amp;D services at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, commented that the budget:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . might as well have contained a plane ticket to South&hyphen;East Asia for Australia's innovative technology projects.</PARA>
<PARA>How much stronger a statement can anyone make as to where the thrust of the government will lead? Essentially, it said we are transferring Australian innovation, Australian scientific discoveries, Australian technology, Australian production possibilities to South&hyphen;East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Ian Holland of Digital Ideas&mdash;a computer graphics hardware and software producer which spent over $430,000 on R&amp;D during 1995&hyphen;96 and employs eight of its 25 staff specifically for research&mdash;in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 2 September 1996 was quoted as saying that it was implicit in the government's decision that it did not value R&amp;D companies or understand the long&hyphen;term benefits of supporting them. That is not exactly a mild comment. It is not exactly equivocal. It is not exactly giving the government a second chance. That approach is typical of a wide variety of companies that, along with a significant number of analysts, are saying that this decision condemns Australia to the problems of a decade and a half ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Peter Roberts said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 27 August:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australians, and especially those who drafted last week's federal Budget, seem to have a peculiarly dated idea of the role played by science and technology in a modern economy. The Budget as it affected innovation was very kind to the basic science&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and even within science there is some debate as to the government's expenditure there, with help for the CSIRO but undermining in other facets of science&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">end of the innovation spectrum and harsh on applied development. Readers need hardly be reminded that Australia performs well by international comparisons at the `R' end of R&amp;D but is only a medium&hyphen;level performer at the `D' end where real wealth is created.</PARA>
<PARA>So what we have there is a significant spectrum of people who are very much asserting that the variety of measures the government <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4544"> is undertaking essentially to decrease the tax concession down to 125 per cent, under the subterfuge of concern with rorts, undermined the syndication aspects. We all know that the minister admitted, as quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> , that maybe he was wrong in the initial statements, that maybe most of these supposed rorts were actually picked up in the review process, in the process that looked at the proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 1 August 1996 on ABC radio Mr Moore appeared to backtrack even further. Asked by journalist Matt Brown why the government was not prosecuting rorters, Moore replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, they've been knocked back in the research and development committee which do the research and evaluation of the various projects.</PARA>
<PARA>This less critical view of syndication is backed up in a 1996 report on the scheme prepared by DIST but erroneously referred to by the government as a report of the Bureau of Industry Economics. The report surveyed 163 taxable syndicates and found 158 were genuine and only five were pseudo&hyphen;schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we have here is an attempt by the government to cut back on its responsibilities by utilising the occasional, rare rort in this system to undermine a system that has essentially been defended by Australian industry, a system which reviews have shown is on balance very worth while to industry, worth while in promoting this country internationally. Moreover, the minister has said that most of those rorts that he is going to utilise as an excuse for these changes would essentially have been picked up in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do know that over the period of Labor government there has been, as I said earlier, a variety of schemes to essentially encourage Australian industry, to make sure that research does attempt to match OECD changes. This is a country which is desperately on the back foot with information technology imports and the hardware imports in that field, a country which, as the government tells us so often, has such a difficult trade future, a country which has for many decades had a very big difficulty with the delivery of R&amp;D. It is being undermined very seriously by this government in a wide variety of research and development areas.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, we will see essentially no attempt whatsoever to look at other industries in Australia that do have difficulties, to go back to a pattern of industry assistance, industry plans, that are obviously necessary. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) has been making plane trips around Asia to say that there will be no halting, no slowing, no ifs and buts about Australia's push to be the leader on tariff reduction. He is out there trying to make sure that his name is up in a lot of neon lights on tariff reductions, saying that there is not going to be any equivocation. But what this government is doing is essentially leaving Australian industry with a utopian kind of concept of a level playing field. The country's interests are seriously undermined by the suggestion that we should halt this syndication and at the same time reduce tax concessions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They can talk all they want about their budget problems, they can talk all they want about rorts, but the reality from all surveys that have been undertaken on this is that it was a net contributor. Yes, there have been increases by other OECD countries; they have been increasing their research and development at the same time as we have. Yes, we are still desperately behind the pack. But the reality is that those inquiries of Australian industry, those surveys of what they think have shown that, fundamentally, investment would not have been made and research would not have occurred unless schemes like this were available. I commend the opposition's position on this matter.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I wish to thank all the members who have taken part in the debate on the Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill 1996. Certainly, for a very narrow bill it had a remarkably wide application. I was surprised at some of the contributions that were made&mdash;even going so far as to suggest that there are going to be changes in the Labor Party's industry policy, which I thought was very interesting. I hope that is going to the right&hyphen;wing faction as well as the left, so we can look forward to reading in the newspapers about the contributions of the member for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4545"> Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) at the caucus meetings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, what is the bill about? Listening to most people here today, you would be flat out understanding it. The seeds of the bill go back to the innovation statement of 6 December 1995, brought down by the previous government. Honourable members would remember that rather cobbled together, press release sort of statement that came out. At that stage of the game the Labor Party clearly knew that there were problems in the system, otherwise it would not have attempted to bring it under control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The essence of this bill, as the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) said, picked up the previous government's proposed bill. The most important part of it is to go about the elimination of gravedigging. Gravedigging is not only a political pastime for the Labor Party. In relation to this particular area, it was a feature devised by some accounting people to go back into corporate accounts as far as 1985 and to redefine certain expenditures as research and development, thereby creating an additional tax deduction, depending on which classification it came under. This was an enormously expensive pastime. It took up hundreds of millions of dollars of tax and had a very adverse effect on R&amp;D because it had already been done. So it certainly was not related to the government's policy at that stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we proposed this bill we came to a proposition to redefine gravedigging so that it could no longer take place. It would no longer be going back in history but it now forced companies to lodge applications with the R&amp;D committee no later than six months after the relevant financial period. I will read from the press release put out earlier this year by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and me:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> affirm the announcement by the former Government that there be no new registrations for expenditures incurred in the 1992&hyphen;93 and earlier income years, irrespective of when application for such registration may have been made . . .</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> in respect of years of income ending after 6 December 1995, taxpayers may lodge applications up to six months following the income year in which the expenditure was incurred; and  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> taxpayers may also lodge applications for registration in respect of the 1993&hyphen;94 and 1994&hyphen;95 transitional years of income at any time before 7 June 1996 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This clearly ended gravedigging. The previous government stepped in to close off that part of the area which was being exploited, and this bill picks that up and brings it through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government also said that we need to review and have a look at what was going on, and we have done that. What was going on in gravedigging was a retrospective view of research and development. We have brought a focus to it which looks forward. No longer can you go back and say, `What I did in the past might have been research and development.' You must plan your research and development now and lodge your application within six months of the end of the financial period, and then you are in the general focus of the play. So all the talk that went on beforehand rather missed the point of what went on.</PARA>

When I read what he had to say later on I wondered whether the member for Hotham had really read the innovation statement of 6 December 1995, that cobbled together piece.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If you had read it you would probably have woken up to this particular point. When they decided to move on 6 December 1995, somehow or other there was `loose lips' around the place because between the period of 1 December and 6 December, 250 applications were received when the daily average had been 10 a day. A good old leak occurred somewhere around the place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know where it occurred as there are some pretty high livers in the Labor Party. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4546"> It might have been around the Flemington racetrack or it could have been out on a yacht with some other people, or things like that. There was certainly a leak, there is no doubt about that. When you have 250 applications flock in in five days after the average was 10 a day, something must have happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth reading what the Labor Party statement said at the time, and this is something that the member for Hotham had probably forgotten to read when he was shovelling that money out. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, a number of claimants have been using the scheme in ways which either do not support the new R&amp;D or are driven by artificial tax devices with disproportionate costs to the taxpayer relevant to the R&amp;D sponsored.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what I was saying and what the Treasurer was saying about it. Apparently the member for Hotham had not read it because he was trying to say that these rorts did not occur. There were no rorts according to him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Reid was in there defending those rorters too. That is a bit of information for him as well. There are three current AFP investigations going on into syndicates or proposed syndicates. That is not a bad effort.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most important aspects to remember in this is the appalling administration of the Labor Party. Not only were there leaks there but one leak got out and 250 applications roared in in five days. When we came into government the department down there was absolutely at a standstill. They could not process stuff. They even had a police investigation going on in the department into what was going on with the R&amp;D position. Syndicates were being investigated and there was a police investigation into the department. They were at a total standstill while they were looking around for the leaks that went on. I am not surprised that they talked about everything else under the sun but <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what was in the bill. It was a disgraceful performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From that position the government moved, after much effort, to clean up the act and on 23 July it moved to end syndication. That was purely in line with policy because the objectives of the government were not being achieved by the syndications. The scheme was mainly directed towards financial outcomes rather than research and development outcomes. As the member for Hotham said, the government makes a very significant contribution to R&amp;D but the private sector has always been quite a bit behind.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To outline a couple of reasons why the syndication came to an end, it was an unstable scheme in every respect and it had a history of a loophole followed by an amendment, followed by a loophole, followed by an amendment. As a consequence of that, it became far better known, as I have said, around Sydney and Melbourne for tax deductions as the way to go than any other area I knew. Everybody knew it except the government apparently. It was one of those extraordinary things. Even the tax concession committee associated with the IR&amp;D Board were pessimistic about the future of syndication. So it went.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am as aware as everyone else that Australia is most dependent on pushing research and development as a vital part of industry policy. It is a vital part for Australia in the future. To replace it we have the START program. The START program is $340 million over four years in grants, loans and interest subsidies. When you roll that in with this current scheme, you have $520 million over the four years to go towards the implementation of research and development which is essentially in the loss making company area. As a consequence, we are right at this moment holding consultations with industry to ascertain the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4547"> most appropriate guidelines to get the best results for money. In the consultations we have had so far, we have been very warmly received by industry. I am confident that the start&hyphen;up position can be readily found in the very near future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill contains the cuts of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to state funding. They are the cuts that he said would never take place. He said that not only before the election but, interestingly enough, after the election. It takes a special kind of deceit, it takes a special kind of treachery, in public life to break promises made not only before the election but after the election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the election in March the coalition said that they not only would maintain state funding but would produce a guaranteed share of Commonwealth revenue in state grants. They broke that promise. This bill is part of the litany of coalition broken promises. But not only that, after the election on 12 March the Treasurer had a press conference when he said he was revealing the state of the Commonwealth books. He said at the press conference that he would not in any fiscal consolidation program be reducing general assistance grants to the states. He has broken that promise as well. It really is a unique occasion in the standards of public life and honesty for the Treasurer to break a promise <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> made not only before the election but after the election. That, of course, demonstrates that any talk of a black hole in the federal budget was really an excuse, really an alibi, that the coalition tried to establish by which they could break promise after promise after promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even when the Treasurer had the books in front of him, even when the Treasurer was conducting his press conference on 12 March, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I made it clear during the election campaign that our purpose was not to cut general assistance grants to the states.</PARA>
<PARA>He confirmed that promise 10 days after the election, on 12 March. It is interesting to understand the psyche, the standards and the morality of Mr Costello in breaking promises, not only before the election but after the election, because he really is the role player in Australian politics. They put 20c in the back of his noggin and he wheels himself out, playing the role. In question time it is doggy on heat. Now, with these backflips at the Premiers Conference and on the infrastructure bonds, it is the circus doggy. He is playing the role of circus doggy&mdash;backflip after backflip after backflip. He wrecked the Premiers Conference earlier this year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism knows these things. He sees the role playing. He sees the 20c go into the back of the Treasurer's head; out he goes, role playing. It is doggy on heat in question time and circus doggy when it comes to the backflips at the Premiers Conference, the big backflip on infrastructure bonds, plus breaking promise after promise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does this add up to? It is more than a question of political morality. It is more than a question of standards in public life, it is more than an issue of basic, core honesty in Australian policy. It has a big impact on the states. These swingeing cuts to the states for this financial year&mdash;and the out years, of course&mdash;have a profound impact on state services and a profound impact on state budgets, so much so that the states are being forced to introduce their so-termed `state Costello taxes'. So state services have to be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4548"> cut as a product of these broken promises, promises broken before and after the election, and state taxes and charges have been increased. The government stands condemned for that and no&hyphen;one in the Australian public&mdash;no&hyphen;one in New South Wales, Victoria or any of the other states or territories&mdash;should be blaming their state government or their territory government. The blame rests with Mr Costello. They are his state Costello taxes. They are his broken promises&mdash;made before the election and broken, made after the election and broken again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The service cuts have their greatest impact on health. Approximately $800 million will be cut from public hospital budgets at state level over the next four years&mdash;$320 million explicitly in the budget itself, plus around $460 million flowing from the reduction in general purpose funding now before the House. But this is a government that is saying that there is some problem in Australia's public hospitals. If there is a problem in Australia's public hospitals, and Australia's health system, is the answer to take $800 million from states grants and state public hospitals and then, having taken $800 million out of the public system, to hand $500 million directly to the health insurance funds via the government's flawed tax rebates?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It proves that the coalition is not opposed to welfare. It is not opposed to handouts as long as they go to the big end of town. It is not opposed to welfare as long as it is for big business. It is not opposed to handouts as long as they go to the big end of town, and in this case they are bloating the already excessive reserves of the private health insurance funds. There is no crisis in the private health funds in Australia. There is no crisis in the private health insurance system. I feel like repeating until I am blue in the face that there is no crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> There is no crisis other than that generated by this government. There is no crisis, other than by a government that is willing to rip $800 million out of the public hospital system to put $500 million of transfers into the already bloated reserves of the private health funds. There is no crisis even though, if we examine what is happening in private insur ance, we find that it is true that they have lost members. Yes, that is absolutely correct. They have lost members but for a very good reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The private funds have lost members because those funds have not offered decent value for money. Here is a party that says that it is pro&hyphen;market, it is pro&hyphen;choice, it is pro&hyphen;private enterprise, so it must understand that if you do not offer value for money you lose customers. That is exactly what has happened to the private funds. They have lost members because they have not offered decent value for money to members from those premiums. Younger, healthier people have dropped out of the funds; they were essentially paying premiums but not using the health services. This trend may have reduced profits and reserves in the short term for those funds, but it has not diminished their contribution to paying for health services in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Expenditure on health services matters. It is expenditure on health services, service utilisation that matters in the Australian health system, not the rate of insurance&mdash;insurance which in many cases is not being used. That is why people opt out of the private health funds. They have not been utilising their insurance.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The number of people unemployed during the period when you were minister increased by 34,444. The unemployment rate increased from 10.4 per cent to 10.6 per cent. The long-term unemployment rate increased by 95,100. The long-term unemployed, as a percentage of total unemployed, increased by 28.1 per cent to 37.4 per cent. The cruellest of the lot: during the period that you were minister for employment&mdash;or unemployment&mdash;the youth unemployment rate increased from 30.2 per cent to 32.2 per cent. It is a circumstance which really means that you should hang your head in shame for even daring to ask this question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course the government has a comprehensive approach to boost jobs.

Further to that and specifically in relation to jobs, whether it is in dealing with the domestic industry, the manufacturing industry, the service industry, the primary industries or beyond, it is an absolute truism that the net effect of the trade policies of this government will be to expand exports, to boost trade, investment and tourism and, by that, to create extra jobs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They did not lead on to jobs. The fact is that over the last six years, between July 1990 and the March election, the Labor Party government succeeded in creating an additional 7,100 full-time jobs. They created an absolute desert of full-time employment. That is the reason why we have the unemployment problem that we have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Growth in the employment situation tailed off after April 1995. After April 1995, growth in employment tailed away to a rate of 1.2 per cent a year. The reason it did that was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4551"> even that government realised it could no longer afford the galloping deficits, which piled up $70 billion of deficit spending over the last five years. That was absolutely unsustainable. The balance of payments blew out. The country realised that the International Monetary Fund would be here soon if there were not an end to that policy.</PARA>

What plans has the government in place to resolve the Hindmarsh Island bridge affair? Will these plans put to an end this long running and expensive saga?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4552" SPEAKER="Wooldridge, Dr Michael, MP" NAMEID="8E4" ELECTORATE="Chisholm" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Health and Family Services" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Yesterday in the other place the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs tabled the Mathews report and announced that it was the government's intention to introduce legislation to finally resolve this matter. This has been going on since 12 May 1994 when the former minister for Aboriginal affairs put a temporary injunction on the building of the Hindmarsh Island bridge. He then appointed Professor Saunders to inquire into the claims. Professor Saunders reported and the minister made a permanent declaration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's decision was subsequently overturned on procedural grounds. The minister appealed to the full bench of the Federal Court and lost the appeal. At the same time, the South Australian government had a royal commission into this matter and the former minister had a second inquiry, this time with Justice Mathews. Justice Mathews's inquiry was found not to be tenable by the High Court because it was not consistent with her judicial office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this 2&half;&hyphen;year saga has shown is that the Aboriginal heritage protection act has very serious deficiencies and very serious procedural impositions on the minister. It would seem to be in everybody's interests now after 2&half; years that this finally be brought to a conclusion. Given the deficiencies that have been shown up in three reports, several court appeals and the final report from Justice Mathews, it would seem that the only sensible <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4553"> way to bring this to a conclusion is by way of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that, it is interesting to note the opposition's position on this matter. The shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs was hitting the airwaves yesterday saying that the legislation would be vigorously opposed. He said, `I am not going to take a recommendation to shadow cabinet to support this. It has not got a chance of passing the Senate.' Even this morning as of 8 a.m. on radio station 4BC he was saying that this legislation would breach the Racial Discrimination Act. It would also have to be retrospective and he said once again that they were not going to support it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to give the shadow minister some advice: if you want to go out on a limb, it is worth checking with your leader before you do so. At pretty much the same time he was on 4BC saying that there is no way the opposition is going to support this, the Leader of the Opposition was doing a doorstop and he was asked twice whether or not he would be supporting this. The first time he was asked he said, `As I said, we'll take a look at it.' That is very different from the position of the shadow minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The journalist had another go at him, quite rightly, and said, `So then you are not saying that this is going to be opposed if you have a look at it.' The Leader of the Opposition replied, `I'm not saying anything about that. I want to take a close look at it.' Quite clearly the Leader of the Opposition is not prepared to stand by his shadow minister. Quite clearly the opposition does not have a clue how they are going to respond to this in spite of 2&half; years to get their act together on the matter. The fact is that, if they cannot get their act together on a simple action like this, if they are divided on such a simple issue as putting to end a 2&half;&hyphen;year saga on the Hindmarsh Bridge, it shows no leadership whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition is going to Bathurst on Friday to make a light on the hill speech. It is very interesting that he is doing this, given that I remember him rubbishing the former Leader of the Opposition for his headland speech.</PARA>

In the reform legislation at the initiative of some in the Senate, an anti-age discriminatory provision was included. I understand from those who were involved in those discussions that when it was included it was directed particularly to older Australians, those reaching 60 or 65, so that they could continue in gainful employment&mdash;a proposition which I think most members would support. It was not realised at the time what the implications for young people would be. In the time following the passage of that legislation there were discussions about how this provision could be implemented so as to avoid an impact on young people. When Labor were in power they themselves publicly conceded that there was no means then available to implement that policy and they themselves extended the exemption.

I have heard suggestions that Telstra should issue $8 billion in redeemable preference shares. May I say that proposal holds no attraction for the government. Redeemable preference shares are essentially a financing transaction by which you would raise $8 billion which would be redeemable at the option of the person who issues them. It essentially amounts to a financing transaction. It essentially would be borrowing off the back of a Telstra security.</PARA></TALK.START>

The differential would be lower and there would be no basis whatsoever for not being able to raise the required funds in the bond markets with Treasury bonds. This holds no attraction for the government. May I say that the government, of course, is determined at the moment, by and large, to stabilise its debt.

The last survey showed there were some niche areas for private health insurance that had not been fully exploited.

For example, a parent may reach an agreement by negotiation with a small business operator for a particular set of hours of employment which would allow them to drop their children at school, to then work from 10 a.m. until 2.30 p.m. and then to go back and collect those kids from school.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The member for Jagajaga put out a press release on the Commonwealth-state housing offer that the Prime Minister had made to the states yesterday. I feel I should defend the honour of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Prime Minister. I doubt that he is lying awake in Tokyo worrying about this press release from the member for Jagajaga, but I think we should set the record straight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, it made two criticisms of the Prime Minister's offer to the states. One was a criticism of the suggestion that the Commonwealth should move towards directing its money to income support and the states focus on delivering public housing services themselves. The member for Jagajaga said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is only one way of assuring low cost housing for the poor and needy in our community&mdash;a strong public housing sector where the states are properly funded to build and maintain public housing so they can keep a lid on rent levels. The coalition's cash in hand approach will fail.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Don't you agree with that?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Where do you think that approach came from? Paul Keating and the Labor Party agreed at the COAG meeting with all of the states. The COAG communique on 11 April 1995 said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a joint communique the reforms will bring about a fundamental shift in roles and responsibilities entailing the Commonwealth accepting responsibility for income support and housing affordability and the states and territories for housing services.</PARA>
<PARA>Prime Minister Howard was bound by that communique. That was Labor policy. The member for Jagajaga is out campaigning now against Labor policy. How extraordinary! She also said in this press release:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If subsidies to low income families in private rental are to be substantially expanded and tenants are to be paid subsidies so they pay around 25 per cent of their income in rent, then revenue neutrality is a pipedream.</PARA>
<PARA>So she is saying that it is also a pipedream to try to do this on a revenue neutral basis. You can imagine how breathtaking we find this kind of thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal that new tenants in public housing ensure they pay no more than 25 per cent of their income for rent and that this be done in a revenue neutral way was published in a document called `Community and Nation' December 1995&mdash;the Labor Party policy. You are campaigning against another aspect of the Labor Party policy. I warned the shadow Treasurer about this. I said that the first thing he had to do was bring the socialist <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4560"> left into line in his own party. They are not just campaigning against the coalition position; they are campaigning against the Labor Party position as well&mdash;a kind of joint unity ticket against both.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is endemic of an opposition which cannot enunciate a coherent position&mdash;not a coherent position on housing, not a coherent position on Hindmarsh bridge. The Socialist left is running around on Hindmarsh bridge saying that it will not even bring a position to the shadow cabinet, whilst the Leader of the Opposition is sitting around saying, `I cannot tell you what it is until it has been to the shadow cabinet.' If the socialist left has its way it will never get there, Leader. That is the problem. It will never get there. There will be no recommendation. Before the budget the shadow Treasurer said on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> on 12 May:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will be obviously looking at the budget line by line in determining our individual responses to it, recognising that governments have to govern. Of course, we are not going to be silly about it.</PARA>
<PARA>Oh, no! You are only opposing $19 billion of it! Michelle Grattan said on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS>  on 18 August 1996 to the shadow Treasurer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So we are talking about fiddling at the edges rather than a fundamental assault?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer from the shadow Treasurer was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think inevitably that is what we are reduced to. I would not demean it by saying it is fiddling at the edges.</PARA>
<PARA>It is $18 billion over four years! You are going to try to ensure that this budget does not balance over the next three years. This is a full-scale assault on an elected government's budget. Yet we had the shadow Treasurer promising explicitly that this is exactly what he would not do, saying before the budget what he wanted was a balance over three years. Again, he was comprehensively rolled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a Leader of the Opposition who, on a personal level, we quite like&mdash;he can share a joke with the Dalai Lama&mdash;but in a political sense he has no authority whatsoever. He is unable to haul the socialist left into line, unable to do anything about Hindmarsh bridge, unable to stand up in relation to the budget assault, unable to enunciate a position on the budget and unable to enunciate a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> coherent policy. This is an opposition which has no pretension and obviously no belief that it will ever return to government and have to face these issues. It is opportunistic, incoherent, divided, demoralised. This is an opposition which is irrelevant and, for very logical reasons, suffering relevance deprivation syndrome.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see some comments by the shadow minister. He was not quite <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> correct in terms of the size of the program announced. He thought it was 76,000 places; in fact, the program that the government has announced was for 74,000. He seems to be of the view that you can make adjustments to other parts of the program and accommodate as many other people who wish to apply to enter Australia on the basis of a relationship with Australians and that it will have no significant problems so far as delivering the government's total program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to understand the size of the preferential family stream. It has grown very considerably. It grew with a 33 per cent increase in the number applying on the basis of a spouse relationship or as a de facto partner or on the basis of fiances. There was a 74 per cent increase in the number of parents who were seeking sponsorship to Australia as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we saw happen last year in relation to these numbers was that the former government had planned a total preferential family program of 42,000 and found, because of the very rapid increase in the number of people applying in the spouse category and in the area of dependent parents, that the numbers grew to 51,000 or 52,000. That increase was very rapid. It was unexpected by the former government. In relation to that matter it made some adjustments during the year. The former government made those announcements on 1 December. On that occasion, when it had to make adjustments it had to make them in relation to other parts of the program. It wanted to deliver the program at the same numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the former government do? It introduced in relation to the independent category a cap, which it was complaining might be introduced in other areas, of 10,000 places. It reduced the numbers of people able to apply within the skilled category by 50 per cent. It effectively degraded the overall level&mdash;the skill level&mdash;of the immigration program.</PARA>

In relation to the preferential family stream, the employment experience is abysmal.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. I refer the minister to the statement made in the House last night by the member for Port Adelaide when he referred to the vulnerability of the South Australian economy. Under Labor, he said, South Australia was always paid special attention. I note the contribution the special attention paid to the State Bank by South Australian Labor made to the vulnerability of our economy. Can the minister inform the House what the results of Labor's special attention have been for those employed in the rail industry in South Australia?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4564" SPEAKER="Sharp, John, MP" NAMEID="AJ4" ELECTORATE="Hume" PARTY="NP" MINISTERIAL="Transport and Regional Development" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Kingston for her question. The question relates to what special attention Australian National Rail workers in South Australia experienced under the very special attention that was afforded to them, according to the rhetoric in the House last night, by the former Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be of interest to members of the House to know that the very special attention afforded by the former Labor government to those rail workers in South Australia saw the number of rail workers in South Australia during the term of the Labor government&mdash;some 13 years&mdash;fall from 10,500 at the beginning of the Labor Party's term to some 2,500 rail workers 13 years later. That is the measure of Labor's special attention for South Australian rail workers. It stands in stark contrast to the rhetoric and false impression given by those people from the Labor Party who engaged in that debate in this House last night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The special attention afforded to AN and its rail workers has left AN in such a mess after 13 years of Labor that it has in excess of $1,000 million of debts and liabilities. It had losses of up to $148 million for the last financial year with no prospect of returning to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4565"> profit in the next few years, indeed no prospect of getting below a loss of $100 million for the next few years. The special attention afforded by Labor to South Australia's rail workers has ensured that any prospect that AN had of being viable was killed off by the way the Labor government established the National Rail Corporation, which strangled AN's opportunities to create jobs in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So that is the way Labor sees giving special attention to South Australia being good. South Australians should have a second thought about that. The South Australians will be looking to the sorts of initiatives this government has announced for South Australia as far as transport is concerned, such as the $48 million extension to Adelaide's airport and the nearly $120 million road project on the Mount Barker Highway&mdash;the largest road project ever undertaken in South Australia, approved by this government within a matter of months after being elected into office.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

As the first step toward implementing the government's national care action plan, an additional $36.2 million will be made available over four years to expand the provision of respite care services and to establish care resource centres across Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates that 74 per cent of assistance needed by the frail elderly and people with a disability living in the community is provided by their relatives and friends on an unpaid basis. Without the assistance of these carers, many of the most dependent and vulnerable people in our community would find it very difficult to remain living at home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is committed to recognising and supporting the work that carers do in our community. The respite initiatives that we will put in place will be to extend the provision of respite care services with a focus on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4566"> care provided at home or in the community, to improve coordination of available forms of respite, to improve access to respite assistance especially in emergencies and to lead to better matching of services and assistance to individual carer needs and circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The carer pension will be changed to provide greater flexibility in caring arrangements and will be achieved by relaxing the following eligibility criteria for pensioners. The number of days for which a carer may temporarily cease caring while remaining eligible for the carers pension will be increased from 42 days to 52 days in a year. This initiative acknowledges that the carer should be entitled to at least one day in every week off as a break. The amount of time carers may spend in employment, voluntary work, education or training while retaining eligibility for the carer pension will be doubled from 10 to 20 hours. This initiative will enable a smoother transition for carers when they are able to return to full&hyphen;time work and will assist them to update and maintain their skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The `carer pension' will be renamed the `carer payment'. This is in recognition of the very valuable contribution made and service given by carers to our community in return for their income support.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This government are&mdash;as we have seen time and time again over the few weeks since this budget&mdash;getting stuck into older people. They are getting stuck into older people who need nursing home beds. Today we have found that they are getting stuck into people who need public housing. There are many older people who need public housing. Just for the information of the Treasurer (Mr Costello), this side of the House will always stand up for public housing tenants. Unlike the government, this side of the House was always going to require the states to maintain their level of public housing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very sorry day for older Australians, because it arises from the way this government is acting towards them. This government&mdash;and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in particular&mdash;has made a constant refrain about its concern for the situation of the vulnerable and the needy, constantly reiterating that, no matter what draconian actions they conceive as being necessary for the nation's affairs, `One group in the community that's not going to be hurt is the most vulnerable.' It might come as news to the Prime Minister or even to the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), but their actions as a government&mdash;and, more importantly, their failure to act as a government&mdash;are causing considerable hurt and concern to large numbers of older Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sometimes of course it is true that a government is faced with making difficult but necessary decisions. When this is the case, it is incumbent on a government to make sure that it does two things. Firstly, it has to clearly explain what it proposes to do and exactly how this will impact on people's lives. This is necessary to avoid the spread of unnecessary or exaggerated speculative alarm. Secondly, it must ensure that the effect of the action is spread as equitably as possible&mdash;that no one group or sector suffers an excessive or unfair amount of pain. It goes without saying <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that this applies to members of the community who could be considered to be needy or vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in this government's ham-fisted, clumsy attempts to bring some measure of reform to aged care, what we see is dramatic evidence of a failure to understand, let alone engage with these basic precepts of good government. Along the way, we see the inflicting of a great deal of unnecessary pain on older Australians and people in the most vulnerable stage of their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government's decision to force older Australians to find an average of $26,000 to enter a nursing home is cruel and uncaring. It demonstrates in the clearest way that this government, despite all its rhetoric about concern for families and the vulnerable, is actually totally indifferent to the plight of older Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at this issue in specifics. Let us go to the source document that the minister herself has used, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of the Structure of Nursing Home Funding Arrangements</EMPHASIS> by Professor Gregory. The Gregory report, which is the report the minister took such delight in using to try to score cheap points against our side of the House three months ago, contains damning indictments against this government's proposals for nursing home care&mdash;most particularly, the proposal to insist on an entry contribution averaging $26,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Gregory considered the option that the government has chosen of using entry contributions to raise money for capital upgrades of nursing home stock. However, he rejected the idea, and I would like to read out his reasons for doing so. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sheer size of entry contributions and the impact on a client's life of having to agree to sell assets to receive care would be a considerable barrier to entry.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Gregory went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the substantial increase in the amount that could be paid by allowing entry contributions seems too harsh a measure.</PARA>
<PARA>The reason Professor Gregory came to this view goes to the heart of the major fault with this government's proposed entry fee system. This must have seemed a very neat solution <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4572"> for the government. They thought, `Hostels charge an entry contribution, so let's just extend it to nursing homes.' Well, such quick&hyphen;fix, policy making on the run options do not work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason this particular decision is such a disaster comes down to a basic failure of understanding of the essential difference between nursing homes and hostels. It does not seem to have occurred to those opposite that nursing homes and hostels are not the same thing. People do not simply make a choice at a certain stage of life between hostels and nursing homes. True, people do usually make a conscious choice about moving into a hostel, but usually it is a choice about lifestyle and accommodation. It is a choice about where they want to live. There is usually no urgency or real pressure, and there may be other options to consider&mdash;such as, increased services from home and community care or staying with a son or daughter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But nursing homes are different. People do not choose to go to a nursing home. People go into a nursing home because they need care, because they are unable to look after themselves, because they are vulnerable and, most of all, because they need to. Professor Gregory cites this fact as a fundamental reason for rejecting entry contributions. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The circumstances under which clients seek access to nursing homes are considerably different from hostel clients.</PARA>
<PARA>The following is a most telling statistic from his report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Approximately 60% of nursing home admissions are from hospitals. This is one indicator of the fact that nursing home entry is often urgent, motivated overwhelmingly by the need for nursing care.</PARA>
<PARA>In this view, Professor Gregory is supported more recently by Anna Howe, an associate professor in health sciences at La Trobe University. Recently, in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> , she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision to move to a nursing home is, sadly, about where the last few weeks or months of life will be spent. For two out of three, this move comes after an acute hospital stay. As well as severe physical disabilities, three out of four nursing home residents have a degree of mental impairment. With assessment by a multi&hyphen;disciplin <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ary Aged Care Assessment Team a prerequisite to admission, all other options have been exhausted.</PARA>
<PARA>She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those who move to a nursing home directly from the community have mostly been supported by family carers, usually living in the same house. The ingoing charge&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that this government wants to impose&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would fall as a very uneven penalty on those carers whose relatives need long-term care while others with different health problems can receive far more costly acute hospital care free of charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is these differences which mean that the system of charges applying to hostels cannot be simply extended to nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>But there may be an element of choice. Let us have a think about what the element of choice is that this government is seeking to impose on families. It will be the stark choice of deciding how much they are prepared to sacrifice for the level of care to be provided for their family member needing nursing home care. The minister says that no-one will have to sell their home to gain entry to a nursing home. She has even gone so far as to threaten to withdraw accreditation from any nursing home that forces the sale of a home to pay the $26,000. These are fighting words indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be interesting to see how the minister follows up on the report on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> last week of the lady in Ballarat who, desperate and with a husband needing admission to a nursing home and a totally dependent 40-year-old handicapped son, when she approached the local nursing home that had agreed to take her husband, says that they demanded that she sign her house over to the nursing home in order to secure her husband's entry. Some choice!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real choices are these. She could find another nursing home. As we know, that is very difficult indeed. She could keep her husband at home and try to cope with his increasing needs as well as coping with her handicapped son or sell her house and try to find alternative accommodation for her son and herself. These are the kinds of choices that the minister's ill&hyphen;advised and poorly thought out reforms are giving to older Australians and their families.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4573">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area of real concern in regard to the way people gain access to nursing homes has to do with the fact that the $26,000 is only an average figure. The policy is based on that of hostels. But that average means that a lot of people are going to pay a lot more. An elderly person in my own electorate said to me just last week that she had to pay $96,000 to secure a place in hostels. That is what they will be paying for nursing homes&mdash;$96,000 tops. How can any minister say that someone who needs nursing home care should be faced with that sort of choice?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Professors Gregory and Howe have shown, people entering nursing homes are, sadly, at the end of their lives, the majority entering from acute hospitals and, more often than not, with a considerable degree of mental impairment. These people are not in any position to negotiate. So who will the job fall to? It will fall to family members, usually daughters, who are likely to be experiencing very strong emotions at the serious illnesses of their loved ones. In these circumstances many people are going to feel under extreme pressure to find the best level of care they can for their loved one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While selling the family home may not be a legal necessity to gain a nursing home bed, it may well be a choice families feel they have to make. A factor influencing this choice will be the quality of nursing homes. To downplay these factors, to say that people are going to have to sell their homes to raise $26,000, is an outrageous and callous decision on the part of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will the situation be for people who have no families to fall back on? Who will do the negotiating? This government, as we are seeing so early in its time, is in love with the concept of the market, but I for one did not think that we would be seeing the concept of the market extended to nursing homes. The government's agenda is to run the public sector down to nothing and have the private sector take over. To have this market orientation, this negotiation over an entry contribution, facing somebody who has just had a stroke, who is completely mentally impaired, is a nonsensical idea.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no market for nursing homes. Surely the minister knows, even given the short time she has been in this portfolio, that this sector is highly regulated. We have a limited number of places available. It is restricted region by region in Australia. You cannot get into a nursing home without passing an assessment test. This is not market forces. This is not level playing fields. What we are talking about here is need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go back to Professor Gregory. The effectiveness of market forces is severely limited because the demand for nursing home beds exceeds the supply in almost all areas. Approximately 60 per cent of admissions are from hospitals. Almost 60 per cent of nursing home residents suffer some degree of cognitive or behavioural deficit and many have no relatives willing to look after their interests. Most potential residents and their relatives have little knowledge of what is appropriate nursing home care and many do not have the time to adequately assess a number of facilities prior to admission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Professor Gregory has written in bold type in his report is that `market forces cannot play a significant role in ensuring quality of care'. That is the advice from Professor Gregory. It is high time that we took a bit of notice of his advice. We will by this measure be exposing care funding to the profit motive and risking the quality of care. It is time that this government got rid of this callous proposal. It is also time that the minister came clean and told this House that she knows that the average is $26,000. She knows that her department has advised me, has advised her adviser, has advised her, that the average is $26,000.</PARA>

They have given absolutely no leadership in the area of aged care. Their policy in relation to innovation in aged care and community care had just eight paragraphs. This is an industry that is in crisis, this is an industry that has been in decline for 10 years and the best they can do in the policy which they went to the last election with is eight paragraphs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Bob Gregory identified in his report that our residential aged care sector was in serious decline, that there was a capital crisis in nursing homes and that too many of these homes would not pass basic fire and safety standards. The Australian people need to understand that the Labor government sat on its hands. It did nothing. It had no blueprint. It allocated eight paragraphs in its policy paper to a very serious and a very important matter for the most vulnerable and the most frail in our community. It is hypocritical in the extreme for the shadow minister to enter this parliament and wring her hands at the fact that this government has accepted the responsibility for fixing the mess that Labor created and Labor left.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's residential aged care structural reform package is built on the unification of the nursing home and hostel systems. The government's vision for residential care is based on: high quality care for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> everyone, regardless of income or location; a national aged care standards agency with providers and consumers working together to own the system of accreditation with government, to ensure quality care and to take strong action against poor performance; a focus on and incentive for excellence; more choice and flexibility for older people; government funding which matches care needs, no matter where in the system people are accommodated; and a system that encourages ageing in place and removes the need for residents to transfer between hostels and nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our vision and our blueprint for residential aged care is based on appropriate funding for dementia care; flexibility to allow providers to continue caring for people as their needs change; providers who have time to care instead of trying to cope with red tape and paperwork; a system which is affordable but which asks for a fair and reasonable contribution from those residents who have the means and can afford to make a small contribution themselves; and access to care based on need, not the ability to pay, with strong safeguards for financially disadvantaged people. The government's package will ensure a high quality of care and sustainability in the system for coming decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is committed to ensuring that our aged care system can meet the needs of an ageing population. The system that we inherited from Labor was simply not sustainable. There has been a lot of speculation about the government's budget measures and speculation and scaremongering about income testing, about entry contributions and about hostel viability, to name a few. Sadly, this has only served to unnecessarily scare older Australians. The government's reform package has focused public attention on our nursing home sector, and rightly so. What this government is putting in place will ensure a sustainable future for aged care in this country. However, in doing so we have also exposed Labor's lack of action and lack of commitment in this area and their absolute disregard for the welfare of the frail and elderly in our community. The best that Labor can offer is a scaremongering campaign. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4575"> best they could offer in their policy document was eight paragraphs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me correct some of the misunderstandings about the entry contribution system. This government has taken the decision to extend entry contributions to nursing homes to address the capital crisis that exists now and to stimulate investment in quality accommodation and care for older Australians. In unifying the nursing home and hostel systems we have looked closely at what works and what does not work. In the hostel system we looked at entry contribution fees, and it has worked. It has provided a very high standard of accommodation. The differences between those entering nursing homes and hostels today has narrowed significantly. My department tells me that nearly 50 per cent of those people currently in hostels could possibly be eligible for entry into a nursing home. The profiles have changed and there is little differentiation today between the two.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The entry contribution fee was originally introduced by the previous Labor government in 1988. It was supported by us and it has been operating successfully for many years. It is essentially the same hostel system we are extending to the nursing home sector. For residents entering a nursing home after 1 July 1997, let me reiterate the government's budget initiative in respect of entry contributions: entry contributions are not compulsory; the amount of the entry contribution is not fixed by government; people will not be forced to sell their homes to get a bed in a nursing home; financially disadvantaged people cannot be charged an entry contribution fee; and people will not have to pay the contribution before they get a bed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), if the example she used is in fact correct, it is correct under a system that they introduced and they ran. If the member for Jagajaga would like to give me the details of that particular case, I will have my department follow it up.</PARA>

It has got nothing to do with whether they have got the money; it has got everything to do with what standard of care they need. In addition, there are safeguards in the current system. There is an advocacy service that can deal with those kinds of complaints.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only people who stay longer than six months will have to pay an entry contribution. My department estimates that only 45 per cent of those who are in nursing homes for more than six months will pay an entry contribution fee. Residents or their estates will get much of the contribution refunded. Regardless of what that contribution is, the provider is only able to draw down a maximum of $2,600 per annum for five years&mdash;a total contribution of $13,000.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;She says that everyone will have to pay it. That is incorrect to start with. It comes from a 1993 inter&hyphen;hostel financial comparison survey which was done while the opposition was in government. It represents the average entry contribution paid in those hostels that charged entry contributions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the average in the 1993 inter&hyphen;hostel financial comparison survey. That survey was available during your term of government. The $130 million will be raised, as I have said a number of times in this House, on the basis that 45 per cent of those eligible residents, that is, those who are in a nursing home for over six months, will pay $2,600 maximum per year, which will be a maximum of $13,000 over a five&hyphen;year period. Providers cannot charge a contribution which would leave the resident with assets of less than 2&half; times the annual pension. Nobody will be forced to sell their home to gain entry into a nursing home. Entry contributions will provide both the means and the incentives for providers to dramatically improve the quality of aged care and the infrastructure.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4576">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Access to care for financially disadvantaged people will also be protected. The government will pay a higher subsidy for people who cannot afford an entry contribution to act as an incentive for providers. This will ensure that quality aged care is available for all Australians. There will be no two&hyphen;tiered system under the government's policy. Pensioner couples whose only asset is their home will not have to sell it when one of them enters a nursing home. While people should be allowed to exercise some choice over their accommodation and services, as they do in every other facet of their lives, we will ensure access and quality of care for all. There will be a strong and effective protection in place for residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor failed to understand and address the shift in balance of care which has occurred in the past decade or two. Hostels are not the same as they were even 10 years ago. Hostels today are caring for more dependent people, particularly those who are suffering from severe forms of dementia, and the levels of government subsidy for those residents is inadequate to meet the needs of this growing area today. Yet under Labor's system you do not always get the appropriate level of funding to care for these people, nor do you get the funding you need to care for those with severe dementia. This is a very severe gap.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A person in a nursing home can be funded more than a person with the same or even higher dependency levels in a hostel. This is hardly an equitable system. In developing the single resident classification and funding scale we will achieve a better match between funding and care needs. This will alleviate the pressure for those hostels which are currently caring for people with severe dementia or a high physical frailty without adequate funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The structural reform package is good policy. It is putting the provision of quality aged care first. It is also a coherent package with each element meshing together to achieve a broader objective. It is not something that can be approached on a piecemeal basis. The government has had to take some tough decisions in difficult circumstances. These are decisions that Labor could not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> make. We are not going to sit on our hands like Labor did and watch nursing home building quality deteriorate further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's package offers the opportunity to keep Australia at the forefront of the world's aged care systems and to ensure quality of care and quality of life for older Australians for decades to come. The frail aged in our communities deserve much better attention than that provided by the previous Labor government, who have stood there and criticised our policy and yet came up with absolutely no solutions of their own. This is a system which has been going into decline for over a decade. Our nursing home system is falling down. Yet these people sat on their hands and did absolutely nothing about it. The frail aged in our community deserve much better. Labor's last budget allocated $12.9 million for capital funding&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am absolutely amazed that the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) did not take the opportunity to explain to this House why aged Australians and veterans are going to suffer a $26,000 slug to get into a nursing home. This is an issue of great social concern to the people of Australia and to older Australians. I observe that there are only eight or nine government members and only one minister in the House. They have really left the minister hanging out to dry. Her political carcass is out there swinging in the wind and they will not even come into the House to defend her.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I pose one question to the minister. I notice that she is over on the sidelines there. There has been a handpass to a minister in the worst position. She has been given the worst policy decision to carry on the floor of this House. I can understand her moving off the floor to talk to the advisers but, as the debate on the first Howard budget proceeds in this parliament, the opposition's initial assessment that it is indeed a budget of betrayal has been confirmed time and time again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the opposition has probed the fine detail of the budget, especially the detail in relation to the $26,000 slug on older Australians, several things have become apparent. Firstly, the extent to which key constituencies have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been dudded by the government has been somewhat understated in our initial assessment. Secondly, it has been become painfully obvious that many government ministers have not been across the detail of their portfolio and have not the slightest clue as to the extent of the damage they are doing to key constituencies such as older people in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One by one substantial promises made to various groups in our society have been cynically broken in this budget. Key promises to youth have been broken. Key promises to the unemployed have been broken. Key commitments to people living in rural and regional communities have been broken. Key promises to indigenous Australians have been broken. But nothing compares with the deep sense of betrayal felt by the aged and sick Australians and our veterans' community after this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), has already pointed out, the confidence of older Australians has been shattered by the decision of the government to force those in need of nursing home care to pay an up-front fee of up to $26,000 to enter a nursing home. It is this measure which will penalise many veterans, war widows and TPI pensioners throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) made a very explicit promise in the election campaign. It was very clear. It was unequivocal. It was simply this: one group in the community that is not going to be hurt is the most vulnerable. We on this side of the House know that any promise that the Prime Minister makes is not worth a tinker's cuss. We know that he cannot lie straight in bed when he makes a promise to the Australian people, but older Australians, veterans and TPI pensioners are more trusting. They actually believe a Prime Minister when he says that he will protect them, but what they got from the Prime Minister was a betrayal. What they got was a $26,000 slug to enter a nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only the $26,000 nursing home fee for some veterans and TPI pensioners that has really affected them. The government has also jacked up the cost of their prescription <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4578"> pharmaceuticals by 20 per cent. They have introduced an additional income tested charge of 25c in the dollar above the pension free area. They have abolished the dental health program which has been used by many veterans. The government, through cuts of $88 million to HACC funding, has ensured that veterans and war widows will pay more for these services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to contrast Labor's term of office with barely the six months that the coalition has been in office. During our time in office we maintained and improved the pensions and the entitlements of our veteran communities over time. Labor also set in place a $50 million package of measures in the aged care area for veterans. In my own electorate, in the term of the last parliament the Bellarine hostel for the aged would not have got up as a proposal, would not have been built, without the $220,000 contribution from the Department of Veterans' Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I pay tribute to the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Con Sciacca. He is acknowledged by the veterans community as the best there has ever been. I do not mean any offence to any former veterans' affairs ministers on this side of the House or the other. However, the current Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), may have very big shoes to fill, but if this budget is any indication he has already failed the test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government have made great play of the fact that they have maintained pensions and entitlements in this budget. That is the very least they could have expected to do for our ageing veteran community, and they have provided some smaller additional funding in certain areas which the opposition fully supports. But it is in the other portfolio areas that some very real damage has been done to Australia's veteran community. It is the failure of the veterans' affairs minister to stand up for veterans while other ministers, including the Minister for Family Services, hatched their plots to hit the veterans of this nation with extra imposts and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where was the Minister for Veterans' Affairs when the Minister for Family Services hatched her policy to slug veterans with a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $26,000 fee to enter a nursing home after 1 July 1997? Where was he when the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) increased by 50c the pharmaceutical costs for each prescription? Where was the Minister for Veterans' Affairs when the government decided to reduce its contribution to the home and community care program by $88 million&mdash;a decision that ultimately will pump up the cost of this service to veterans?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where was the minister when the government made the decision to subject veterans and war widows to an additional charge of 25c in the dollar above the pension free area? For some older Australians, that could mean an impost of up to $238 per week. The simple fact is that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs went missing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we asked about this matter in the House yesterday, I really did feel sorry for the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. We asked a question on nursing home fees of the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer). Of course, in typical fashion before this House, the Acting Prime Minister handballed this question to a minister in a worse position than himself&mdash;a real hospital handpass. What did the Minister for Veterans' Affairs say? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are currently, through my department, talking to the Minister for Family Services on this issue of how it will affect our veteran community.</PARA>
<PARA>He didn't even know, when this proposal was put in the budget, the damage it was going to do to the veteran community. He is still going to talk, talk, talk to the Minister for Family Services about what it is going to do. She doesn't know what is going on. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs does not know what is going on. We can't get a decent answer to questions we ask on this matter in this House. We just had it here in this debate today.

That eminent Australian economist and other reports found that this stock was at an all-time low.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were also major problems with the Australian design standards, fire standards, health standards and outcome standards in nursing homes. That eminent economist found that there was $36 million needed to meet fire standards, $42 million needed to meet health standards and $540 million needed to meet Australian design standards. Did Labor take any notice of that? No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Gregory also found that there was $520 million needed to meet outcome standards. Eighteen per cent of all residents in nursing homes were living in rooms with five or more beds. There was a critical situation where residents with walking frames could not even be fitted through doors into toilets and bathrooms. That is the standard things were at under Labor. In the past, more government funding has been provided per day to keep people in prison than has been provided to care for our elderly and frail Australians who did so much in many cases for this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Gregory, the eminent Australian economist, found that there was a lack of incentive to maintain good quality nursing home stock and that the reason for the lack of incentive was the funding system. The standard of the nursing homes had never been part of that funding arrangement. One report found that 75 per cent of nursing homes would have to be rebuilt to meet standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The policy of entry fees to nursing homes is based on Labor's policy of entry fees to hostels. The $26,000 figure that is being waved about the place is worked out on the average paid by 40 per cent of hostel residents who actually pay anything to enter a hostel. No real figure has been arrived at and there is a simply nasty scare beat-up campaign under way from those people who could not solve any of the problems I have alluded to&mdash;not one of them. They are now attempting to terrify people, but nobody will believe them any more. We all saw what happened on 2 March this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4580"> The hostel model Labor introduced has proved popular for many. A significant number of residents in hostels choose to pay because it provides them with choice&mdash;choice of standards and choice of the type of accom modation they can go into. If the standard of accommodation is raised in nursing homes as it has been for hostels, then every person who will find themselves a resident of those nursing homes will benefit, not just those who have been more fortunate in life than others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has very clearly said that the financially disadvantaged will not have to pay, but that has not been mentioned in arguments from the other side today. They choose to ignore it and choose to say what they hope will sink in and frighten.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) has said that pensioner couples will not have to sell their home should one be required to enter a nursing home. There is a message for younger people in the policy direction that we are taking. They must think about the aged care that they might require one day; they cannot just blow everything as they go through life and expect taxpayers to pay for their care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1987 nursing home fees have been the same for everyone&mdash;that is, 87.5 per cent of the pension. This is the same for someone who might just happen to be on a Kerry Packer type of income as it is for a full pensioner who has always lived throughout their life in public housing and had no capacity to save for their future care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said before in this place, I have never had any confidence that Labor planned in any way for the future. It is not always easy to predict the future, but an ageing population is something that was always there to be seen for all. ABS figures predicted that the over&hyphen;65-year-old population will rise to four million in this country by the year 2001. This has huge long&hyphen;term implications for public policy and requires responsible government action. At some stage five per cent of all of us will end up in a nursing home.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The legislative changes made by the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Amendment Bill 1996 will make it easier for the organisers of the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games and licensed users to take action against those persons who are engaged in ambush marketing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ambush marketing is the unauthorised association of businesses with the marketing of an event such as the Sydney Olympics. Typically, the ambush marketeer seeks to gain some benefit by suggesting an association with an event without paying for the marketing right or licensing fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Olympic and Paralympic Games in the year 2000 are events of great national significance for Australia. These events provide unique opportunities to demonstrate to the world this country's skills, talents, environment and achievements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the critical factors in making the games an outstanding success is the ability of the organisers, the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, known as SOCOG, and the Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee, known as SPOC, to raise the funds necessary to host the games. It is a massive task. It is also very expensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of staging the games is estimated to be over $2 billion. It will be shared between the organising committees, the government of New South Wales and, to a minor extent, the Commonwealth Government through its commitment to share half the expected deficit on the Paralympics, up to a maximum of $25 million. The Commonwealth government's overall budgetary contribution to the staging of the games will exceed $400 million. It is expected that the revenue raised from official sponsorships and licensing fees would need to be of the order of $700 million to meet the SOCOG and SPOC budget for the games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ability of SOCOG and SPOC to attract sponsors depends to a large extent on the exclusivity of the licensed indicia and images. If adequate steps are not taken against ambush marketing, the official sponsorship revenue could be significantly eroded. Ambush marketing was a problem in Atlanta, and we want to avoid the problem here. For example, two major international organisations which did not have licensing agreements with the Atlanta Olympic organisers both attracted large numbers of people to their respective sports pavilion and interactive theatre while implying an association with the Atlanta Games. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4582">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 28 June 1996, this government brought in the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Act 1996, which was<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> </EMPHASIS>designed to protect the Sydney Olympic and Paralympic Games against ambush marketing. Although the government was aware at the time that the legislation could possibly require some amendment, the need to have the legislation in place before the Atlanta Games commenced made the immediate introduction and passage of the legislation a necessity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having the legislation in place enabled SOCOG and SPOC to take advantage of the major marketing opportunity afforded by the Atlanta Games. The government also believed that amending the legislation at a later date rather than during the passage of the principal bill would also ensure that there was adequate time for consultation with games organisers and other interest groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act presently provides protection for the Olympic and Paralympic Games against ambush marketing through the regulation of the use for commercial purposes of the indicia and images associated with the games. However, for trade in domestically produced goods, the act as it stands enables action only to be taken against the person who applied the indicia and images to the goods or services. This may make it difficult for effective action to be taken against some who may engage in ambush marketing activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments contained in this bill will enable games organisers and licensed users to take action against retailers, distributors or other parties in the supply chain rather than having to pursue through the supply chain the unauthorised person who applied the indicia or images to the goods or services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, the amendments will enable SOCOG, SPOC and licensed users to take action against those who aid, abet, counsel and procure breaches of the legislation. In other words, it will be possible to take action against persons whose involvement in the contravention of the legislation is in the nature of assisting in the unauthorised application of indicia and images rather than in their direct application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures greatly improve the operation of the legislation and help ensure the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> preservation of the games marketing revenues. As well as protecting the revenue of the games against ambush marketing, they help ensure that the interests of legitimate retailers are protected from less scrupulous competition. Retailers, distributors and other parties will need to check to ensure that the person who applied the indicia or images to the goods or services is licensed. To do this, they need to check the register of licensed users located at SOCOG's office in Sydney or the state offices of the Australian Industrial Property Organisation to ensure that the person is entered on the register.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In preparing the bill, the government consulted extensively with the games organisers and other interest groups, in particular, retailers. To make it easier for retailers and others to ensure that the goods they receive have the indicia or images applied to them by a licensed user, SOCOG proposes to provide easy access to the register of licensed users of the indicia and images, to disseminate widely information on the legislation and on who the licensed users are, and to provide a sophisticated identification system for genuine products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the public awareness campaign, SOCOG will be advertising in various media, and licensees will be required to advertise in trade catalogues and similar outlets. Retail and other industry associations have agreed to cooperate with SOCOG in the dissemination of information so that the public is aware and understands the legislation as it relates to the licensing of users of the protected indicia and images.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that with these amendments the legislation represents a balanced and workable approach that will protect the Olympic and Paralympic Games against ambush marketing without placing an undue burden on business. In saying this, I am confident that industry, SOCOG and SPOC will work together in a cooperative manner which will add greatly to the effectiveness of the legislation and help ensure a good budget outcome is achieved for the Sydney 2000 Games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These provisions, together with those in the principal act, will cease to operate after 31 December 2000, following the completion <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4583"> of the games. There will be no additional cost to the government of administering this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, the sponsorship program for the games has already begun with Telstra and IBM contributing $100 million as part of the corporate sponsorship effort. We must protect the sponsorship revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government believes the additional protection provided by this bill will enhance and complement the protective measures already in place under the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Act 1996 and the current intellectual property laws, and that it will help in making the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games a sound financial success for Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The veterans' affairs 1996 budget package honours key pre&hyphen;election promises to the veteran community. It provides for simpler and more flexible entitlements. It is fair, with better access to services and more assistance to help veterans help themselves. The government's commitment recognises Australia's debt of gratitude to our veteran community, who served us so selflessly in times of conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major initiatives cover the areas of health care, housing, rehabilitation, compensation and commemoration. In particular, a number of anomalies will be removed from the system, resulting in more efficient administration and simplified service delivery. Before discussing the bill in detail, I would like to foreshadow a key initiative now under <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4584"> development in my portfolio to improve the delivery of services to veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One group of veterans and war widows we have found to be disadvantaged, simply because of where they live, are those in rural areas. They are remote from the services that many in the city take for granted. Ready access to information and services is vital for all veterans, but especially important to those in country areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to this particular need, I will announce in October a health policy for the veteran community in rural and remote areas. It comprises some innovative, cost&hyphen;effective ways to make more information, health and community services available in rural and remote areas. The policy will ensure continuing improvement in the provision of health care and support to the veteran community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of other health initiatives, which do not require legislative action, will also be implemented as soon as practicable. For example, veterans will now have a greater choice than ever before in the range of spectacle frames available to them. Multifocal lenses will also be available to those who prefer them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Veterans who require special footwear will find it more convenient to obtain their shoes and the necessary repairs. Veterans living in remote areas who need medical grade footwear can be issued with three pairs at one time. This will mean that they will no longer have to regularly travel long distances to get the shoes they need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Eligible veterans will now also be able to use any footwear repairer contracted by the Department of Veterans' Affairs for repairs to their medical grade footwear. This means veterans will have greater access to repair services in locations convenient for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Funding will be made available to provide Australian merchant mariners with access to an asbestos screening program. This is designed to assist in the detection of illness related to asbestos exposure. Our World War II Australian mariners have not been eligible for an existing asbestos exposure screening program which is available to current and past members of the armed services and its civilian <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> employees. This measure will ensure that all eligible veterans have equal access to the same services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The list of eligible drugs contained in the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme will be reviewed. This will ensure the best results from the pharmaceutical treatment provided to veterans and war widows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A major review of the medication program for high risk veterans will also take place. The aim of this review is to reduce inappropriate prescription and medication use and improve their quality of life and health options.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the measures contained in the bill. The coalition is committed to the fair and equitable treatment of veterans and will continue to ensure that inconsistencies and anomalies in the Veterans' Entitlements Act are removed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current asset value of allocated pension investments will be taken into account for the purposes of the assets test. This is how they have been treated under social security legislation for some time. It is unfair that some people could gain increased income support by entering into particular investment arrangements. As announced in the budget, these changes will apply to any allocated pension investment entered into after 20 August 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the other income support changes in this bill reflect similar changes being made by Social Security. The deeming rules will be changed to make them less complex. For money held as cash or on deposit, a deemed interest rate, currently five per cent, will be applied to the first $2,000 for single pensioners and $4,000 for couples. This change will simplify pensioner notification requirements because individuals will no longer need to advise about small interest fluctuations. This has been perceived as intrusive. For some pensioners the change will provide an opportunity to increase their overall income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will adjust the way lump sum compensation payments are treated. The calculation for the preclusion period for a pension payable to a person who has not reached pension age is to be changed. The compensation payment will be divided by the maximum <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4585"> amount of income that a pensioner can earn before the pension ceases to be payable. This will determine how long it will be before pension payments can be made.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The partner of a person in receipt of lump sum compensation payments will no longer have a preclusion period applied to their pension payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased that the Victoria Cross allowance is to be increased. A rate of $2,700 will now be paid to our three surviving recipients each year. It is to be backdated to 17 August 1995 which was the date from which the British Government increased the Victoria Cross allowance it pays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another anomaly we will correct relates to funeral benefits. A payment will be able to be made for costs associated with the transportation of the remains of a veteran who dies in financial need away from home when obtaining approved medical treatment. This assistance is available for certain other veterans who have died away from home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill makes several positive reforms that correct a number of anomalies in the Defence Services Homes Act 1918. Veterans who have previously been assisted through the Defence Service Homes Scheme because of their own service and who are widowers of World War II ex&hyphen;servicewomen are currently not entitled to a second loan based on their status as widowers. On the other hand, World War II widows who are also ex&hyphen;servicewomen can receive this assistance. This anomaly will be removed and these men will now be entitled to a second loan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rate of interest for additional advances under the Defence Service Homes Scheme will be reduced. This will allow new borrowers to use their full entitlements over time for purposes such as home repairs or modifications, without having to pay what is effectively a penalty interest rate. This measure will assist eligible persons to maintain their homes and remain in them for as long as they wish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Eligibility for loans under the Defence Services Homes Act is to be extended to those who first enlisted in the Defence Force before 15 May 1985 and have not served more than six years but had operational service in Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia or Somalia. To date, this group of veterans <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has been denied assistance, even though their colleagues who enlisted later and served in the same areas have been able to obtain loans under the defence home owner scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will make several other changes that will simplify administration of veterans' benefits and improve the service provided to veterans. A minimum variation rate, initially set at $1.00, will apply to income support payments. This means that variations in a pensioner's income and level of assets will not affect his or her rate of pension unless consequential changes in the rate of pension are at least $1.00 in either direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be no need for pensioners to advise the department about small changes in their income levels. This will eliminate unnecessary administration and also reduce the level of intrusion into veterans' lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Modifications will be made to the pension advance scheme which will also improve administrative efficiency. Applicants will now be able to receive one advance per year but will no longer be required to provide information about how the advance is to be used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Changes have also been made to correct an anomaly in the advance payment scheme. War widows and widowers who receive service pension or income support supplement at a `frozen' or `ceiling' rate will now be able to obtain the $500 maximum allowable pension advance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government recognises the crucial role that veterans' advocates play in the repatriation claims system. Funding will be provided to ex&hyphen;service organisations so that they can employ more staff. This will be additional to training programs already provided to ex&hyphen;service organisations on veteran entitlements and services. By helping to handle applications for review of pension claims to the Veterans' Review Board, these advocates will improve the efficiency of the repatriation claims process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4586"> There are many other items in the Veterans' Affairs Budget package that I have not mentioned. Another bill is expected to be introduced later this year. At that time I will provide honourable members with further details. In the meantime, the initiatives out lined above clearly demonstrate the strong and unequivocal commitment of this government to veterans and their families. These Australians sacrificed so much for their country and contributed enormously to the freedom and way of life we all enjoy today.

He can quote dollar terms, but I would suggest that there is a real decline in those grants, particularly when one looks at the cost increases that public hospitals are facing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But of greater importance to the House should be the fact that there is a very specific and a very clear $312 million cut in grants to the states for public hospitals.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A cut is a cut. It might relate to cost shifting in the past, but it is a cut that has its harshest impact for the future. It is also allied to the fact that in the provisions now before the House, the general assistance grants to the states, there was a reduction in the global funding at the Premiers Conference of $619 million in the current financial year, $640 million in 1997&hyphen;98 and $300 million in 1998-99. That is a reduction in state revenue capacity of $1.6 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that the states allocate between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of their budgets to hospitals, you do not need to be Einstein or even the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) to work out that there is a reduction in the funding for state hospitals of the order of $450 million. If they spread the cuts equally across their state budgets, the $1.6 billion cut translates into a hospital funding cut of $450 million. So there is explicitly $312 million and implicitly in the legislation now before the House $450 million&mdash;a cut of nearly $800 million&mdash;less in public hospital funding as a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4587"> product of the first budget of the Howard-Fischer government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was making the point before question time that this is no answer to a suggested problem in the public hospital system in Australia. What sort of answer is it to take out $800 million of public hospital funding and then hand over $500 million per annum to the private health insurance funds?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also mentioned before question time that, in relation to private insurance in Australia, there is no crisis. I mentioned I would say it until I was blue in the face and until it sank in on the other side. There is no crisis in the private health insurance sector in Australia. Let me just quote some of the figures. For all the 79 private funds their operating profit for 1995 was $142 million and for 1996 it is $61 million. For both years&mdash;this year and last&mdash;their total assets were of the order of $2.5 billion and their reserves were of the order of $1.3 billion.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a far more sensible and fair arrangement for the Government's expenditure of $1.7 billion would be the direct subsidisation of the use of private hospital services.

From anyone's perspective a much more rational and desirable outcome.</PARA>
<PARA>I say `hear, hear' to that. If this government will not support public hospitals for ideological reasons, at the very least it should directly subsidise private hospitals and use.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that does not convince the members opposite, let me try a simple comparison, because there is a certain mystique about the health sector, and maybe government members cannot get their minds around how one part of it is linked to another.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, if people had been buying rail tickets but had not been catching trains&mdash;that is the equivalent in health: they had been taking out insurance but not using services&mdash;would the government then introduce a tax rebate for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4589"> people to go and buy rail tickets and still not utilise the service, or would it put spare public money into public services, build new rail lines and put more rolling stock out?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These things get even worse. In relation to the amendment I have moved, I want to make reference to an issue in my own electorate. The government promised that it would increase funds for public hospitals. We are getting an $800 million cut over the next four years. That is a very clear broken promise.

So in the south-west of Sydney, there were not only two broken promises in capital funding for a new Narellan hospital and for a major upgrade of the Campbelltown hospital but there was the global broken promise of $800 million being taken out of the health system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of these things have a very big impact on the south-west of Sydney and the greater western Sydney region. It makes even more important the task of locational redistribution within the New South Wales health budget. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> There has been a recent controversy in New South Wales relating to the Carr government. Because of the federal broken promise and the removal of $800 million from the health budget, it makes it more important and even more critical for the Carr government in New South Wales to engage in the principle of hospital funding redistribution. When the Tories in this place are taking away public hospital funding, it is left to Labor. It is left to Labor in New South Wales to give the west and south-west of Sydney their fair share of hospital funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that most of Sydney's public hospitals are located where the people used to live, not where they live now and the suburbs to which they are continuing to move. I give an example. The federal electorate of Sydney has within its boundaries seven public hospitals. In my seat of Werriwa, which is in the south-west of Sydney, there are none. There are 130,000 people in the Werriwa electorate, and there is not a public hospital within its boundaries. The electorate of Chifley has one public hospital; Fowler, one; Greenway, one; Prospect, one. They are large federal electorates in the growth suburbs of the west and south-west of Sydney. Between those five electorates, there are four public hospitals. In the federal electorate of Sydney, there are seven.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those sorts of inequities cannot go on. There is a substantial shortfall in the funding share for the south-west of Sydney, western Sydney, the Central Coast, the Hunter region and Illawarra. The truth is that these regions, in terms of their population growth and hospital funding share, need to run faster just to stand still.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no magic pudding in the health budget. This is a straightforward question of redistribution, a question made even more acute by the federal government's public hospital cuts. As the people move to the growth regions, funding needs to be redistributed to their areas for their services and essential health facilities. This funding can come only from areas which are losing their population share and, hence, enjoy a relative surplus of funding and facilities.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4590">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Successive state health ministers&mdash;Collins, Hannaford, Phillips and last week Andrew Refshauge&mdash;have said that they would increase funding for western and south&hyphen;western Sydney but not at the expense of other regions. At a time of low growth in government revenue, this may mean a decline in resources per head of population, given the growth of new housing estates in the suburbs in Sydney's greater west.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fiscal austerity is more likely to disadvantage growing areas than overserviced parts of Sydney, such as the northern and eastern suburbs. Entrenched interests will fight hard to preserve existing benefits, compared with suburbs which have gone without and are struggling to secure new services. Only the redistribution of public resources can ensure that the rate of population growth is matched by a growth in government health services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the demographic centre of Sydney has moved further west, state governments have been reluctant to follow the politics of redistribution. It is much easier for politicians to fund new services from growth in government revenue than to relocate resources to areas of greatest need. The economics of the 1980s, however, killed off this soft option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Health services are an outstanding example of the strength of vested interests in New South Wales politics. The state's politicians have failed to embrace the politics of redistribution. Fear of publicly confronting the medical professions has overwhelmed the interests of equity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me provide some of the comparisons which underscore this argument. There are seven teaching hospitals east of Parramatta, compared with two in western Sydney. The south-east and central districts spend twice as much per person on health than the Wentworth and south-west Sydney districts. Let me just give the figures: health expenditure in south&hyphen;east Sydney per head of population is $750; the central region, $948; the Wentworth region, $386; and south-west Sydney, $396.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The centre of Sydney and the southern and eastern suburbs have nearly double the number of hospital beds per thousand population than greater western Sydney. Again, I will provide the figures: in south&hyphen;east Sydney, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there are 3.59 hospital beds per thousand population; central Sydney, 3.96; Wentworth, 1.78; and south-west Sydney, 2.07.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every year close to 80,000 patients leave Sydney's greater west to receive basic care, often travelling for more than three hours to do so. The number of patients will grow because of the Howard government's public hospital funding cuts. That trip is often three hours in duration, which exceeds the World Health Organisation benchmark. If inner city hospitals or those on the lower North Shore are busy, it is because they are treating tens of thousands of people who are forced to travel from other parts of Sydney due to the lack of local services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give the figures for the number of patients who travelled outside their local health area for treatment in 1994&hyphen;95. In the Wentworth region, this accounted for 36 per cent of the patients&mdash;that is, more than a third of people travelled outside their own region to gain treatment. In south-west Sydney, the figure was 29 per cent, and for the Central Coast it was 20 per cent. What was it for the south&hyphen;eastern part of Sydney? Just 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give the House the figures for the availability of linear accelerators for cancer by radiotherapy. Greater western Sydney has half of Sydney's population but only six of these linear accelerators. The rest of Sydney, with the other half of the population, has 15 of them. This is a gross imbalance of service availability for the essential treatment of cancer by radiotherapy&mdash;and I know something about this. That is an imbalance that needs to be corrected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are twice as many hospital staff per thousand population in the south&hyphen;eastern and central regions than in the west and the south-west of Sydney, with the south&hyphen;east having 16.3; central, 19.3; south-west Sydney, 8.4; and Wentworth, 9.4. This cannot continue. These imbalances, these inequities and this injustice cannot continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current resource distribution formula does not do enough to catch up with the population growth. I repeat what I said earlier: the west and south-west of Sydney in terms of their share and re&hyphen;allocation of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4591"> hospital resources need to run faster just to stand still. These are the growth regions, the suburbs to which people in Sydney and beyond are moving. Radical redistribution in the funding formula is required&mdash;not cheap publicity tricks or smoke and mirrors, but radical redistribution. Bandaids are not enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Refshauge recently announced another $134 million for the New South Wales health budget. My understanding is that this does not close the gap between the health regions in the centre of Sydney and the south-east, compared with the west and the south-west. The gap needs to close at a time when the Howard government is cutting away the global allocation. It is time for the Carr government to take stock. They need to examine the funding cuts out of Canberra and use them as the absolutely essential reason by which radical funding redistribution should be embraced and applied.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Returning to the States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill, last week I referred to some recent remarks made by former Treasurer John Dawkins. Speaking in Adelaide at a function for the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia, Mr Dawkins admitted that, with the exception of his 1993 budget, the Labor government from 1988 onwards had dropped its bundle. That would come as no surprise to those members who caught up with the fascinating ABC series <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Labor in Power</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Dawkins's comments at that Adelaide function are pretty rich when you remember that what was really clear from that series was that his principal numbers man was quite prepared to sacrifice good government in order to attain power. Gary Punch, a former member of this House, a member of the Hawke and Keating government and also a Keating disciple, allegedly said that he would be prepared to bring down the government to get rid of Hawke. In an astonishing display of greed, power and unbridled ambition, the series convincingly revealed that in order to find issues to attack and discredit Bob Hawke, Dawkins and Keating were prepared to seize on anything.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nowhere was this more obvious than in Keating's ambush of Hawke's new federalism. Keating's courting of the Left of his party during this period was not so much unprincipled as a sad reflection of what power and ambition can do to an individual. Unfortunately, the repercussions of Keating's personal hunger for power were felt by all Australians. Hawke's new federalism was an attempt at eliminating the duplication, the inefficiencies, the shifting of costs and the imbalance that exists between the states and Canberra in this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4593"> country. It was an attempt to redress the inequalities in revenue sharing in our Federation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The plans for a new era of cooperation and agreement were endorsed by both Labor and Liberal premiers at the time. Unfortunately, the Placido Domingo of Australian politics prevailed and the scheme was scuttled. In repaying those who had delivered him power, Paul Keating as Prime Minister proceeded to undo much of the work that Paul Keating as Treasurer had fulfilled. Unlike his namesake, he converted not once but twice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Euromoney</EMPHASIS> magazine Finance Minister of the Year became, seven years later, a deficit spending Prime Minister. As Treasurer he had delivered budgets in surplus while the states were undermining their banks and financial institutions. As Prime Minister, Keating led the way in the decline in national savings while the states began to adopt responsible fiscal consolidation stances. How ironic. What a reversal in roles that Paul Keating, the man who delivered budgets in surplus in 1987 and 1988, I think, later became the deficit spending Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In speaking in favour of the States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1996, it is important to make the point that this government believes in federation and that it believes in the states&mdash;not just in words but in deeds. The Commonwealth's clear command of financial resources discloses a trend that has long been a matter of concern. Writing in 1954, S.J. Butlin stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The enlargement of the Federal Parliament and the rewards of the Commonwealth service are both hastening the transition to a condition in which the States have no future except as administrative agents of a central government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is merely the latest phase of a trend which has been continuous since Federation, and it is still the same because it is by and through financial relations that Federalism is disappearing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What becomes relevant is the design of financial machinery and financial policy without undue regard to the `rights' of the states.</PARA>
<PARA>Butlins' main point was that it is essential that we design financial machinery and financial policy in order to keep the important concept of federalism viable.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides general revenue assistance to the states and territories and also encourages them to continue improving efficiency in areas like transport and communication. It appropriates $16.3 billion, which represents 12 per cent of Commonwealth outlays, or, if you like, the equivalent of two Beazley black holes. The equivalent of two Beazley black holes is what we are spending in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The states and territories will receive a real per capita growth in financial assistance grants, or FAGs, in 1996&hyphen;97 and their real maintenance will be guaranteed to 1998&hyphen;99. That is conditional on the states meeting their obligation under the agreement of the April 1995 COAG meeting to implement the national competition policy. The first tranche is conditional on each state and territory implementing COAG agreements on electricity and gas and observing reforms in road transport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition thinks that grants to the states have been cut. That is wrong. On top of the increase in financial assistance grants, states and territories will receive $219 million in competition payments. In real terms, the total net assistance to the states this year in 1995&hyphen;96 prices, in real terms, is higher than it has been since the 1984 budget. This year total Commonwealth assistance to the states will increase by 2.2 per cent. As well, the states and territories will contribute to the reduction of the Commonwealth budget deficit by fiscal contributions which will improve saving over the next three years. This year the states will contribute $619 million to plug the budget's burgeoning Beazley black hole. Flexibility on how to pay the fiscal contribution will allow states and territories to deduct from general revenue assistance or direct grants or to reduce specific purpose grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth's total payments to the states represent about a quarter of all Commonwealth outlays. The government could never have quarantined this area from fiscal consolidation without cutting into other areas like health or social security. But, even so, we are actually paying the states 2.2 per cent more than last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill had its genesis at this year's Premiers Conference. At that conference all <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4594"> Premiers and Chief Ministers, both Labor and Liberal&mdash;although there was only one Labor&mdash;recognised that Labor's debt burden needed to be shared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent years, the total state public sector has moved from a deficit of $3.7 billion or 0.9 per cent of GDP in 1991&hyphen;92 to a surplus of $1.9 billion or 0.4 per cent of GDP in 1994&hyphen;95, thanks to the prudent management of the Court, Brown, Groom and Kennett administrations. During that period, New South Wales had a Liberal government which had low levels of public sector net debt and low budget deficits. Queensland is in the strongest position of all, with budget surpluses and no net public sector debt. The crippling legacy of Burke, Bannon, Field and Cain has slowly been overcome in those states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence of disciplined Liberal Party administrations at state level, the states in total have been in surplus for some years by adopting debt reduction and saving strategies. In contrast, `Keating's Commonwealth' continued in a spendthrift, profligate way. As outlined earlier, the irony of the 1990s when reflecting on the 1980s is that it was Paul Keating&mdash;the man who, in 1987, claimed to have delivered the first budget surplus in 40 years&mdash;who actually led the decline in national saving while the states were adopting a responsible fiscal consolidation stance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this year's Premiers Conference it was proposed that the sales tax exemptions that all levels of government enjoyed be removed. The principle was that where public enterprises or utilities competed with private companies they should be treated equally by the wholesale sales tax system; in effect the goal of competitive neutrality. In some cases, the exemptions were being openly rorted and the exemptions that the state, local and territory governments enjoyed were distorting resource allocation and encouraging this rorting. Purchasing decisions and decisions on whether to contract services out to the private sector were affected, in effect, by that sales tax exemption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Premiers Conference agreed to remove the exemption on private&hyphen;plated cars which are part of executive salary packages for all levels of government. That really was where <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the rort was the worst. In the words of former US President Ronald Reagan:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For everyone who finds a tax shelter, it leaves someone else out in the cold.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, we were unable to broaden the sales tax base. The tax transparency and competitive neutrality principles which would have come by treating government instrumentalities in the same way as private firms would have further streamlined the business of government as well as led to better allocative decisions based on truer prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make the point that it would have been fairer to end the wholesale sales tax exemptions enjoyed by all levels of government and to also expose the Commonwealth to state taxes like stamp duty, payroll tax and financial institutions duty. It would have led to a structural improvement in the budget balance and fairer tax treatment of government business enterprises. It is important to note that the states' fiscal contribution will give us a three&hyphen;year improvement in savings, but not a permanent source of revenue, not a structural improvement in the budget deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to 1974, Australia ran a budget surplus of two per cent of GDP on average. Since 1974 it has run an average deficit of 1.4 per cent of GDP. In a sense, Whitlam's legacy was not the abolition of national service or the introduction of so&hyphen;called free education. Rather, Whitlam will best be remembered for presiding over the irresponsible explosion of government expenditure. That was an explosion which contributed to the disastrous stagflation of the mid&hyphen;1970s. For example, in 1974 government spending increased 14.6 per cent. In 1975 it increased 12.2 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than Cyclone Tracy, 1974 should really be remembered as the year in which Gough Whitlam struck, wreaking havoc on the Australian economy. Darwin was rebuilt but, sadly, our budgetary position was devastated and the rebuilding had just begun. Malcolm Fraser could stop the tidal wave of government expenditure that Whitlam had unleashed, but he could not wind it back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the reason for the change in the budget's structural balance since 1974 has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4595"> been a shift from the Commonwealth budget to state budgets of capital works spending. Gough Whitlam relieved the budget of capital spending when the Postmaster&hyphen;General's Department became Telecom and Australia Post and they both did their own borrowing. Malcolm Fraser froze the states' general purposes capital payments and encouraged them to borrow overseas for capital projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whereas in the 1960s and early 1970s budget deficits included a large component of spending for capital works, more recently the budget deficits that the Hawke and Keating governments were racking up have not been contributing to saving and have had minimal capital spending. In effect, budget deficits in the early 1970s were good and in the 1980s and 1990s they were bad. In the early 1970s they were a down payment on our future. In the 1980s and 1990s they were a debt burden for the future generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The failures of state and federal Labor governments of the 1980s and 1990s have been well documented elsewhere. I do not want to revisit that, but it is worth noting that in my own state the South Australian Labor government, without a whiff of corruption, lost more money per capita with the State Bank collapse than the murky stench of WA Inc. and more per capita than even the corrupt BCCI Bank. It is not a record that we are particularly proud of. I do not think that the South Australian government was corrupt and, in a sense, it does not really matter because its incompetence cost more than the corruption of WA Inc. and more than the corruption that was involved with the BCCI Bank. Their incompetence left a damage bill three times more than that of the LA riots of 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the mid&hyphen;1990s the states have had to carry much of the burden of lifting national savings. It is the projected state budget surpluses which are stabilising net national debt and propping up our national saving. Fortunately, all state governments agree with the need to increase national savings and have agreed to make a fiscal contribution to plugging the budget's Beazley black hole. There is every sign of a new discipline in state and Commonwealth governments. I do not think we can ask the states to make a contribution <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to improving the budget while Labor try to stop the Commonwealth government from doing its bit and paying its way. They want to continue to squeeze the states without Canberra sharing the load. Just as they did in government, in opposition they are happy to impose a discipline on others that they will not impose on themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within our Federation there is considerable imbalance between spending and revenue raising. The states raise 55 per cent of the revenue they spend. They are dependent on Canberra for the rest. The Commonwealth raises 35 per cent more than it spends for its own government outlays. Also, through section 96 grants, the Commonwealth controls 25 to 30 per cent of state spending. Clearly, Commonwealth&hyphen;state financial relations need to be reformed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The vertical fiscal imbalance which is inherent in our system contributes to overlap and duplication because responsibility for programs often depends on the nature of Commonwealth grants. Some states are reluctant to raise more of their revenue. They find Canberra and the Commonwealth government a useful whipping boy at every Premiers Conference. Malcolm Fraser offered the states some detailed functions and responsibilities as well as some marginal direct taxation raising powers. That offer was not taken up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the early 1990s several states ran large budget deficits. At that time, five of the six states were run by Labor governments. Now the states are in combined recurrent surplus and are reducing their debt level. Only one of those states has a Labor government&mdash;New South Wales. Is that coincidental? Is that just fate or bad luck? Historically, the ALP have always felt that they got a bit of a rough trot, that they had a bit of bad luck, bad timing. When Jim Scullin from the Labor Party won in 1929 and the stock market crash occurred about one month later, that was just bad luck. When the Whitlam government had to deal with oil price rises of 400 per cent and the high unemployment and double digit inflation which led from that, that was a bit of back luck and there was not much they could do about it. But the record of new Labor in the 1980s and 1990s has been one <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4596"> of debt and deficit, of financial collapse and incompetence. Is that just more bad luck, or is it bad government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, under Labor, section 96 payments expanded from one&hyphen;third to over 50 per cent of total grants. Federally, Labor used those section 96 payments, or the FAGs with tags, to restrict and control the spending of the states. This bill will reduce the specific purpose payments&mdash;section 96 grants&mdash;by three per cent this year. According to New South Wales budget papers which were quoted in a recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> by Alan Wood:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the last 15 years Commonwealth spending has increased in real per capita terms by 2 per cent a year while Commonwealth payments to States fell by an average of 0.3 per cent a year.</PARA>
<PARA>I would suggest that the Commonwealth straitjacket that Labor used and applied to the states may encourage them to extract profits from monopolies not exposed to the full gale of competition and encourage them to retreat from the Hilmer reform process. This government's overall increase of 2.2 per cent in state assistance will encourage the states to continue with competition reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at Labor's legacy of Commonwealth&hyphen;state financial relations. In 1983 when we last left office, federal grants to state and local government represented 9.5 per cent of GDP. Eleven years later it had dropped to 7.2 per cent of GDP. In 1983, federal revenue was 24.5 per cent of GDP. By 1994 it was 25 per cent of GDP, almost the same. So while federal revenue remained static in terms of GDP, the grants to the states declined by two per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at it in more detail, financial assistance grants to the states actually increased in real terms from 1983 until 1987. That was when Keating decided to put the screws on the states. That was when he made his famous `hollow log' statement about the way he felt the states were somehow squirreling away their grants. So he put the screws on the states. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The States Grant (General Purposes) Amendment Bill is from one point of view a very routine <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> annual measure, but it is legislation of very great practical importance to the functioning of our Federation. It is a key determinant of the quality of government services delivered by the states and territories. It does have a real impact on the quality of life of a great many Australians. States and territories, after all, deliver the vast bulk of basic public services in this country and the funding provided by the Commonwealth every year through this legislation does have an enormously significant effect on the ability of those governments to provide the decent level of services that people are entitled to in a civilised society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a very direct sense, the quality of our hospitals, our schools, our roads, our legal systems and a great many other essential public services is determined by this general purpose funding provided by the Commonwealth to the states. Of course the states also rely on specific purpose payments in a great many areas and also on their own source revenue but, as any observer of a Premiers Conference can attest, the issue of general purpose payments is a vital and critical one for the major service providing level of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition know this only too well. They are supposedly, after all, the champions of the states in our federal system. However, as in most areas, the gap between the government's rhetoric and its performance in the area of state funding is nothing short of deceitful. I have to say that the member for Boothby (Dr Southcott) maintained that fine tradition of empty rhetoric in his contribution that we have just heard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the last election, the following promise which this bill now breaks was made. The coalition undertook to provide a `fixed percentage of revenue to facilitate better planning and give certainty to the states and territories'. The formula through which this would be achieved would be one, the coalition promised, which would `guarantee current services and be revenue neutral'. That promise was very explicitly reaffirmed by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) 10 days after the election when, at his first press conference on 12 March, he said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4597">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think I made it clear during the election campaign that our purpose was not to cut general assistance grants to the States.</PARA>
<PARA>A question was interpolated, `So specific purpose payments will be cut?' The Treasurer answered:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well we'll be looking at specific purpose payments yes, but it is not our intention to have the States take the pain in relation to general assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>That promise was broken spectacularly during the June Premiers Conference and that breach of faith is codified in this legislation we are dealing with today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1996 Premiers Conference will go down as a watershed. It was without question a farce. There has often been over the years acrimonious debate in these gatherings. There is certainly usually parochial complaining by any government that feels that they have been hardly done by and most of them from time to time feel that they are. But for this government, and in particular for this Treasurer, the June 1996 Premiers Conference was an unrivalled, unmitigated disaster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In early June the states and territories were probably contemplating a rather nice, quick meeting. After all, these promises were on the record. The previous year's conference had been probably the quickest on record. It was all over in half an hour or so, allowing the related COAG meeting, the Council of Australian Governments, to commence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason that the meeting in that year, our last year of government, had been so successful was that the Commonwealth had offered a fair deal to the states and they had accepted it. The deal was a real per capita guarantee for three years and Labor would have delivered on that promise. In addition, we negotiated the competition payments to share the benefits of the historic Hilmer competition reform agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I say that we would have delivered this real per capita agreement because we have a history of delivering on negotiated agreements. Just to look at recent years, at the June 1990 Premiers Conference Labor undertook to maintain the level of financial assistance grants to the states in real terms from 1991-92 to 1993-94, subject to the condition that  Australia did not experience any major eco nomic deterioration. Despite the significant economic downturn that did of course then occur, Labor agreed to honour the real terms guarantee in each of those financial years. That relieved an enormous amount of stress that would otherwise have been experienced by the states. In addition, we also provided another $169 million to the states as a one-off addition to that in 1992&hyphen;93.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of this triennium, the 1994 Premiers Conference agreement was reached that financial assistance grants, FAGs, to the states would be maintained in real per capita terms over the next three years. At the 1995 Premiers Conference this real per capita guarantee was then extended to 1997-98.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a time of what was obviously strong budgetary pressure, the Commonwealth, under the Labor government, for the long-term good of this nation, consistently maintained and then increased financial assistance grants in real terms. This did have a significant impact on the budget of the Commonwealth. There is no doubt about it that our maintenance of those grants in real terms, not backing away, not backsliding, was one of the factors that contributed to the budget deficit being higher by the end of our term than it would otherwise have been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other key factors is that of the inflation rate being much lower than had been anticipated as a result of us breaking the back of inflation during our term of office, denying the government the windfall revenue that flows from higher inflation rates. Another key factor is that of the Working Nation commitments. There is no doubt about that. We make no bones about it because we did feel the necessity to make that contribution to the education, training, skilling and job readiness of our members of the community&mdash;an obligation that has obviously not carried through to this current government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the significant impact maintaining our commitments had on the Commonwealth budget, we did shield the states from the worst impacts of the recession and guaranteed thereafter that the states' capacity to provide core services to the public was maintained. In short, we took almost the whole of the fiscal responsibility for the recession because to do <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4598"> so was the best policy for the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The record shows absolutely unequivocally that when Labor makes a deal it sticks to it. This brings me back to this year's Premiers Conference, the fun at which began when the Treasurer announced he had unilaterally decided that the existing sales tax exemptions enjoyed by all governments were rorts and that therefore they were to be terminated. All motor vehicles at state and local government level were to be taxable from that time, with an impact that was estimated by local government sources to be $200 million to $300 million a year for local government alone, with a whole variety of other measures removing that sales tax exemption to be worked out over the next few months. The total bill was estimated by the Treasurer to be $1.2 billion for states and local government, but certainly the states, the territories and local government themselves thought that was a considerable underestimate, as I believe it was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Acceptance of this new tax was to be a condition of the delivery of the already agreed financial assistance grants payments, payments that the Treasurer had promised before the election to deliver, a promise which he reaffirmed, as I said, immediately after the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Predictably enough, the victims responded. The conference was a disaster. It stretched out not over half an hour but over two days. The related COAG meeting was also a farce. It produced absolutely nothing concrete. At a series of meetings the Treasurer was not allowed to attend there was not only bad blood already around; it was an atmosphere described by most of the participants as the worst they could recall in Australian federal relations history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess this farce and the disaster associated with it did serve one very important public purpose: it did allow the public of Australia to know what the Treasurer's coalition colleagues really think of him. Certainly they pulled no punches in describing exactly what they did think. Mr Stockdale, the Treasurer of Victoria, said on 12 June:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it's a very black day for the new Federal Government. The central appeal to people of Australia was that he&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Treasurer&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">could be trusted, that he would keep his promise and he would honour his commitments and here he's broken no less than five commitments: two election promises. No tax increases. This is a tax increase.</PARA>
<PARA>And so he went on. Mr Borbidge, the Premier of Queensland, said that he had a high regard for the Prime Minister but that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't share that view of the Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA>And further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Costello is off to an appalling start.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of people picked up that particular metaphor, no doubt inspired by the immortal line, so I am reminded by my colleague the member for Batman of Mr Kennett, the Victorian Premier, that the Treasurer had every quality of a dog except loyalty.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Peter Costello's only been there a dog watch, but in that short time he's making Willis and Dawkins look good.</PARA>
<PARA>I will leave the final word, I guess, to the coalition colleague of the member for Boothby&mdash;not that the member for Boothby has stayed around&mdash;Mr Dean Brown, the Premier of South Australia, who was quoted on 13 June on wire services throughout the nation as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth&hyphen;State relations have never been as low as they are now.</PARA>
<PARA>He was not impressed with the lowness of the relations that had been reached during the Whitlam period or the Keating period or the Hawke period, which so exercised the good doctor from Boothby. He was not impressed by the low ebb of Commonwealth&hyphen;state relations of the Scullin era, or the Chifley era, or the Curtin era or any of the other earlier <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4599"> parts of Labor history. He had a very clear perception of just this. I quote again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth&hyphen;State relations have never been as low as they are now.</PARA>
<PARA>True, indeed. The `agreement', when it was finally arrived at, was a humiliating backdown for the Treasurer, but it still involved, of course, significant cuts in grants to the states. The states had no alternative but to accept them. Their arms were well and truly up their backs. These grants cutbacks were given the Pythonesque title of the states' `fiscal contribution'. It is those that are contained, I guess, within this legislation&mdash;the contributions made by the states by way of cuts to the grants that would otherwise have been payable had the promises been kept. The contributions were announced as $619 million in 1996-97, $640 million the following year and $300 million in 1998-99. It is a $1.5 billion broken promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a positively Orwellian twist&mdash;I think that is the only way you can describe it&mdash;the Treasurer also announced that he was extending the real per capita guarantee introduced by Labor until 1998-99. That is to say, he was extending the agreement he had breached only until the end of the three-year period for which he told the states he would not honour it. Why did he not extend it further to actually give the states some hope, some tangible benefit from all of this? The answer, I would suggest, is absolutely clear. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister are planning a repeat of the 1996 Premiers Conference in 1999. At that time they will try once again to tax the other levels of government, just as they tried and failed to do this year. The Prime Minister admitted after all that he still thought this tax was good policy, after he failed to implement it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last general issue I want to return to in all of this is the proper role of government. I said at the outset that this bill is one of the key ones in the functioning of the  federation. It also points out one of the really big lies that is constantly trotted out by our opponents. For at least a generation we have been criticised by our conservative opponents for being over&hyphen;centralist and therefore anti-state. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> There is a very clear way to answer that; that is, simply by referring to our record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Which government in Australia has given the states and territories a fairer deal in terms of untied funding? Look at the record of the last few years as compared with the record of this year and you are left in no doubt about the answer&mdash;it is Labor. Which government has provided more tied assistance to the states and territories in areas such as health, education, roads, railways, housing, legal aid and environment funding? Ours. It has worked well in terms of the delivery of real services to real people, which you are just not in the business of providing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are so anti-state, why do we always provide more assistance to help with the provisions of the core services of government? If the Prime Minister is so pro-state and the Treasurer is so pro-state, why are they cutting both tied and untied assistance? Take the most prominent service of all provided by the states&mdash;public hospitals&mdash;so eloquently dealt with by my colleague the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) a few minutes ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everyone knows the pressure that the hospital system is under. Funding cuts do not just cause inconvenience, however; they cost lives. If the states have less money overall, less is bound to go into hospital resources. Given that some 30 per cent of state budgets already go into health, it is a totally reasonable inference&mdash;the second reading amendment makes this clear&mdash;that around $450 million will be cut from hospital budgets in this way over the next three years. In addition, the budget also much more specifically and directly cuts a further $312 million over the next four years, supposedly to counter cost&hyphen;shifting practices. But that is just a convenient justification for a cut. Will cutting these grants stop the cost shifting? No, of course it will not; it will just encourage more. Will cuts deliver better services to people through shorter waiting lists and shorter waiting times? No; this is simply a savings option disguised as a structural measure. The government favours private medicine over public medicine. It is reducing the resources available to the public hospital system.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4600">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The answer as to why all this is happening is really very simple. Why is the government cutting assistance to the states, both tied and untied? This government, led by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, simply does not like government doing more than the absolute minimum. It is not a matter of not wanting the Commonwealth to do things and giving it to the states; it is a matter of the Prime Minister saying he does not want the Commonwealth to do things and saying that it is a matter for the states, but cutting all funding sources to the states, both tied and untied, in a way that the Prime Minister knows they will not be able to fill the holes left by the cessation of Commonwealth activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An absolutely classic example of this kind of issue at work occurred under our government with the immunisation program. This was transferred to the states in 1987 in response to some of the sorts of pressures that people are talking about today, supposedly to get the meddling Commonwealth out of the way to improve outcomes. So an agreement was reached whereby the Commonwealth funding was maintained but transferred into general revenue funding. The states were allowed, accordingly, to establish their own program priorities without having to be subject to the Commonwealth administrative yolk, as they claimed. What happened? The states took the money but did not spend it on immunisation. They engaged in shifting the costs of immunisation onto Medicare by increasing the delivery of immunisation services by general practitioners. I will not go into the detail of it; I do not have time. The net result of it all was an absolute unmitigated disaster, universally now  recognised as such, flowing from that abdication of Commonwealth responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At least back in 1987 we notionally kept the funding flowing for the services in question. We just left it up to the states to get on with the business of implementing them. What is happening on this occasion is that the funds themselves are rapidly and dramatically drying up. One example of the practical impact of this, in an area where the Labor government showed itself absolutely willing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to work in terms of delivery through the states, is the Commonwealth dental program. I know from my own very moving experiences visiting a number of clinics where this program has been at work of the devastating impact that the complete cessation of that funding will have, a cessation of funding which we know perfectly well for most states is not going to be picked up in whole or even part and as a result pensioners and cardholders right across the system are going to suffer abominably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth of the matter is that we believe, as we have always believed, that there is a strong national coordination role for the Commonwealth in these matters. We believe, however, that the role and responsibilities of the various levels of government should be continually reviewed and refined. That is why we initiated the whole COAG process, now under way. We are very happy to work with the states. We are very happy to continue the funding to the states, not only special purpose payments, which have often been controversial over the years, but in terms of general assistance grants and the financial assistance grants as well&mdash;the subject of this legislation, which involves such a crude and outrageous breach of promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister, the Treasurer and this government have an ideological agenda which is absolutely transparently crystal clear&mdash;lucidly clear&mdash;in this particular legislation. It is not just to divest functions from the Commonwealth to the states. That has always been part of the conservative agenda. It is to divest functions and services from the government generally. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I wish to make is the ability the Labor Party have, which has always existed, to delude themselves. In this case we have seen them delude themselves on the issue of a procedural motion, and a proper motion has just been before the place. The shadow Treasurer as one of our previous speakers to this debate, spent a lot of time telling us just how kind the previous Labor government had been to the states over time in regard to the funding we are debating today. I thank them very much for the delays they caused, because <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it gave me the opportunity to obtain the statistics relative to payments to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting to look at the budget outlays by function in the budget document and find the figures that relate to this particular issue. It is of interest to me that back in 1986-87, when the previous government was in place, the figure for the `General purpose intergovernment transaction function' stood at nearly $13 billion. Of course, in 1996-97 it is now at $16.797 billion. That is irrelevant in itself until one takes it as a percentage of the total government outlays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have another document here that points out that back in 1984-85, shortly after the election of the previous government, the grants to the states in their various forms represented 19.8 per cent of total government outlays. By 1994-95, shortly before the previous government lost office, it was down from 19.8 per cent to 12.3 per cent&mdash;nearly half. The reality is that the shadow Treasurer stands up here lecturing us about how we as a coalition government have dealt to the states. In fact, it has been well known and well publicised over the years that, every time Paul Keating, as Treasurer and later as Prime Minister, boasted of how he had maintained Commonwealth outlays as a percentage of GDP at relatively low levels, the Commonwealth's own purpose outlays had gone up and that that percentage had been maintained by the process of cutting money to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worse than that, because the shadow Treasurer also got on to the health issue. These health outlays in the states are amazing things. It was the previous government that stood up, invented a program called Medicare and then dumped all the costs of the hospital side of that on to state governments. Yes, they sent them a bit of money; it was just never enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So promises were made, but the costs were dumped on the state governments. The states are now twisting on that hook. They cannot find the money from the resources in the revenue base available to them, and people are now turning around and coming up with cost shifting measures that have to be addressed also.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4607">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anybody who suggests that the previous coalition government was in any way responsible for the current parsimonious status of the state governments is ignoring history. The ability to rewrite history is something that has stuck with this Labor Party for as long as I have been here, which is 16 years. They have rewritten history back to the time when Billy Hughes swapped sides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that in all of these cases it is time that the shadow Treasurer, the person who has the claimed academic qualifications and everything else, remembered history and did not come into this place&mdash;where everything is on the record&mdash;and try to rewrite it in terms of his previous government's dealings with the states. The Labor government robbed them blind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will repeat something I said earlier. Between 1984-85 and 1994-95, Commonwealth payments to the states as a percentage of total outlays dropped from 19.8 per cent to 12.3 per cent. It is a farce to suggest in any way that the problems confronting state governments all arose in this year's budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why was it necessary for this government to go to the states and ask them to make a contribution towards getting rid of the Beazley black hole from the funds which were guaranteed to them by a previous government? The answer is simple: somebody, somewhere, had to decide what their commitment to the youth of Australia was. For years I have been walking Australia complaining about the Keating policy of letting the children pay&mdash;a policy of meeting everybody's requirements, feeding the money out into the economy and borrowing the difference. The Labor government never had the courage to tax to the level of its expenditures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that, over the lifetime of the Keating government, we saw the debt of the Commonwealth rise by over $70,000 million. Who has to pay that back? More particularly, who is going to suffer from lower living standards? The youth of this country, that is who. Why is it that the hospital system will be under pressure? Because you spent the money. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the issue throughout. The money has been spent. Members on the other side cry crocodile tears over the future of Telstra. They spent Telstra. On any business balance sheet, there is $70 million of additional debt. That is after you sold the Commonwealth bank, Qantas and CSL. You sold all of those assets and spent the money. So they have gone, too. The kids' assets have gone. On the balance sheet, the value of Telstra is spent. Every penny of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We propose to sell only a third of Telstra and try to reduce that debt to manageable levels. Anyone who does the homework will see that government revenue will benefit, even after the loss of dividend, by saving $300 million or $400 million a year on the interest bill. That is the reality, and it has to be done to give the kids of this country a go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is grossly improper in reasonable economic times for governments to be borrowing money. If they cannot meet their promises with taxation, then they should spend less. That is what we are trying to do. We should be doing it, and we should be getting assistance in doing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the other point I want to make. There is a thing called the national interest. We had a lot of philosophical positions which were formulated into policies and which were eventually stolen by the then Labor government and used. Privatisation was one of those. Not at one stage did we walk away from our philosophical position. We stood up in this place and were counted&mdash;we voted in favour of our position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say that the Commonwealth Bank would not be sold today&mdash;certainly the Labor Party would never have got to that position&mdash;if we had tried to make the sort of stupid mischief that is going on from the opposition benches today. It is opposition for opposition's sake. It is heartbreaking, because there is a national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see that the member at the table, the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor), is raising his eyebrows. No electorate more than his needs help. It needs a new labour program so that the employers will go back into the marketplace and hire people. The Labor Party is finding every possible scheme to drive <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4608"> around silly industrial relations laws. But businesses will not buy it. They will always be smarter than the rest and, if you keep putting up roadblocks, they will stop hiring people. We want to give the businesses some confidence that they can hire people and hire them on rates where they make good money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hear time and time again that in my state we have draconian industrial relations laws. Every week, people are moving out of the electorate of Corio and over to Western Australia to be exploited&mdash;exploited because we have a government that is giving people the opportunity to earn the highest wages in Australia. Their industrial law is working. People are leaving Victoria. They are going over there to get exploited. They reckon it is so good being exploited in Western Australia that they cannot get there quickly enough. That is the reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">National interests should be put above politics. After you have lost an election&mdash;as we did, and we stayed in opposition for a considerable period&mdash;there comes a time when you ask yourselves, `Are we going to oppose this to be mischievous, or are we going to oppose it because it is wrong?' Our record in that regard is that we opposed things only when they were wrong. We did not do backflips on our proposals when we were in opposition. If we said in our policy that we would do something or if we had done it in the past, we stood by it. The simple fact is that the Labor Party is not doing Australians any favours at all by denying progress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I listed myself for this debate, my principal reason was to put the argument where it really belongs. I would like to think that this is the last parliament where we have to debate this sort of legislation&mdash;the Commonwealth's gift to the states, the last time we have to have the Premiers of Australia coming along cap-in-hand begging for money. Too frequently Prime Ministers make themselves and their bottom lines look good by denying the states the funds they need to provide the services like health, dental care and all the other issues which are properly their responsibility and, might I add, not ours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say something about the brilliant Medicare while I am in that area! The figures <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are here&mdash;budget outlays by function, and I know them off by heart. Prior to the introduction of Medicare, the expenditure of the Commonwealth on these three items was: defence, about $4 billion; education, about $3.5 billion; and health, about $3 billion. It was the general public's opinion that they had a pretty good health system. Over 60 per cent of Australians paid for their own health cover. That is why the outlays were that low. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What is the situation today? We outlay $19.4 billion for health, $11 billion for education, and $10 billion for defence. And you wonder why there is no money for students. Your health system has doubled in relative terms in cost and, as a result, what have you got? You are starving every other segment of the budget. You have created a community attitude where they are hooked on it, just as they might be on a drug, and the situation goes on. You have highly distorted the situation. The situation is no good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk about the national interest. It is time that both sides of this parliament stopped being silly about tax. It is time that we demonstrated that as a group of politicians we can sit down together and look at what is a ridiculous and stupid tax system. I got some information out today. How do states survive outside of the $16.3 billion plus another $219 million that we pay to the states? Let me tell you. Payroll taxes: $6.579 billion, a direct tax on employment and one of the silliest taxes that man ever invented. In tough times we tax people for employing people. Then we bring in a thing called a threshold that encourages small business to say: `I cannot put another person on because I will break through the threshold and have to pay payroll tax.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tax on removable property is worth $7.8 billion. It is probably not bad to the extent that it services property but it is another tax on business enterprises and other people who are trying to run a business and make profits. One of the great tragedies of the present difficult time is that businesses are finding that they cannot put their prices up but a lot of these taxes are increasing. I looked to the business with which my family is associated the other day and saw over a period of time that the tariff they charge has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4609"> remained standard but the council rates have doubled. That is a little outside this debate but it is an example of how business people are finding it more and more difficult to pay these taxes when in a low inflation environment, which I am delighted we now have, they are unable to raise their fees to recover that amount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Taxes on financial capital transactions, stamp duties, are worth $3.998 billion. Financial institution taxes are worth $1.831 billion. We are going out to the world saying: `Come to Australia, put your head office in Australia, run your Asian enterprise from Australia, but every time the money flows in and out we will tax it. We will tax you when you bank it.'</PARA>

I have just cited how much money is involved. It is a silly tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could go on and cite the others. Taxes on insurance have been around for years&mdash;they are worth $1.688 billion. Again, it is just a straight cost of doing business. The taxes keep increasing and more and more businesses close down or replace workers to find the money. That is silly. I am arguing that it is time we sat down. Before Christmas I will bring a resolution to this parliament trying to get an even-sided committee, a committee that is half the opposition and half the government, to sit down and look at taxation between local government, state government and federal government and all its implications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not foolish enough to say that you apply a tax and somebody loses more than someone else. But we should have the wit in this place, if we are fair dinkum politicians and if we are here to do more than shout at one another and play games, to get together in the national interest and work out what is the best and, more particularly, the simplest tax system for Australia that raises the revenue, that runs the hospitals and looks after <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the poor but at the same time does not make it negative for business because business will always be the people that create employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard someone say the other day: `You are cutting back on public servants. That will create more unemployment.' If that were so simple, why don't we double the number of public servants and have no unemployment? We do not do it because there is not enough money in the economy to afford it. Why have a tax system that no-one else in the world has today? Why keep adding to fuel tax when it represents such a huge percentage of the cost of doing business in Australia? You can have a fuel tax in other parts of the world. The member for Corio&mdash;and good luck to him&mdash;has a major car manufacturing industry. Our present tax system, according to Australian Treasury, adds $700 to $800 to the manufactured cost of a car. We put lead in their saddlebags and say: `Compete with the imports; export to the rest of the world, but pay $700 a car for the privilege.' It is silly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should be looking at other ways to make your industry more efficient and create more jobs. We are smart people. We should be competitive in the world. When you talk about jobs, the simple reality is that if we got another half a per cent of the world's business we would probably have to double our population to handle it. It is out there for us because we have not got a big population. We do not really need to play that role within the world. We are constantly hamstringing our people with silly ideas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Talking about industrial relations, I have been an employer all my life. My kids discovered the other day&mdash;they run the family business&mdash;that if they chastise anybody now under this unfair dismissal law they have also got to threaten them with the sack. What a dreadful situation. We have never done that. We might tell someone they are not pulling their weight or something, but you never say, `And you're going to be sacked.' But if you do not do it every time and if they claim unfair dismissal when on the 10th time you put them off, you have got to pay them compensation. That is silly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have never known an employer yet who wanted to sack a good worker. They see them <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4610"> as the greatest asset they have got. They do not get up every morning thinking, `Who can I be cruel to today?' We should not make that a concept within Australia. Whilst there will always be the odd smart alec, your typical Australian small business employer gets along very well with his staff. Frequently it is very hard to differentiate him from them.

Tonight I want to talk about a couple of issues in my shadow portfolio that are very important particularly to people in my own electorate of Jagajaga.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most outrageous efforts of this government in cutting $1.5 billion in grants to the states over the next three years of course is the effect of these cuts on our health system, particularly on our public hospital system. When we consider that about one&hyphen;third of all state expenditure is on health, then it is possible to get an appreciation of the scale of the impact of these cuts. These cuts are going to have very serious implications for our public hospitals. Some might say, `Oh, but there are separate Medicare grants for public hospitals.' What they do not realise is that 50 per cent of hospital funding comes out of general purpose grants to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This massive cut to state grants is going to see more and more cuts to public hospital services&mdash;particularly, I would have to say, to our public hospitals in Victoria. They are cuts that we can ill afford. The reason we can ill afford them is, of course, that they come on top of cuts to public hospitals. In Victoria we have seen far too many cuts. We have seen massive cuts to public hospital expenditure over the last three years. We are all too familiar with the terrible stories.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I received a letter from a constituent of mine who has had exactly this problem in my local hospital. The hospital is the Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre&mdash;an outstanding hospital. My constituent is a resident of Watsonia. He was admitted to casualty at the Austin at 4.45 p.m. with angina. He had the usual tests done. He lay in casualty until 11.30 that night and was advised that he would be kept overnight. At approximately 2.15 in the morning he was told that he had unstable angina and that there were no beds available at either the Austin or the Repatriation sites. He says:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.30 a.m. Ambulance arrived and I was taken to Box Hill.</PARA>
<PARA>This constituent makes it very clear that at no time has he made any criticism of either the medical or the nursing staff at the hospital. At all times the medical and the nursing staff tried to help him in every way that they could. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My complaint is in the delay in waiting for an ambulance while my condition was unstable . . . I am also disturbed about the apparent lack of application of priority treatment to veterans as evidenced by the offer to go to a private hospital.</PARA>
<PARA>This was to be at his own expense. After all, this priority treatment was something which <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4611"> was agreed to between the RSL, the government and the hospitals at the time of the amalgamation and incorporation in their charter.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust my comments may be of some help in your fight to improve standards of care and for additional money for such purpose.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>What I am going to have to tell this constituent is that not only is this government not providing any more money; it is taking a considerable amount of money, through the general purpose grants, out of public hospitals. That is not the only cut that is going to happen to public hospitals. As we also know, public hospitals are going to suffer massive cuts as a result of specific purpose payments and other cuts.</PARA>

They offer the highest quality of service to our local community and, of course, to the whole of Melbourne, Victoria and many international patients. The Repatriation hospital, as it was, provided exemplary service and care to generations of veterans, while the Austin, as well as providing public hospital care to the local community, has gained international repute for the standard of its care, particularly for those with spinal injuries. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor, when in government federally, was totally committed to a first&hyphen;class public hospital system. Let us just look at some of the figures that demonstrate that, figures that call into question the comments of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) in question time today. What happened during the last three years of the Kennett government is that the Kennett government cut its share of public hospital funding by $275 million. While he was doing that, Labor federally actually put in $207 million. The Minister for Health and Family Services might try to say that that was money meant for the repatriation patients. In fact, another $130 million was paid to Victoria for repatriation patients but, as you can see from the letter from my constituent, that money is not going to give veterans the priority they were promised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can also see that the same thing is happening in other states. In South Australia and Western Australia the same problem has occurred. The Premiers of both of those states have taken money out of their public hospitals while, at the same time, Labor was trying to put money in. These trends are very disturbing, particularly, as I say, when we look at the other cuts that exist in this area of health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at what has been described as the most callous cut of all to health programs in this budget&mdash;the complete abolition of the Commonwealth dental program. I happen to know a little bit about the Commonwealth dental program. It is not the case, as members opposite have suggested, that the Labor government when in power just dreamt this up at the last minute. I was, in fact, the director of the national health strategy that was responsible for the development of this policy. It was developed in close consultation with the Australian Dental Association and it was with the support of that association that Labor implemented this policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Far from being a last minute thing&mdash;which we have certainly seen plenty of in this budget&mdash;and far from being that sort of policy initiative, the Commonwealth dental program was a carefully thought out policy. It was a highly targeted policy and it has only been <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4612"> available to people with health care cards. It was not a generally available service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the implications of complete abolition of the Commonwealth dental program in Victoria. Before we had the Commonwealth dental policy there were 70,000 people getting treatment in Victoria and the waiting time at the local dental hospital was four years. Can you imagine having to wait for four years if you were in pain and in need of dental treatment? In 1996, with the Commonwealth dental program, 99,000 people were treated. It was a massive increase in the number of people treated and the waiting time was brought back to 12 months&mdash;still far too long. That is certainly not something that any of us would say was a reasonable waiting period and, therefore, a justification for getting rid of this program. Nobody should have to wait that long to get their teeth fixed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the Victorians projecting will happen to people needing dental care now that this scheme is abolished? By 1998, they estimate there will be 289,000 people waiting for dental treatment in Victoria. If that is not a very callous statement, just wait to hear for how long they estimate people would have to wait&mdash;11 years. What do those opposite say should happen in Victoria? They say, `The Victorian government should pick it up. This is not something for us. We shouldn't have to worry about dental treatment. This is a matter for the states.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the one hand, they say to the states, `You are going to have to take a cut of $1&half; billion.' Then they say, `While we are about it, we are going to give you a few extra responsibilities,' like complete responsibility for what, up until very recently, was an outstanding program&mdash;the Commonwealth dental program. So we are seeing a complete contradiction on the part of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just say one other thing on the dental program because this is another untruth that is being peddled around this House. The government is trying to say that the states did not keep up their end of the bargain while the Commonwealth dental program was coming into operation. That too, in fact, is not the case. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you take the Victorian government as an example&mdash;as my previous discussion on hospitals shows&mdash;they have not been too loose with the cash. What they did do in the dental area was provide an additional amount of money for dental care to enable adolescents to be treated as part of the school dental program&mdash;which they had not been before&mdash;and also to expand the denture program. So it is not the case in Victoria that the state government walked away from the school dental program, or walked away from dentures, or walked away from the state dental hospital. They did not do any of those things. As the figures show, what in fact happened was that a lot more people got treated as a result of this outstanding program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen this program abolished. We have seen $1&half; billion taken out of the states' budgets. Because health care is such a large part of the state expenditure, what we are going to see in Victoria is a massive increase in the length of time that people will have to wait for urgent care. We just saw those figures released in the last week. There are in fact increasing numbers of people now waiting for urgent care, but what we think is even worse than that is that people are put on trolleys and left for 15 hours or even longer waiting for an urgent hospital bed. That is not the sort of policy that we should be condoning. We on this side of the House absolutely condemn these cuts to the states' grants and call for them to be reversed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened closely to what the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) had to say in this debate on the States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill. She was talking about shining lights. My understanding is that the shining lights were dimmed by the Labor Party over the last 13 years that they have had to keep this country on an even keel. In 1983 they inherited a good, sound financial base. In 1996, we inherited a disaster.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Jagajaga said that the situation was outrageous, but who has been there for 13 years, with respect? You have not been there for 13 years, but your party has been in government for 13 years. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4613"> They have been at the wheel. They have been driving the bus and where has it taken us? It has taken us to a dead end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Jagajaga spoke a few moments ago about people waiting on dental lists for four years. I think it is disgraceful that you have to wait for four years if you have not got private medical cover. Who was responsible for that situation? The Labor Party. When you think of the massive debt that we have inherited, I believe the states have taken a very sensible approach and have accepted&mdash;even the Labor state has accepted&mdash;the financial arrangements for the next three financial years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In looking at general revenue assistance, information has been provided to me by the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) in his second reading speech and also by the Department of the Parliamentary Library and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS>. I must say the Parliamentary Library and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> certainly do provide very valuable information to honourable members, and I would hope that more honourable members would use it. To quote the section in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> which talks about general revenue assistance:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Special revenue assistance grants include the Medicare guarantee payment, special and transitional allowances for the Australian Capital Territory . . .</PARA>
<PARA>and the Northern Territory. Medicare guarantee payments are estimated to total $428 million in 1996-97. That is $188.4 million for Victoria and $240 million for New South Wales. This compares with a total of $413.9 million in 1995-96, which represented $182 million for Victoria and $231.9 million for New South Wales. Even after the drastic cuts that the states had to take to accommodate the black hole&mdash;the bankcard deficit left by the Keating government of some nearly $10.3 billion&mdash;the amounts by which the grants have been reduced are very minor in comparison to the general community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is a routine amendment to the act incorporating changes to arrangements as agreed in 1996 at the Premiers Conference and under the national competition policy reforms. In effect, the bill allows the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Commonwealth to recoup an amount of $619 million from the states and territories in 1996-97, $640 million in 1997-98 and $300 million in 1998-99 as a contribution to the Commonwealth's deficit reduction strategy, while effectively maintaining the underlying growth in the pool of financial assistance grants in real per capita terms. The contribution of each state and territory is on an equal per capita basis, that is, the population shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amounts were determined according to the forecast escalation parameters used at the time of the Premiers Conference in June 1996. They imply a growth in the financial assistance grants pool of four per cent per annum, which is combined population growth and inflation, over the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the Commonwealth has chosen to `lock in' these amounts regardless of the actual outcome for inflation and population growth. If the escalation factor for the pool comes in under four per cent per annum, then the states and territories will effectively lose out. If, however, the outcome for inflation and population growth combined is greater than four per cent per annum, then the states and territories will earn a small gain compared to the outcome if the amount of contribution was tied to the escalation factors applying to the pool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an incentive, therefore, for the Commonwealth to conduct its policies in such a way that inflation remains around its current levels, given that the population growth is relatively stable at around 1.1 per cent per annum. The bill ensures that the per capita relativities, as determined by the Commonwealth Grants Commission, along with the relevant state and territory populations, are used in formulating the distribution of the combined pool of financial assistance and hospital funding grants. It also provides for the payment of special revenue assistance to the territory of $10 million in 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some members may have been aware that during my first speech I inferred that the Northern Territory, in some instances, was able to get additional funds from the Commonwealth government for the special needs of the Northern Territory for providing services to isolated communities by way of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4614"> health, education and other things which are more expensive to provide in the territory than they would be in the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important that those funding levels out of special revenue assistance are still provided. In fact, I can remember that many years ago, when the special revenue system was first brought in, the Northern Territory government put a particular proposition to the Commonwealth government for a higher level of funding, especially in Aboriginal communities in terms of providing essential services for health, education and housing. Unfortunately, at that particular time the Commonwealth government did not accede to the request of the territory for that amount of funding for the provision of services. It is a bit of a pity. Going back seven or eight years, it was probably far cheaper to put infrastructure in place then than it is today. If that was done, there may have been a lot more housing and a few more schools in those remote areas. Today, in 1996 dollars, obviously it is going to be much more expensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The program as put by the Northern Territory government was rejected. In my speech yesterday on the appropriation bill, I did make some comment in relation to the funding that was going to be provided by the coalition for indigenous programs. I am happy to say that the money that is going to be put in by the coalition over the next four years is going to be more than the Labor Party put in over the previous four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that if the Commonwealth in 1987-88 had accepted that particular recommendation by the Northern Territory government for the provision of those essential services in those communities, some of those Aboriginal communities would be far better off today. As I said yesterday in my speech on the appropriation bill, in the last 13 years some of these communities have really gone backwards. It is a fact. When you go to some of these communities they say, `You are neglecting us.' In a real sense, funds are being made available over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1996-97 the coalition has been put under a lot of pressure in framing its budget&mdash;in taking a very hard stance through the ERC, in trying to provide a better direction for the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian community. They have had to take some hard decisions. We can look forward to the 1997-98 budget being not as tough and a bit more generous in terms of providing those essential services to remote communities. When I talk about essential services, I am hoping the states grants general purpose funding will be increased, especially to the Northern Territory, in the 1997-98 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will use the last few moments of my time setting out the main provisions of the bill. Item 1 of schedule 1 of the bill inserts a new section 12A in the States Grants (General Purposes) Act 1994, the principal act. This gives the Treasurer discretionary power to make competition policy payments to the states and territories for 1997-98. Item 2 of schedule 1 of the bill inserts a new section 15A in the principal act, which makes financial assistance grants to the states and territories for 1996-97 conditional on the payment of an amount of fiscal contribution; that is, towards the Commonwealth's deficit reduction program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Item 3 of schedule 1 of the bill inserts new schedules 3 and 4 in the principal act. Proposed schedule 3 sets out relativity factors for the states and territories for 1996-97. These are used in the determination of per capita grants. It also sets out the formula for determining the amounts of arterial road grants payable to the states and territories in 1996-97, and base assistance amounts for each state and territory for 1996-97 with respect to special revenue assistance grants. Proposed schedule 4 contains the formula for Commonwealth payments to the states and territories in 1997-98 for implementation of the national competition policy. The formula is based on an indexed amount divided by the states' and territories' population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth would not have had to take these drastic measures into consideration had it not been for the Beazley bankcard debt, the black hole, the deficit that has been left on the Australian community. The medicine taken by the states is certainly going to be hard for them, but I know that after the Premiers Conference they decided they would rather take that course of action than any <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4615"> other action the Commonwealth had proposed at that particular time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The possible closure or sell-off of the Australian National Railways Commission and the discussion on the sale of our airports has caused Tasmania to look hard at its transport systems this week. It has not helped that information that is vital for sensible decision making on Tasrail has been kept from decision makers and only let out by mistake.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to take up the issue of the Brew report, some of which was apparently released in error in Tasmania last week. It was of great concern to me to see a headline in newspapers that Tasrail will close because it is not viable. Figures from annual reports told that Tasrail was moving towards being self-supporting until that statement. It appears from the report now that Tasrail was forced into heavy loss&hyphen;making contracts against the wishes of the Australian National Railways Commission. It has been bearing a load of debts from the whole systems administration. The next bombshell was that the person who came in to relieve the retiring general manager of Tasrail has a contract for only six months. Even if there was a possibility of arguing that Tasrail is now very effective and can stand on its own feet if freed of debt, the governments do not want to know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both federal and state governments are after its closure, their excuse being that they do not think it is government business to be running railways. What nonsense! Maybe the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), during his current love affair with Europe, might just consider some of the European transport systems. Many of these train systems are government run and subsidised and can move thousands of people and tonnes of freight very effectively and very efficiently. The governments are subsidising the infrastructure, not the fares and running costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4616"> The biggest problem facing transport in Tasmania today is that the current state government has no idea about planning. There is no strategical transport system for Tasmania. We need to provide an integrated, multimodal transport system&mdash;flexible and adaptable&mdash;to deal efficiently with Tasmania's future transport needs in a changing environ ment. I believe that Bob Cotgrove's article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury </EMPHASIS>on 16 September is very important. He identifies that the difficulties faced by Tasrail are not unrelated to other transport means and should be looked at in a broader context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has never really been a strong effort to integrate services. The private and public bus systems do not meet. I think the only connection made in Tasmania is that a bus meets the ferry at Devonport. We now have a threat to the air travel should the airports go to the highest bidder rather than to a local consortium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both commuter and tourist passenger and freight movement should be developed in unison, if not incorporated together. I can only point to Norway, where they have incorporated a tourist trip in their daily freight and mail runs through the fjords. You start by train on a ratchet railway, collect a ferry for the water travel and then pick up a bus service at the other end. They are all well patronised and easily accessible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hobart is taking on trams again, but the river is barely touched in the south or the north. Air travel should be integrated with our other modes of transport. One advantage is that the local rail still has a strong competitive advantage over road transport for certain commodities such as logs, pulp, cement, coal, sulfuric acid, fertilisers and other low value bulk materials.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call upon the state government to set up a commission of inquiry as a matter of urgency so that all the ideas and concerns of the transport industry can be considered. The proposed update of the Callaghan report might be an appropriate vehicle because it is Commonwealth funded, as long as it can be completed in time and quickly. It would also help local entrepreneurs who are looking at the airports to come up with a profitable package. Tasmania needs a proper strategy to ensure that all transport modes can work together in a unit and that way Tasrail has a very good opportunity and a good chance of still being part of our transport system into the next century.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My adjournment address is prompted by the first speech delivered by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) last week in this chamber. There is a lot to admire about the honourable member: a single mother raising four children, running a family business in a tough economic climate and a fearless courage to speak out. These are characteristics normally found in my heroes and, in fact, the hallmarks of traditional liberalism. That, however, is where my admiration ends.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley has called for an immediate end to foreign aid, preferring instead to see the money spent on ourselves or, more specifically, on unemployment. Her understandable resentment of the more questionable aspects of Aboriginal funding leads her to deny a disadvantage in being an Australian Aborigine. A number of callers to my office think she is right. One went so far as to suggest in rather crude terms that, in contrast to the member for Oxley, I am seriously lacking in testosterone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I challenge those who subscribe to the view that we spend too much on Aborigines to go to Palm Island, Fitzroy Crossing, Aurukun or Docker River and then tell me you wish you had been born there. I would not consider myself privileged were I to be born into circumstances in which I would have only a one in three chance of living to the age of 65.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I took my son doorknocking&mdash;he is nine&mdash;in March for Red Cross. I told him that he would learn something important that day, and he did. A man in a three-storey mansion with two luxury cars in the drive gave us 50c and said, `No change.' An elderly woman, nursing her dying husband in what seemed to be a lifelong family home, offered $50 with the comment, `There is always someone whose needs are greater.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sometimes it is tempting to think that we ought to give up on foreign aid. Billions of dollars have been spent in the last 30 years. Economically, politically and ecologically things frequently seem worse, with famine, war and refugees. But remember though that the media highlights the bad news. My images of time spent in Kenya and Tanzania for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4617"> World Vision are of people not unlike the member for Oxley or anyone else in this parliament&mdash;people struggling to survive, but usually happy in giving of themselves to others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we become a people who no longer care about the world, it is then that we cease to be true human beings. One&hyphen;eighth of mankind, its aspirations and talents reside in Africa, so too lies the measure of this country as a nation of caring people. As members of the human race, we should not ever abandon those in need. Would we give up on drug rehabilitation, telling kids not to smoke or support for families? Of course we would not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have found in life that the strength of human beings and of nations can be measured in terms of the care, concern and compassion that they show to those who are most in need. Opinion pollsters seldom take their clipboards to the slums, the shacks, the shanty towns or the distant communities of Aboriginal Australia. But if they did, on behalf of the member for Oxley, or indeed for any one of us here, we would find that their aspirations are a little different from the people whom she and I represent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that money can be better spent. However, Fred Hollows, Weary Dunlop, John Simpson Kirkpatrick and other selfless icons of this country did not become so for the promotion of self-interested resentment. There is constant tension within all of us as individuals and as a society between on the one hand wanting for ourselves and for our own self-interest and on the other hand needing to know that we are doing what we believe to be right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My son will need much more testosterone than that of the member for Oxley to follow in the shoes of the Australian icons whom I mentioned. In the end, leadership is not about populism, and it is not about appealing to the primeval instinct in human beings to want for themselves; it is about trying to evoke in people a genuine enthusiasm to support things that are in the best long-term interests of others, the community and society. In that sense, I disagree vehemently with the things that were said by the member for Oxley.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in this adjournment debate tonight on the connection between the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Commission of Audit: report to the Commonwealth government</EMPHASIS>  and the implications of taking this National Commission of Audit approach, which directly interlinks with the philosophies of the coalition, for the future of the Commonwealth government of Australia. I will compare that with what we have had in the last 13 years under Labor and look at the future direction of the country as this philosophy is put into place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A key recommendation in the report of the National Commission of Audit was that the Commonwealth should hand over areas of responsibility to the states in so far as it is possible, therefore diminishing the Commonwealth's role. The argument was to stop the overlapping of services. Page 4 of the document says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where programs are transferred to the States and funded by way of untied financial assistance grants:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Commonwealth should seek the States' agreement to provide appropriate data for the collection and publication of national aggregate statistics on program output and outcome.</PARA>
<PARA>So the Commonwealth's role is simply to be a repository for the data collected by the states so that it can have an overview of the programs that are put back to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The states are given these programs at a discount. The next recommendation says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the funds transferred should be at a level of no more than 90 per cent of their total value reflecting the scope for rationalisation and savings by the States in reduced administration.</PARA>
<PARA>So the states would get Commonwealth government programs at only 90 per cent of the total dollar value of what it used to run the programs. For that 10 per cent cut for the extra work, the extra responsibility and the extra administration&mdash;simply because of the argument that the overlap is done away with&mdash;the states are given less and they are asked to do a great deal more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third key recommendation was this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> any national policy bodies that are retained should limit their activity to joint work on national coordination and strategic directions and the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4618"> development of standards, benchmarks and performance measures. They should not be involved in service delivery or approval of projects.</PARA>
<PARA>This last recommendation of the National Commission of Audit underlines the coalition's approach to what the Commonwealth government of Australia should be involved in. Not only should they hand over their current powers and their programs at a discount to the states but their sole role should be as data collectors and as people who provide development standards, benchmarks and performance measures. They should not provide any services and they should get out of the game completely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an implication here. Historically, the Commonwealth has undertaken program and service delivery in a range of areas to supplement the states, which have been incapable of providing adequate service provision to the people in their constituencies. It has cooperated with the states and with the local government to provide things that could otherwise not be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There probably is no better example of an innovative program passed through this House than the building better cities program, initiated by former Deputy Prime Minister Brian Howe. This program enabled local, state and federal governments to cooperate effectively in things that they could not have done on their own. In South Australia major projects have been put together and are now very successful. Most programs have been carried out by a Liberal government in cooperation with the federal government, and they could never have been done with the resources available to the state of South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Likewise, the Australian Technology Park at Redfern, Sydney, could never have been established without the cooperation of the New South Wales government in providing the land and the $11 million of building better cities funds for the basic infrastructure for the technology park, which is of world standard. As it is more fully established in the coming years&mdash;and it should be supported by further Commonwealth funding&mdash;it will the leading technology park in the world.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I would like to place on record my congratulations to all the members of the Australian Paralympic team which recently competed in Atlanta with such outstanding results. The Australian Paralympic team won 42 gold medals, 37 silver medals and 27 bronze medals&mdash;a total of 106.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The team finished second overall on the gold medal tally and have been welcomed back with parades throughout Australia where thousands of Australians turned out to show the paralympians how proud we are as a nation of these magnificent athletes. Whilst it is important to recognise the medal winners, the world record holders, the champions, I would today like to also recognise the athletes who competed, gave their best and proudly represented their country without winning a medal because they are, in my eyes, all champions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One such athlete is Ms Sue&hyphen;Ellen Lovett from Mudgee in New South Wales. She is a visually impaired equestrian athlete who has worked tirelessly throughout her life not only to continue to compete in equestrian events despite her rapidly failing vision but also to help others through the Riding for the Disabled Association and other groups and by undertaking many arduous endurance rides throughout Australia to help raise money for those less fortunate than herself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sue&hyphen;Ellen and many other members of the equestrian team were forced to use borrowed horses for their events and overcame many other difficulties to achieve their very credible results in Atlanta. Once again, congratulations and well done to each and every one of the 162 members of the Australian Paralympic team.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, in the few minutes I have tonight, I want to make a couple of other comments as well. I was raised in a family that always believed in giving everyone a fair go. Having been involved in many different sports with my family, I have always taught my children to be good sports. After all, it is the Australian way to be a good sport&mdash;that is, accept <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4619"> the final result, congratulate the winner and gracefully accept your defeat until the next game.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Politics is very much like sport. The opponents present themselves to the voters each three years, contest the election campaign, accept the will of the people and the victor becomes the member. At least, that is how it should happen but, obviously, some members on the other side do not believe in a fair go, a fair contest and the Australian way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 2 March, the Australian people passed judgment on the opposing teams and overwhelmingly showed that the Labor Party had lost the ball, knocked on too many times and basically had forgotten what the game was all about. In the seat of Lindsay, the workers, the families, the retired people and the small businesses all said, `Enough is enough.' They were sick and tired of the old, tired team dragging them down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For 14 years their member, Ross Free, took the people of western Sydney for granted and traditional Labor voters took the opportunity on 2 March to elect a new team to represent the seat of Lindsay. They elected vibrant, young, dynamic Jackie Kelly to be their member. Obviously, the Labor Party have not heard about a fair go or the Australian good sports.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every other member of this House knows, and their political party warned them, that you have to be eligible to stand for the House of Representatives before your party nominates you. In every other seat, the candidate did what the state party asked them to do, they did what their party wanted them to do, except in the electorate of Lindsay. The fact <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4620"> that the Liberal Party was at fault is proven by the fact that the High Court determined that the Liberal Party had to pay two&hyphen;thirds of the costs of the action. So if the Liberal Party is not at fault, why did the High Court end up saying you had to pay two&hyphen;thirds of the cost? That is the rebuttal that I would make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight, I rise to make some remarks about capital assistance for hostels&mdash;in particular, capital assistance for Rosemary Lodge, which is in Bateau Bay in my electorate. Rosemary Lodge has been established and funded by the Entrance&hyphen;Long Jetty RSL sub-branch. I would like to read a letter from Mr Peter Davies, the president of that sub&hyphen;branch. He writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Michael,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hardly a day goes by when Rosemary Lodge does not get an enquiry for permanent or respite accommodation. Currently our resident mix is 80% financially disadvantaged and while this does not provide for an operating profit, we feel that we are providing a necessary service and are willing to continue to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I know you are well aware of the need for more hostel and respite places required in this area and lets face it that need is growing on a daily basis throughout the Central Coast. Our Sub Branch is quite willing to allocate $700,000.00 toward the cost of building 14 more places and an additional respite room, however, without capital funding from either State or Federal coffers this project will remain a pipe dream.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Davies attached a letter from Wallace Mackinnon and Associates, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Peter,</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of the Federal Governments 1996/97&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the budget&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the proposed advertising of new Aged Care Places will take place in October 1996, but unfortunately, no longer will successful applicants be provided with any Capital Funding.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>What this correspondence indicates is that this government has decided that apparently there will be a reduction or complete elimination of capital funding from the federal government for the non&hyphen;profit sector hostels. This is an issue of great concern that I hope will attract some interest from members on both sides of this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many people who are disadvantaged living not just in my own electorate but <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> right across the country who rely on the `not for profit hostels' to provide them with basic accommodation. If the federal government is cutting out the capital funding that in the past has been available for charities, religious organisations and organisations like RSL sub&hyphen;branches to build hostels that do not require up-front capital payments, then I think that is something that, I would appeal to the government, should be reconsidered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same point needs to be made in the whole area of nursing home access. The government has decided that people will have to pay an up-front nursing home fee if they are new residents, and the government has said that if a person has not lived in their own home for two years they will be exempt. But the problem is: if you are the owner of a nursing home and you have one vacant bed, and one person says they can give you $26,000 in an up-front free, and the other person has been granted an exemption by the government, who are you going to allow as the resident in your nursing home? Of course you will go for the person who pays the up-front fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, the government is cutting back the capital funding available for disadvantaged people in hostels and nursing homes. Is it any wonder that there is a growing wave of opposition to this government's changes in aged care? And is it any wonder that the Australian people are calling on you to reconsider your decision to cut back funding for aged care? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak about community radio. However, at the outset I would like to commend the honourable member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) on his speech. I agree with every word and every line that he delivered in his speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, I am reminded of a story in relation to foreign aid that was delivered by Mr Harold Henderson, the former Director of World Vision. He was responding to the populist theme of `What's the point of giving money to people overseas? It never gets there, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4621"> so you don't give it.' The story goes something like this: if you are running through the desert with a pail of water for someone who is dying of thirst, the pail is leaking and, because of the run, it is spilling a bit and at the end of the journey there is a little bit of water left, do you pour it out onto the sand? Of course you do not; you give it to the person&mdash;and that is what it is really all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had an involvement for some years with community radio and I thoroughly endorse it&mdash;in particular, 4CRB on the Gold Coast and, more recently, Radio for the Print Handicapped, 4RPH. But one community radio enterprise that just cannot seem to get off the ground and that has been battling away for more than 20 years is Family Radio up in Brisbane. It from time to time is allowed to have test broadcasts but it simply cannot get a licence.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SK6">Mr TONY SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He was a disaster, as I am reminded. But the fact of the matter is that Family Radio has a very good profile in Brisbane. There is enormous support out there. I have received many letters from constituents in my electorate asking how much longer Family Radio will have to wait to get a licence. During temporary transmissions, usually of about 90 days, the estimated audience is of the order of 50,000 people, which is very substantial&mdash;and that estimate is probably conservative. The target audience is in the age group of early twenties to mid&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fifties, and there are some programs that appeal to other overlapping groups.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The goals of the radio station are quite laudable. They are: developing a profile that has wide community support and appeal; developing a high quality broadcasting service; providing support and encouragement to the family unit through education, information and entertainment from a Christian perspective; encouraging activities by the churches; providing facilities, including training and professional development of all personnel involved in Family Radio at all levels to obtain excellence in performance; and providing opportunities for media exposure for creative talent in this particular forum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history of Family Radio's attempts to gain recognition has been very disappointing, as I have indicated. It has broad support from all major Christian denominations. Archbishops of both the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches have participated in broadcasts, as have other denominational heads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Broadcasting Authority has already identified six available FM frequencies in Brisbane which could be allocated. There are no other aspirant community groups conducting temporary transmissions in Brisbane. As I have indicated, this is a viable organisation. It is not seeking government funding, as some of the radio stations that are presently on air have been doing and are continuing to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Family Radio is independent, it is viable and it is desperate to get a licence. It is seeking the support of many members in the Brisbane area from where the target audience is obtained. Having spoken to a number of members, I do not know of anyone who would oppose the application. I support fully the application for a licence by Family Radio, and I commend its tenure as an aspirant to the House.</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(10.18 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill. This bill will extend the time available for international education and training providers to become registered. Registration requires accreditation and approval by the respective state or territory where the agency operates. As well, it imposes financial conditions on private education providers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's commitment to international education commenced in the 1950s when numbers of Commonwealth students were educated under the Colombo Plan. The aim was to assist Commonwealth developing countries by training their future leaders. In those days there was no expectation or understanding that there was a two&hyphen;way benefit for the country. The education was expected to be of greatest assistance to those who were students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1970s, restrictions were placed on quotas of international student enrolments. In the 1980s, Britain, once the favoured destination for Commonwealth and other Southern Hemisphere students, introduced full cost recovery fees to their universities. In response to that, Australia's international student enrolments grew hugely and the country was seen as offering a low cost, high quality education in a stable and mostly welcoming society. Of course, this sudden influx of overseas students brought quite heated public debate about overcrowding in universities and the costs of educating these non&hyphen;Australian students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two significant reports came out in the mid&hyphen;1980s. The Golding report saw mutual advantage accruing to domestic and overseas students; it very much saw this as something important for our nation. The increase in international understanding and goodwill was seen as a very good outcome. The Jackson report took a more commercial view&mdash;that international education was a potentially significant export industry for Australia. So it advocated a free market approach to maximise returns for competing institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1986 we saw deregulation of the tertiary education sector. This allowed non&hyphen;residents to purchase education on a full fee&hyphen;paying basis in Australia. Under the federal government's national unified education policy, the number of tertiary education providers increased hugely. The response to deregulation saw the numbers of international students increase by over 100 per cent between 1980 and 1987, with most of these students coming from Asia or Oceania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that time there was ineffectual regulation and very little monitoring of parts of the industry&mdash;in particular, those that offered English language education and training. At the same time, student visas were often used to short&hyphen;circuit immigration procedures. This led, as most of us know, to a very damaging international education crisis. The reverberations of this disaster lasted for a very long time. In particular, Asian markets looked at our smaller private <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4623"> institutions as a high risk for their sons and daughters. Many were left with fees paid but no service offered, and they could get very little action from the government of the day for quite some time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I worked at the University of Melbourne as a manager of international development in the 1990s, when I was overseas I was often asked by parents whether it was all right to come and study under the ELICOS program in Australia. They were only too aware of friends and relations who had been damaged by fees paid and students left stranded in Australia. This bill is extremely important in that it seeks to ensure that all providers of education to international students have a quality offering and that they also have financial regulation in place so that such an embarrassing crisis can never occur again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia, we now recognise that our overseas students are of enormous benefit to our current and future situation as a nation situated in Asia. For example, our educational and professional development is enhanced when students in Australia mix with future business partners and professional partners, as the global expansion of our markets takes our next generation well beyond Australia's shores.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyone doing business today understands the significance of interpersonal networks that take time to develop. If Australian and non&hyphen;Australian students work together on courses for three to four years, friendships and networks can begin in their youth. That is of enormous significance and potential advantage as those two groups grow up and share their friendships into later life. That is also important for our cultural and diplomatic objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Education in Australia is known elsewhere in the world to be of a high quality. Some of our leading institutions have the most prestigious research institutions in the world. For us to offer places to students to share in the learning in those agencies is substantially appreciated by many families in Hong Kong, Singapore and mainland China.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also a form of development aid that we can offer to overseas nations, helping students to do courses in Australia which, when they go back to their own countries, will assist their nations to grow and develop. That is a very important part of our aid. Of course, the enhanced research outcomes that come from international education in Australia are good for both the research outcomes in themselves and for our international reputation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of these students coming to Australia, we also have substantial economic benefits. Overseas students in this country expend something like $1 billion a year on goods and services and some $700 million on course fees. The multiplier effect of their purchases in this country increases our domestic markets. It is an exceptionally good thing for our economy to have many more people within this nation buying goods and services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some 86 per cent of our students come from Asian countries. The majority of those&mdash;74 per cent&mdash;are enrolled in universities, but others are at TAFE colleges, secondary colleges, primary schools and English language intensive courses for overseas students&mdash;our ELICOS programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are clearly in a situation where the reputation of our educational offerings is what is most important as we compete with other nations in offering these educational services.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's reputation as a nation which offers high quality education and institutions in a very carefully regulated environment is extremely important as the parents and students choose where they will go. Therefore, this bill is of critical importance. It extends for several years the time that an institution may take to become registered. It is, without a doubt, one of the most important things we can do to safeguard the reputation of our nation for years to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I am very pleased to support this bill. I believe that, as overseas students receive an education here, or in Malaysia or Thailand where we have taken some of our campuses offshore, they may perhaps come back to Australia in years to come as business people or as people applying for full&hyphen;time residency. This will be significant for the Australian economy, for our culture and for our reputation as a nation that pulls its weight in the world. I commend this bill to honourable members.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, as members are aware, this is a very simple and very straightforward bill. It extends the operation of tuition assurance schemes for a further two years. These are excellent arrangements. Since their introduction in 1993, all students have received the tuition they have paid for or have been refunded their fees. As a result of these arrangements, the Commonwealth has not been called upon to provide financial support to students where a provider has been unable or unwilling to meet its commitments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So they are very good arrangements. They have the support of the educational industry. They have the wholehearted support of education providers. I am delighted to see that they have the support of the opposition as well as that of the government. I thank the shadow minister for his contribution to the debate, I thank members on both sides for their contributions to the debate, and I am delighted to know that the education industry is progressing so well in the electorates of honourable members.

<ELECTORATE> (Canning)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.30 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak to the government's Appropriation Bill (No. 1). The appropriations set the scene for a better future for Australia. As the Treasurer (Mr Costello) mentioned in his budget speech, the focus is on savings&mdash;savings for investment, sustainable growth and real jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first observation I would like to make is that this is a budget that has been welcomed by middle Australia. They know that this budget turns around the failures of the past and sets this country on track for the future. They know that we cannot live forever beyond our means on the bankcard with ever growing debt. Mainstream Australia understands that hard decisions have to be made and, more importantly, they expect a responsible government to do just that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition went to the election promising a better deal for families, for small businesses, for real jobs, for older Australians. As well as that, we promised improvements to our health care system and to fix this country's financial system. All of these things have been achieved in this budget. We have, indeed, delivered just that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take this opportunity to congratulate the Treasurer on the budget, a budget that is strong but fair. This government has fulfilled its major promises that we took to the Australian electorate in March this year. The Australian people will not forget that it was the previous Labor government, those members opposite, who took great pains to hide the true state of the nation's financial situation from the Australian people. The Labor government hid the fact that the budget outcome for the past year was a deficit of over $10 billion. Such financial dishonesty should never be inflicted on the Australian public again. Therefore, I applaud the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4627"> Treasurer for initiating the charter of budget honesty that will require a government to make the Australian people aware of the real state of the Treasury's books before they cast their vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The financial burden left by 13 years of Labor mismanagement is shared fairly by asking high income earners as well as business to make a contribution. This huge debt problem created by the previous Labor government could not be ignored by this new government, so we have taken the responsibility of fixing that problem, and the Australian people are backing us all the way. Let me refer to an opinion poll published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> magazine of 3 September 1996, conducted after the budget was handed down and when Australians had had a chance to digest its contents. Seventy&hyphen;seven per cent of respondents view the budget as average or better. Even 60 per cent of Labor's voters agree. This detailed Morgan poll shows the high level of trust the Australian people have in this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have honoured our major election commitments while achieving a major turnaround in the nation's finances. Our central election commitment was to Australia's families. One of our highest priorities as a government is to relieve the financial pressures on low and middle income families with children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In January this year, while I was campaigning in the seat that I now represent, I produced a report called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canning chasm</EMPHASIS>, which looked at the incomes of families in the electorate of Canning. The report was drawn from Australian Bureau of Statistics data outlining the inequality between families on different incomes in the south&hyphen;eastern suburbs of Perth. According to the ABS data, 14.5 per cent of families living in Canning were surviving on incomes of $16,000 or less. Meanwhile, 11 per cent were living on incomes of over $60,000 per annum. This showed the electorate of Canning to be an area that had a great disparity between families who were well&hyphen;off and those battlers who struggled daily to make ends meet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people I represent in Canning have told me time and time again, as I meet with them around the electorate, that they are very pleased with this budget. And these people represent middle Australia, the battlers to whom we promised a better deal in the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Canning also understand that our family tax initiative will really benefit them. This initiative will assist almost two million Australian families and recognises the financial sacrifices made by those families with young children where one parent stays at home. This will provide a great deal of additional assistance for families in my electorate of Canning, as I am sure it will also do to many other families in many other members' electorates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The family tax initiative, along with other budget initiatives such as the health insurance tax rebate, funding for marriage and relationship education and parenting education programs will all go a long way to helping these families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to that, there will also be an increase of $5 million a year for emergency relief funding to welfare agencies who help those families who are most in need. This will alleviate the pressure that the majority of Australian families have been feeling over recent years. Australians know our central election commitment was to look after families and we, I believe, have truly met that commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is also a budget that acknowledges the needs of women and issues such as child care and balancing work and family. Of course these concerns are not unique to women and there are many men who also juggle these commitments today. But women now represent 43 per cent of the paid work force and many women spend different periods of time in and out of the labour market mainly due to family concerns. Through this government's initiatives on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4628"> family tax measures, freeing up the industrial relations system, making superannuation easier and breaking new ground in marriage and family support, women will benefit greatly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition also campaigned to give Australians real jobs. This budget takes responsibility for getting employment on track again by helping small business to get back on its feet. Small business is the backbone of the Australian economy, and it is small business that employs the majority of Australians. I note with interest the report and an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 16 September 1996 reporting that Australia has lost the equivalent of $12 billion in export earnings, forgone partly because of our decline in competitiveness. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The previous Labor Government must take the blame for much of this problem. In its final years it has failed to drive forward with those micro&hyphen;economic reforms that could have made Australian businesses more flexible and competitive in export markets.</PARA>
<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  goes on to ask how the business sector can reach its full potential when, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is hobbled by a regulatory environment that impedes our international competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA>The newspaper also notes that the Howard government has already taken initiatives in this area and indeed we have. Our workplace reform legislation and our package of measures to help business will go a long way to strengthen this sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has already met its commitment to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor to 6 per cent. This means that small business is no longer assessed for provisional tax on income in excess of what it has earned. The capital gains tax rollover relief that was announced in the budget will allow small business to rollover their business assets without capital gains tax disincentive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government's industrial relation reforms currently before the parliament will rectify the job&hyphen;destroying unfair dismissal laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recently sent a small business survey to all small and large or medium sized businesses in my electorate of Canning, and there are approximately 3,000 of them. I asked them, `If you could fix any problem to help your business or create jobs what would it be?' The most common answer that I got was to fix the unfair dismissal laws brought in by the previous Labor government. Many other business owners also mentioned the fact that they would like to take on apprentices if it was made more feasible for them to do so. Therefore, one aspect that I am particularly pleased with is the apprenticeship scheme announced in this year's budget. The allocation of almost $260 million in incentive payments and wage subsidies will provide real jobs and a real future for young Australians. This government will deliver real jobs&mdash;not revolving door training programs which have left people, particularly our youth, despondent about their future and their worth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor, the number of apprenticeships dropped to its lowest level in 30 years. In government they favoured countless training programs with fancy names and not much else. They did not work and, unfortunately, many of the people who went through these schemes did not end up working either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned before, the coalition made it clear during the election campaign that one of its central priorities was to tackle Australia's high level of youth unemployment. I believe that the apprenticeship system has always been a tried and true method of getting young Australians into real jobs and I am pleased to see a return to this system.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4629">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget is about creating real jobs. We are not going to con the unemployed as Labor did. Their training schemes were, in the main, unsuccessful. Sadly, too many people ended up back where they started: unemployed and without a job. It was a cruel and callous hoax. This was a disgusting and totally irresponsible and immoral scam by the previous Labor government, the so&hyphen;called champion of the unemployed. This government is not going to use the unemployed as pawns in some gigantic chess game. We in the Howard coalition government have genuine compassion for the unemployed, and we are determined to provide a far better future for them. Let me quote an article published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> on April 6, 1996. Listen very carefully, on the other side. The article says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a growing body of research, economists have compared groups of unemployed people who enter government training schemes with similar groups who do not. In almost every case, these studies have found that the schemes have failed to improve either the earnings or the employment prospects of their clients. After surveying the results of various broadly based training programs for unemployed adults, the training&hyphen;friendly OECD was forced to conclude in 1994 that there is `remarkably meagre support for the hypothesis that such programs are effective.'</PARA>
<PARA>By easing the burden on small business, by introducing the modern Australian apprenticeship and traineeship scheme, by introducing employment placement enterprises, and by opening these enterprises up to the private sector, we will be creating real jobs for the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the first time in 13 years, the unemployed have real hope that they will be able to get a job. The article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> again says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of five Australian training programs studied during 1989&hyphen;92, only one could report&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>only one, mind you&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that at least half of its participants were either working or studying three months after completion.</PARA>
<PARA>Who was in power in 1989&hyphen;92? The members opposite: that is who was in power&mdash;the members opposite, who grew increasingly out of touch with reality and who had no real plan to fix the problem they had helped create.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our jobs pathway guarantee program will take school students and give them active work experience and the opportunity to take on apprenticeships or traineeships while still at school, to adequately prepare themselves to adapt to working life. Germany leads the world with this type of scheme, called the `dual&hyphen;education system'. Many German 16&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds sign an apprenticeship contract with local firms to work part&hyphen;time in training positions. The rest of the time, they go to a vocational school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These apprenticeships are not necessarily only for traditional trades or skilled jobs: they also include white&hyphen;collar and professional occupations. It is a company apprenticeship scheme that is tied to the educational system. When the apprentice/pupils finish, most get jobs either with their employer or, at the very least, in the field in which they had trained. This scheme works, just as the jobs pathway guarantee program will work, by allowing the education system and industry to work hand in hand to quickly respond to industry needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is committed to the youth of Australia. It is going to be a very difficult task to raise the standard of literacy and numeracy skills, which has been very much in decline in recent years in Australia. There is presently a new Western Australian designed program that is being piloted at East Maddington Primary School and at other schools in my electorate of Canning. Called `Reading for sure', the program was developed by Perth clinical psychologist Dr Julia Solomon, in an attempt to reduce anxiety in children who were afraid to read for fear of making mistakes in pronunciation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4630">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Solomon's research showed that it was necessary to produce a reading method which could capitalise on the consistent findings that children learnt to read by breaking up the sounds in words. The `Reading for sure' program has already been used in a number of Scottish schools, where it was used to train severely dyslexic students to read. Within 18 months of starting the `Reading for sure' program, most of these students, who had reading skills five years below average for their ages, had caught up to the same reading levels as their peers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mention this only because, if we raise a generation of people who have only the most basic reading and writing skills or who cannot even count without a calculator, and if we continue to have a generation like this, industry will not be able to advance. According to the same 6 April article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> that I quoted from earlier, a report released in January this year by Industry in Education, a British employers group, said that what they really needed was not more skills training but people who could actually address an envelope. I have spoken to Dr Kemp, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, about the `Reading for sure' program, and I will continue to lobby for funding for this and other numeracy and literacy skills programs after the budget, so that we can give our youth&mdash;and adults, for that matter&mdash;the most basic skills of being able to read, write and do arithmetic, so as to assist them to get jobs that will lead to a better future for themselves and for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to point again to the responses I received to the survey I recently sent out to small businesses. They strongly indicate their support for the measures put forth by this government and they particularly agree with our commitment to scrap Labor's unfair dismissal laws, so as to give small business a chance to employ people and to thrive again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I drive along the Albany Highway in my electorate of Canning and look at the new developments taking place there, I can see that business confidence has grown with the election of the Howard coalition government. Some very large businesses are expanding, promising higher employment and a much healthier local economy. New shopping complexes and factories are being built, whilst others are being enlarged. This confidence augurs well for the future. I have already stated that small business is Australia's largest employer. We need small businesses in our suburbs and our towns, not only to provide local amenities and facilities but also to provide opportunities and work for families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My remarks during this appropriation debate have been mainly concerned with the need for small business to succeed, the need for reducing our country's huge bankcard debt created by the previous Labor government and the need for a stable economy. Indeed, we cannot halve our social problems in this country if we cannot solve our fiscal problems. This budget goes a long way to solving our nation's economic ills. I look forward to Australia reaping the social benefits once our economy is back in shape.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The budget we are debating today in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) provides further evidence that the coalition government's policies and philosophy stem not from the homes, the workplaces, the communities or the lives of ordinary Australians but rather that they find their genesis amongst the pages of the driest of economic rationalist textbooks and theories. I have no doubt that is primarily from where the previous speaker, the member for Canning (Mrs Johnston), received her economic education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the time I have available today, I would like to highlight some of the ways that this budget impacts on the people of my electorate. Having driven along the Albany Highway this year and noted the similarities between the south&hyphen;eastern suburbs of Perth in the electorate of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4631"> Canning and those of my south&hyphen;eastern Melbourne electorate, in particular in the area of Cranbourne, I have no doubt that the two electorates would feel the impact of this budget in very similar ways. Cranbourne is the third fastest&hyphen;growing area in Australia and, like the electorate of Canning, could very much be described as typical of middle Australia. The government would no doubt have us believe that Cranbourne and like suburbs around the country were the beneficiaries of this budget, that it was aimed fairly and squarely at them and that they will, in the government's words, no doubt be better off because of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time that we had a fairly critical look at the glib rhetoric that emanates from the mouths of members of the government, especially in their submissions on this appropriation bill, and to that end I intend to turn to some informed Isaacs local commentary, to see what prospects the budget holds for the people of Cranbourne and, I am sure&mdash;by extrapolation&mdash;for the people of Canning living on streets that border the Albany Highway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Cranbourne District Commander of the Salvation Army, Mr Derek Linsell&mdash;who, I might add, was a willing host to the then opposition leader, John Howard, on 5 October last year in a detailed tour of the Salvation Army's jobskills facilities in Cranbourne&mdash;recently summed up rather succinctly the fear and despair that this budget places on the lives of ordinary Australians, the kind that the government claims to represent. In the 3 September edition of the Cranbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun</EMPHASIS> newspaper, Mr Linsell attacked both the Victorian and federal governments for putting the budget bottom line ahead of the needs of the poor. In that edition of the Cranbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun</EMPHASIS> Mr Linsell said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ultimately this strategy will come back and bite us on the rear end. We're all going to have to get used to 10 per cent of Australians being in an underclass, which will mean more crime, more vandalism and more poverty.</PARA>
<PARA>So much, I might add, for the fulfilment of the government's promises to assist the families of middle Australia, as claimed by the honourable member for Canning. Mr Linsell went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My concern is that we just don't seem to care for people. History shows us that this is not only bad economic policy, it is also bad social policy.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the same man who happily led John Howard by the arm around the Salvation Army facilities in Cranbourne late last year. He went on to describe how the situation in Cranbourne, in middle Australia, is deteriorating. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Six or seven people are coming to us every week for emergency housing. That demand has come from nowhere in the past couple of months and some homeless people are living in squats.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cranbourne is all about people achieving the great Australian dream of having a family and owning a house. Many people come here expecting to get on the housing ladder and find they can't.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Linsell went on to warn that Cranbourne was facing a welfare crisis which could push many recipients into a permanent underclass.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no doubt that we can all see worrying signs. We realise that we will always have poor people, to greater or lesser degrees. But the beauty of Australia over the last decade or more has been that we have put a safety net in place. The danger&mdash;and this view is shared by Mr Linsell&mdash;is that this safety net will simply disappear. I have no doubt that his fears are particularly well&hyphen;founded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget will do nothing for those in our community who are struggling to raise their families, run their businesses and achieve their goals in life. The family tax packages offer little because of the cuts that are being brought to bear, whether they be in the fields of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4632"> education or health. In fact, one of the great urban myths that is developing in this country is that the so&hyphen;called easing of unfair dismissal laws will be the great panacea for small businesses which have been the beneficiaries of a low inflation and low interest rate economic regime for several years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) so precisely put it in his address&hyphen;in&hyphen;reply to the budget:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The message of this budget is don't be sick; don't be old; don't expect to go to university; if you're unemployed, too bad; and if you're young and unemployed, forget it.</PARA>
<PARA>I think we should look at some of the impacts of this budget in more detail. I have made some brief mention of cuts to the health portfolio in this budget which targets private hospitals, pensioners and the disadvantaged through a massive reduction in public hospital funding, higher charges for prescriptions and reduced access to dental services. So much for this budget fulfilling the promises, hopes and dreams of middle Australia, as claimed by the member for Canning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget papers indicate that a further $320 million has been cut from grants to the states over the next four years. In addition to the sum of $600 million pro rata health reduction announced at the previous conference, this will dramatically increase hospital waiting lists for those who depend on public hospitals. Pensioners will have to pay an extra $100 million a year for drugs under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The cost of each script will increase to $3.20 without any compensating increase in the pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In perhaps one of the more pertinent issues, which has been the subject of complaints to my office in recent weeks, the betrayal of the least well off in our society is compounded by the abolition of the Commonwealth dental program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The news that the federal budget will end funding of the highly successful Commonwealth dental health program can only be described as callous and miserable. The Commonwealth dental health program was introduced by the previous Labor government in 1994 to assist the states to reduce severe inequality in dental health care in the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the program, dental health services were available to the holders of pensioner concessions, pensioner health benefits, health care and Commonwealth seniors cards. Some 4,736 health card holders were treated in the electorate of Isaacs alone last year, with nearly 200,000 people across my state of Victoria receiving some form of dental treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The providers of the dental care under this program in the electorate of Isaacs include the Berwickwide Community Health Service which provides both general and emergency dental care to residents of Cranbourne, Berwick and Packenham. It treated 1,389 patients from the town of Cranbourne alone last year, as well as the 528 patients it treated in&hyphen;house. The service also referred 861 cases to private dentists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, the Frankston Community Health Centre located in the seat of Dunkley provides general and emergency dental care to residents in the Mornington Peninsula and is likely to lose around a half a million dollars due to the budget cuts. It either treated or arranged treatment with private dentists for nearly 6,000 patients from surrounding areas last year. The centre has two dental surgeries and refers any work over its capacity to the approximately 35 locally operating private dentists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Chelsea Community Health Centre similarly provides general and emergency dental care to residents in the cities of Kingston and Bayside and treated 2,934 patients last year&mdash;a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4633"> 470 per cent increase over the number of patients it treated before federal funding was introduced. As well as those patients it treats in&hyphen;house, the centre also refers between 70 to 100 cases a month to local private dentists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer (Mr Costello), in his budget speech, justified the abolition of this much loved dental health program by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As waiting times for public dental health services have now been reduced, funding for the Commonwealth dental health program will cease.</PARA>
<PARA>It looks like the funding abolition will see the waiting lists of these centres blow out, far from being reduced in the future, from around 12 months currently to five years or longer, even for basic dental treatment, blowing the Treasurer's illogical and short&hyphen;sighted premise well and truly out of the water.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Patients from Isaacs in need of emergency dental work will be forced to travel into the dental hospital in the city or be forced to pay private dentists to have teeth extracted as the cheapest option available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The abolition of this program will no doubt be a tragedy as it enabled the less fortunate members of our community who previously received only the most basic of dental care or who missed out all together to receive the dental health care that they both need and deserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Leader of the Opposition said, it is hard to think of a more callous budget decision in the last decade or one that more clearly breaks the Prime Minister's commitment not to hurt the most vulnerable in our community. Again, so much for this budget fulfilling the promises of Australian middle-class families as submitted by the member for Canning in her speech in this place not a few moments ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The security and quality of life of older Australians have also been made much less certain by this year's budget. The decision to force those in need of nursing home care to find the money to pay an up&hyphen;front entry fee is an attack on people at a very vulnerable and a very fragile stage of their lives. As we all know, this entry fee will be something like $26,000 but could be as high as $88,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of the entry fee, nursing home residents who are not full pensioners will be charged nursing home fees of up to $34 per day, or some $12,000 per year. This fee is charged as soon as a person's income goes $1 above the pension free area. The many older Australians&mdash;there are many of them who live in Isaacs&mdash;who receive care at home via the home and community care program will be faced with much higher user fees for the first time as a result of this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I returned on the Friday of budget week to my electorate of Isaacs, one of the first functions that I attended on that day was the Longbeach schools district mid-project achievement celebration at the Mordialloc Primary School in the heart of Isaacs. The celebration might have been referred to better as a commemoration rather than a celebration because there was something bitterly ironic in the fact that such a function should take place only days after the federal budget spelt the end for the very program that was being celebrated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The function celebrated work carried out on 22 schools within the Longbeach schools district under the federal governments new work opportunities program&mdash;one of the programs claimed by the member for Canning to have fancy names and not much else. The work included the construction of rotundas, pergolas, amphitheatres, brick and concrete paving, outdoor furniture, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4634"> garden beds and general building maintenance at schools within the Longbeach district. To date, approximately 50 per cent of those works have been completed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to Mr David Turnbull, the project coordinator, participants of this project employed adults who were willing to take the first step on the road to employment. The skill and pride that they have demonstrated in the work they have completed is reflected in the high standard that has been achieved. I can attest to that high standard, having seen many examples of it in and around schools across the electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the government has decided to shut down over the next 15 months every significant locally run job program, such as new work opportunities, which have helped local people gain the skills, expertise and, most importantly, the self&hyphen;esteem and confidence required to take that all&hyphen;important first step back into the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other labour market programs to be abolished include jobskills, skillshare and jobclubs. Again, these are initiatives which have more than just fancy names. These are initiatives which make the less than confident in our society understand that they can go out there and get work if, through these programs, they are job ready.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the coalition government has gone back on its promise not to cut labour market programs which help unemployed people find these real jobs. These commonsense programs, such as new work opportunities, have been real success stories, getting people off the dole and providing them with skills and training, which make them attractive to employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 2 September edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Frankston Standard</EMPHASIS> newspaper provides us with yet another example of irony. The Liberal member for Dunkley (Mr Billson) is reported as praising the Mornington Peninsula jobsnet campaign for what he called its `meteoric rise' in the number of traineeship places available in the Frankston and Mornington areas. The honourable member rightly pointed out the importance of traineeships and the success of this particular program, which is a joint effort between local business, media and DEETYA, in getting more than half of the trainees into ongoing real jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The irony was provided some two pages later in the same edition of that newspaper in an article entitled `Jobs scheme future doubt'. The first paragraph of that article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Peninsula's successful and much praised job creation campaign, Jobsnet, has been cut adrift by the Federal Government.</PARA>
<PARA>Cut adrift&mdash;despite its worth being recognised by the member for Dunkley and despite receiving glowing praise from the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, when she visited us in relation to the same scheme only last month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a budget of $72,000 last financial year, jobsnet created 1,076 extra jobs in that 12 months, with over 280 young people now in permanent work as a result of this program. The Westernport Area Consultative Committee generously donated $15,000 to the program to see it through the coming years&mdash;more accurately, to see it through to the end of this year&mdash;but its long&hyphen;term prospects are in jeopardy. Given the Howard government's own predictions of little or no reduction in the unemployment rate in the foreseeable future, without effective labour programs such as skillshare, jobsnet and new work opportunities, the unemployed face a very bleak future indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could go on at some length to talk about cuts to legal aid. The pensioner legal aid centre has been the victim of significant cuts to the legal aid budget and no doubt will be devastated by cuts to its budget starting in financial year 1997&hyphen;98 of over $33 million&mdash;more than 20 per <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4635"> cent of what the Commonwealth spends on legal aid funding. Again, this will impact most savagely on the needy in our society, quite contrary to the submissions by members opposite during this appropriation bill debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was first elected to parliament I made a pledge to the constituents in Isaacs. That pledge was that I would hold this government accountable to meet the high standards set by previous governments and demanded by the people of Australia in ensuring that the principles of equity, of tolerance and of community which underpin our society are the parameters which guide and control our law makers and those whom we charge to enact those laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Along with my colleagues from the Labor Party who have spoken out against many of the provisions of this budget, I believe we have clearly demonstrated that it falls well short of the standards set by previous governments and that&mdash;far from being guided by the principles of equity, tolerance and community&mdash;the ideology behind this budget is that of the bottom line, an ideology which recognises the cost of everything but the value of nothing.</PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (Adelaide)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(11.08 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with pleasure that I rise today to speak in support of the budget measures announced by this government in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1996&hyphen;97. This is the first budget of the 38th parliament, and one which takes the first step in turning around the creeping sense of inevitability that was beginning to pervade Australia prior to the 2 March election. No longer must we resign ourselves to a declining standard of aged care, a shrinking small business sector, apathy about the macro&hyphen;economic environment and finding real jobs for Australia's long&hyphen;term and young unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a bold budget. Not prepared to put off the tough decisions and be content to tighten spending, this government has reaffirmed its commitment to economic responsibility and to providing Australians with real answers to the dilemmas caused by unemployment, public sector debt and a feeling of isolation within the mainstream in Australia towards the decision makers of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a firm but fair budget. It is also somewhat of an anticlimax for members on the other side of the House in light of the ridiculous claims that they made before the budget. Unfortunately, the scaremongering and exaggeration about the effects of the budget have continued, as has been so evident by the standard of debate from some of those on the opposite of the House. As the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> commented, rarely have Australians been presented with a happier anticlimax. It went on to say that there were actual advantages for families with children and for some couples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can we forget the scaremongering of 12 per cent cuts to universities, the reduction of the aged care pension and jobsearch allowances and the number of other untruths spread throughout Australia about the unknown content of the budget? As one newspaper announced, this budget is about priorities and pragmatism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It makes a priority of those vast sections of the Australian community forgotten and neglected by Labor and also makes a priority of the reduction in debt and deficit with fairness, with this government asking all sections of the Australian community to contribute. It is pragmatic because it does not avoid the challenge of reducing public sector debt, and it is pragmatic in the sense that it highlights the need for long&hyphen;term strategies to deal with Australia's chronic unemployment problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition has delivered, in the context of the economic mess left by Labor, a sound budget. This government, as has been made abundantly clear in this budget, is about fairness and sharing the burden to undo Labor's economic legacy. The `spend, spend, spend' mentality <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4636"> of Labor has allowed it, like some sugar daddy, to buy its way into Australian political folklore. It irresponsibly increased public spending to feed the ravenous hunger of special interest groups and has pursued a policy of trophy economics, of grand schemes and Keating's so&hyphen;called `big picture'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I put it to members in this Main Committee that the Commonwealth's ability to continue to provide quality services depends upon a reassessment of the level of public expenditure. To do otherwise would prove to be a far greater threat to the provision of quality services than this budget has been made out to be by the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor, Australia's economic sovereignty was placed in a perilous position, with our net foreign liabilities, as a proportion of GDP, the third worst in the industrialised world, ranking Australia 45th out of 49 countries in terms of external debt to exports. The uncontrolled spending spree has come to a very necessary end. The deficit, however, will remain an ever present reality. The government will have to work within the economic confines it has created. In true form, the Labor government, instead of contributing to repairing the economic mess that they created, accuses this government of ideologically driven cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If propriety is an ideology, if responsibility to the taxpayer of Australia is an ideology, and if fiscal restraint in light of this economic debt is an ideology, then I and my coalition colleagues stand guilty. I would argue, however, that far from ideology, this is a budget driven by common sense and pragmatism. A `spend, spend, spend' mentality cannot go on forever unabated and without direction or proper financing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget also returns the political momentum of this country back to those who Labor has for so long forgotten and neglected, as is so apparent from the attrition inflicted upon Labor on 2 March. Among their numbers were small businesses everywhere. Labor went into the 1996 election with nothing to offer small business. It is no understatement to say that the coalition has done more for small business in the last six months than Labor did in 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reduction of the tax uplift factor, changes to capital gains tax arrangements which will amount to a $150 million tax cut, the provision of information, consultation and support mechanisms, a reduction in red tape and better relations with the tax office and, most importantly, the scrapping of Labor's unfair dismissal laws are among the broad vision this government has for restoring some faith in a crucial sector of the Australian economy. As Max Walsh commented, the bottom line is that the budget is good for business and good for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrary to the lies circulated during the election and again in the lead&hyphen;up to budget night, the coalition will continue to index pensions at current rates. What a scandal for the ALP to circulate any information to the contrary to the 14,800 persons on the age pension in my electorate of Adelaide. The government has also eased the burden on self&hyphen;funded retirees, providing them with the same tax rebate as pensioners. Couples will now have a tax&hyphen;free joint income threshold of $19,850.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to health policy, the government has made up to $250 available to couples and at least $450 available to families to put towards private health insurance. This is a significant step towards undoing the outrageous negligence of private health in this country, which has seen levels of persons covered by private health insurance drop to just 34 per cent. The only way the health crisis can be averted in Australia is by coordinating the recovery of both public and private health sectors. You cannot do that with only one in three people in private health insurance, and Labor never had the answers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4637">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">High income earners will face an increased Medicare levy surcharge. That is right and proper. Again, this is a measure aimed at equity and at sharing the responsibilities of Labor's terrible legacy. In addition, there are important improvements to public health. Areas that have received particular attention are the national childhood immunisation program, the national diabetes action plan, maternal and child health, injury prevention, and life education centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Improvements in rural health include the setting up of a department of rural health in rural areas, with links to university medical schools; the Institution of John Flynn scholarships for medical students to give them greater exposure to country medical practice; and the provision of financial assistance to help improve locum arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government did not create the unemployment disaster in Australia, but we will take the long&hyphen;term responsibility and put into place measures that will reduce unemployment. Only a long&hyphen;term strategy will do justice to the nature and enormity of the unemployment problem in Australia, and the best and most genuine way of creating more employees is to create more employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already spoken of the many benefits to the small business sector, but I would like to add that initiatives like the $207 million apprenticeship scheme and the ongoing reduction of interest rates will improve the macro&hyphen;economic climate for employers, thus making them more confident about expansion and the increasing of staff numbers. Complemented by the government's intended reforms in the workplace, this is the only way that a long&hyphen;term recovery in employment figures can come about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures reveal the mind&hyphen;set of the government which is aimed at real solutions, even if the benefits will not be seen overnight. This is in direct contrast with those who are now in opposition who were intent on the bandaid measures and short&hyphen;term irresponsible strategies which were so convincingly rejected by the Australian public at the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all those people on newstart, for the 3,485 people on jobsearch and for the 178 people on the youth training allowance in Adelaide, this is the first good news they have received for some time. Again, putting some balance back into job training, this government has allocated $3.7 million in the next four years to rebuild the decimated apprenticeship and traineeship system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget does not pretend that the problems of long&hyphen;term and youth unemployment will be solved overnight, but it does provide real hope to our jobless and the end of the cruel and endless training merry&hyphen;go&hyphen;round that was the norm under Labor. These budget measures are about real job creation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The allocation of $20 million over two years to the Australian Taxation Office will boost investigation of the tax avoidance schemes of the super&hyphen;rich. This is simply another fair and equitable measure intended to ensure that all sections of the community contribute to restoring financial security for Australia's future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has also been made of the announcements of changes to the higher education portfolio. But let me take this opportunity to remind members that the coalition changes mean that students do not have to pay up&hyphen;front fees and will not be denied entry because of an inability to pay. They will be required to pay HECS only when they can best afford it as they recoup the financial and career rewards that the study they have undertaken brings to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The message sent out by the opposition parties in regard to full fee&hyphen;paying places has been particularly disappointing. Full fee places mean extra places at university over and above those <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4638"> that are funded by the Commonwealth. Overseas students have had the opportunity to buy places at Australian universities for years. Under access and equity principles, surely it is only fair that these opportunities be extended to Australian students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, has stated that the government is firmly committed to maintaining the level of benefits to eligible families which Austudy provides. At the same time, we want to send a strong message to the whole community that well&hyphen;off families with extensive assets and on high incomes will not be eligible to receive financial assistance via Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, an element of fairness has been added to the measures already in place. Not only has the coalition government set about undoing the mess left by Labor, but it has gone as far as possible to ensure that this situation never repeats itself. The charter of budget honesty will ensure that this shameful chapter in Australia's economic history is brought to an end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me remind members that last year the previous Labor government spent $10 billion of taxpayers' money to repay interest on government debt, both here and overseas. The public sector debt must be reduced in this country, and the Australian Labor Party should be honest enough to acknowledge this and to acknowledge its own culpability in creating this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Labor government taxed and it spent. Labor increased wholesale tax and petrol tax, introduced the FBT, raised the pension age for women to 65, introduced retrospective HECS changes, increased the Medicare levy and raised company tax. Despite this, Labor still managed to accumulate $69 billion in deficits over its last five years. As Terry McCrann has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the Budget we had to have&mdash;and self&hyphen;evidently never got and never would have got from the previous occupant of the Lodge.</PARA>
<PARA>Another commentator, Alan Wood, has stated frankly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor should apologise for its terrible failure as a financial manager and help Costello clean up the mess.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the most disastrous examples of Labor's mismanagement was the running into the ground of Australian National, in my own electorate at the Islington workshops and elsewhere around South Australia and Tasmania. In the 13 years, the number of employees of AN has declined from 10,500 to 2,500. Yet Labor now tries&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>There is some good news in the budget for the workers and their families at the Islington workshops and for the residents of my electorate who live nearby. Money is at last available to clean up the badly contaminated land there, and that was confirmed in the House yesterday by Minister Sharp. All this is in sharp contrast to the previous ministers for transport, Senator Bob Collins and the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton), who talked on this subject but never delivered.</PARA>
<PARA>As the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has also recently commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not want to condemn Australia to a high debt future, nor put at risk the reduction in interest rates</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the growth that will flow from it. That's the choice. There are no easy choices in relation to the Budget . . . If we don't do it now, future generations are going to have less choice than we had because they are not only going to be trying to pay for their own services out of their own taxes, they are going to be servicing the debts that we ran up on their behalf.</PARA>
<PARA>I endorse those comments. They encapsulate the position&mdash;that bind, if you like&mdash;in which the government finds itself. The coalition has introduced some tough measures, but they are for the future for us all, and to guarantee future Commonwealth credibility in financial matters and the Commonwealth's ability to provide quality services into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor created this mess and now wants to obstruct the very measures that will undo it. In regard to interest rates and business and consumer confidence, this is an especially irresponsible measure. Under Labor, home mortgage rates hit 17 per cent and business loans went over 20 per cent because Labor could not control its spending. As the Treasury secretary has stated, Australia will be `courting danger' by doing anything else but putting into place a sincere and genuine attempt to tackle government debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I read with some shock the comments by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) to the effect that the budget was an act of betrayal and the first step towards a new, unfair society. I have gone to some lengths to explain the many fair measures in this budget that give no small amount of attention to ensuring that all sections of the community contribute to undoing Labor's mess&mdash;the legacy of its betrayal of Australian taxpayers, the unemployed, the elderly and the battlers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In speaking on the budget, I cannot let the events that transpired on the eve of the budget go without comment. I was in the position to observe these events first&hyphen;hand for one and a half hours as I assisted those who sought to defend this place. Television coverage of the event did much to convey the violence that was apparent that afternoon, but television is a medium that does not easily capture in its entirety the mood that can be present during such an event. I can assure all those who think that the riots were sensationalised or over&hyphen;reported that the threat was very real and a pervading sense of fear hung heavily on all those who were present in the foyer that afternoon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take this opportunity to place on the record my admiration for the way the Federal Police handled that situation. They were calm under extreme provocation. Damages are now estimated at $300,000 and I hope that those responsible are made to pay. I know that there is extensive video film of the riots and some people have already been identified. One unionist from Adelaide, who authorised such charming election material as the message, `If you believe in religious freedom and human rights, put Worth last,' has been identified as being a ringleader.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I would like to address some of the issues raised during this debate by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). I would like to draw all members' attention to the fact that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4640"> the federal seat of Oxley is one in a desperate position. In many ways, it is a microcosm of Labor's mismanagement. The member for Oxley would do better to address the problems of unemployment and poverty in her electorate than to make overgeneralised attacks on our indigenous communities and bodies like the United Nations. What will negative campaigns do to alleviate the suffering experienced by her constituents?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen only this week the benefit of being part of the United Nations, with Australia sponsoring an anti&hyphen;nuclear testing agreement. This will prove beneficial for all Australians, including the constituents in Oxley. But the member would have us leave it. The member for Oxley refers to her research proving that indigenous Australians are better off than non&hyphen;indigenous Australians. I have already circulated to my parliamentary colleagues, in July of this year, my own arguments that reveal the shortcomings in her research.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak in opposition to this budget. In particular, I wish to raise the issue of Grayndler and the impact that this budget will have on my electorate. The people in my electorate have been hurt by this budget. They have been hurt because of the savage budget cuts inflicted on them by the new Howard&hyphen;Costello razor gang.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was at university the last time the coalition handed down a federal budget. At the time, I believed that the then Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, was a Thatcherite. In hindsight, he was positively dripping wet compared with his sidekick, the architect of the first razor gang, the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard promised during the election campaign that services to people in need would be maintained. He promised stability and he promised fairness. Obviously, these were not core promises, because what this budget delivers is cuts to services and instability for families across the country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Rubbish!</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="R36">Mr ALBANESE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say to the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson), in particular, that this budget probably does represent and deliver for people in St Ives, but their interests are not the same as those of the people in Marrickville.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from making savage and unnecessary cuts to the public sector, higher education, ATSIC and the ABC, what this budget does is to shave off funds from virtually all government sponsored service delivery programs, which will adversely affect people most in need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at my electorate. I stated earlier that the people I represent have been hurt by this budget. They are people who can least afford to be hurt. According to the 1991 census, 41.6 per cent of people in Grayndler were born overseas&mdash;the Australian average is only 22.3 per cent&mdash;and 47.8 per cent of people speak a language other than English at home. The Australian average is 15 per cent. By and large, the working people of Grayndler are wage and salary earners&mdash;88.8 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What effect has this coalition budget had on these people? First of all, the Medicare office in Marrickville Road has been earmarked for closure but, never fear, they are going to put a fax machine in the local pharmacy! It is a pity that this cannot be programmed to assist those residents whose first language is not English, and it is a pity that those who cannot afford to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4641"> wait for cheque refunds are going to be disadvantaged by this. I note also that there are no Medicare offices on the hit list to close in the seat of Bennelong or in the seat of Higgins.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the CES offices are closing. They have been marked off to close at Marrickville, Ashfield and Leichhardt. I guess if you cannot register for work you do not appear in the unemployment statistics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just a few doors down from my electorate office is Marrickville Skillshare. This is an organisation which has excelled in getting long-term unemployed people into real jobs. On average, 60 per cent of their clients go on to find long-term employment. Furthermore, Marrickville Skillshare has developed a specialist expertise for people from non&hyphen;English speaking backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is their reward for such conspicuous success? The minister responsible, Senator Vanstone, has decimated the Skillshare budget. Its staff numbers have been halved. This time last year Marrickville Skillshare was able to provide six months training and work experience for 45 adults and 42 youths in its brokered programs. Today, the brokered programs no longer operate. It is likely that for this financial year Marrickville Skillshare will be funded to assist 340 clients as opposed to the 800 that it assisted in the last financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labour market programs are the key to addressing the problem of unemployment in this country but all this government can see is the amount of money that can be saved by cutting them down to the bone. Even if you look beyond the rationalist response; even if you look beyond the human cost of unemployment then you will see that the economic cost is also massive because people, if they are not in jobs, are not paying taxation. Therefore, on the revenue side you lose money and on the expenditure side you are forced to continue to pay out social security rather than people gaining their income from employment. This is policy madness. It will lead to an increase in unemployment and it will also have a long-term negative economic effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moving a little further afield we come to the Marrickville region Adult Migrant English Service situated at Enmore. This time last year AMES was running 15 DEET funded English for Work courses. These courses are by and large taken by highly motivated, newly arrived migrants. The courses themselves are not for the faint&hyphen;hearted. There are three levels, each of which involves 20 hours of intensive English tuition over 20 weeks. Upon completion of English for Work III, students would be considered eligible for entry into TAFE vocational courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How many courses are currently running today at Enmore AMES? There are two! Last year there were 15, now there are two. Forget the shaving analogy of the budget I used earlier, this is slash and burn. Incidentally, AMES also runs adult migrant English program courses for the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs but from 1 October this year the concessional rate of $2,205 for the English education charge will be scrapped, which means that NESB migrants will have to pay the full charge of $4,405. On 1 January 1997 the charge will rise to $5,500. Currently, some 90 per cent of people who pay the charge are eligible for the concessional rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This cost recovery measure inflicts a further financial burden on the very people who can least afford it: new and potential migrants. This is another example of the government implementing an agenda which has played up to the racists in our community, which suggests that those in ethnic communities can go to the bottom of the pile. Perhaps when we see the Prime Minister show some leadership in speaking out against people such as Pauline Hanson <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4642"> he will have some credibility and the people on the other side of the table will have some credibility as well. Realistically, the only migrant groups unaffected by this charge, the only ones that have been left alone, are those from English speaking countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a lot of rhetoric also from those on the other side about the family. Increases in child-care fees are inevitable given the loss of operational subsidies for community based long day care centres. Families using these centres will be paying around $20 a week more for each child in care. My electorate has 16 community based long day care centres providing places for 756 children. This provides the opportunity for the parents of those 756 children to actively participate in the labour market and provides 252 workers at these centres with employment. All this productivity comes at a cost of only $820,275 in operational funding to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is peanuts, given the productive value that these parents have for our economy. Community based child care aims to provide affordable, quality care. The prime motive for private child&hyphen;care centres is making a profit. Therefore, it is community based child care that sets the standard in the marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This represents yet another broken promise by the new government. In a letter to the Australian Early Childhood Association, dated 28 February 1996, just days before the election, the then shadow spokesman for family services, Dr David Kemp, made a commitment to preserving the operational subsidies, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The policy also states our continuing support for the community&hyphen;based long day care sector, and we regard the operational subsidy as one of the key supports of that sector. The coalition has no plans whatever to change the operational subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a very clear commitment that has been broken by those opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess this is just another one of those non&hyphen;core promises. We had two sorts of promises. There were the ones that the new government kept. They were the core ones. All the rest were the non&hyphen;core promises. They do not really count. We will remember that and we will be reminding those opposite of it in the lead&hyphen;up to the next election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The so&hyphen;called family&hyphen;friendly tax initiative is also fundamentally flawed. A low income family who, by necessity, must have both parents working gets a tax break of only $1,000 per dependent child. Such a family may earn only $70,000 a year, or $35,000 each. However, a single income family can earn up to $65,000&mdash;which increases by $3,000 for each additional child&mdash;and get the $1,000 per child and an additional tax break of $2,500 if they have a child under five years. Therefore, a family with three young children, struggling on a combined income of $60,000 a year, gets a $3,000 increase in the tax&hyphen;free threshold. However, a single income family with three young children can earn $71,000 a year and get the $3,000 plus an additional $2,500 increase in the tax&hyphen;free threshold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The message is very clear. To women in middle&hyphen;class families, who can afford that, it is: stay at home. But to those on the lower end of the rung it is: bad luck. There is no equity in this decision. Let us face it: the only people this family tax initiative will assist is upper middle income earners who can afford to live on one income. Low income families, who by necessity must have both parents working, are, in effect, punished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These tax concessions, along with the cuts to the child&hyphen;care sector, are a transparent attempt to get women out of the work force. Women being forced to leave the work force provides a double bonus for the government. Firstly, their departure creates a job vacancy and, secondly, because they cannot afford to be in the work force, they do not register for work and therefore <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4643"> do not appear in the unemployment statistics. Is this the coalition's secret strategy for bringing unemployment numbers down?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, this budget is not making Australia the clever country. Another area where the people of Grayndler will be hurting is in changes to the higher education contribution scheme and Austudy. Understandably, most families are very keen to see their children succeed. This sentiment is especially strong in first&hyphen;generation Australian families, who by and large had very humble beginnings. I remind members that almost half the population of Grayndler was born overseas. One form of relief for these parents was that independent Austudy became available to many students at the age of 21. To raise this to 25 years places an untenable burden on many families. Furthermore, lowering the income threshold for HECS repayments from $28,495 to $20,701 means that many graduates will find it very difficult to get ahead. As a result, they may need to rely upon the support of their parents even longer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The likely outcome of these changes is that children from lower income families will be forced to give up the dream of a tertiary education because their parents simply cannot afford it. But then, perhaps this is actually one of the aims of these changes. I can assure the Main Committee that, contrary to comments made by Senator Vanstone, not too many students from the inner west of Sydney will be paying their way into university in the `dumb but rich' category that is being implemented by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The privatisation and Americanisation of the Australian higher education system, whereby people from richer areas, from rich families, can buy their way into university, having not got the marks, is a disgrace&mdash;given, in particular, that they will have had advantages of going to the sorts of upper&hyphen;class private schools that some of the people opposite obviously went to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The elderly and the frail are not immune from the new, improved razor gang either. There is nothing like hitting people when they are down. The coalition government has withdrawn $88 million from its contribution to home and community care funding. And the government's proposed solution of the shortfall in funds? User pays, of course&mdash;user fees for meals on wheels, user fees for home visits, user fees for community transport, user fees for respite care, user fees for shopping support, user fees for home maintenance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These services allow the elderly and the disabled to remain in their homes with dignity. Without them they will be forced into nursing home care. But of course they cannot really do that, because once they apply to get into a nursing home, having had the choice of staying at home taken away from them, the government begins to impose an up&hyphen;front fee of an average of $26,000. This may not be a lot of money for people in Bradfield, but I can assure you that it is a lot for people in Grayndler and it is a prohibitive amount for vast numbers of elderly Australians and their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, thanks to the budget, people already living in nursing homes face increased fees. This will negatively affect almost 2,000 elderly people currently living in the 34 nursing homes in Grayndler. There are 1,954 people in my electorate who will be impacted by this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps one of the most unjust aspects of this government's cost&hyphen;cutting plans is the threat to the Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement. Funding for the next financial year may remain stable, but it is only while reforms are being worked out. It is clear, however, that these so-called reforms will lead to funding cuts of up to $500 million. The importance of public housing may be lost on the coalition government, but for hundreds of thousands of people across the country it is no exaggeration to say that it is a lifeline. Having grown up in public housing for the first 20 years of my life, I certainly can attest to that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4644">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's idea, in effect, is to abolish public and community housing, and to extend rent assistance to public and community housing tenants. In an area like the inner west of Sydney, the rental market is very tight and market rents are very high. You would be lucky to rent a bed&hyphen;sitter for less than $100 a week and an average three&hyphen;bedroom home would rarely be leased for less than $300 a week. Such a change would alter the whole character of inner city areas, where public housing has ensured that there is a mix of people of different backgrounds. Even with increased rental assistance, low income families will be severely disadvantaged by the loss of public and community housing. The effect of these changes is potentially devastating to low income families. But then it seems clear to me that when the Prime Minister and the Treasurer talk about family friendly initiatives they do not include lower income families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, this budget will increase inequality. It is a road which has been gone down before; it is a road which Margaret Thatcher went down in Britain, and Reagan and Bush went down in the United States. But it is a road which is being rejected all over the world. The UNDP's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Human Development</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Report</EMPHASIS>, which came out this week, when comparing economies throughout the world said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the key to East Asia's success was a relatively equal distribution of private and public assets. Countries there concentrate on redistributing not income but wealth. What generates income is productive wealth. A progressive redistribution of assets tends to boost growth because it has a broad positive effect on people's incentives.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>There is also a report by the OECD that came out in July 1996. This report concluded that growing inequality is far from conducive to growth. It admits the future prosperity of OECD countries depends on reducing social and economic exclusion in the forms of high unemployment, non&hyphen;participation in the labour market and, in some instances, growing inequalities in earnings and incomes. The World Bank has also put out a report suggesting that growing inequality is bad for economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would suggest that the results of this budget are very much going to be a reduction in economic growth, an increase in unemployment and an increase in inequality in our society. When you look at the labour market programs, where you have a strategy implemented to have labour market programs withdrawn, you also have changes to the social security system with massive proposed increases in penalties for people. If you do not turn up to a job interview, you can cop up to at least 13 weeks withdrawn social security payments. Some of the honourable members around this House should think about what they would do without 13 weeks of any payment. Those people have to get their money from somewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a `fair go' budget as the government would like us to believe. It is a `have a go' budget. Have a go at the elderly. Have a go at the unemployed. Have a go at low income families. Have a go at women. Have a go at students. And have a go at people least able to fight back. I urge the House to reject the measures in this budget.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I commence I would have to refute some of the nonsense that was just said by the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese). The best study on income distribution in Australia was done by Boyd Hunter and Bob Gregory from the Australian National University. Bob Gregory was a member of the Reserve Bank Board. From 1978 to 1991 the top five per cent of income earners in this country increased their average income by 23 per cent. The bottom five per cent reduced their average income by 22 per cent and, in fact, the people who were displaced most from the work force were <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4645"> women in low socioeconomic areas and blue-collar workers. This budget, amongst other things, actually does a great deal to try and reduce income disparity in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the period leading up to the March federal election I was asked by a number of people why I was in such a hurry. I replied that this election was occurring at a time when, in every sense, our country was at a turning point in its history. As such, I do not consider that the election was a cricket match to which we would return in three years time, nor was it a question of whether John Howard or Paul Keating would occupy the Lodge for the ensuing three years, but rather, the outcome of the election would see the economic and cultural destiny of Australia set for the next 30 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget represents the first of what will be a series of major changes in direction for Australia. In its broader sense, it heralds two fundamental shifts in the way that we see ourselves. The first is to set a three-year program to turn the deficit into surplus to stop indulging the present generation at the expense of our children. In returning expenditure to a level below that of income and consolidating this nation's capital base, we begin the long road back to funding social infrastructure from income rather than from the accumulation of further debt in the sale of assets including the acquisition of Australian companies by foreign interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second major change and arguably the greater change to be found in the budget papers is a cultural shift. Under the previous government, in particular, the expectation of what governments can and will provide had grown at an unsustainable rate. This budget represents the first instalment on rediscovering the forgotten ethic of those who can afford it being encouraged, if not expected, to care for themselves, whether that be in health, aged care or higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition parties, and the Labor Party in particular, cannot seem to make up their minds. On the one hand, the shadow Treasurer, suffering from relevance deprivation syndrome, certainly publicly, and I suspect also within the Labor Party, agrees to a three&hyphen;year strategy for deficit reduction, but on the other, thinks that $7.2 billion in savings should be obstructed. As Alan Wood, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on September 10, said, Labor seems intent `on extending its record of fiscal irresponsibility into opposition, aided and abetted by the Australian Democrats.'</PARA>
<PARA>For every billion dollars of budget savings blocked by the opposition, another billion dollars has to be raised on the international equity markets or through the sale of Australian assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In debating this budget, this parliament needs to put our circumstances into proper perspective. We have had external deficits in 28 of the last 30 budgets. Sixty&hyphen;nine billion dollars was accumulated in deficits by the previous government's last five budgets. Household savings at 2.5 per cent of disposable income are the lowest in the OECD and the lowest savings ratio in the developed world. We have a lack of savings, public and private, which has meant that growth approaching 3&half; to four per cent has required us to use monetary policy and increase interest rates to stop a balance of payments problem, with people who are left trying to manufacture in Australia having to borrow money offshore in order to support growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The use of our debt under the previous government to prop up consumption has exposed us to an exchange rate depreciation. Four per cent of our gross domestic product has been spent servicing debt and equity obligations. Net foreign debt approached 40 per cent of GDP and, under the previous government, debt reached a staggering 19 per cent of gross domestic product. If you then look at Eslake's work on social security payments, he found that, in 1970, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4646"> 18 per cent of Australians over the age of 15 were in receipt of some kind of social security payment. In 1995, 30 per cent of the people in this country over the age of 15 were in receipt of social security payments, and if you excluded unemployment benefits it was 24 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year we spent more on health, welfare and education than all of the money raised by taxes on income&mdash;and that is PAYE taxes paid by the attendants in this chamber and by people in blue&hyphen;collar areas, like that of the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) and the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), who are out there working today. I repeat: more money was spent on those three big&hyphen;ticket items than all of the money raised on taxes from income. The amount spent last year on health, education and welfare was $71.3 billion. In contrast, $65 billion was raised by taxes on PAYE income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot have it both ways. You cannot snuggle into bed with two to three per cent underlying growth, denying transport, communications and industrial relations reform on the one hand, and then, on the other, insist on free education, health and aged care. The Labor Party's history of opposition to serious tax reform completes a picture of disengaged unpreparedness for the realities this nation now faces. Little wonder the shadow Treasurer's accurate self&hyphen;diagnosis of relevancy deprivation syndrome! Let's hope it is not contagious&mdash;for the member for Port Adelaide at least.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget finally moves Australia in the right direction. In the 1995&hyphen;96 budget, the deficit, as we now know, was $10.5 billion. That is 2.1 per cent of GDP.</PARA>

What the member for Port Adelaide fails to appreciate is that in those other countries that have those levels of debt they also have high levels of growth, they have high levels of savings and they also have positive balance of payments. What this means to us, to everyday Australians, is a return to surplus, an effective long term improvement to national savings and to a deep&hyphen;seated balance of payments problem and, along with industrial relations reform, unshackling of the impediments to growth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other important aspect of the budget that needs emphasis is a charter of budget honesty. For the benefit of members on the other side, honesty means that you actually tell the truth, that you tell people what the facts are. The charter of budget honesty requires that the heads of the Department of Finance and Treasury will sign off on an economic and fiscal outlook within 10 days of the election being called. After the election is announced, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition can request costings of their announced policies by heads of the Departments of the Treasury and Finance. It requires annual updates on the government financial position and economic outlook. Every five years the government will have to publish an intergenerational report which assesses long term sustainability of its policies. It will require a fiscal strategy statement to be produced annually and, of course, we will move to accrual accounting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the effect of this budget on my own electorate, I have the privilege to represent the highest median income area in Australia and, in response to the nonsense to which we were <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4647"> just exposed from the honourable member from Grayndler, I can say that I have had a number of concerns in my electorate about the impact that this budget will have on higher income earners.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The survey was distributed to the households in my electorate and required those who responded to place it in an envelope, put a stamp on it and mail it back to me. I received 1,285 valid responses. There are another 60 people who did not identify themselves, and so I did not include them in the survey. The survey was made possible through funding provided by the members of the Liberal Party in my electorate; and for their hard work and sacrifice I am extremely grateful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When asked to specifically rank 12 listed national issues in order of greatest importance to them, 11.4 per cent of respondents nominated foreign debt as the highest priority; 10.9 per cent, taxation reform; and 10.3 per cent, health care financing reform. But analysis of the responses showed that there was a significant proportion of residents who considered&mdash;correctly, in my opinion&mdash;foreign debt, taxation reform, interest rates and unemployment to be issues where both the problem and the solution were interdependent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should also point out to the House that, whilst a code of ethics for parliamentarians rated a 12, a significant number of respondents explained that, although they were placing it last, in their opinion the ethical and professional behaviour of federal parliamentarians would be likely to substantially improve when the then Prime Minister finished his term. Question 4 invited respondents to nominate the single most important issue that I should address on their behalf, and 265 respondents rated economic productivity issues as the highest priority to them, followed by health, social services, social justice and youth unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also advise the House that, in analysing the more specific responses to this question, I was struck by the concerns shown by Bradfield residents not only for the economic indices, but also for a higher priority to be placed on what might be loosely described as social justice issues. Amongst these, permeating the survey was a concern for Aboriginal reconciliation, foreign aid, community service and the treatment of carers, the despair of young people, and what could be described as the compassionate manifestations of the elected government. Some of the calls that I have received in my office in the last few months have related, in fact, as much to those sorts of issues as they have to economic ones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most interesting part of the survey was the specific comments that people made. I have 160 pages of comments in my electorate office. I read every survey before it was collated into the computer, and I then listed five pages of specific comments from people in my electorate which reflected a cross section of their views and concerns. I will now highlight some of these <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4650"> responses, because I believe that they confirm that, in a general sense, the budget is moving in the direction in which my constituents would like to see us go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The following are quotes from my own constituents. `I feel powerless as I see Australia slipping downhill.' `. . . working for the good of Australia and Australians on a long&hyphen;term basis rather than on an ad hoc basis geared to the next general election.' `Population growth: do we need to grow? Can we sustain growth?' `The question that needs to be asked is: does Australia need multiculturalism? We are not being asked; we are being told that it is good for us. I question that.' `I have been disillusioned with the political process and its participants, short&hyphen;term perspectives and constant criticism of the opposition, irrespective of what is good for the country.' `No private enterprise could exist if managed the way this country has been in the last 20 years. Change it and make decisions.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other responses included the following. `Develop and rediscover hope in people's lives. Give incentives so that effort is rewarded and they can achieve their dreams.' `We desperately need support for small business: simplification of rules governing small business to encourage employment, and simpler tax for casual or part&hyphen;time workers. There are too many rules and regulations covering the simple exercise of doing a day's work.' `Unless we rectify economic issues first, the nation cannot afford to rectify quality of life issues'&mdash;and therein lies the fundamental difference between us and the opposition party. `Let's get the country back on a sound financial footing first. You cannot have quality of life in a sick economy.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The responses continued: `The issue I rank above all those listed is the increasingly inequitable income distribution in Australia, such that the rich are getting richer and the poor are becoming more numerous and poorer. We face a bleak future if this trend is not reversed.' `There should be a long&hyphen;term bipartisan plan for Australia, not three years stumbling from election to election.' `An economically strong Australia will benefit all its citizens.' `We are living beyond our means. We must cut spending under our present government.' `Introduce a GST&mdash;we are currently taxing all the things we are trying to encourage.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`The plight of our Aborigines is a national disgrace. It is embarrassing that so many Aboriginal people do not even have access to basic needs.' `Has Australia really become an Asian country? Where are we heading? Are we acceptable to the rest of Asia? How must our people change?' `Industrial relations: there must be a proper balance between capital and labour. Each must cooperate with the other and bloody&hyphen;mindedness exists on both sides. Our national future depends on cooperating effort.' `Make unemployed people work for the dole, for example helping in nursing homes, gardening for the aged and other community programs.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further responses included: `The problems facing self&hyphen;funded retirees are becoming overwhelming. We are treated almost with contempt. We urgently need tax relief, support with private health insurance and concessions available to government funded pensioners. Why is it that you work all your available years and are taxed, try to save and you are taxed, then retire because you have made an effort to save, do not get a pension and still get taxed?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`We have the tragedy of family break&hyphen;up due to the ease with which the young can obtain support from the government, and we parents are told that it is none of our business when we appeal for help. Amongst numerous families I know in this predicament, my own daughter left home at 15 years. She was at a private school&mdash;paid by us&mdash;but still managed to get Austudy on two occasions when stopped by us. In the three years away she has managed to live on welfare, jobsearch allowance, workers compensation&mdash;obtained after one week's work&mdash;and other handouts which she wastes on trivialities, including cigarettes and alcohol. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4651"> A group of them move from place to place and therefore do not pay any rent. It annoys us immensely that this child earns more than I do a week, as I work part time, have eight certificates and a degree. My husband is too busy trying to survive in business to tell you what he thinks. Do the best you can.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The responses continued: `The only way anyone will employ young people is if there is a youth wage.' `I wish to live in a just society with equal opportunities for all. It may surprise you that I do not mind paying taxes to bring this about.' `What a welcome relief for someone to ask my opinion.' `The total negativity of one political party to the other is appalling. The TV picture of abuse and name&hyphen;calling is so pathetic and we refuse to watch it. See if you can bring some decency and respect back into federal politics.' `The country has no hope, the way things are going.' `If you are going to pursue politics do it with passion and not platitudes. Make the tough decisions and not the politically expedient.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The responses included also: `Youth suicide: concentrate on the needs and welfare of our young men and women, particularly, and give them hope.' `Please oppose republicanism. We believe this overrides all the abovementioned issues.' That was a comment from a household of eight people aged 9 to 89. The next respondent said, `The republic: I will not vote Liberal because of the attitude to a republic. Liberal policy has to broaden its appeal.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So on it goes. These are people in my electorate expressing their own concerns, their own aspirations for Australia, and this was at a time immediately prior to the election. It was a time when we were labouring, if you like, under the previous government. Therein lie many of the reasons why there was a change of government and the reasons why the people wanted to see change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) yesterday described me as `the silvertail doctor'&mdash;I wish I were a silvertail&mdash;`from the Upper North Shore of Sydney'. But the aspirations and concerns of the people in my electorate are in many ways little different from those of the people in Grayndler or in Port Adelaide. They were desperately concerned about the way our country was going, and they really felt that, while there were many decent people in the previous government, the government in almost every sense had lost its way. To refute the idea that everyone that I represent is wealthy and affluent: I will never live in a three&hyphen;storey mansion, I will never own a Rolls Royce, but I will fight to the death for the right of any Australian, whether they live in Grayndler, or Bradfield, to believe that one day they might be able to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget is about those two things, as I said earlier. It is also about us stopping indulging ourselves. Of course, in many cases we would love to fund not only the things the opposition is concerned about but also much more; but we can only spend what we earn. Every time we spend more than we are earning, we are spending the future savings of our children, we are forcing people in the private sector to borrow money from overseas, and we are continuing the pressure to continually sell Australian assets. On this issue, by the way, of the electorate that I am privileged to represent, one respondent said to me, `Remember that there is an underclass on the North Shore and that we are hidden, but we are trying to live with dignity on social welfare.' I am very much aware of that fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the budget to the House. It is going to do two things. It will return us to the position we were in pre&hyphen;Whitlam, which is that our social infrastructure will be funded on income rather than on debt. It will, as I said before the election, also change the destiny of this country. We now have a Prime Minister who is like any one of us, an ordinary man, a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4652"> man who clearly is relating the decisions that he and the government make to the concerns and aspirations of people in my electorate and people in the electorate of Grayndler and of Port Adelaide. He is someone who is obviously taking into account what we think when he makes a decision on our behalf. Those of us who are privileged to be members of this government will do everything that we can to see that the voices of our constituents are being heard, whether we happen to agree with them or not. I commend the budget to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (Calare)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(12.07 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 1996 budget represents a continuation down the path of the downsizing of government involvement in the economy that has been at the heart of economic thinking in this country for more than a decade. However, this government has taken the credo a step further in what I believe are its misguided endeavours to balance the budget inside of two years. Let it not be forgotten: the so&hyphen;called $10 billion Beazley black hole is about one&hyphen;third of the Howard cosmic catastrophe left in 1983, yet that was brought back into balance, as indeed can this deficit be controlled more conservatively, and with less disruption, than this budget allows.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the desperate rush to win credit ratings from the money markets, we have slashed any meaningful commitment to many of the long&hyphen;term unemployed and to regional development, Aboriginal reconciliation, alternative energy development, and our national broadcaster. We have premised any environment commitment upon the sale of our greatest earning asset; which sale will provide, for the huge environment problems we face, less funding than has been provided in normal outlays in forward estimates in recent years. Middle Australia has been provided with a tax break, on the one hand, but has been asked, on the other hand, to fork out more for child care; while dental programs for the disadvantaged and elderly have been dismantled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First, let us examine the labour market programs. New employment placement enterprises will now be paid on the basis of their success in getting unemployed job seekers into sustained employment. While this new market driven labour program is attractive to free marketeers, the payment structure will, according to the budget papers, `be focussed on finding people jobs rather than placing them in training programs.' What a wonderful motherhood statement! Will this mean that the displaced power workers, the road workers, and the defence factory workers of the Lithgow district, for example, will be delivered into new jobs? Where, I ask, will these new jobs come from? The government has set no target on reducing unemployment, and most indications are that it will sit at around eight or nine per cent for the foreseeable future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So where, I ask&mdash;as we downsize Telstra even further by 23,000 jobs, as we become even more efficient for the sake of fewer and fewer&mdash;are these jobs that these entrepreneurs of the unemployment marketplace are to deliver? PEPEs, those private employment enterprise centres, look set to be the boom growth industry of the late 1990s. For what results? At a time when there are few jobs emerging in regional Australia, our government has chosen to slash back its commitment to regional development&mdash;surely the catalyst for growth and job generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To expect a balanced budget to deliver lower interest rates and then, by some magic, a growth in job investment, is pure fantasy. The transport and regional development sector of these budget papers is shameful. Apart from a commitment to maintain a bipartisan agreement on the Pacific Highway funding, nearly every category is a negative. That is a cut in regional commitment. Let me list just three of them: a $132 million reduction over four years in funding for the national rail infrastructure authority; a massive reduction in funding for the national highway system; and abolition of the regional development program which has been <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4653"> severely criticised by local government, farming, commercial and community groups around Australia. At a time when regional Australia is crying out for infrastructure assistance, this government is turning its back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the minister announced the RDOs were being cut, I said I looked forward to his commitment of projects of `real and lasting benefit to regional Australia.' Where are they? A political handout of $48 million has been provided, in such excruciatingly tight fiscal times, to the South Australian Liberal government for Adelaide airport. Let us analyse this. Given that Adelaide airport's performance is declining, how does this government find $48 million to extend what is one of the country's lowest ranked airports&mdash;being neither a major tourist destination nor having any significance as a freight airport&mdash;to link into south&hyphen;east or north Asia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Adelaide is primarily a domestic airport. In the financial year 1995&hyphen;96 it handled just 230,000 international passengers&mdash;just two per cent of the national total&mdash;while at 6,554 tonnes of airfreight exports in calendar year 1995 it barely exceeded three per cent of the national total. Yet this government has found $28 million this year, and a further $20 million next year, to fund Adelaide airport runway extensions. At a time when we need to be funding&mdash;and when both sides of politics promised&mdash;at least a feasibility study of a new freight airport at Parkes, this government has provided zero, zilch, nothing, to a project that potentially could deliver many hundreds of jobs and billions of export dollars from goods delivered efficiently to our markets to the north. It is difficult to see what benefits will flow to Australia from $48 million worth of Adelaide airport extensions&mdash;certainly not a huge leap in international passenger traffic or airfreight export from an airport ranked below Cairns in importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget has also sold out any real commitment to alternative energy research. The fledgling ethanol fuel industry, of which the Manildra group was a major player until budget night, has rightly challenged statements by energy minister Senator Parer who claims, `current production and use of fuel ethanol is not cost effective in reducing emissions of greenhouse gas and environmental pollutants.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The axing of the bounty, due to be in place until the year 2000, saved the government $21 million. That bounty has helped attract more than $40 million in private sector investment in viable production of fuel ethanol through the processing of feedstocks. The ethanol bounty scheme also provided $4 million for research and development of processes to produce ethanol from forest plantation thinnings, sawdust, crop stubble, cotton trash and biomass from urban waste, among others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That research and that 18c a litre bounty have been stopped dead in their tracks. Along with the government's refusal to endorse the greenhouse emission targets that the rest of the developed world demand, this decision displays a lack of environmental concern, policy that suits the petroleum industry, and a guarantee that if our economic direction may no longer be that of a banana republic&mdash;although I have doubts about that&mdash;our environmental record is certainly heading that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since World War II, government subsidies to the oil industry are estimated to be $2.9 billion. Against this is the $25 million under the ethanol bounty scheme, $3.9 million in associated research and development, and $2 million for a pilot ethanol program. Yet the Australian Institute of Petroleum complained that the bounty would give ethanol an unfair advantage. Major oil companies refuse to participate in the bounty scheme, but 100 independently owned <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4654"> service stations have been supplying ethanol blend fuel in Sydney and regional areas. The dark shadow of the oil giants lies right across this disgraceful budget decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such also are the environmental credentials of a government that wants to flog off our most valuable asset on the spurious grounds of setting up an environmental heritage trust, which could easily be funded by accessing that very Telstra dividend indefinitely. The Telstra sale is not about the environment; it is a continuation of the shameful disposal of our national assets begun by that champion of national sovereignty, Paul Keating, and embraced with passion by the Liberal Party. The National Party has tagged along with this economic lunacy, too timid to argue against, and now enmeshed in the sticky web of, downsizing and sell&hyphen;offs to explain to its bewildered and angry constituency why government and former government services and publicly owned enterprises are disappearing before their eyes. To dispose of Telstra, delivering $2.3 billion to its shareholders&mdash;the people of Australia&mdash;is short&hyphen;sighted economic vandalism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us turn to the elderly and how they may be treated by this budget. The changes to nursing home contributory funding&mdash;the shift of costs from government to the public&mdash;must be better explained to an older generation that has yet to be fully consulted about the implications for the family home, the inheritance that all older people want to hand on to their children. Such cashing&hyphen;up of assets to pay for nursing home accommodation also dramatically underlines the physical cut these elderly people must make from the life outside to that within an institution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Chances are that many families may choose to try and keep their frail elderly in their homes and try to provide less than professional caring. I hope there is no plan here to ease the demand for nursing home beds. The Thatcher government introduced a similar scheme&mdash;the cost was debited to the elderly patient's estate&mdash;that brought about a huge increase in home care, with disastrous social results, but delivering the desired cost shift from the government to the patient or their family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But having said that, I must report that one local community body in my electorate, the Yeoval Multipurpose Health Centre, containing as it does a nursing home, hostel and hospital, sees real benefits in obtaining such funding from local clients to enable maintenance and extensions and improving a facility for the benefit of local elderly people, who will, in fact, be investing in a community asset, ensuring its continued viability and caring for older people within their own district, rather than their being forced to seek nursing accommodation in some more distant town.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is perhaps one of the unintended and unsuspected positive outcomes of this new policy for more remote towns and communities. But it certainly needs widespread explanation and consultation before it is implemented, because there is a concerned sector of the elderly population in larger centres, such as Orange, Bathurst and Lithgow, who see this is an assets grab for little apparent return. Having paid taxes in the past to support aged care, they are now being asked to pay for their own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, while mentioning the Yeoval Multipurpose Health Centre, might I plead with the government to research this model of what smaller centre health care should be all about and to maintain federal commitment to the multipurpose centre biannual grant program. The Yeoval community have been successfully conducting their multipurpose health centre for seven years, and they firmly believe the concept is one that suits rural and remote areas. So do I.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4655">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout my electorate there is grave concern at the abolition of the dental health program, to save this government $55 million alone over the next 12 months and $112 million, $114 million and $116 million in each of the three years after that. The Minister for Health (Dr Wooldridge) said in the House that it was a very difficult decision, but cuts had to be made. He said that it was a program that had handled the backlog and was now to cease. Why, then, was there no money set aside for the years ahead? Do underprivileged and elderly people's teeth stop rotting now that the backlog has been met?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Orange, Cowra, Lithgow and Bathurst health districts, there is a six&hyphen;month waiting list for people to access the program. That was before the budget. Emergency care only is being offered from now on. Over 20 per cent of the population will now be denied this assistance; 74 per cent of dental health funds for the economically deprived have gone; four clinics in the region will close. It is a service for which there is no substitute except a dramatic decline in dental health care for disadvantaged young, adult and aged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth sought, and gained by referendum in 1946, the power to make laws for the provision of `hospital benefits, medical and dental services'. In his policy launch of 18 February this year, the Prime Minister vowed to `continue an effective social security net for the disadvantaged and needy and to maintain all current Commonwealth concessions' which includes dental concessions. Half a million people access this scheme. If it is discontinued there will be waiting lists three years long by 1998 and after that these people will be forced to have their teeth extracted. The state cannot pick up the huge funding shortfall to deliver these services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Changes to the higher education contribution scheme could also impact heavily on my electorate and rural Australians. While I have no great problem with a modest incremental increase in the contribution to tertiary education by its beneficiaries, the steepness of these increases will particularly hit remote and distance education students from institutes like the Orange Agricultural College.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of $4,800 or thereabouts for rural science and marketing degrees will prove too expensive for many rural students coming from somewhat depressed areas in the bush, trying to upgrade their skills in a rapidly increasing competitive agricultural marketplace. I have fears, too, that the dramatically increased HECS will turn many economically disadvantaged away from tertiary training generally, and their skills could be lost to the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I applaud the extension of the actual means test on Austudy to catch those rorting the system through manipulation of their taxable incomes. It is a patently unfair system which excludes many deserving students with honest parents while including children of families that have prodigious wealth. Why can't part of the savings in the higher education area be directed into more Commonwealth scholarships for the lower income groups, complete with living away from home allowances&mdash;a scheme that worked so well in the 1950s and 1960s and offered a transparently fair income tested access to university for thousands of young Australians? One thousand such scholarships for rural and remote area students is a start, but it must be multiplied twentyfold and offered to students right across the spectrum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who can pay should assist more; those who cannot must be assisted in far greater numbers than this budget provides. Otherwise, we will fail to tap the intellectual resources of young people trapped by the economic circumstances of their parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cutbacks to Aboriginal funding&mdash;the ATSIC slashes&mdash;have been well documented. This country has debated Aboriginal welfare for decades. We have patronised indigenous <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4656"> Australians for generations and only in the last decade has any semblance of self&hyphen;determination, apart from Wave Hill, emerged. Yet, at the start of so&hyphen;called reconciliation with the first Australians, we have buckled to impatience, ignorance and mischief at best, racism and deliberate community division at worst.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have pulled $400 million from Aboriginal programs. It is one thing to share the budget pain, it is another to devalue both funding and self&hyphen;determination. Our spending on Aboriginal programs&mdash;$1.5 billion out of $130 billion&mdash;is about 1.2 per cent of total outlays, less than the two per cent of the population that Aborigines represent. Let us get this funding priority in perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the extension of SBS to more regional areas is welcome, the 10 per cent cuts to the ABC in each of three financial years from 1997&hyphen;98 and the current thrust to further corporatise this great broadcaster represents an assault on our cultural infrastructure unrivalled in recent times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I search with hope in these budget papers for a sign of real commitment to regional Australia. I applaud the supermarket to Asia strategy to boost food exports, but I despair at the lack of commitment to any infrastructure designed to get food to those markets. I heard the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a carefully designed strategy to identify bottlenecks.</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that air freight transport&mdash;an exclusive air freight component and an exclusive air freight industry&mdash;is an obvious one needing direct support now and not another committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I applaud the $115 million funding boost to CSIRO. I applaud retention of the diesel rebate scheme provided that its rorts are attended to. I applaud exceptional drought circumstance funding continuing and rural adjustment funding. They are vital and obviously welcome. I applaud the fringe benefits tax exemptions and the capital gains rollover concessions&mdash;a boost to small business that will hopefully be supplemented by amendments to the unfair dismissal laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was pleased to see a $36 million road black spot funding program until I saw the $621 million cut in national highways spending over the next four budgets. A throwaway line on page 158 of the budget statements says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Funding for national highways has been reduced.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Well, $621 million is a devastating reduction in a country crying out for better roads as our arteries are hammered by heavy road freight that should be on rail. Sydney&hyphen;Melbourne rail freight, for example, has dropped from 50 per cent in 1972 to 20 per cent now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The green corps job scheme is welcome but will soak up but a minute fraction of the LEAP and other former labour market unemployed scheme participants who will not qualify for traineeships&mdash;perhaps 60 per cent of our unemployed. A one&hyphen;stop employment and social security service will be achieved through closure of CES offices in many areas with resulting net loss of jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The MAATS system of apprenticeship and traineeships is very welcome. But the cost of implementing it will be at the expense of programs for the most desperate unemployed. It seems that the gold medallists of the jobless market will be catered for but the long&hyphen;term unemployed will languish, too difficult to train, not potentially productive enough to attract the new bounty hunters of the labour market.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4657">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Medicare services will allegedly be improved by closing Medicare offices and asking chemists to take over this complex task complete with fax machines and 1&hyphen;800 lines for the old, the ill and the confused. In essence, this budget begins to balance the books. But it is too rigorous. In so doing, it creates an imbalance in our society that may well prove counterproductive, socially divisive and uneconomic, particularly for regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a time when we need vision and renewed commitment to publicly funded soft and hard infrastructure this budget takes it away. At a time when we need to support job generation in regional Australia this budget does very little. Australians expect a mix of public and private ownership and investment; a mix of private and public employment. By reducing its own spending so severely and relying on the market place to fill the void, by expecting struggling users to pay more by shifting costs to the states, this government and this budget risk contracting the economy of regional Australia even more.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak today on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1996&hyphen;97 on behalf of the people of McEwen; those families who have battled to make ends meet; the young people denied access to higher education or a job; the farmers who have survived drought and flood, volatile commodity prices and high production costs while competing in global markets; and small business people who have survived high interest rates, mounting compliance costs, unfair dismissal laws within a rigid labour market system and a tax system that actually penalised them for working hard and building up their businesses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I speak on behalf of all of these people who, for the first time in more than a decade, have an opportunity to break free from the legacy of disadvantage and dishonesty that has held them back and denied them opportunity. They know that we are entering a new era. This has been recognised by editorial comment throughout the country and is reflected in comments, like those of Terry McCrann, describing the budget as `arguably, the only honest budget in living memory'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People realise that as a government we have not tried to hide the facts. We have stated right up front what the real problem is&mdash;a huge deficit of $10.3 billion with a rising level of debt, including a rapidly rising level of Commonwealth government debt moving over the past six years from $17 billion to $96 billion, an increase of 464 per cent, as a result of policies introduced by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major task facing this government is to reduce that deficit and level of debt in the fairest possible way by providing measures to sustain growth and enable business to begin to thrive, while ensuring that those in real need in our communities are cared for. In order to achieve that, a substantial program of reform is needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is exactly what the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has delivered in the first budget of the Howard government&mdash;a program of reform to reduce the rising levels of deficit and debt. As the Treasurer said, although we did not create these problems, we have taken the responsibility of fixing them. This will be achieved largely through expenditure savings, some reduction in tax expenditure, and a crackdown on tax avoidance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hard decisions needed to begin the repair and reform of our economy are long overdue. People in my electorate are appreciative of the fact that this government is prepared to take strong measures but will do so in a way that is fair, balanced and responsible. There are no increases in income tax rates or company tax rates, nor are there any increases in wholesale tax or petrol excise. This budget offers hope and a revitalised future for our country.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4658">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the key areas this budget will address is the enormous problem of unemployment that we currently have as a direct result of both monetary and fiscal policies pursued by the previous Keating government. The facts about levels of unemployment are these: throughout the 13 years of Labor government, unemployment reached levels that we have not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much is being said by opposition members of late about unemployment targets. I am staggered that these people have the audacity to talk about numbers. Let us put these claims under closer scrutiny. Even though those levels of unemployment were high, they were not the true figure. We know that anyone who worked for a few hours a week was not counted as unemployed, and there were many thousands of people underemployed&mdash;working way below their level of qualification or getting only part&hyphen;time employment and no opportunity to start a career. On top of this, thousands of people were shunted from one training program to another, the only outcome being placement in yet another training program, but no job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition constantly refers to their Working Nation program as a success, but the reality is contained in a DEETYA report commissioned by the former government. This report found that Working Nation failed to assist the short&hyphen;term unemployed, that it neglected the newly long&hyphen;term unemployed, and above all, it found that labour market assistance had been changed from inexpensive programs with good outcomes to expensive programs with poor outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the height of hypocrisy for these people, who were responsible for such failed programs, to criticise our government&mdash;after only months in office&mdash;for the unemployment levels that they created. It is also hypocritical for the opposition now to be demanding targets for unemployment, when even the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said in 1993:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our commitment, as a government and as a nation, should not be any arbitrary unemployment number or rate. Our commitment must be to the reduction of unemployment as rapidly and as completely as possible.</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition knows in his heart that setting targets for unemployment is not the main responsibility of government; it is to actually tackle the causes of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition's claim that they could have achieved an unemployment rate of five per cent by the turn of the century is a fairytale. Setting targets does not create jobs. The reality of the situation is&mdash;the people of McEwen recognised this on 2 March&mdash;that Labor's policies over the past 13 years have been the cause of unemployment, not the cure for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us examine how the previous government destroyed people's chances of employment. They used monetary policy to create such a depressed economy, where small business&mdash;our major employer group&mdash;battled high interest rates and lack of consumer confidence. We saw record numbers of business bankruptcies. Those who managed to survive those conditions then had to contend with unfair dismissal laws which resulted in thousands of small businesses ending up in court. An unfair provisional tax uplift factor, high compliance costs and a mountain of paperwork all restricted the ability of small business to become more competitive, more productive and more profitable&mdash;the very ingredients needed for growth and jobs. This budget removes those impediments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An amount of $180 million will be delivered back to provisional taxpayers because this government has already honoured its commitment to reduce this uplift factor of six per cent. This means that we have ended Labor's unfair practice of assessing small business for provisional tax on an income in excess of what they have earned. We have introduced <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4659"> legislation to end the unfair dismissal laws of the previous government. Small business will once again begin to employ people because they will not be penalised for doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact of capital gains tax in small business has been a serious issue for a very long time. The previous government had the Beddall report on small business for six years but did nothing. That report recommended major changes to tax&mdash;including capital gains tax&mdash;on small business, but it sat and gathered dust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, this government has demonstrated its commitment to small business by introducing in this budget changes to capital gains tax, allowing profit to be rolled over in order to encourage small business to become bigger. It also allows those small business people&mdash;who have risked their capital, worked hard, supported themselves, provided employment for others and used their business both to provide a livelihood for themselves during their working life and to build up a nest egg for their retirement&mdash;to be exempt from capital gains tax up to a capital gain of $500,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget also provides encouragement for employee shares as a form of savings through more generous tax treatment. All of these measures are designed to get government off the back and out of the pocket of small business and allow them to thrive in a more flexible economic and labour market environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian electorate must be aware that the very people who, when in government, sat and did nothing to help small business employ more people are the same people who, in opposition, are crying crocodile tears about unemployment levels while preparing to vote against our measures of reform in this budget. In other words, they did precious little themselves while in 13 years of government and have now set a course of action to prevent this government from making the changes that they failed to make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were elected to tackle this problem. People said that they had had enough of being told that this was as good as it gets, when all around they were confronted with the reality. In country towns and suburban shopping centres there were vacant shops that had previously supported a family and provided local employment, factories forced to reduce shift numbers, and farms that could no longer afford to employ. There was a massive shift from productivity to dependency as the CES list grew and numbers of social security recipients grew. That is what this government inherited after 13 years of Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those in opposition, the very people responsible for that legacy, are now the ones opposing and criticising aspects of reform that we want to introduce to fix the mess they created. They lack all credibility. However, we will not be deterred. People elected us to implement reform, and this budget is the beginning of the repair process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget marks a turning point for both young and old Australians; for families, for small business in the country and in the cities. Thirty per cent of young people who drop out of school before year 12 have had no option in the past other than to join an unemployment queue. We will change that. This budget makes provision for $187 million for the development of vocational education in schools. This means that young people not suited to, or who do not want to, study at the tertiary level will now be able to begin an apprenticeship at school and get a chance of a career and a job. The Australian Secondary Principals' Association has welcome this initiative by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At long last there is a recognition that vocational education is important to secondary schools and has a crucial place in the secondary curriculum. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4660">  </PARA>
<PARA>Towards the end of the Keating government, the number of young people in apprenticeships had fallen to the lowest level as a proportion of the work force since the 1960s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget sets to repair this situation by appropriating $200 million over the next four years to modernise the apprenticeship system. There are new growth industries like information technology crying out for a highly skilled work force. By providing the funding and making the system more flexible to allow young people to work at multiple sites through group training means that we are providing a modern apprenticeship training system in tune not just with the 1990s but the next century. This gives hope and opens new pathways for young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget focuses on providing the best results through traineeships, apprenticeships and encouraging businesses to take on employees by providing wage subsidies. This budget, Mr Deputy Speaker, also acknowledges the struggle so many families have had in making ends meet over the past decade by providing assistance to approximately 2 million low and middle income families. Eligible parents will receive an increase of $1,000 to the tax&hyphen;free threshold. This means that a single income family with two children, with one under five, will receive an extra $34 a fortnight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has also honoured our election commitment to make private health insurance more affordable to low and middle income families by introducing in this budget a program of incentive payments. From 1 July next year eligible families with dependent children will be entitled to receive an incentive of up to $450 per year paid either as an up&hyphen;front reduction in their premiums or as a tax rebate. These two initiatives mean that eligible families with two dependent children who take out private health insurance will benefit by up to $51.90 a fortnight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have developed a comprehensive strengthening family strategy to help prevent and overcome family breakdowns. This strategy incorporates measures to support families in times of financial, social and emotional crisis, strengthen relationships and help prevent child abuse, youth suicide and youth homelessness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, families living in regional areas have undoubtedly been the hardest hit by the previous government&mdash;even to the extent of many of the farming families in the Seymour district of my electorate being denied access to drought relief. At a recent meeting of farming families from this region they readily acknowledged that they could do little to affect global commodity prices. What they want and have been trying to achieve throughout the Labor years of government is a reduction to their costs of production and to be able to operate in a more flexible labour market. They are sick to death of having to watch their products&mdash;which have been produced using the most cost&hyphen;effective means available to them&mdash;leave the farm gate and lose their competitive edge through the high costs of transport and fuel, and then face delays and further high costs on wharves due to inefficient work practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget recognises the importance of regional areas to our national economy and recognises the hardships and special needs of people living in these regions by providing extra assistance for education, health, child care, landcare and road funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister's announcement of the supermarket to Asia strategy is a tremendous boost to regional Australia. This not only recognises the advantage we have as well&hyphen; respected producers of clean, green produce from a disease&hyphen;free environment and our proximity to the Asian markets, but acknowledges the role regional Australia will play in the future <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4661"> development of value&hyphen;added products to an Asian food market estimated to be worth several hundred billions of dollars over the next decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This future development, however, and the jobs that will be created in the process are dependent on us as a nation being able to harness our natural resources, talent and technology to take advantage of prospective markets. This budget underpins our future success in these areas. Yet again we find an opposition ready to put this development at risk by opposing aspects of this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extension of the export market development grants for the tourist industry demonstrates a clear commitment by this government to encourage further development of this growing industry and highlights the inadequate response of the previous government to support this growth industry. Already there are tourist operators in my electorate eager to take advantage of this assistance and I can assure members of the opposition that they are watching very closely to see how they vote on this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned earlier the advantages Australia has in producing clean, green food&mdash;and how important this is to us as a trading nation. We have this reputation because of our clean environment. However, in order to maintain that reputation as well as repair degraded areas, improve our water quality and control weeds and feral animals so that we can increase our levels of production and maintain our marketing edge, we must spend money on restoration of the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget makes provision for an additional $158 million over the next four years. But this is in addition to the $1 billion Natural Heritage Trust from the one&hyphen;third privatisation of Telstra. Landcare groups in my electorate are already identifying areas in urgent need of repair that will benefit from this. There is $49 million to assist the states in expediting regional forest assessments in order to fulfil our commitment to implement the national forest policy statement. The central highlands of McEwen will benefit from this process. Once the NFPS is implemented, we will at long last have achieved a balance between protection of high conservation value areas and security for our timber industry, which in my area alone contributes almost $20 million to our national economy and over 600 jobs in the local area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young people between the ages of 17 to 20 throughout McEwen will have the opportunity to participate in Green Corps and demonstrate their support for preserving and maintaining the environment in a very practical way while gaining valuable work experience. It is imperative that this budget be passed as soon as possible to enable us to begin the job of repairing our nation and restoring opportunity to all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess it is not hard to realise why we have been left with such a huge task of repair when the opposition is still not able to face the cold hard facts. Just a few days ago the immediate past Treasurer made some statements that defied all credibility when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly, by the standards of comparable countries we do not have a budgetary problem, and we do not have a government debt problem.</PARA>
<PARA>One can only wonder what sort of planet the members of the opposition are occupying. What it does say, however, is that they are continuing to delude themselves, but at the expense of people in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget is an honest start to begin the long haul of reducing crippling levels of deficit and debt, and restoring confidence. Any attempt by opposition or minor parties to block aspects of this budget places this process at risk. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking in this budget debate, I want to canvass a number of areas in the budget that relate directly to science and research and development, because I think they are quite critical areas and it is very important that we should highlight what the government has done in this budget to these vital areas of our national infrastructure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, as a society we are inclined to take science a little bit for granted these days. Those members who are of my generation will recall that the first lunar landings merited almost a full day of television coverage. There was blanket coverage by the news media of the day, and most of the population was transfixed by the spectacle and gave it a great deal of their attention. Now, I am afraid, this kind of event rates but a few minutes on national television. Indeed, often these things are not covered at all in the United States or in this country because they no longer attract an audience share of comparable size.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This says a lot about the way in which our societies regard science, how they regard innovation and technological change. We live in an era of information overload. I am afraid the advances now come so quickly that the public are almost overcome by the rapidity of that change in the science and technology areas and are no longer able to differentiate it, to attune to it, in a way that they once did when the interval between progress and change was somewhat greater.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are dramatic effects of that in our economy  because those changes in society and technology do lend themselves to substantial gains to our economy, to health, to all of those areas of applied science which we take so much for granted in our everyday lives. But, unfortunately, they do create a climate where budgets can sometimes ignore the impact of these vital areas on our national infrastructure&mdash;and this is one such budget. I, for one, believe it is vital that the public are informed about what has occurred here and that the information about the impact of this budget on science and technology and engineering is brought to public attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget represents a very massive attack on innovation in this country. I think it is important to focus attention on the way in which it has attacked innovation in particular, because that is really what we are talking about. Fundamental research and development, whether it is in the pure or applied sciences or engineering disciplines, is vital to the process of innovation in our culture, and innovation is what leads to growth in national wealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout Australia's history we have relied on science, engineering and applied science to deliver the goods for our agriculture, mining, health and communications sectors&mdash;a wide range of our national infrastructure. It is on those things that we have accumulated wealth over the last 150&hyphen;plus years. Without science, without innovation, we would not have been able to achieve the national gains which we have made. It is vital, if we are to consolidate those gains, that budgets of government recognise, particularly at the national level, the vital importance of science, applied science, engineering and technology in delivering growth for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is critical to examine firstly the area of reductions in research and development expenditure. They are perhaps the most dramatic or the most obvious in the budget. Some $2.25 billion will be saved over the next four years by a combination of reducing the taxation concession available for research and development from 150 per cent to 125 per cent and by abolishing altogether the syndication package. There has been a very small introduction of new funding under the so&hyphen;called start program which will provide some additional funds for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4663"> research and development, but it is minimal when compared to the dramatic cut which the research and development tax concession has suffered and which the abolition of the syndication scheme has brought about. Those two schemes between them, in their own way, have been responsible for ensuring that Australian industry was brought into the research and development revolution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has always had a very strong background in public research and development. Our universities, CSIRO, ANSTO, AIMS&mdash;that whole range of public sector institutions&mdash;have always been at the forefront of world science research and development. Business, on the other hand, has never had quite such a strong commitment. In many cases, it has purchased research and development work from overseas, from parent companies or from other companies who have taken the technological lead. Or, alternatively, it has simply failed to undertake the necessary research and development to ensure that its product line was world's best practice, was at leading edge and was therefore able to grow with the world economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government introduced the very substantial tax concession at 150 per cent. It introduced the syndication scheme to address the questions of those companies who are, in effect, cash poor; they have no current profitability because they are committing so much of their funding as a start&hyphen;up company to research and development that they are not in the luxurious position of having to pay income tax which would, of course, mean generating a profit. So, by syndication, they are able to combine with those who do have taxable funds, profitable funds, and therefore have the opportunity to provide a cross&hyphen;fertilisation in the industrial and private sector to ensure that new start&hyphen;up entrepreneurial firms, vital for growth in the 21st century, are able to take advantage of the tax concessions available and are able to get some public assistance in their research investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is critical to have public assistance at the early stages of this process. I certainly do not believe that we should be providing public support, taxpayer support, to mature, well&hyphen;established companies who are able to generate sufficient funds for their own research and development over the longer term. But it is certainly vital that we provide initial start&hyphen;up capital and that this is freely available to those who want to engage in early research and development, to get their products started and off the ground&mdash;a very good way in which syndication was able to address it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For longer&hyphen;term research for the BHPs, the General Motors, the IBMs or whatever of this world&mdash;so long as that research is undertaken in Australia&mdash;the 150 per cent tax concession addressed their needs and certainly provided substantial encouragement for the board of directors to provide that funding. So combining those two schemes together creates a very good package. That was reflected in the increasing activity in the private sector research and development field that would have generated substantial gains to Australia in employment, in national wealth creation and in preserving our technological leadership in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have put all of that at risk by cutting the R&amp;D tax concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. We are now putting ourselves in the category of New Zealand, for example, where the tax concession was abolished and research and development has dropped dramatically. That is the kind of risk we take. People will compare us with our neighbours, Malaysia and Singapore, who offer 200 per cent concessions, perhaps under slightly more restrictive arrangements, Mr Deputy Speaker, but nonetheless under arrangements which are readily <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4664"> accessible to firms which can easily relocate in this region. I think therein lies a very significant risk to this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is undertaking a massive experiment in the research and development sector. If they are wrong, if that experiment demonstrates what I suggest it will, then Australia will be a very substantial loser. Research and development funding will go offshore; companies will be dissuaded from embarking on what is a very high&hyphen;risk undertaking; they will buy proven research from overseas; and Australia will return to those days when we did not enjoy a substantial lead in this area. I think that is the grave risk of this massive experiment which the government is now undertaking for very short&hyphen;term, financial expediency reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we turn to the other side of the research coin, which is the public sector agencies&mdash;CSIRO, ANSTO, AIMS, to name the most prominent three&mdash;then, of course, a different historical picture needs to be taken into account. These organisations, along with the universities, have always maintained a very substantial public research sector presence in Australia. They have a great track record. Indeed, all honourable members, I think, would be well aware and proud of the record which agencies like CSIRO have maintained on behalf of Australia over the years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So how has this government rewarded them? At first, I thought, `Very well.' The budget night speech of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) indicated, to quote him directly, `An additional $115 million will be provided to CSIRO.' My first thought was a very positive one, Mr Deputy Speaker, as I am sure it was for all honourable members. I thought, `What exciting science and research projects CSIRO will be able to undertake with this very massive additional amount of money which this government has provided them!' But, like so many other aspects of this budget, when you begin the examine the fine print, that is when the disasters are revealed. Of course, what the Treasurer did not tell us on budget night&mdash;and I suspect that it was a very substantial misleading of the House in that regard&mdash;was that the fine print in the budget will take millions of dollars out of CSIRO's available funding and, indeed, over a period of the next triennium and beyond, will leave them $10 million or so worse off than they were before the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How will this occur? It will occur by an increase particularly in the efficiency dividend which now applies to all CSIRO activities. Under the previous government there was a modest efficiency dividend on administration, which was defined as 30 per cent of CSIRO's activities&mdash;a very modest efficiency dividend in that regard, which encouraged more efficient administration. That has now been extended to three per cent and it has been extended to cover the whole of CSIRO's programmed activities. That is a very massive withdrawal of funding from CSIRO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How is the government going to recover the rest of its $115 million additional grant? A new efficiency dividend of asset realisation was introduced to ensure that CSIRO would be required to sell buildings, to vacate premises, to liquidate other assets, which will ensure that a total of some $60 million or thereabouts is also returned to government coffers during the course of the triennium, and along with a few other minor measures, realising a few million each, the government will, in fact, recoup more than its $115 million touted additional investment in CSIRO. This will leave our premier public sector research agency about $10 million worse off as a result of this budget over the course of the next triennium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the dividends which CSIRO has paid, not necessarily in immediate dollar terms, as this government now requires, but in public sector research terms. We have seen from that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4665"> organisation, over several generations now, the benefits transferred to industry in the patents taken out and in the innovative and often brilliant public sector research. And how has this government rewarded that organisation? It has withdrawn funds from it in a quite deceitful way, given the Treasurer's initial statement on budget night, which will cost this nation dearly over the next few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similar consequences apply to other public sector agencies, like ANSTO and AIMS, which are now subject to the full three per cent efficiency dividend. So, even though, on the surface of this budget it would appear that there was no immediate or dramatic cutback in those agencies, when you take into account the insidious impact of that three per cent efficiency dividend, they will also be left worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought it was a nice juxtaposition to see the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) in a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> interview the other Sunday morning announcing an increase in the AIMS project of a marine science and technology policy for Australia while cutting 20 staff positions out of the AIMS budget. The net effect will be that an organisation, which even the minister admits has a valuable role to play in helping Australia develop its offshore resources, ocean based resources and other freshwater resources in the fisheries and marine area, will now see its funding significantly cut, with some 20 positions, including eight within the scientific projects area, also going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a recent budget debate in the science community following the release of the August budget, the minister admitted that over the last six months he has spent so much time working out how to take money out of the science budget that he has not had time to develop a science policy or vision for this nation. So much of the vision that we saw before the election in terms of election commitments has been breached by this budget that I can understand why the minister now needs to prepare a fresh version of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> But I suspect that the community, and the scientific community in particular, will imply a vision for this minister in the absence of an articulated vision from him and that vision will be implied by the actions of this budget. We will have to conclude that his vision implies cuts, cuts and more cuts to public and private sector science.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the vision for science that we have seen from this government. It was demonstrated within weeks of their taking office when the European southern observatory project was summarily cancelled&mdash;again, for short&hyphen;term expediency in the budgetary sense but at a long&hyphen;term cost to the economic and technological development of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The information technology industry, to turn to another aspect of our science based portfolio, has also done very badly out of this budget. Although there is some prospect that large multinational companies will benefit from the outsourcing bonanza which we might reasonably expect in 12 or so months time when the next budget is being put into place&mdash;because I suspect that this government is heading towards that kind of outcome in next year's budget statement&mdash;again, that will be at the cost of our local Australian software suppliers and our hardware suppliers as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those small to medium companies which have taken a very significant lead in Australian information technology over the last few years will now find that, in this budget imposed drought in IT, they have no role to play. Whether they will be around next year to take advantage of the outsourcing opportunities which the government will offer, I very much doubt. I also doubt the value of those potential outsourcing opportunities.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4666">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a situation now where the government has failed to deliver&mdash;in a way, thank goodness&mdash;on its promise to cut $1 billion out of IT over the next three years. It has admitted that election promise was totally unrealistic and absurd. But instead it has imposed a freeze on significant IT expenditure which will not only hold back savings in government administration, improvements in efficiency, and service delivery to clients, but will also impose an intolerable burden on small and medium sized Australian computer information technology suppliers, software suppliers, who will now have one of their larger customers simply telling them to go away for at least 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think that is a realistic position for many small companies; they will simply go under. The multinationals will wait it out and they will be around next year to pick up the large contracts which, I suspect, this government will offer. But this imposed drought, if you like, I also suspect will have a very negative outcome for our service delivery possibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">IT now is one of those things that needs to be devolved in the power structure. We need to have individuals and departments making assessments about their own requirements and taking advantage of diversity within an overall framework. I understand that we cannot have anarchy prevailing here, but we certainly need to ensure that we capture the benefits of diversity and that we capture the benefits of innovation in client service delivery. Those are the things which we are in danger of losing in a government mandated whole&hyphen;of&hyphen;government approach which ensures that those outside government in the international computer companies are able to dominate our Australian industry in a way which is entirely at the cost of Australian companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majors&mdash;the EDSs, the IBMs and other like companies&mdash;have a valuable role to play in the provision of information technology services. I know a number of the people who operate in Australia on behalf of these companies. They provide a significant service to Australian business and to government, but their role must be clearly defined. It should not be to take over the whole of the operation; it should be to form strategic partnerships with departments where they have a special expertise and are able to offer something for the government to take. I suspect that this is an argument which we will be having next year, and will be a substantial one for this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I ask: how has this budget dealt with science? The answer is: very harshly, very unfairly. There is a range of matters that I have not had a chance to talk about. The increase in HECS fees for university students in the science and engineering disciplines will be a severe disadvantage. The massive cutbacks to universities as a whole will undermine our ability to delivery on research and development in the sciences and in the engineering fields. Those areas are quite significant, as are the government's cutbacks in international collaboration. Just to take one example, the program on global change is likely to suffer government cuts in this area, and that will undermine our international reputation as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Organisations like Telstra in mere anticipation of privatisation, are dramatically slashing their research activities. Those cuts in the Telstra research laboratories, for example, amount to 250 jobs in less than four years&mdash;almost half of their research effort. That is what they are doing while we think about privatisation, while the bill is still before the Senate. What happens were it ever, God forbid, to go through and Telstra actually were to be confronted with the reality of that situation? The whole of that research effort will also be undermined. Even small areas, like Internet access for members of parliament or the provision of these information technology <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4667"> services throughout the government, have been the subject of significant reductions in funding. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1996&hyphen;97. The people in the electorate of Swan knew this government was about to deliver change, a change for the better. They knew that, while delivering our commitments to ensuring that Australian families were given greater security and greater opportunity, we would have an overriding responsibility to reduce our national debt. They were sick and tired of living on the bankcard and sick and tired of this great country having to do the same. We had to reduce a deficit caused by years of overspending, when money was directed into bandaid measures rather than long&hyphen;term goals. The previous government were debt junkies who threw money at their problems and then had to find money to pay for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Swan knew that this government was going to change the way the health system and health insurance were administered. They knew that there would be changes in training and education. They knew that there would be changes to small business regulations. They knew that there would be industrial relations reforms. Superannuants were desperate for help and wanted to be treated as equals. Middle income families wanted relief from being underresourced and overtaxed. They wanted security for their and their children's futures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian people knew of plans to privatise one&hyphen;third of Telstra and of the National Heritage Trust which would begin the long overdue commitment to the environment of this nation. Most of all, Australians wanted the opportunity to pay their own way. They were tired of being on the end of handouts. The electorate of Swan&mdash;indeed, the people of Australia&mdash;knew that there would be these and many other changes. That is why this government clearly has a mandate to govern in a manner which demonstrates fiscal responsibility and prudent economic management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian people now want this Howard coalition government to get on with the job that they were elected for. This government inherited an enormous amount of debt, larger than the people of Australia were told by the former government. The $8 billion Beazley black hole was our first shock. Now we are informed that it is more than $10 billion. As part of this budgetary process, this government has committed itself to a charter of budget honesty so that we will see the real figures that a new government inherits rather than the dishonest figures displayed by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget encapsulates some of the necessary measures for debt reduction. Australians generally do not mind taking the pain if they can see that it is being done for some net gain. The previous Labor government told us to endure the pain and things would improve but we were deceived because things only got worse. The previous government deserted their blue&hyphen;collar supporters, who really needed their help at a time when the gap was widening more and more between the well off and the battlers. The net result was that the traditional blue&hyphen;collar supporters of the ALP voted with their feet on 2 March and supported this government in their droves because they realised that they had been taken for granted, taken for a ride.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget has been well received. The measures have had some criticism from the usual quarters but in Swan I generally have had a most favourable response. The electorate has indicated that they are willing to do their bit and learn to live with some sacrifice if it means a positive outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this budget is not only about cuts. There also have been increases in many areas and shifts of funds, which often go unnoticed&mdash;and unnoticed by the media, as I have had to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4668"> explain to those in Swan who sought clarification on points in the budget. The Australian people are looking at the long term rather than asking how this will affect them today. That is the reason that this budget has been so well received.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Swan, youth unemployment was up to 30 per cent. That one&hyphen;third of our youth was unemployed was totally unacceptable. At times, 12 per cent of the general population in Swan were unemployed; well above the state's average. This is a disgusting state of affairs in my electorate, given that the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) was in the best position to help these people as a former Minister for Employment, Education and Training, and then as the Deputy Prime Minister&mdash;but he did not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I kept hearing over and over again that the unemployed people&mdash;the youth and the older people who once upon a time had been able to find a job when they wanted&mdash;did not want to go from one training scheme to another and be caught in the bureaucratic labour market program cycle. They wished, at the end of their training, that they could find a job, a real job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The priority of the previous system of labour market programs was markedly different from that which we envisage for the future. Its priority often seemed to be its own administration rather than a focus on outcomes for clients. It was good at hiding the unemployed. The outcomes of these schemes were not fantastic. The numbers of people who found real jobs at the end of these training programs were not high enough to warrant the huge costs of their operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two&hyphen;thirds of the people who went through the Working Nation schemes are still out of work. Some participants of these programs would then go on to further training at another institution, such as a TAFE, and repeat what they had already learned. Clients were course hopping. One example is the number of forklift drivers who were turned out of these sorts of courses for a very limited number of actual opportunities to be forklift drivers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not to say that training schemes are unnecessary. Some of the labour market programs run in my electorate of Swan were very well run and had high outcomes. Let me make it clear that I support training, but by efficient, genuine programs that offer the prospect of real jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did witness duplication of services at some of the labour market programs in Swan. I saw at first hand the need for some cutbacks. Some courses being run by skillshare were also being offered at the TAFEs and at other tertiary institutions. Some of the courses offered by skillshare were not accredited courses and that made it difficult for some employers to accept clients because they did not have recognised qualifications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the next four years, the $5.4 million&hyphen;plus that the government has allocated to labour market and training assistance will help those in the labour market to seek employment in a more performance and output orientated program. I support the implementation of the modern Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system, better known as MAATS, which will be partly funded by a considered reduction in labour market program funds. MAATS is this government's response to the fact that in 1995 the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships, as a proportion of the total work force, was at its lowest level in three decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Labor government deserted the apprenticeship scheme, which has resulted in a dearth of skilled tradespeople. Industry is now feeling the effects. This is demonstrated by the fact that one company in Perth, for example, has had to bring in some specialist welders from the Philippines. Current apprenticeship and training schemes do not allow for the schemes <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4669"> to extend to farriers and blacksmiths, for example. These people, once qualified, have the potential to earn immediately from $60,000 to $100,000 a year in their particular trade, but at the moment most farriers are self&hyphen;taught and it is very hard to provide skilled training for these people because there are very few skilled people to train them. The previous system has failed these people by failing to train them properly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Too frequently in Swan I see the social ramifications of the years of not being able to find a job or be trained. I see the dysfunctional people who have lost their self&hyphen;esteem and ego and self&hyphen;respect. These effects last for years to come and not only permeate other areas of their lives but also often affect the other people in their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My electorate of Swan is the home of a large section of the West Australian racing industry. As much as there are apprenticeship schemes all around Australia which might have accommodated apprentice jockeys, these schemes have been largely ignored because of the lack of incentive and the lack of funding for quality trainers to take on the right sort of apprentice. The system now has done more to train strappers than potential jockeys. Under the modern Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system this has been corrected, and the right people are encouraged to find training. The new funding for MAATS will make it more attractive for the better trainers to take on these budding heroes of the future. Recently I attended a hospitality awards presentation for apprentices at the Ascot Racecourse, which is in Swan. The participants were working in the industry and they were delighted that this budget had provided new funding for MAATS of more than $200 million over four years. This will take the Commonwealth commitment for apprenticeships and traineeships to some $1.7 billion over four years, which is almost half of the $3.7 billion four&hyphen;year training package announced by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Minister Kemp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I passionately support the removal in our workplace reform package of the Brereton unfair dismissal laws, which have been the greatest disincentive to job opportunities for young people. Together with training reforms and small business reforms, employers will have the incentive which has been missing for so long and which has hurt business and employment in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An issue which has received support in my electorate has been the changes to the higher education system. Significantly, people welcome the fact that those who were likely to earn more at the completion of their degrees were going to contribute more personally than they did under the previous system. I know of only a few students who object to taking responsibility by contributing to their own education. In the last year, nearly half a million university places were filled across Australia and this simply could not have been done without the funds provided by HECS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also support the government's decision to speed up the payback of HECS debts by lowering the income threshold. I was asked by a lawn&hyphen;mowing contractor in Swan recently why his $24,000&hyphen;a&hyphen;year income had to pay for someone to be educated, while a graduate earning $24,000 in the first year or two did not have to pay any extra. I could not really answer this, because it was unfair and inequitable. Now, though, the minimum income threshold is $20,701, and this only attracts repayment of less than $12 per week, which will barely affect the lifestyles of future Australian graduates. Through the changes to the higher education system, this government has addressed yet another situation where those who could least afford to were subsidising higher income earners. Again, it has received the support of my electorate, which I am certain is indicative of other marginal seats in Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4670">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That leads me to comment on the health system and private health insurance. This government has made a genuine attempt to make the Australian health system universally available. The private health sector has run down from approximately 60 per cent of Australians being privately insured to the current deplorable state where only approximately 30 per cent are privately insured. The result is that there are fewer places in the public health system because those who could be privately insured do not have the incentive to stay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To address this, this budget delivers our pre&hyphen;election commitment that those who can afford to be privately insured will be encouraged to do so, and those who do not wish to be privately insured and who can afford to will pay more in the Medicare levy. This principle will free up hospital places and facilities for those who are genuinely in need and will have the effect of injecting more funds into our beleaguered health system, which has previously been stripped of this vital capital. Older Australians, families and the less well off can take comfort from such a decision because Medicare will certainly stay to service them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am happy to say that for the families of Australia, and the families in Swan in particular, this government has delivered on its commitment to ease the financial burden experienced by so many families. In particular, low and middle income families in Swan with an income of less than $70,000 per annum have welcomed the raising of the tax&hyphen;free threshold by $1,000 for each dependent child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The $6 million over the next three years to increase marriage and relationship education services to the community will contribute to assisting families to stay together. This government is serious when it says that the family is the cornerstone of our society, and we are providing genuine support in the form of these types of budget measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my honour to be in this Main Committee to endorse the first Howard&hyphen;Costello budget which delivers the pre&hyphen;election commitments to all Australians. Some tough decisions needed to be made in this budget so that our country can be returned to the status that it deserves in the world community. My belief is that the majority of my constituents in Swan understand and appreciate that these decisions needed to be taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, a government which cynically keeps an eye on the popular polls, rather than on those it is committed to serve, is really a government which lives on the edge and does not deserve the support of the people who placed their faith in it on 2 March. I commend this budget to the people of Swan and to the people of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, the greatest challenge for all governments in the industrialised world is to address two basic fundamentals: firstly, the fair distribution of income; and, secondly, the attainment of full employment. This budget does neither. This is a poll&hyphen;driven budget but without a coherent game plan. This is a budget without the vision thing. This is a budget with a flawed rationale. This is a budget that encourages processes that divide, exclude and ignore. This is a budget based on ill&hyphen;founded assumptions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberals say this budget is framed to overcome Australia's biggest problems of debt and deficit. The Liberals tell Australians that the Australian economy is somehow in deep, dire trouble as far as debt and deficit is concerned. What is the real truth about debt and deficit in Australia? According to the criteria of the European Monetary Union, Australia has the fourth lowest debt in the industrialised world. What about the deficit? Australia has the third lowest deficit in the industrialised world. That is the real truth.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4671">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor, Australia developed an economy that was internationally and widely accepted as one of integrity and quality. A couple of months ago the Australian economy was confirmed by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) as sound. So what is all this nonsense about a budget to deal with debt and deficit? This is an assumption that is clearly wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is also a government that says its WROLA bill, the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, will mean higher productivity which will lead to more employment. It is therefore worth examining that assumption. Over the past 50 years in the industrialised world the following has occurred: capital investment has quadrupled; energy consumption has tripled; productivity has tripled; but&mdash;and this is a very big but&mdash;employment has grown by only a third. Higher productivity does not lead to higher employment. The government is wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is also a government that believes in downsizing and that it leads to higher productivity and efficiency. It does not. Its guru, Stephen Roach, said so and has clearly rejected the benefits of downsizing. Corporations and business will not deliver full employment. Why would they? Downsizing does not produce higher productivity. It does increase the unfair distribution of income&mdash;the gap between rich and poor simply gets bigger with downsizing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, this is a budget based on flawed assumptions. The debt and deficit argument is wrong. The higher productivity&hyphen;higher unemployment link is wrong. The downsizing link to productivity is wrong. But the wrong&hyphen;headed thinking of the government continues. The supposed links of budget surpluses to interest rates is wrong. The claim that privatisation is better than a public sector is wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberals say that Labor's opposition to $425 million of the budget bottom line will risk rises in interest rates. Beg your pardon? Run that past me again. At the end of the 1980s, Labor was running budget surpluses and interest rates were 15 per cent. The Prime Minister's attempt to create a connection between interest rates and surpluses is clearly wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberals say that privatisation works better than the public sector, is more productive and gives greater dividends to consumers. Wrong, wrong, wrong. It is competition, not privatisation, that gives lower prices to consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor has never said, and does not say now, that our economy is not without problems. Obviously we have a national savings problem which we addressed with a superannuation scheme. There is also a current account deficit problem, to which curiously I have not heard one reference from the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor could have achieved a budget balance in the lifetime of this parliament, but without the savagery of this budget's cruelty to vulnerable Australians. The Liberals' budget strategy of taking nearly $8 billion out of the economy will contract growth and employment. And yes, the Liberals admitted it in the budget papers. They project no more than 3&half; per cent growth right through to the turn of the century. There is no target for growth, there is no target for employment. As I said, this budget has no game plan. This budget gives no direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberals have not got the faintest idea where they are going. And there is the sad irony: they do not know where they are going and there is a great likelihood they will end up somewhere else. The great pity of that scenario is that millions of Australians will be seriously harmed in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By contrast, Labor's budget strategy would have achieved a balance in 1998&hyphen;99. Labor would have had growth of 4 per cent over the next three or four years. Under Labor that would <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4672"> have meant more jobs; under Labor that would have meant more private income; under Labor that would have meant more savings; and under Labor that would have meant more government revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reasoning in the Liberal's budget is flawed. It is a blatant betrayal of the ordinary working people of this country, who will pay for this failure. The budget will do nothing for what the Prime Minister said before the March election was Australia's most pressing problem, that of unemployment. By the government's own admission, the budget will do nothing for unemployment at all. The government agrees there is no hope of a brighter outlook for the jobless in the foreseeable future. If this is their number one priority, then they have already admitted failure and broken their promise to Australia and to Australians. Of course, it is clear that, having attained government by claiming that they care about the unemployed and by claiming that they will continue to provide opportunities for people to retrain for the workplace, that priority has been quickly abandoned. It is just a bit of trickery, really&mdash;cruel trickery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No longer do you hear people on the government side saying that unemployment is the country's most pressing problem. These days they say the most pressing problem is the deficit. Before the election, they portrayed themselves as being compassionate, saying that they would frame their policies to create jobs. After winning government, though, what has happened? They have shed the costume and framed a cruel budget based on false assumptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has abandoned those who are looking for work and those who are facing redundancy for the deficit&mdash;the third lowest deficit in the industrialised world? So much for their care about the needs of people, about the plight of the unemployed. This budget completely abolishes $1.8 billion worth of job training and reskilling programs for those seeking work. It abandons all those who are looking for work, young and old, a decision that will deny 230,000 people the training and the skilling they need in order to get ready for the workplace. The truth is that creating jobs was not a priority in the framing of this budget; it was not even a factor. It has been shuffled a long way down the list of priorities, down as far as it has always been for conservative governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) said on television the other night that if unemployment does not come down then the government does not deserve to be re&hyphen;elected. But it has already demonstrated that it is not willing to formulate a budget designed to bring down unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget will actually make people sick. This budget ruins the quality of health care. There are direct cuts to health care. There are huge cuts in funding to the states, which means that the states will cut health funding. There is also evidence of the first steps in the dismantling of Medicare. Despite the government promising that its policies would not entail cuts to public hospitals, the budget does just that&mdash;lopping around $800 million off public hospital funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The abolition of the Commonwealth dental care program, which provided basic and emergency dental care to health card and Commonwealth seniors card holders, is a particularly mean and heartless act which will bring greater hardship to low income people and particularly the aged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberals promised to maintain Medicare in its entirety, but in their first budget the promise has already been betrayed. This budget reduces rebates for certain items and increases <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4673"> the maximum patient payment&mdash;signposts on the road to dismantlement of the most popular, most successful and fairest health care system this country has ever had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that is nothing too surprising. The Prime Minister has been a lifelong opponent of a fair and a decent health care system, and his squinty&hyphen;eyed protestations to the contrary during the election campaign can now be seen for what they were. The coalition also promised to maintain the Medicare levy at 1&half; per cent. That promise is broken. The budget contains a lot more broken promises, all of which will mean greater hardship for aged pensioners and other beneficiaries. For example, the coalition had promised to maintain the real value of rent assistance. That promise is broken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget increases the pharmaceutical benefits scheme co&hyphen;payment for all health card holders without offering any compensation whatsoever, which effectively cuts the real value of pensions and other benefits. The coalition promised to maintain the real value of pensions and benefits. That promise is broken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition promised not to force those eligible for the disability support pension onto unemployment or other benefits. That promise is broken. It promised to maintain a lump sum advance system. That promise is broken. It promised to introduce a pension bonus plan. That promise is broken. The list goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is easy to expect the Liberals to frame a budget which hits low income people and beneficiaries the hardest&mdash;they always do it. This budget, however, also attacks those on middle incomes: the middle Australia the Prime Minister wanted to feel relaxed and comfortable; the middle Australia the Prime Minister claimed had faired badly and deserved extra support. In fact, it is middle Australia who will feel the brunt of this government's ideological, zealous, irrational cost&hyphen;cutting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For families with incomes in the middle range, the small tax cuts offered will be more than countered by a whole raft of increased charges. For example, families will have to pay more for child care; they will have to pay more to give their children a decent education; they will have to pay more to have their elderly parents looked after in a nursing home; and they will have to pay more for hospital and medical care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take child care, for example. Those using community&hyphen;based child care will have to find an additional $14 a week. That alone is far more than what they will get with the tax cuts. In all, the government is taking $500 million out of child care and it is that amount that parents across the country will have to pay from their own pockets to make up the shortfall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the Prime Minister also wants the middle range family to pay for the nursing home care for their ageing parents. They may be asked to find $26,000 to buy them entry into a nursing home&mdash;maybe more&mdash;and then face the new daily fee of up to $34 a day. How will families on middle incomes afford these extra imposts? For those aged persons living in their own homes and utilising the range of services provided under Labor's home and community care program, higher user&hyphen;pay charges will apply. Again, it is their children and their families who will have to foot the bill&mdash;and add the increase to $20 per script for prescription drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But while middle Australia has been hit very hard, it is a budget which will bring perhaps the greatest hardship to older Australians. Firstly, they will be hit with the abolition of the dental health program and next by the failure of the government to adjust the deeming rate to reflect lower interest rates attainable by age pensioners on their savings without having to put their money at risk. The budget cuts the real incomes of age pensioners. And changes in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4674"> superannuation will unfairly deplete the retirement incomes of those people who retire or who are retrenched at 55 years of age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget will also bring hardship because of its failure to support business. The budget abolishes the research and development syndication, despite the coalition praising it before the election, and reduces the tax concession rate for research and development. These broken promises, along with cuts to a range of schemes and programs like Austrade and AusIndustry, will severely retard small to medium enterprises in their pursuit of innovation and excellence. Is this not the very thing this country needs to create employment and turn around our terms of trade?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are broken promises in almost every area of government administration most of which I have not even time to mention here. For example, the cuts in Aboriginal programs were a vicious, callous and totally unwarranted attack on some of the most vulnerable people in our community. Another example is the $1.4 billion to be paid by university students in payments and repayments of their course fees. Another broken promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who remember the Prime Minister when he was the former Liberal Treasurer do not find the broken promises surprising. Nothing has changed in the Prime Minister's head, but he has employed, I admit, better make&hyphen;over people. Other broken promises include: cuts to the environment, roads&mdash;$622 million&mdash;tourism, trade, the ABC, education, the arts, foreign aid, and on it goes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister made a big play in the lead&hyphen;up to the election about promising Australians a comfortable and a relaxed nation. That promise is broken. This budget will eventually make a lot of people in Australia very uncomfortable and very anxious while at the same time it will send this country intellectually to sleep.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget makes almost every sector of the Australian community pay more for the services they currently enjoy while completely abolishing other important services, typically those services which assist those most in need. The focus of the attack on those most in need was, however, predictable. Conservative governments compulsively attack those in need the hardest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what was even surprising to me, and not predictable, was the extent to which middle Australia will be made to pay for this budget. And pay they will, for everything from child care, to health care, to education for their children and nursing home care for their ageing parents. But the budget's big failure is a failure to steer the country, a failure to lead. This is the failure which follows inevitably from the failure of vision. This government has no vision for this country. It has no clear view of where it wants to go. This much we know from the budget. This is a budget steering us nowhere in particular. It is a dead hand&mdash;as Kim Beazley has said&mdash;on the national tiller.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Conservative governments do not lead. Instead, they hand over government to a particular stream of the bureaucracy, to the public servants from Treasury and Finance, who are just the captives of the financial markets. They do not make policy to drive Australia forward; they let their departments in Canberra shuffle the cards. They do not roll up their sleeves and work at the engine of government; they wash their hands of the responsibility of government. They put the country to sleep.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that respect, this budget returns Australia to the sleepwalking days of the 1950s and 1960s, and even the late 1970s&mdash;the era when opportunity passed this country by, the era when our national economic infrastructure developed the great structural faults which Labor has, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4675"> for the last 13 years, sought to mend. It was the era of the big, irresponsible conservative yawn. True to form, this is a budget which will send Australia to sleep. It is a budget devoid of vision and it is based on false assumptions. It is a product of ideological zealotry, of a frenzy of cost cutting for the wrong reasons, of a failure to reason and of a complete absence of compassion. It is a budget without the spine of commonsense evident in all sensible and responsible offerings. It is a budget that will take this country nowhere.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And it is a budget that will cause great hardship for most in our community&mdash;and the greatest hardship will have to be borne by those with the greatest need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget slashes billions of dollars out of government programs&mdash;and those billions of dollars are going to have to be found by ordinary working Australians. It is a complete fabrication for the government to argue that the hardship they are inflicting upon Australians with this budget is a harsh but necessary medicine. It is a medicine forced down the throat of a healthy economy, a cure for a non&hyphen;existent illness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real reason is simply ideological zealotry. They do not see a role for government in assisting people in our community who are in need. They do not see a role for leadership. They believe in a crass sort of individualism which, in their thinking, overrides any sense of collective responsibility for the country and the community we are building. They think that, if people are in need of government assistance, they have not worked hard enough. They submit to the fundamentally flawed idea that somebody's failure to get a job, or hold a job, is that person's own fault. You look at the budget papers and you think, `What is the matter with this word "unemployment"?' The old word processor got a bit of a blip, didn't it? You hardly see a mention of it anywhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Liberal government also commits itself to the fundamentally stupid idea that, if somebody gets sick, then it is their responsibility to be able to pay for the medical treatment they need. If they or their kids cannot afford to go to the dentist or to the doctor or to have an education, the government's view&mdash;according to this budget&mdash;is that they therefore do not deserve any of these services. There are three members of the opposition here&mdash;I mean the government. I cannot get used to it, can I?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What does this national coalition budget mean to Australians in this great nation of ours? Could it be a glimmer of hope to some? Yes, I think so. Could it be the green light for small business that will instil economic confidence? Once again I think so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many initiatives in this budget. The most important is the reaction of the financial markets to reduce interest rates as a result of the sound policy decisions of this government for reducing the massive debt left by the opposition. This has had a major effect on home owners and small business people who have suffered for far too long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet there is more to come, a lot more. When the coalition's industrial relations reform passes the Senate it will rectify a number of the anomalies that have been holding small business back. They will then be able to start employing people and creating real jobs. We will also be encouraging small business to take on more apprentices and trainees instead of running costly training programs in basket making, for instance, only to see those involved return to the unemployment queues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reduction of the provisional tax uplift factor will provide a great boost to the small business sector, as will the allowance to claim an exemption from capital gains tax up to $500,000 on the sale of a business when proceeds are used for retirement. The small business task force investigation will also provide a lot of the answers the business community is asking for, such as a reduction in bureaucratic red tape and paperwork.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a vision for the electorate of Capricornia. I have set goals that I expect to achieve. Some may say that I will never get the money from government to put major infrastructure into my electorate, such as extending the dam wall at Mount Morgan and building a dam in the Dawson Valley. And the many other projects that will follow will reduce unemployment in my area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I am used to working with knockers, people who focus on the tall poppy syndrome and only want to knock one's tireless efforts. There are those who knock the many initiatives in this budget that have been carefully planned for the people. I say to those people that the new Austrade office will give producers of any product the ability to directly trade overseas from my electorate of Capricornia; there is the $1 million for accommodation at Shoalwater Bay for the military; and there is the 6.25 per cent increase to local government in untied financial assistance and road funding grants. I am proud to say I had great pleasure in championing these projects for my electorate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4677">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The increased funding to local government in Queensland became a very real need to me as I was a councillor on the Belyando Shire Council in Capricornia. My council colleagues, including the mayor of the Belyando Shire Council, Councillor Jim Turner, Councillor Margaret Henn, Councillors Mary and Dale Langford and Councillor Arthur Plate&mdash;just to name a few&mdash;always instilled in me the need to fight for increased funding for local shires.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was followed up by reams of paperwork and literature passed on to me by the chief executive officer of the Belyando Shire Council, Mr Alan Lambert. This paperwork was generated in an effort to receive the result that the executive director of the Queensland Local Government Association, Mr Greg Hallam, called for when he lobbied all candidates prior to the 2 March election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another institution in Capricornia also received funding. I hate to mention it, really, because I know it really sticks in the throat of the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). I mean that it sticks in his throat, for he is still trying to get his foot out of his mouth after his statements, made to the media while visiting my electorate, regarding the funding shortfall to the Central Queensland University. To his surprise, it just so happens that the university received a nine per cent increase in its funding over the next three years, and not a cut. The vice&hyphen;chancellor and the acting president of the student union have both come out saying they are pleased with the budget outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Back to the knockers. I consider myself a rather humble sort of man. I say this with great passion: apart from my Christian views on life, my good wife, Leica, and those close to me in my family, nothing else is as important to me as the people of Capricornia. With this thick hide and these broad shoulders I will soldier on to provide a result to my employers at home&mdash;the residents of Capricornia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No matter where you go, you cannot please everyone. I understand this. More to the point, people do not mind change as long as it is not to them. So, if changes to social security hurt some, or certain jobs are lost because funding has run out, I say, `Don't despair, there will be other opportunities out there for you.' To this end, I will continue to make representations to this government to continue to receive money for projects that will give full&hyphen;time jobs, not just two&hyphen; to three&hyphen;month training programs that lift your hopes and then throw you back on the unemployment queues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this coalition budget, I see new initiatives that will cause my electorate of Capricornia to prosper and grow. It is a shame the other side of the House will not look ahead to see the big picture. It is very clear to me that until politicians from both sides of the fence scrum together and put forward constructive criticism that is to the benefit of this great nation we will continue to have people miss out, owing to ego&hyphen;driven individuals who are not prepared to wear a little humble pie for the good of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After my previous statement, it would be remiss of me not to point out an area that I will continue to lobby the Minister for Health and Family Services (Mr Wooldridge) on. That is operational subsidies to community based child&hyphen;care centres. I am concerned that some of these centres in my electorate will suffer as a consequence of this decision. Some of these centres are in drought&hyphen;stricken areas where the money is tight. There are a number of single mothers who have to go out to work to make ends meet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take on board the fact that these cuts only bring all the centres into line with the privately&hyphen;owned centres, which is fair to all. So, at this stage, until the smoke clears and we can see <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4678"> exactly what will be the end result of this initiative, I will continue to monitor the funding cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue I will be taking up, with the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill), is the 500 per cent increase in the environment management charge, which, because it was introduced to be effective immediately, will hurt a number of tourist operators in my electorate and the adjoining electorates of Wide Bay, Hinkler, Dawson, Herbert and Leichhardt. I strongly support my coalition colleagues in opposing this increase as it stands. Together, I am sure we will convince the minister to reconsider the implications that this increase will have for our tourism industry. While it is fair enough to charge tourists for the costs of maintaining the reef and the local environment, it is not fair to impose the charge on the local operators&mdash;which is exactly what this does&mdash;as they cannot pass the increased charge on to pre&hyphen;booked tourists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am on the subject of the environmental management charge increase, I was astounded today to be handed a press release issued by the ex&hyphen;Speaker of the House, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), which claimed the coalition members affected by this increase had voted against a motion to debate it. This grubby attempt by the member for Cunningham to politicise the amicable negotiation efforts of the south&hyphen;east Queensland members in this important matter is nothing more than a blatant lie. It is a typical political stunt by the opposition to pull on a debate ahead of its time.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On another sensitive subject, I heard the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission kick up a stink over shortfalls to funding to its previously exaggerated budget. I have seen Aboriginal people miss out on the necessities of life such as housing, health care and education owing to the wealthy administration of ATSIC and to its commissioners not passing the money down the line to the people who really need it. Until the commission proves there are no inequities in its system and stands accountable to the public, then a cut to ATSIC is warranted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to ATSIC and its rules for one and not another, let me raise the issue of ATSIC's election of office bearers. ATSIC holds secret ballots and conducts non&hyphen;compulsory voting to elect its representatives. This is completely opposite to the Australian parliamentary system of electing representatives. ATSIC calls for equality and reconciliation, yet it is not prepared to adopt a democratic and accountable system for its people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many people in this country whose ancestors were sent here in chains for offences that today we regard as petty. They did not have a choice but were taken from their families and dumped in a strange land across the seas, thousands of miles from their homes. Would it be unfair to say then that they have equal claims? Two hundred years later, would it not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4679"> be fair for their ancestors to expect the Australian taxpayer to keep them in the same way as the Aborigines? I do not think any other Australian would expect that either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to ATSIC and its rules for one and not another, I must say on behalf of all those good black and white Australians out there that, while there are two sets of rules for the people of this great nation, the country will continue to be divided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard some individuals complain about the changes to HECS, but for every one who has complained I have heard four others who say it is about time the system was made fair and equitable. To explain this, an example is called for. I have a friend called Scott who has a truck courier business that operates from Rockhampton throughout the central Queensland area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a good example. To get his start in life, Scott chose to buy a truck. He paid up front. I think he even had to borrow the money from a lending institution. For Scott, it was an up&hyphen;front investment fee of say $60,000. What would he expect to net after mechanical expenses and fuel running costs to the truck? Maybe $55,000 a year income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now let us look at the HECS scheme previous to the proposed changes. Students could study at university, complete a course&mdash;or should I say, purchase an investment or asset from the Commonwealth&mdash;at approximately $2,500 a year and not pay it back until they were employed and/or earning an income of $28,500 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this in mind, it is not hard to argue the case for change. It is a person's decision to purchase the asset in relation to the income they wish to make. I will explain. A degree in teaching may give an annual return of say $35,000 to $40,000 a year, therefore a relatively low HECS fee should be considered. A student wishing to purchase an asset that has the capacity to earn say $200,000 to $300,000 a year should have to pay more for his or her investment or asset.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The repayments for that asset are worked out on a percentage of their income after they begin to earn $20,000 per annum and then not until they have the capacity to pay it back, which means it could be some time before they start work&mdash;many students I know shoot off overseas for a well&hyphen;deserved break before getting into full&hyphen;time employment. They are not even compelled to start making payments until they have a job. Under these circumstances, this is a fair initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to one and all the cuts to every area had to come. We cannot afford to continue to throw money at everything that moves. We have to tighten our belts a little or the children&mdash;yes, our future generations&mdash;will be left with a country, or more to the fact, Mr Deputy Speaker, they will be left with nothing for we will have written cheques that our taxpayers cannot afford to pay. It is time to put our best foot forward and not take a selfish outlook on life and give this country the future of love and prosperity.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to take part in the appropriations and speak on the budget. I support the amendment moved by the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans). This is Jobless Johnny's first budget and it is a very disappointing budget. There is no growth, no jobs and no job certainty. When one discusses the appropriation bill it is always important and relevant to look at some of the macro-economic framework that the budget is placed in. When you look at the macro-economic framework you see that things are not looking good so far as growth in the economy is concerned, so far as jobs and job certainty and security are concerned and so far as unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4680">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not actually start with the budget paper. I will start with a very important part of members' reading in this place and that is the 1996 annual report of the Reserve Bank which the former Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Fraser, signed off on 6 August. It is a nice prelude to the budget on 20 August and at page 11 the board refers to the labour market and says as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employment growth was broadly in line with the path of economic activity but the within-year movements were quite variable and their interpretation was complicated by uncertainties relating to the data. Over the year, employment rose by 1.0 per cent compared with 4&frac34; per cent during the previous year. The slowing was evident among both part-time and full&hyphen;time workers but was more pronounced among full-time workers. Despite the slower growth in l995&hyphen;96, employment has increased by around 10 per cent or over 750,000 since the trough of the recession in mid 1991. Over the past 18 months the slowing in employment has been more pronounced than the slowing in economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA>So the scene for the budget on 20 August as signed off by the Governor of the Reserve Bank is a slowing in employment and a slowing in economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you move on in the board's report to pages 12 and 13, the board has this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The unemployment rate was largely unchanged over the year at around 8&half; per cent. Long-term unemployment continued to fall in 1995-96 with the unemployment for those out of work for more than a year falling to 2&frac14; per cent of the total labour force. This is still higher than for much of the 1980s but well down on the peak of the above 4 per cent recorded in mid 1993. The concentration of unemployment among certain groups in the community suggests that, while lasting reductions in unemployment require sustained growth and economic activity, combined with restraints in labour costs, there is also a role for training and other programs targeted at groups figuring prominently among the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA>What is the board saying here? The board is handcuffing itself, as the previous government did with the Working Nation white paper, to the notion of the need for economic growth to create employment and the need for programs aimed directly at unemployed, particularly long-term unemployed. I repeat what the board had to say, `. . . there is also a role for training and other programs targeted at groups figuring prominently among the unemployed'. That is why it is so distressing to see a budget which has no economic growth, therefore no prospects for employment growth, no prospects for reduction in long-term unemployment and, at the same time, a massive reduction in the expenditure outlaid for those programs which are aimed at trying to give the long-term unemployed, in particular, a chance at employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you turn to the budget itself, some 14 days after the Governor of the Reserve Bank signed off the bank's 1996 report, if I refer the committee to Budget Paper No. 1, it is interesting to see how through the macro&hyphen;economic forecasts and statements in Budget Paper No. 1, you get a very clear understanding of the notion of no jobs, no growth, higher unemployment and higher long&hyphen;term unemployment. In some other matters I will refer to subsequently, I think that we will see that these forecasts are now a bit tenuous and in some respects are optimistic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At table 6 at page 1&hyphen;20 of Budget Paper No. 1 we find the forecasts for growth or real GDP. The forecast for 1996&hyphen;97 is 3&half; per cent; for 1997&hyphen;98, 3&frac14; per cent; for 1998&hyphen;99, 3&half; per cent; and for 1999&hyphen;2000, 3&half; per cent. All are forecast below four per cent, which is that percentage of economic growth generally regarded as the percentage you need to make some inroads into unemployment. Anything less than four per cent is basically just picking up those newer entrants to the labour market. Page 2&hyphen;3 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Economic growth is expected to continue at a firm and sustainable pace in 1996&hyphen;97 with GDP forecast to rise by 3&half; per cent. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4681">  </PARA>
<PARA>There are two things here: again, confirmation that we are looking at modest proportions of economic growth, but also there is a bit of an illusion here&mdash;I frankly do not regard 3&half; per cent of growth as firm and sustainable or, as it is referred to subsequently in the papers, as `a forecast for strong growth'. It is simply growth in the economy that is barely enough to take care of those newer entrants to the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moving on, under the heading `Employment and Unemployment' at 2&hyphen;15 of Budget Paper No. 1, we find the budget paper saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite continued fairly rapid growth in year average terms, employment growth eased significantly through the course of 1995&hyphen;96, increasing by around one per cent in the year to the June quarter 1996 compared with 4.8 per cent in the previous year.</PARA>
<PARA>At page 2&hyphen;20:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's economic outlook is for another year of strong growth.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not regard 3&half; per cent as strong growth. And the final comment in the macro-economic section of Budget Paper No. 1, again under `Employment and Unemployment':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With continued non&hyphen;farm GDP growth and an expected deceleration in real wage growth, employment growth should accelerate through 1996&hyphen;97. However, a slowing in employment growth in year average terms is likely given the weak outcomes in the second half of 1995&hyphen;96. The current level of job vacancies and the expectations reported in business surveys, support a short&hyphen;term outlook of modest employment growth. Increasing employment opportunities and higher real wages through the course of 1996&hyphen;97, should encourage people to re&hyphen;enter or enter the work force, resulting in modest rises in the participation rate. With the labour force expected to grow solidly through 1996&hyphen;97, the unemployment rate is expected to decline only gradually to around 8&frac14; per cent in the June quarter 1997 compared with 8.6 per cent in the June quarter 1996.</PARA>
<PARA>On the budget paper's assessment, which I will argue is now in a sense an optimistic assessment as far as employment and unemployment is concerned, and a massively optimistic assessment so far as defining 3&half; per cent growth as strong, the key element arising out of this budget is no jobs, no growth, no job certainty. Jobless Johnny has really set himself to his nickname with this particular budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But shortly after the budget we find in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on Friday, 6 September the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Long&hyphen;term jobless may rise with reforms. The federal government's radical redesign of labour market assistance might not reduce the number of long&hyphen;term unemployed, Minister Vanstone conceded yesterday. Senator Vanstone said it was, `theoretically possible that long&hyphen;term unemployment would rise.'</PARA>
<PARA>For `theoretically possible', read `absolutely sure and certain' because what have we seen since budget day? What we have seen since budget day is the unemployment figures for August 1996 going above and beyond any of the forecasts or expectations that we find in the budget so far as unemployment is concerned with the monthly rate for August 1996 at 8.8 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Banker's Trust</EMPHASIS>, in its commentary on the monthly unemployment figures for August had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our quick conclusion is that the labour market is still just muddling along.</PARA>
<PARA>The member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), I know, would be interested in this quote.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The unemployment rate for males rose from 8.5 per cent to 9.1 per cent, its highest level since last October. The female unemployment rate was steady at 8.4 per cent. Almost all of the rise in unemployment in the month was accounted for by males. Who'd be a bloke?</PARA>
<PARA>And they conclude their comment by saying:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4682">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The labour market is simply stagnating, getting neither better nor worse.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, I think that is optimistic, given what we have seen in the last couple of days in so far as a couple of surveys and forecasts are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one point I would like to focus on for a moment. That is the notion of the need for economic growth to create employment, but also the need for governments and society to take special steps or measures to do their best to give unemployed people&mdash;in particular, long&hyphen;term unemployed people&mdash;the chance of getting back into employment. It is the notion picked up in the Reserve Bank's report which I have referred to, and it was the intellectual and policy basis of the previous government's Working Nation report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shorthand version of that policy approach is simply `growth plus'. In other words, you need economic growth, but you have got to take special steps or extra measures to make sure that the long&hyphen;term unemployed in particular get a chance of employment. And what have we seen in this budget? On the one hand, no growth, no jobs, no job certainty. And on the other hand, a massive slashing of the programs and the funds devoted to those special measures or extra steps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, if it was not enough for these very modest growth proportions or projections to be subscribed to by the government, in areas where we know we have had considerable success over the last decade in improving economic growth and jobs&mdash;namely, our export performance and Australian industry's performance&mdash;we also see, systematically through the budget papers, industry assistance, incentive or support programs and trade or export enhancement or incentive programs either abolished in breach of election promises or massively slashed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are interested in building ships and exporting them, the bounty is gone. If you are interested in being a small or medium size company that exports, the EMDG scheme has been gutted effectively and a cap of $150 million put on it, cutting EMDG expenditure by $426 million over a four&hyphen;year period in breach of an election commitment. That commitment was that funds to EMDG and Austrade would be cut by $58.3 million over a three&hyphen;year period. And my reference is just to the EMDG scheme. When you look at what is occurring in Austrade you effectively have $90 million cut out of appropriations for this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in that context that we saw the release yesterday by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Westpac Bank of their September quarterly survey of industrial trends in manufactures in Australia. In the course of the materials released by the ACCI and Westpac yesterday we find Bill Evans, the General Manager, Economics, for Westpac commenting:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that the budget was aimed at restoring business confidence and its associated forecast predicted a very healthy 14 per cent increase in business investments, the results of the survey, in showing that manufacturing activity continued to ease, will be disappointing for the government.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the 3&half; per cent maximum growth which is in the budget papers is predicated on a 14 per cent increase in business investment. And, a short time after the budget, the ACCI and Westpac are saying that you will not necessarily get that private investment. So, in addition to all the other things that are going on that I have referred to, you are not necessarily going to get the private investment which is also required to meet the very modest growth projections that we see in the budget. Mr Evans continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another worrying sign relates to employment. The March and June surveys reflected an economy where employment growth was negligible. Hopes for a stronger employment performance in the September <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4683"> quarter are not supported by this survey. Expectations for the December quarter offer little hope of any significant improvement in employment conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, don't expect any great increase in employment and, on the other hand, what will you also get? You will get an increase in unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the highlights by the ACCI and Westpac, there is a specific reference to unemployment. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labour shedding continued in the September quarter with a net balance of minus 24 per cent versus minus 23 per cent previously. A further decline in numbers employed is expected in the December quarter with a net balance of minus 19 per cent. The decline in overtime work is expected to continue in the next three months</PARA>
<PARA>The survey shows, not an increase in employment, but a decrease in employment and a consequent increase in unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The summary of the survey of industrial trends released at the same time by the ACCI and Westpac says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Manufacturing activity continued to ease with actual outcomes in the September quarter 1996 broadly similar to those reported in the previous three quarters. New orders, output, employment and overtime work all declined, in most instances marginally more quickly than in the previous quarter.</PARA>
<PARA>So, where is the trend line going? Down. Employment is going down. Orders are going down. Investment is going down. The trend line in unemployment is up. Jobless Johnny: no jobs, no growth and no support for the long&hyphen;term unemployed&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Capacity utilisation remained at low levels. Increases in new orders and output are again predicted for the next quarters with expectations for new orders strongest in the lead&hyphen;up to Christmas.</PARA>
<PARA>And you can look at the tables that are attached to the survey, under the headings `Employment: Labour shedding continues unabated' and `Overtime declining'. And I will not take any further time on that particular survey.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then you can look at the MTIA's budget assessment. The MTIA in its input special budget production has a very nice table which makes these points quite illustratively: `The outcomes and forecasts, main economic forecasts from the 1996&hyphen;97 budget'. The MTIA, in its formal budget response, refers to risks and challenges, and makes the very obvious comment: `four per cent plus growth must be our goal'. But for the forecasts and the statistics which the MTIA regard as being significant:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GDP&mdash;outcome 1995&hyphen;96 year average, 4.1; forecast 1996&hyphen;96, 3.5&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>imports are up.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unemployment rate, 8.5 year average 1995&hyphen;96; forecast, 8.5</PARA>
<PARA>last month, we saw 8.8 and all the evidence from the surveys that I have referred to are for that to increase. And we saw in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  today a summary of those reports under the heading `Jobless forecast fuels fears of economic slowdown'. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fresh evidence that unemployment could soon reach 9 per cent and the prospect of further job losses in manufacturing have fuelled fears of a budget induced economic slowdown.</PARA>
<PARA>That is obviously the case, given the measures contained in the budget. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the worst long&hyphen;term jobless figures in seven months were released</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">yesterday. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry found manufacturers expected labour&hyphen;shedding to continue. . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Westpac's general manager, economics, Mr Bill Evans, said there was "a chance" that unemployment could hit 9 per cent by the end of the year. . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that the number of long&hyphen;term unemployed . . . rose to 229,300 in August. It was the third monthly increase in a row and the highest figure since January. Senior Treasury officials played down hopes of a rapid improvement in employment from the Government's labour market reforms.</PARA>
<PARA>And, of course, the other thing that we are regaled with in the budget is the Budget Paper's waxing lyrical about all these problems which will be solved by the government's workplace reform bill. All you have got to do is force the wages down, give the workers low&hyphen;paid jobs, and that will solve all the problems of the world. So I was very pleased to see that Professor Gregory was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  today challenging this very simplistic notion that those on the other side always love to handcuff themselves to&mdash;namely, that we will solve all the problems of the world by just pushing down the workers' wages.</PARA>
<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  article, which is headlined `Gregory challenges Government push on labour flexibility', says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Professor Bob Gregory has issued a sweeping new challenge to Federal Government claims that greater labour market flexibility will significantly reduce unemployment in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Professor Gregory argues. . . that Government moves toward creating a more US&hyphen;style labour market will reduce the wages of low&hyphen;paid workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The restoration of full employment will lie in a direction other than reducing the wages of the low paid,' he says.</PARA>
<PARA>The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Noting the Government's claim that its planned individual employment contracts will not worsen employment terms and conditions, Professor Gregory says: `Is it possible to reduce unemployment and produce jobs by creating greater labour market flexibility, but ensure that this flexibility does not extend to reducing wages and conditions?'</PARA>
<PARA>So Professor Gregory scotches the simplistic notion that coalition members have always trotted out in this place that all one has to do is crush the workers' wages and the problems of the world will be solved. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the Main Committee on Appropriation Bill (No. 1). It is quite interesting listening to the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), who gave us a bit of an economics lesson today. But what is quite extraordinary is that some time ago he worked for the former Prime Minister in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4685"> Treasurer's department. He quoted so many figures of economic growth, but debt level was not mentioned once. He did not reveal that we had the highest interest rates under the previous Labor government and somehow he tried to link unemployment rates with the new incoming government. It was quite interesting that he did not once speak of the debt levels that he left this country with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was extraordinary that under the previous government we had high economic growth but we have also had high levels of unemployment. I might put to you that the reason that people are not employing&mdash;and every person that I speak to will not employ people&mdash;is that we need to sort out the industrial relations area. Until that legislation goes through that is the disincentive, not the economics figures and statistics that you quoted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first budget brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) is based on fair and responsible economic management. It is an accumulation of many hours of hard work, and many industry, business and community groups around Australia, and in particular in my electorate of Petrie, have shown their appreciation by applauding the budget. The appropriation bills are Australia's litmus test for the next three years. From the federal election six months ago, this government, the first coalition government in 13 years, has a mandate to return this country to strong economic management. This government has taken the responsibility to bring the $10 billion deficit back to level terms in three years, to throw out the ALP's unfair dismissal laws, to privatise one&hyphen;third of Telstra, to get small business back working and to provide for the heart and soul of this country, which is families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has a mandate because under Labor interest rates were at record high levels, unemployment reached levels not seen since the Great Depression and national youth unemployment soared to well over 20 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As a new member of the House of Representatives representing the seat of Petrie in the northern suburbs of Brisbane, I eagerly awaited the first coalition budget in 13 years. There was a lot of pre&hyphen;budget speculation around. There were the opposition calls of a horror budget and scaremongering among many groups in the community. My electorate office was ready for that Wednesday following the budget, and were we inundated with budget negativity? No, no, no. My constituents instead were calling me bitterly complaining about the riots at Parliament House and disgusted at the burning of the symbol of Australia, our flag: an episode which I would like all members in this particular chamber to thoroughly condemn. People calling my office were more concerned about the welfare of myself and my staff and offered their assistance, and I thank all those people who contacted my office for their consideration and thoughts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Petrie electorate includes people from all walks of life: small business, schools, older residents, the fishing industry and local government. Each stands to gain from this budget. As I talk to people in the electorate, I feel that this is a budget for families, for young people in our community, a budget for small business. In fact, it is a tremendous boost to get this country working again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Families are the life and soul of our community. It is the family unit, no matter what shape or size, that is the cornerstone of society. It is families who have found it so incredibly tough over the last 13 years. Double figure unemployment rates, high youth unemployment and high interest rates have left families wondering where the next dollar is going to come from. There are many families out there who are just living from week to week with the bare minimum in their shopping trolleys. This government will provide assistance through family tax <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4686"> initiatives and by providing financial incentives to low and middle income families who invest in private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government came into power on the platform of giving hope, of giving respite to families who have struggled particularly hard over the last five years. In the government's first budget, we have delivered. As promised, Medicare has been retained in its entirety and the operational subsidy for family day care centres has been retained, as has child&hyphen;care assistance and the child&hyphen;care cash rebate. The government has provided a fair and responsible budget; a budget which will help the hip&hyphen;pocket of the people of Australia and will give confidence to the marketplace and encourage consumer spending and self&hyphen;esteem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From my electorate's perspective, one of the most pleasing aspects of the budget has been its flow&hyphen;on effects for young people. The Howard government believes young people have for far too long been neglected, with sky&hyphen;rocketing unemployment, spiralling suicide rates, and a lack of hope and inspiration. This cannot continue. Our young people, next year's generation, need hope and inspiration, and our budget delivers. Working Nation has failed a lot of those young people and the long&hyphen;term unemployed. For too long these people have been going through the revolving door of endless labour market training programs before returning to the unemployment lines. Real jobs did not eventuate, and many of these people lost hope. Confidence in the system plummeted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In workplace reforms, the move towards a quality apprenticeship system for young people has been very well received in the community. Many people can remember the days when apprenticeships led to real jobs. You cannot beat the experience gained from working on the job, and skill based training lays the foundation for a quality system. The apprenticeship system that we have instigated reflects the modern labour market and the needs of business and industry; provides world&hyphen;class training in skills that business and industry require; gives employers a key role in determining the kinds of skills and training required; and also makes training arrangements simpler and far more flexible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The apprenticeship system put forward by this government is a step towards growth and employment options. The changes proposed in this government's industrial relations mandate will allow for flexible training arrangements. It gives more options and opportunities through small and medium sized businesses, so important to the economic vitality of the Petrie electorate. These changes, importantly, will allow businessmen in my electorate&mdash;such as cabinet&hyphen;makers, fibreglass moulders, mechanics, printers, typesetters and electricians&mdash;to expand their businesses, using the talent and skills of the young as apprentices in an affordable and well&hyphen;managed system. The apprenticeship scheme proposed by this government needs to be cultivated and supported, and can in time bring tremendous benefits to this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also wish to support the government's move to curb the high levels of youth homelessness. Organisations such as the Society of St Vincent de Paul, Lifeline, the Smith Family, City Missions, the Salvation Army and those individuals who spend their life comforting those on the street must be applauded. These people have hearts of gold and high levels of determination and dedication, and most of them work in a voluntary capacity in very trying circumstances. The growth of homelessness in our communities is debilitating and does nothing for the self&hyphen;esteem of families or communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a recent edition of the Queensland <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>, I was saddened to read that the Council to Homeless Persons has warned that Queensland's rate of homelessness was `nearly twice the national average'. The article reported that it had been estimated that there were some <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4687"> 61,000 homeless people in Australia, of which homeless families make up 13 per cent. Community groups are taking more and more responsibility each and every day, and people are crying out for comfort, support and someone to talk to. It has been estimated that there are over 20,000 homeless young people aged between 12 and 18. This figure is a very sad indictment of our society, and something needs to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth homelessness pilot program shows the government's commitment to this important area of society. With an $8 million package over three years, it will focus on family relations. The strategy is based on improving the existing supports available and reviewing the ways that information is transferred from community groups to income support agencies. Early intervention and family reconciliation are other areas which are being supported. The fact that the program is voluntary is also important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, youth suicide is an issue that has touched many families. Australia's suicide rate is one of the highest in the world and this government is prepared to take a stand here. Research and early intervention measures are needed. Counselling services are in great demand and the national youth suicide strategy will be welcomed in many communities, including those in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While on the topic of young people in our society, I attended a function recently at Deception Bay High School, where the principal, Mr Jim Stephens, was so proud of the achievements, academically, socially and culturally, of his students. Furthermore, Redcliffe State High School deserves special mention with their recent result in the Queensland Rock Eisteddfod, where they finished second&mdash;a great result for the determination and dedication of students, teachers and parents. Last Saturday, I was delighted to join the principal of that school, Mr Barry Ferris, in opening up their new performing arts complex, where the Commonwealth invested substantial funding. This government continues to support schools and education in such a way to further improve the opportunities that are available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget will provide further incentives for students through educational and training schemes. Over the next four years, Australia's schools will receive $14 billion in funding from the federal government. We are preparing our young people for future employment. In fact, just recently the Australian Secondary School Principals' President, Duncan Stalker, has applauded the fact that schools are to be given direct access to funding to support an increased emphasis on vocational education for the nation's secondary schools. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At long last there is recognition that vocational education is important to secondary schools and has a crucial role in the secondary curriculum. The challenge facing secondary schools is to design and implement vocational courses that are equally valued along with other school programs by students and parents.</PARA>
<PARA>The Petrie electorate has welcomed this government's commitment to the job placement, employment and training program. JPET aims to assist young people to establish a stable lifestyle, resolve family conflicts, attain life skills, return to education and prepare for entry to and continuing participation in the work force. I commend the funding of $11 million per year over the next two years which has been set aside for this program. We just cannot forget our young. This government has a rock solid commitment to young people in the Petrie electorate and throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A key area in getting this country back working again is small business. The Attorney&hyphen;General only this week released provisional bankruptcy statistics, and it is a disgraceful legacy from the Labor administration. There were over 17,000 bankruptcies for 1995&hyphen;96 and in my <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4688"> state of Queensland, as the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) would know, there was a rise of nearly 40 per cent for the financial year. The previous government failed to deliver real industrial relations reform and the current account went out of control, forcing up this country's national debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spoken previously of the sad sight in my electorate of the growing number of small businesses shutting their doors over the last few years. Vacant shopfronts have become a far too familiar sight in too many suburbs, in community shopping villages and even in the central shopping malls. Capital gains tax initiatives introduced by this budget have been very well received in my electorate and the capital gains rollover relief will, in time, have a very positive benefit for many small businesses. They have the opportunity to expand and to create more jobs. Generous tax treatment for employee share schemes will provide a sense of ownership in our big businesses and encourage participation from within. The government has made a commitment to ensure that a lack of financial operations does not constrain growth and development of small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Business leaders representing prominent Australian organisations recently met in Canberra and they have given full support to these budget measures. They called on the minor parties in the Senate to pass the workplace reforms and, as National Farmers Federation President Donald McGauchie said, `We expect the passage of the bill to produce conditions for increased employment and higher wages.' Business will be given a choice in managing their work force and enterprise agreements negotiated under a dual system will provide business with much more flexibility than they presently have with a rigid awards system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key area on the mind of every small business person in my electorate is the unfair dismissal scheme. This is an ALP legacy that will stick to the opposition for many years to come. The present unfair dismissal laws are a noose around the head of many small businesses who struggle from week to week. I am talking about the family corner store, the florist, the baker, the butcher, the coffee shop owners and the restaurants&mdash;each and every one has grave concerns about these unfair dismissal laws and they are crying out for help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened is that the move towards casual work has been the death of many full&hyphen;time jobs. In some industries, where there have been large turnovers of staff, employers have become very careful with their placements. A coffee shop owner in my electorate recently told me that he no longer employs full&hyphen;time employees, preferring instead part&hyphen;time and casual workers. This government intends to amend this legislation for benefits across the whole country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, this is a further measure which is targeted towards jobs&mdash;real jobs&mdash;for the benefit of our community. This government recognises the needs of the unemployed, particularly those in the 50 to 60 age group. Many of these people find it terribly difficult to re&hyphen;enter the work force, through lack of skills or limited opportunities. Whether their predicament is brought about by retrenchment, economic circumstance or family situation&mdash;male or female&mdash;it is important that the needs of these people be further examined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the subject of industry, the fishing industry is a valuable asset to the electorate of Petrie. I represented the interests of the constituents with fishing enterprises recently, to save the diesel fuel rebate scheme from abolishment. I am pleased that the diesel fuel rebate scheme  has remained intact. This is of particular significance and will achieve economic sustainability throughout the whole fishing industry. Not enough emphasis is placed on the fishing industry. At the moment, many in the industry who harvest prawns are in a state of decline due to poor <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4689"> climatic conditions. I look forward to working with local and state fishing organisations, processors and consumers, to work towards a more productive sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had the pleasure in Brisbane recently, on behalf of the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer), of launching the new strategic plan for the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation&mdash;a corporation which has been doing commendable work in managing fisheries research and development programs. Research by the Southern Fisheries Centre, coordinated by the Queensland Department of Primary Industries at Deception Bay, has received funding from the government for its projects, particularly in the prawn trawl fisheries. It is budgeted that the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation will invest $13.5 million in 200 new and continuing projects, highlighting the government's commitment to this important resource sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, the higher education sector is of interest to my constituents. I believe the move by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) to announce budget initiatives early was a positive step to help universities and students in their decision making processes and planning. The Petrie electorate includes the Carseldine campus of the Queensland University of Technology, a university that I have had an association with over a number of years, both as a student and as a tutor. I was very pleased to see that the Queensland University of Technology's operating grants for 1996&hyphen;97 have risen by 3.8 per cent and the variation for 1996&hyphen;98 is 4.9 per cent. I expect that the university will benefit from the research funding that has also been made available. The increased funding for university research is upwards of $140 million over four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes to the user&hyphen;pays system for university education will make it, I believe, a fairer system. The three&hyphen;tiered system will change for the better the irregularity that existed before. The new proposals are a far more equitable system, streamlining the process which existed where everyone was charged the same, regardless of which course they undertook. Australian students will also be given the opportunity to purchase an undergraduate place, in the same way that overseas students can do now. The reality is that education costs money. We live in a user&hyphen;pays society, and the variations to the HECS system will provide far more equity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, there is a chronic shortage of carers in our community. I have made the point of speaking to many community groups, such as St Catherine's Respite Centre&mdash;a St Vincent de Paul centre in the Petrie electorate. The centre caters for approximately 40 clients a day, providing a freshly cooked three&hyphen;course meal for lunch in a very caring and supportive environment. I have spoken to a number of church and community groups concerning this issue. Respite centres in the Petrie electorate, unfortunately, are limited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is certainly a great need for overnight centres and occasional weekend care. Those who spend their lives comforting and supporting others must be applauded for their wonderful efforts. If these dedicated people were not so committed, the situation would be far worse than it is today. I will do everything I can to support the needs of carers in my electorate. I will work towards this cause in providing overnight care and weekend occasional care. This is a quality of life issue, and everybody deserves a break to settle their own nerves and their own system. The lifelong love and dedication which carers provide need to be rewarded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national carers action plan introduced by this government is a step towards this quality of life. This plan recognises the role that carers play, and their importance in today's society. I understand that there will be a focus on matching services and assistance to the needs and circumstances of individual carers. I am proud to see that this government has not ignored <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4690"> these carers and that we have taken them under our wing and will recognise and support their efforts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of this budget will not only have benefits for this country fiscally, but will also provide substantial benefits to the confidence of the business community and families. This budget will lay a foundation for this country's future and provide a far brighter future for all.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to follow my colleague the member for Petrie, and I acknowledge her interest and the interest of the member for McMillan (Mr Broadbent) in the small business sector. I look forward to working with them on the inquiry into fair trading and I hope that we can bring in a report that the government will implement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first budget of the Howard government, presented by the Treasurer Peter Costello, shows once more a lack of imagination from the conservative side of Australia politics in public policy making. In a short space of time, the Treasurer has already shown that he is clearly a slave to economic orthodoxy. There has to be a better way to build a better country than is shown in this budget. The fixation with budget deficits and ultra low inflation rates belies the fact that we need economic growth in which to create jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government has clearly failed to recognise that the role of government is not just to balance the books like a small suburban accounting firm; it is actually to create the climate for economic growth and to redress market failures. Obviously, there have been significant market failures in  Australia over the past 50 years. We have failed to address the need to replace jobs lost with new jobs for ordinary Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate of Rankin there is a well known suburb called Inala, a suburb in which I grew up. When I was growing up, there were a number of opportunities for people to work. These included the heavy engineering firm at Rocklea, Evans Deakin Engineering, General Motors Holden at Acacia Ridge, and the Huttons Meatworks. All have since closed due to competitive pressure or rationalisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this government needs to do is to turn economic policy into an instrument for creating jobs for these people. The unemployment in this suburb and in other areas in my electorate is unacceptable. It is one of the reasons we are now in opposition. However, the unemployment minister Senator Vanstone has admitted that unemployment will stay at 8 per cent until the year 2000. This is simply not good enough. From their own words the government has let down the unemployed in my electorate and across the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us take a look at what they think the answer is. But let us first say what the answer is not. The answer is not to smash the job schemes that actually help people find jobs, nor to cut $1.8 billion over four years out of labour market programs. I challenge government members to visit places like the Inala South&hyphen;West Skillshare office in my electorate and to speak with the 730 people who benefited from the Skillshare program during the last financial year. What are these people, and the hundreds of other people in my electorate who found jobs through the Skillshare programs, to do?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's answer is to cut funding for programs like the new enterprise incentive scheme&mdash;NEIS&mdash;and the jobskill program. These schemes have been successful in my electorate in areas such as Inala, Browns Plains and Woodridge. The answer is not to make the unemployed feel ashamed of their position and guilty by introducing things like the so&hyphen;called `dole diary'.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4691">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I talk to community groups in my electorate, I find one thing is certain. Senior citizens are concerned about and just plain scared of the consequences of this budget. The government's decision to align the nursing home system with the hostel system results in senior citizens having to pay an entry contribution to gain admittance to a nursing home. Older members of the community who need nursing homes may have to pay up&hyphen;front fees of around $26,000. We cannot yet get the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) to identify what the figure will be. She answers every other question, but will not answer this one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister of Family Services has tried to defend the decision by saying that it is simply a matter of aligning the two systems of nursing and hostel care. This is a ridiculous argument, and it is clear that she does not understand her own policy. You do not need to go through a test to get into a hostel as a matter of choice. You have to be assessed before you get into a nursing home and that is a fundamental difference. It is the reason that the previous government did not relate the two together. Anyone who has any understanding of aged care policy knows that the two types of care are indeed vastly different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The increase in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme will result in pensioners now paying an additional 50c per prescription, or $3.20 in total. Many of the pensioners I represent are angry that there was no warning of this sudden increase. There is not the compensation that there initially was when the scheme was introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of my constituents who are on fixed incomes will find it difficult to deal with this sudden increase. For a sick pensioner it can mean up to an additional $5 per week. Elderly people who live at home and who have chosen to stay at home in familiar surroundings will be slugged user&hyphen;pays fees at a rate of around $4 per hour. The government has also reduced its contribution to home and community care funding by $88 million over four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All these measures make it difficult for pensioners, and they are right to ask why this government is hitting them so hard. Too often we have become slaves, however, to economic theory. That applies to all sections of the Australian political spectrum. What we have to do is find Australian solutions for Australian problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recently listened to a debate on the ABC about what used to be called the `fair go country'. In fact, we have lost in recent years the attitude of a fair go for all. I think the election of this government is a further step away from it. Unless this government recommits itself to the philosophy of a fair go, we will end up as a society with a distinct underclass. I know this because I have seen many of the people in my electorate suffer under the types of programs that have been cut in this budget. What the budget will mean for low income families, pensioners and the unemployed is not a pretty picture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many members have spoken of how the scrapping of funding for the Commonwealth dental scheme will affect the community. I did some research and found out how many people in my electorate used this scheme, and I was simply staggered by the result. My electorate of Rankin had one of the highest usages of the scheme in Queensland. Over 13,000 residents in my electorate used the scheme during the last financial year. Over 7,000 residents and health care card holders in Logan City in my electorate used the scheme last year. So these people can now expect long queues and much pain from John Howard's broken promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before this scheme was introduced, the cost of dental health care was out of the question for many poorer Australians. Under Labor, they were able to receive dental health care. This, cruelly, will no longer be the case. This is an absolute disgrace, and I will be making it clear to the people of Rankin that they have been forgotten by this government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4692">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only way for people to break out of the poverty cycle is through economic development and through jobs. Both of these objectives have not been met by this government in its first budget. Small and medium sized enterprises can offer many opportunities for Australians, as many speakers on the other side have said in their contributions to this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going back a little in time, the McKinsey report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Born global</EMPHASIS>, which was brought down in 1993&mdash;I recommend it to all honourable members&mdash;showed how many Australian companies are able to focus on new markets, and the global market is part of their initial business plan. This is something that has not been part of Australian culture in the past and something the government needs to nurture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not natural for Australian companies to think of international trade as their basic market. In the past, we have always been a country that fed its domestic market and sold any excess to export markets. We did not see exports as a primary source of income for business. But, when we see in this budget the EMDG scheme, the DIFF program and a whole range of other support programs attacked as business welfare, we see that the economic rationalists within the Treasury are getting their way with a continuing stream of coalition ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These types of programs are not business welfare. They are addressing a market failure in creating an export culture. Because of our OECD membership, we also tend to think that we are a fully developed country. The opposite is true. We are still a developing country, admittedly with a very high standard of living but one that continues to improve. If we do not improve our standard of living, then many people within our society will fall through the net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to look forward now and have a look at the safety net itself, to see how it is administered. We have to do so, not because it has failed or because we want to cut funding, but because we want to redirect it to enable Australians to become more part of a productive society. Unless we offer all Australians the right to work we will fail the test set down by this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are ways to create jobs and to do it through our natural resources. Australia is the world's leading mining nation. It is the leader in mining technology and mineral exploration. We are at the forefront of mining technology development. This is, of course, one of our most important sectors. We fail to realise that already we export more goods and services from the mining sector than from the well&hyphen;publicised wine industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite often, we do not recognise that research and development is taking place in these areas and that Australia is producing world&hyphen;class goods for export markets. What we need to do is promote them more and ensure that our trade bodies, such as Austrade and Ausmine, are given the support they need. Australia can set the trend. Most people would not realise that the first CD&hyphen;ROM technology exported by Australia was an adaptation of mining programs on teaching an operator how to use underground equipment. This was, as I said, done on CD&hyphen;ROM for the first time and exported out of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are ways, of course, to create new employment. But we need to be forthright and not listen to the economic theorists who tell us what we cannot do rather than what we can do. In December 1995, during discussions I had with a major Japanese paper company, I asked the simple but obvious question of why this particular company had invested in paper production facilities in Canada and other countries but never in Australia. The answer was something of a revelation. It simply was that Australia had never told that particular company that they had to invest in Australia, whereas the Canadians had.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4693">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many ministers have been told you cannot instruct overseas business to construct plant in Australia. The reality is that if you own the natural resource and you want to put a condition down you will get the investment. The Canadians have shown us how to do that. It is now time, I think, that Australia grasped the nettle.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is how we can overcome our trade deficit as well as create new jobs for all Australians. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, this budget will not create jobs and will, in fact, add pain to those in the community who are unemployed. What we need is innovation and what we need is new ideas. What we have got in this budget is not just economic rationalism but economic orthodoxy. We have closed CES and DSS offices. With the cutbacks in job programs, with pensioners being hit, with the unemployed being offered no future and with cuts to child care, we can truly say that this government is certainly not governing for all of us.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in support of a budget that restores Australian families and small businesses in our regions to their pre&hyphen;eminent position after 13 years of neglect from the former Hawke and Keating governments. In fact, having heard from the speakers today and having two of the guilty party, the member for Fowler (Mr Grace) and the member for Rankin (Mr Beddall), sitting here in this room, it is a pleasure for me to address this hallowed chamber and discuss a couple of matters that came out of the member for Rankin's address.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Talk about nowhere to run and nowhere to hide! These two are two of the guilty party. As the member for Rankin said, he watched his people suffer through 13 years of neglect in the seat of Rankin. Why did he not do something about it? As the former minister for small business, for heaven's sake, he was the minister who presided over small businesses in Australia paying 22 per cent interest rates. That was a total failure, not just on his behalf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noted, as he spoke today, that he still had some good ideas. He was one of the ministers who actually had some good ideas. But his own party walked away from him every time he put those ideas forward, because he actually used some commonsense. He actually went to the Japanese and talked to them about how he could get investment in Australia. But he was rejected, along with all those backbenchers and ministers who sat in regional seats. They were ignored by the executive. That is not happening with this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You saw&mdash;and I do not want to be distracted, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;that historic meeting where the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) brought together all of those people on the woodchip issue. He brought the conservationists together, he brought the industry people together and he brought the interested members of parliament together on the coalition side. They sat down and, very quickly, came up with an idea that is acceptable to the Australian community and provides a great opportunity for jobs in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The speech we have just heard from the member for Rankin shocked me. It shocked me in that, once again, they are using scaremongering with the elderly and the most vulnerable in our community. That is a great disappointment to me as the member for McMillan, having suffered through so much of this in my first three years here, watching a government use the scaremongering with the elderly and the vulnerable in our community through the whole of the Fightback package. And now I am seeing them doing exactly the same thing again in opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No&hyphen;one pretends that this was an easy budget to deliver. In fact there must have been this huge sigh of relief in Labor ranks when they lost because they had nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. You heard the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) talk about job programs and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4694"> denigrate the Prime Minister&mdash;as only the Labor Party do&mdash;by using language for the member for Bennelong. But I noticed you pulled him up, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;and I thank you for that&mdash;when he called him `Jobless Johnny'. At the same time the member for Perth said, `On the other hand&mdash;' and what was on the other hand? Nothing. He had no new ideas, no new policies and no hope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this budget brings to Australia is hope, and it returns to the people the ideas and the aspirations that they have for this nation. I repeat, no&hyphen;one has pretended it has been an easy budget to deliver. But most of the members on the other side of the House know that, had they been re&hyphen;elected, they would have been delivering a very similar budget. The decisions and the commitments made were difficult. At the same time, however, one cannot dispute that in this budget the burden of the challenges facing the Australian community has been delivered equitably. The government had no other course, after 13 years of mismanagement of the Australian economy, but to take the action that they have taken and spread the difficulties equally amongst the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget&mdash;in my humble opinion&mdash;is a tribute to the Prime Minister, John Howard, and to the Treasurer, Peter Costello, for the way they went about the process of fairness and equity to get an outcome like this that is not merely concerned with the next financial year, nor that reflects some pre&hyphen;occupation with reducing the deficit bequeathed by Labor. This budget is the first step towards retrieving a credible role for government in our community. In the face of growing cynicism and doubt, not only about the function of government but also about the very effectiveness of government itself, this budget establishes the foundations essential to resisting this trend by restoring credibility and honesty with respect to national governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent years we have witnessed the increasing perversion of due process in government. After so many years of incumbency, the former Labor government deluded itself by believing that it could retain power merely by being seen to do something. It overlooked the necessity to actually deliver real outcomes. In my electorate of McMillan prior to the election campaign we had the then local member, Mr Cunningham, announcing in the local paper that he had received $10 million in funding for the electorate. Little has been delivered. We cannot find it in any budget anywhere. Was it just another hollow promise? It is disappointing a whole lot of people around Moe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed that the Opposition Leader (Mr Beazley) actually mentioned funds withdrawn from Moe in Gippsland. There have been no funds withdrawn by this government. In fact, we have delivered exactly what we said we would. We said that, if this was a government commitment that had been signed off, we would do it&mdash;and we have done it. We have done it in every regional area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government was an administration by style not substance. The dying days of the Keating government can best be described as a shell adorned by labels, such as Working Nation, Creative Nation, Young Nation, One Nation, with little to excuse its failures for 13 years. Labor had even less to justify its sixth term in office. In no other area of public policy was this more manifest than in the proliferation of labour market programs that paid absolutely no regard whatsoever to the effectiveness and performance of such schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government's own adviser, DEETYA, in its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation: evaluation of the employment, education and training elements</EMPHASIS> determined after having carried out an assessment of labour market programs that Working Nation had failed by promoting placements in relatively expensive programs that failed to meet the measure of the quality <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4695"> expected. This report compounded the weight of growing evidence, which the government was electing to ignore, that effectively suggested that government concentrate on delivering real jobs rather than formulating programs. Other reports were compiled with the Economic Planning Advisory Council and the National Board of Employment, Education and Training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The DEETYA report condemned Working Nation for shifting the number of placements away from such effective schemes as the jobclub program to programs such as new work opportunities. Under the new work opportunities program, the employer had no obligation to retain the employee, whereas under wage subsidy programs an incentive was available to encourage the retention of placements. In addition, taking on a trainee was far less expensive under NWO schemes than through many other labour market programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the number of placements in wage subsidy programs was intended to increase, there was an evident decline in the number of these positions. For example, in 1993, 26 per cent of program placements were in the jobstart program. That figure fell to 18 per cent in 1994&hyphen;95 and to 17 per cent in the first eight months of 1995&hyphen;96. There is ample evidence to suggest that the new work opportunities program was competing for placements in the private sector together with other DEETYA programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The basis of the more expensive labour market programs was not solely flawed on account of effectiveness. Those programs were placed in areas without, it would appear, any genuine consideration of the priority attaching to such assistance. Administrative data reveals that 15 per cent of all new work opportunities program placements went to the 30 DEETYA areas with the lowest unemployment levels while only 16 per cent of all new work opportunities placements were landed in the 30 DEETYA areas with the highest levels of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sufficient time does not exist here to fully trace the failings of Working Nation. What can be said is that Labor has attempted to disguise a policy vacuum with a myriad of programs, distorted incentives and avoided any transparent commitment to real outcomes. In contrast, the transitional and long term initiatives contained in this budget are premised not on programs but on outcomes. They are focused on the individual and not on remote or misbegotten targets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget will establish the framework within which the range of labour exchange services can actually be expanded. At the same time those programs that have demonstrated effectiveness will be retained such as new enterprise incentive schemes, NEIS, and various English and literacy programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regions, like my electorate of McMillan, will benefit by the retention of the Office of Labour Market Adjustment; regional community employment councils, formerly area consultative committees; and the forest industry adjustment package. I note also with very great pleasure the allocation of $48 million towards the finalisation of regional forest agreements. I know that the timber industry, which supports many families in my electorate, will benefit directly from this initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is appropriate at this time to congratulate the government on its decision to lift the woodchip export ceiling by one million tonnes. The decision is much more than the export ceiling; the decision represents country jobs for country people in the electorate of McMillan. Over 1,000 jobs directly depend on this industry in my electorate. Countless other jobs rest upon the activity and employment in the timber industry. I know that employees, management, the NFF, the VFF, the Forest Protection Society and the CFMEU have worked diligently to correct many of the myths surrounding the industry in Australia. Were it not for their <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4696"> confidence in the Howard government, this process would have been rendered far more difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also provides medium to long&hyphen;term supply security which is so vital to the industry. Many industry representatives in McMillan have long been restricted in their investment decisions by uncertainty as well as the risk of government policy decisions over the years. We have witnessed so many of these. By accelerating the conclusion of RFAs, this budget allows for a stable and sound environment for investment planning. The process that has been outlined by the Prime Minister encourages managers to adopt thinning operations which maximise future sawlog yields in production forests and illustrates the government's commitment to the national forest policy statement as well as value adding in Australia by providing an incentive for woodchip exporters to source their material from sawmills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The modern Australian apprenticeship training scheme guarantees much&hyphen;needed flexibility that has been absent. We have been neglecting the needs of our young unemployed, not to mention their prospective employers. The wage top&hyphen;up serves as a safeguard for apprentices, trainees and employers. I have noted with annoyance that the opposition has levelled criticism at the principle of apprentices being paid only for productive time in work. This is a principle which has been accepted by both parties. For the Labor Party to oppose in opposition what it embraced in government is manifestly opportunistic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the issue of health. Before I do, I will just make my point on how important the woodchip situation is. I will not say who sent me the fax; I will just read out what that fax says. They are talking about an address I made in the House yesterday. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I caught up with your spirited defence of the new woodchip regulations. I understand the shadow resources minister, Neil O'Keefe, made his usual destructive contribution on this matter. I appreciate your support for our industry as the past environment has created much uncertainty and has caused much unnecessary hardship in rural Australia. Thanks again. Look forward to catching up with you soon.</PARA>
<PARA>That is just another person seriously concerned about jobs in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the member at the table agrees with every word I am saying on this. I come from a position where I cannot believe that you can sit here and be as brazen as you were today in the House during question time when you know that, between 1990 and 1993, you sat there while employment increased 150 per cent. It went from 3,000 to 9,000 in the seat that I formerly held. It is an indictment of you that you can actually sit there and think that we are not going to do the best that we possibly can for those people who are unemployed. We will do it. Everything this government can afford we will do on behalf of those people who are unemployed and genuinely looking for jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The health portfolio, better than most, demonstrates Labor's impotence in office. Despite having virtually unlimited resources to effect change, Labor was constrained not only by its industrial wing&mdash;to no&hyphen;one's surprise&mdash;but also by a commitment to a version of universality that guaranteed neither access to public health services nor fairness.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect Labor considered that, by its commitment to a standard Medicare levy in the absence of private health insurance rebates, it was addressing the current crisis in our public health system. Sadly, its commitment in this regard became a pretext for inaction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only the coalition has had the courage and the sense of social justice to embrace a two&hyphen;tiered Medicare system, requiring the wealthy in our community to contribute more to the operation of our public health system. I am sure I would be supported by every member in this room on that issue. The Medicare surcharge for high income earners is an eminently fair measure, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4697"> adding perspective to our health system. The long&hyphen;term maintenance of the public sector depends on greater contributions from higher income earners. The availability of rebates places singles, couples and families in a better position than they enjoyed under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the availability of rebates for private health cover has been affected by recent increases in health fund premiums, let us remember that the recent increases and impending applications for increases are a direct result of the trend of decline in the number of people taking out private cover. For the opposition to attack the coalition on this front is unforgivable. It is worthy of dismissal for what it really is: a desperate attempt to repair its poor performance in the polls and its poor performance on the health issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the establishment of the inquiry by the Productivity  Commission into the state of health funds, the government has acted promptly to ensure that the value of these premiums is maintained. In fact, access to health services will be further enhanced in electorates like McMillan. Allowing pharmacies to serve as Medicare agencies will improve access for clients and pensioners in Australia's regions and more remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I am incensed when I hear criticism from the opposition in the wake of our announcement of our intention to reform the aged care sector. It is the height of hypocrisy for a party which introduced an identical system for hostels to now oppose the implementation of the very same system in nursing homes. Unifying the hostel and nursing home system is a measure necessary to address a steadily worsening crisis in nursing home care. In simple terms, nursing homes around the country have not been able to attract sufficient funds to upgrade facilities. Many premises are increasingly dilapidated and fail to meet the standards that we, as a community, should expect for the elderly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994, the then Labor government commissioned a report on the state of nursing homes. After surveying 150 nursing homes, the following findings&mdash;amongst others&mdash;were made: 75 per cent of homes needed fixing or rebuilding to meet Australian design standards; 13 per cent of homes failed to meet fire authority standards; and 39 per cent of residents were in rooms with four or more beds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's objective for aged care is twofold. Firstly, the package allows sufficient funds to address the capital crisis facing many homes; and, secondly, it removes inequities between the nursing home and hostel systems in order that the financially disadvantaged will be protected, while those who can afford to make a contribution will be able do so. Twenty per cent of people who are financially disadvantaged will not be paying to go into a nursing home. They will not be charged $26,000. And everybody on the opposition side knows exactly that. Importantly, full&hyphen;time pensioners are exempt from having to make any entry contributions. So, too, are financially disadvantaged persons who have not owned a home in the last two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What people need to understand is that entry contributions, which are established by agreement between management and client, will not be compulsory. While the contribution is to be negotiated between the prospective resident and the proprietor, there are very strict conditions under which arrangements can be finalised. Very secure safeguards exist for the benefit of prospective residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should remember that, under the previous government, millionaires enjoyed better access to nursing home beds than the battlers who so conclusively deserted Labor at the last election campaign. For instance, a resident must always be left with assets of at least 250 per cent of the pension&mdash;some $22,000&mdash;and the entry contribution can only be drawn down at the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4698"> maximum rate of $2,600 per year for a limit of five years. Members on the other side know that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most significantly, people will not be forced to sell their own homes at fire sale prices. The same system implemented by Labor for hostels in 1988 will now be applied to nursing homes. While people are given six months to sell their homes, if they fail to do so they cannot be ejected from their accommodation. Their draw&hyphen;down simply becomes a debt due to the proprietor. A further guarantee exists in that no prospective resident will be asked to make any contribution within the first six months of admission to a nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not have the opportunity today to address other issues which are so important and specific in this budget. My community is relieved that the years of the Keating and Hawke governments have gone. We now have the opportunity to build on this budget to make sure that we deliver the promises and the programs that are in it on behalf of the Australian people. I see myself as having had a great blessing in being able to make this address on behalf of the constituents of McMillan. I will serve everyone of them, whichever way they have voted, to the best of my ability. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for McMillan (Mr Broadbent) talked about coming from a regional area. McMillan certainly is a region of Victoria. Regional areas were certainly betrayed in this budget&mdash;totally betrayed. They were betrayed and abandoned, and the honourable member for McMillan's electorate was abandoned. The Department of Regional Affairs has been gutted&mdash;there is no longer a department. The minister has said that there is no clear rational or constitutional basis for Commonwealth involvement in regional development. The minister's statement has wiped out the Department of Regional Affairs. But it is easy to compare what this budget takes away from regional Australia with what Labor had in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal member for Wannon, David Hawker, who is chairman of the Federal Liberal Regional and Rural Committee, said in a press release on 21 July 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a disgrace that people who choose to work and live in the country often have to put up with the inadequate or non&hyphen;existent services. While many of the capital cities have started to recover from the hard&hyphen;hitting recession, that recovery has not flowed on to regional areas.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to say to David, and to the member for McMillan and all the other members representing regional Australia in this government: `Let's talk about some of those services.' Let's talk about the Medicare offices which have been closed right around Australia. This budget closed them in regional Australia. And it is no good putting in your rebate claim at the chemist&mdash;the chemist does not have a fax machine that can refund you with dollars and cents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Social Security and CES offices have been closed in regional Australia. They are regional services that apply within Australia. They are regional offices right around the country and they are being closed. The tax offices are being closed in Launceston. People in that area have to go all the way to Hobart to talk to somebody in the tax office. That makes things really difficult for older people who like to talk to a tax official on a one&hyphen;to&hyphen;one basis. They cannot do it anymore. Bingo! Out it goes. With this budget, this government, out it goes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Family Court in Launceston is being downgraded. I do not know whether there are other family courts in other parts of regional Australia. If there are, I am sure they are under attack and I am sure they are under pressure of closure. This all happens in regional Australia. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4699"> honourable member for McMillan (Mr Broadbent) is listening very intently, and so he should, because his region has been betrayed by this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">University places have been lost in regional universities. In Tasmania, we have lost 380 places from our university. We were very fortunate and we worked very hard&mdash;and I know you did too, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;to increase the opportunities in the northern part of Tasmania and also in the north&hyphen;west so that, especially in the north&hyphen;west which has one of the lowest retention rates of tertiary education in Australia, we would have more places for people up there. We have lost that opportunity and those places are now under pressure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirty places have been lost at the Australian Maritime College in Launceston. That is a loss to the north of Tasmania. A report I was looking at recently on the economics of northern Tasmania stated that 23 per cent of its economic activity comes from education&mdash;university, the Maritime College, secondary colleges and other educational facilities. So that is a big loss to the state and to that part of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's $150 million in infrastructure funding has gone out of the budget. Bingo! It is taken out of the budget; there is no more infrastructure. There was no rational or constitutional basis for that decision, but the minister does not believe that this government has a constitutional or a rational reason for being in anything to do with regional development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sale of Telstra will affect regional Australia enormously. Tasmania will lose at least 600 jobs for a start, and that is a big loss of incomes for Tasmania. There has been some discussion that digital mobile telephones will be the answer for regional Australia and that regional Australia does not need to have the same services as urban areas. I think this is what is being pushed to all the regional members of the government. They are telling them that mobile phones are the answer for regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment, 70 per cent of the base stations are located in metropolitan areas, 25 per cent are located in regional areas and five per cent are located in remote areas. I sourced that from answers to a question on notice from the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith) on 20 August 1996. So only a small proportion of regional Australia currently has access to mobile phones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will not be an increase in the infrastructure in the less populated areas after privatisation. Even if there was, the mobile phone does not allow the same interactive communication that is available on the Internet or e&hyphen;mail. It does not allow CD&hyphen;ROM. It cannot give access to the information systems of the world in the same way that is possible with a physical cable. Without Telstra's current ability to cross&hyphen;subsidise services, the regional areas will be forgotten and discounted and they will not receive the roll&hyphen;out of the cable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tasmania is in a very vulnerable position. I worry greatly about its being able to receive that roll&hyphen;out. If they do not have this technology, will the individuals, organisations and areas be at an economic disadvantage? It would certainly heighten Tasmania's isolation, as it would with many other regions throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is the $600 million sliced off national highway funding. They have pork&hyphen;barrelled a bit up in the northern part of New South Wales and given the members up there some areas&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BV5">Mr ADAMS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, they have taken $600 million off the national highway funding. I think this translates to about $9 million less for Tasmania's highways. Last week the Brew report indicated that they are trying to get rid of our railways. It is a double whammy, of course: they are taking money off the highway system in this budget and closing the national railways in Tasmania, or trying to. There will certainly be a significant loss of work on the Bass Highway and I am sure there are places in the Penguin area and other areas towards the north&hyphen;west coast where work was being phased in that will probably also be set back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at the loss of the last government's labour market programs, comparing this budget with what was there under a Labor government. These programs were about skill development for long&hyphen;term unemployed and for young people. It was the opportunity to gain skills through some of these programs. Skillshare is about giving skills to some people who would not get into TAFE, people who would need help with basic literacy and numeracy, basic English, that sort of training, in order to have skills to find a job, to have an opportunity to compete, to have a chance of competing on equal terms with others in that very competitive job market. Those people are going to be denied an opportunity with a 33 per cent cut in the skillshare budget. So there is going to be a reduction in labour market programs, a reduction in chances for people to gain skills, a reduction in opportunities for them to be able to get job ready and a reduction in training for some of those young people who need to come through a program before they can go towards an employer to be taken on board as an employee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can say that these were Mickey Mouse programs, you can say whatever you wish about them and run them down&mdash;which the other side does&mdash;but they were programs that were there to assist long&hyphen;term unemployed and other unemployed. And when we, first as a government and then as an opposition, have sought to find out what this current government would set itself as a target to reduce unemployment, it has refused to tell. So this government has been able to cut $1.8 billion out of labour market programs and it has cut that at the expense of the unemployed, young people, long&hyphen;term unemployed, people who did have some hope, who had some opportunity to gain skills that would make them somewhat competitive in a very competitive labour market. By cutting that, by getting rid of that, we have reduced the opportunity for a lot of those people. They are to have a test on whether the opportunity to do a course is worth while, and it will be very interesting to see how many people are thrown on the scrap heap using that sort of technique.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is the ABC. The Launceston office of the ABC and the local programs are under enormous threat, especially in future years. Over the next four years the ABC will lose $209 million&mdash;$11 million next year and then $66 million each year for the next three years. Regional Australia has got to take a loss when you start cutting the ABC like that. We are going to have the networking of programs out of Melbourne and Sydney and we are going to lose regional programming right round the country. It will devastate the ABC and will mean the loss in Tasmania, I am sure, of the symphony orchestra. Local programs will disappear and all our news and current affairs will probably come out of Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What relevance does all this have to regional Australia? Those members opposite who represent regional Australia have failed to be able to contribute to the debate within this government. They have failed to take up the issues that are really relevant to regional Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4701">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are the losses and changes also to programs, such as the reducing of the tax concession from 150 per cent for research and development to 125 per cent. This puts at risk programs that were being started in our country. For instance, it has recently become technically feasible to treat primary sulphide concentrates by bacterial oxidation to dissolve copper, followed by solvent extraction and electrowinning of the copper. Simply, this is using technology to mine and retrieve the copper concentrate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new Mount Lyell mine, at Queenstown, is experimenting with producing copper on site rather than sending it overseas to be smelted. This is a new way of smelting, a new technology. This is about smartness. This is about doing things better and differently. This is a good, value adding project, something that we desperately need in my state of Tasmania and in the rest of regional Australia. The project would have three stages over three years in conjunction with BacTech, one of two or three companies in the world who have the technology to treat these copper concentrates in this manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So here we are, getting on the edge of technology and being knocked over by a really silly, stupid decision of a government trying to play at a political level about something to do with big black holes. This would have meant 30 to 40 jobs and the long&hyphen;term the viability of this mine, which has to make itself a viable proposition over the next few years. The project is at risk. Why? Because this government really is not looking at the future. It did not have any vision in this budget. When I have heard members from the other side speak in the budget debate on the appropriations bill here, all they have wanted to do is to attack this side of the House. They want to attack the previous government but lack putting much vision into the future. They have failed to be able to go in there and take on the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the executive of this government, and to be able in any way to influence this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All those members who have come in from regional Australia have been walked over, and regional Australia has been the loser. The betrayal of the private sector, which is taking risks for the future, is a really silly decision. The government has a vital role to play in facilitating this and should have been in there doing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is the loss of the $150 million in infrastructure funding, putting other projects at risk. Orielton Lagoon, in southern Tasmania, is at risk. There is an irrigation scheme here and an effluent recycling project. The feasibility study showed the export opportunities for farmers involved in new crops in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate, just over from the airport of southern Tasmania, there are close opportunities for cherry farming, for intensive farming, taking water out of a recycling sewage farm and putting that water on to the golf club, selling the water to the golf club, selling it to farmers. The feasibility study has been done, all the engineering is done and all we needed was a bit of capital to make it happen. Of course, bingo: $150 million infrastructure funds for regional Australia, bingo. `No constitutional responsibility,' says the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the shipbuilding bounty. Everybody knows the Incat success story in Tasmania. Some of the rewards that we have there are at risk. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Senator Vanstone) talks about real jobs. Real jobs have been created there, with new jobs in welding and aluminium product, and very new skills have been founded. A lot of work has gone into building up the skill base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bounty was reviewed in February 1995 and the report found that the industry had totally transformed itself in the 1980s from a domestic situation to export, and about 80 per cent of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4702"> the production is now exported. Why change a success story? It is very hard to understand and it is just a stupid decision by government to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is the hydrodynamic facility at the maritime college in northern Tasmania. This would have been a world class third&hyphen;generation ocean testing basin. It would have put Australia at the forefront of this type of research. The sort of research that they are doing there in the maritime college is work on the platforms for the oil rigs that are now being made in Australia at Bunbury, I think, in Western Australia and at Newcastle on the east coast. The technology for these things has been developed in the test tanks at the maritime college in Launceston. Fourteen million dollars would have given us a facility that would have put us at the leading edge of technology, but that has been knocked back by this government, using this budget. So the honourable member representing that region has failed that region miserably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could go on. I have not touched on things like funding to the state governments for programs such as housing, dental care, child care, superannuation, elderly care&mdash;all these programs that really matter to families. Government members have been quite forceful in saying that they represent families. Families are the basis of all those programs that are affected by the cuts in this budget. The families will feel the disappointment, the let&hyphen;down, of the many broken promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has been very short&hyphen;sighted in this budget. It has failed to give a vision, a hope, to many different groups within the community that were probably thinking that with a new government there would be new opportunities and we would get some vision. But the government wanted to play around with the politics of the edge. They talked about a $9 billion deficit, black holes, et cetera. But they offered no vision to our industries or opportunities to help the long&hyphen;term unemployed by putting in place the programs that needed to be put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is wishy&hyphen;washy. It does not have a clue about how to stimulate job creation in this economy. It has failed. Its ministers are in disarray in the other place. The minister in our House is talking about trying to get the number of apprentices up, but he does not even know in which industries he is going to get the apprentices up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has been betrayed. Regional Australia has been abandoned, betrayed, forgotten and run away from by all those members on the other side who came in from regional Australia. It is a shame, and they should be ashamed that they have let down their electorates. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, in the short time available to me tonight I would like to make a few points relating to the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams). First of all, let me say that 77 per cent of the Australian population have already spoken. They have told us that they believe this is a fair, equitable and responsible budget, which is something that has not been achieved in my memory and certainly not in the last 13 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will make a couple of quick comments regarding his last remarks. I noted down on the pad in front of me the words `short&hyphen;sighted approach'. I think that is exactly what the Labor Party had. The fact that they were willing to sell the future by overspending now indicated quite rightly that they had no long&hyphen;term vision. In fact, they were quite prepared to sell off the farm. They were quite prepared to go further into debt in order to fulfil their short&hyphen;term goals rather than to look at the long term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They talk about the failure of the minister for employment. That is hypocrisy at its best. Six months we have been here. The Telstra bill, the industrial relations bill and the budget&mdash;the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4703"> things with which we went to the people&mdash;are not yet through the parliament. When the legislation is passed and they have had time to be put into place and to have an effect, we will see real jobs created. I think that we are going to pay the price for taking an honest approach to government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We saw in the lead&hyphen;up to the last election so many people being put into jobs. I should say `into outcomes'. They are not jobs; they are long&hyphen;term training projects. They enable people to come off the long&hyphen;term unemployment list and on to the short&hyphen;term unemployment list. They do not create a job; they do not create any wealth for Australia; they do not give these people any hope. They simply made the government of the day look better. I will perhaps leave to my second instalment my other comments regarding the budget, which the greater percentage of Australians acknowledge was the correct measure to take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make reference to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A fair go for families</EMPHASIS>, a publication put out by the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission. This is to pre&hyphen;empt the debate that will take place in the main chamber perhaps tomorrow in relation to the family tax laws. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A simple method of moving towards a fairer taxation system for families would be to introduce additional tax thresholds in respect of dependents.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what this government has done. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This would recognise the additional minimum costs incurred by families with dependents.</PARA>
<PARA>This publication of 1987 was available to the previous Labor government for some eight years, yet it never took it up. In our first term we have taken it up and on 1 January of this year we will see those tax cuts come into effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two issues I would like to address in the very short time available. The first one is aged care in my own electorate of Longman. Aged Care Queensland has put a submission together which will be going to the federal and state ministers for family services in the next few days. This submission identifies particular areas of Longman as being the most disadvantaged areas when it comes to nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The area of Bribie Island in particular is one which has seen a great deal of growth, particularly for elderly people as they move there for the fishing, the beaches, the fine weather and, of course, the quiet lifestyle. It has also resulted in the fact that we have only 50 places in total, provided by one nursing home, for the entire population. The population of people aged 70 and over is some 3,000 to 4,000. This means that in reality, to be able to meet the criteria, we should have somewhere between 300 and 400 nursing home places and we have 50. The situation in Caboolture is no better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past the whole approach to nursing home places has been totally misdirected. We have talked of regions, and Bribie Island and Caboolture come into a planning region called Cabool. Pine Rivers Shire is also part of that particular region. That helps to equalise the numbers. It means that through this process we have been unable to deliver the places where they are needed and where the elderly population wish to live.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not, unfortunately, have a large population. The Gold Coast, known as the south coast region, has 3,021 aged care places for a population of 30,939 over 70 years of age. This means that they are underserviced by only 73 places. In the area of Cabool, we are 224 places underserviced. If we were fully serviced just in the Bribie&hyphen;Caboolture area alone, all of those places would be taken.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4704">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am reassured by Aged Care Queensland that they are recommending 30 places be allocated to Caboolture and 70 to Bribie Island to bolster the already high quality establishments that are there, such as the Bribie Island Retirement Village and the War Veterans' Home at Caboolture, not to mention Sunnymead Nursing Home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to bring to the committee's attention the plight of the Autistic Association of Queensland. I have been meeting today with two people, Mr Bruce Faye, the President of the Autism Association of Queensland, and Carol Renard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of all the areas of special needs, this particular group is probably the most disadvantaged because, as these people pointed out to the minister and myself today, if you have in this room people suffering from perhaps Down Syndrome, it is quite obvious. Their impediments can be seen and it is very obvious visually. People with autism look just like you and me. The fact is that the needs they have are very much specialised. They need additional care. Unfortunately, in Queensland at this stage we have an absolute lack of people available to service the parents, the school teachers and the carers, as well as the children who suffer from autism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst people with autism look 100 per cent healthy, their behavioural patterns and ability to communicate are often extremely lacking. The additional care they require is imperative if the families are going to have any quality of life and if the teachers are able to assist them, in particular in regional Queensland where we have one staff member looking after more than 400 families with autistic children. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The cost of first release CDs is approximately $30.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) A number of rail systems in Australia and overseas have trialled reflective material on rolling stock or used it on a large scale. These include the Burlington Northern Railroad, Canadian Pacific and Canadian National in North America. The NSW State Rail Authority has over the last few years progressively fitted reflective logos to its grain hoppers. The Victorian Public Transport Corporation has fixed reflective material to about one third of its grain fleet and intends to complete the process. National Rail has also trialled reflective strips.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) A number of such tests have been done in Australia and overseas. A summary of recent studies is contained in Part 5 of the Proceedings of the 17th Conference (1994) of the Australian Road Research Board at pages 231 to 242. This study reports that there is a lack of definitive information on their effectiveness, but some railroads consider the devices to be useful. The Australian National Railways Commission (AN) considers that trials have not demonstrated that the measures tested led to an improvement in level crossing safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) AN has advised that the indicative cost of placing reflective material on a wagon varies from $30 to $70. The variation is due to the size and type of material and the way it is attached.</PARA>
