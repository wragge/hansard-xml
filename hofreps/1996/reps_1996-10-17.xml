<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the House expresses its deep regret at the death on Saturday, 12 October 1996 of the Honourable Rendle McNeilage (Mac) Holten, CMG, a Member of this House for the Division of Indi from 1958 to 1977, Minister for Repatriation from 1969 to 1972 and Minister Assisting the Minister for Trade and Industry from 1971 to 1972, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</PARA>
<PARA>Mac Holten was born on 29 March 1922 and was educated at Scotch College in Melbourne. At the age of 19, he enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force, serving as a flying instructor and test pilot until 1946 when he left the air force with the rank of flight lieutenant. Mac was a retail grocer before entering federal politics. He became a member of this House in 1958 when he won the Victorian seat of Indi for the then Country Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his maiden speech to the parliament, he reflected on his wide&hyphen;ranging concerns&mdash;from education and the importance of research to assistance for home ownership, to the difficulties faced by primary producers and industry, to foreign policy where Mac perceived that Australia's traditional ties with Britain and the United States must be juxtaposed with its geographical location in Asia, issues that are as relevant today as they were then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During his 19 years in this parliament, he contributed actively to the work of a number of parliamentary committees. He served on the Joint Committee of Foreign Affairs from 1962 to 1966, the Joint Statutory Committee of Public Works from 1967 to 1969 and the House Committee from 1974 to 1977. Mac was Minister for Repatriation for three years, between 1969 and 1972, and in 1971 and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1972 he also served as Minister Assisting the Minister for Trade and Industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His public service did not end after his departure from federal politics in 1977. In 1980 he was appointed Administrator of Christmas Island. In the same year he was appointed a Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George for his parliamentary and community service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I personally served in the federal parliament with Mac Holten for a period of three years, from 1974 to 1977. He was an affable person who enjoyed social discourse. He enjoyed celebrating and relaxing with his friends in a convivial fashion. From my recollection he was a great lover of sport, in particular a great lover of cricket and Australian rules football. I know that he will be greatly missed by those in the now National Party of Australia, the successor to the then Country Party, and by other members of the coalition and by the broader political community who knew him well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife Shirley, to his children, Diana, Carolyn and Debbie, and to their families our very sincere sympathy in the loss of her husband and their father.</PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (Brand&mdash;</ELECTORATE>
<ROLE>Leader of the Opposition)</ROLE>
<TIME.STAMP>(9.35 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion. I support the remarks made by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on the death of Mac Holten. The Prime Minister has an active memory of him from a period of co&hyphen;service in this place. I do not have that active memory in the same way but I do have a memory of him from the times when, as a boy, I visited parliament and can, of course, recollect him as a member of the government backbench and then the government frontbench.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His career was classically that of the hardworking National Party&mdash;then Country Party&mdash;member, obviously deeply connected with his branch, deeply connected with his electorate, having been associated in employment before he entered small business and having, like many country people, had a time in the armed services during World War II. Like many others on all sides of the House at that point of time, those in the services cut their <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> teeth on the issues of leadership in the community and community responsibility. We had a generation, of which he was part, grow up excited by or introduced to the possibilities of government and have imposed upon them very heavily the obligations of patriotism in its most extreme. He came through that refiner's fire successfully and subsequently made a substantial public contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot say, having reviewed the speeches of Mac Holten, that he was anything other than a child of his times. My father was apparently a victim at one point in time of a pair of characterisations&mdash;one always loves one's parents and therefore one is never necessarily terribly objective&mdash;which I find so way out that I can only think they must have been preceded by an exceptionally good dinner when they were made. Nevertheless, that is all part of the cut and thrust of politics and we occasionally say things about each other which we do not really mean. I stand in hope that that applies to Mac Holten as well because it is not of a piece, as far as I can see, of the record that he had in public service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at his record, I guess he would have regarded the high point of his political career as being his ministerial service as Minister for Repatriation. There are one or two features of that administration that are worth a remark. His time in that portfolio was obviously infused with an appreciation of the trials and tribulations of service personnel, the trials and tribulations he had once himself experienced. He was moved by a visit to Vietnam when he obviously felt that not sufficient attention was being paid to the plight of soldiers, and he quoted back to the media on his return a comment from one of those who would ultimately become the responsibility of his portfolio: `I don't care what happens to me as long as you blokes look after the missus.' That really impressed me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5708"> When he held that portfolio, he pursued several inquiries into the standard of care for veterans and their entitlements. We had a bit of a debate with him at the time, as I see from the record, as to whether all the things that might have been considered were con sidered, but there is no doubt at all that there was a wide&hyphen;ranging review of the position of veterans. It was probably inspired by the notion that the Vietnam war was going to produce a new crop and the whole system needed to be modernised. As a result, he was there at the pointy end, if you like, of a substantial set of changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note too that he was involved in remedying an injustice. There were differences between the entitlements that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ex-service personnel enjoyed at the conclusion of the World War II hostilities and those enjoyed by other defence personnel. He introduced legislation to remedy that at the time he was Minister for Repatriation. No doubt that was a high point of his career.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The time he gave in his last piece of public service as Administrator of Christmas Island must have been for him pure joy. That would have been a task he would have taken to at that time very readily. He was remembered, I do recollect, during a visit to Christmas Island. The Administrators loom large in the consciousness of people on that island. Mac Holten was recollected by those who were there as having been an Administrator in his time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His career is that sort of career that, when we all consider what we are doing in politics, most of us would see as a quiet, solid political career. He was a faithful servant of his party, a servant of his electorate and a servant of the conventional views and philosophies of his time. The passing of such people should always be noted. I join with the Prime Minister in extending condolences to the Holten family.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support this condolence motion in respect of the Hon. Rendle McNeilage Holten, or Mac as so many of us knew him. He was a neighbour to my then state electorates of Sturt and Murray when I first entered the New South Wales parliament many years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mac Holten gave outstanding service for almost two decades in the federal parliament, but he gave to the community for a far longer period. He was, as the Prime Minister (Mr <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) have said, a Minister for Repatriation and a Minister Assisting the Minister for Trade and Industry. He was perhaps not always showing up as being one who wanted to break the mould, but in his own way he did seek to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very early in the piece, back in 1968, he made a visit to Lima and to South America as he recognised that in the trading tapestry of the world, as it was changing then and is changing now, Australia needed to look not only as a priority to Asia but also beyond that. So it was that Mac Holten travelled the world partly in his role as assistant minister for trade and also as the then federal member for Indi.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mac Holten as a minister did not forget his party links either. I recall vividly the times he helped out when it was difficult for him to do so, when it was an added commitment against his family time on weekends and the like. He would cross over to campaign in the electorate of Riverina, most notably to come and give workshops with regard to that historic campaign in the seat of Riverina which saw the defeat of a sitting Labor member for Riverina in the 1974 elections. In fact, Mac did not recognise that border; he was often on both sides of the Murray River helping people, helping veterans, helping out in the party political sense. He always had an open door approach to people wherever they came from, especially in relation to the portfolios he held.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His love of the Collingwood Football Club was paramount in his sporting activity, more generally around Wangaratta, as was water skiing on the same said Murray River with people like John and Shirley Nolan and others during his fitter years. I know my former colleagues and former members of this parliament, Doug Anthony, Ralph Hunt, Peter Nixon and many others, would want for me to add their voice to this condolence motion, their great respect for Mac Holten, one of their colleagues with whom they worked for so many years during periods of previous coalition governments. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and the member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5709"> in Victoria this day attending the memorial service and have asked that I also add their support of this condolence motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In one sense to me, as a younger, newer member of the state parliament just out of the army, Mac Holten stood and loomed as a figure larger than life. He was always a help, a guide and a mentor from the border region of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mac, you served your country well, particularly in World War II. You went on to serve the community in a raft of ways, not just as the federal member for Indi. I extend sympathy to his widow Shirley and family and say that they can be rightfully proud of the contribution Mac Holten made to our nation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to associate myself with the motion of condolence moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for the family of Mac Holten. I had the great pleasure of encountering Mac over the years&mdash;mostly at National Party forums&mdash;and, like everybody else, was struck by his natural charisma. He was a very lively character, and that was borne out by a very successful community and public career.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mac was born in Melbourne in 1929. He left school at 16 to sell life insurance but joined the RAAF in 1940 and became a flying instructor and test pilot. After the war he played football for Collingwood. Indeed, he played some 82 games for Collingwood, I understand, as a centre halfback, which is testimony to his toughness and resolve&mdash;playing in that position for Collingwood is not for the faint&hyphen;hearted. Mac was also Vice&hyphen;Captain of the Melbourne Cricket Club at a time when that club was all&hyphen;conquering. In 1949, as a 26&hyphen;year&hyphen;old, he was lured to Wangaratta to coach the Wangaratta Magpies. He had phenomenal success, leading them to four successive premierships, as well as becoming a star local and country weekend cricketer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At around this time Mac was approached by the National Party&mdash;specifically, by a legendary figure of the time, Keith Bradbury MLC. Mac joined the National Party, stood for the seat of Indi in 1958 and won it. Mac was a very good local member, as people in that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> community will readily attest to. He was a hard campaigner, very resolute, with a sense of purpose. In fact, at one of our first meetings when I was a new member of parliament, he inquired as to whether I was a good campaigner and said to me, `There is one test.' I asked, `What's that, Mac?' And he said, `Do you ask them for their vote?' He never believed in meeting anybody on the campaign trail without actually asking them for their vote&mdash;and that is no easy thing to do, as all of us in this place know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mac had a distinguished career in parliament and, as has been said, was Minister for Repatriation between 1969 and 1972. He was also Minister Assisting the Minister for Trade, then Sir John McEwen. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) has touched on his efforts to forge into Asia. Indeed, I take note of a press clipping of 29 May 1972 where Mac is reported as having led a delegation of six manufacturers of automotive parts to South-East Asia&mdash;specifically, into the countries of Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. So Mac was treading that trade route long before it became so fashionable in the modern context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mac was a strong advocate for his electorate, particularly the textile industrial. If you look at his career, time and again you will see it marked by his strong defence of the interests of his textile and clothing industries, particularly the two mills that were in Wangaratta at the time. I am told that they were the Bruck mill and the Wangaratta woollen mills. Mac was a great all&hyphen;round sportsman, as we know&mdash;football, cricket, anything. But, above all else, he used these sporting pursuits to encourage young people to push themselves and to strive for the very best, as he always did in his own public life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After leaving parliament in 1977, Mac was appointed Administrator of Norfolk Island, the exact period being from 1980 until 1982. He remained in Wangaratta until only a few years ago when he shifted to Melbourne. I should say that I seem to recall Mac actually played in the Prime Minister's XI against a visiting international cricket team.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YT4">Mr BRUCE SCOTT</NAME>
<ELECTORATE> (Maranoa&mdash;</ELECTORATE>
<ROLE>Minister for Veterans' Affairs)</ROLE>
<TIME.STAMP>(9.51 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with colleagues on both sides of the House in expressing my condolences and those of the veteran community to the family of the late Hon. Rendle McNeilage Holten, very affectionately known by so many Australians and service people as Mac. Although renowned as a fiercely proud local member, excellent pilot and committed flying instructor, I would like to take this opportunity to place on the record the veteran community's appreciation for Mac's outstanding work on their behalf. He was Minister for Repatriation between 1969 and 1972, which was a most turbulent time here in Australia as the ugly war in Vietnam raged on. He rose most admirably to the challenge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, Mac will be remembered as the architect of the Native Members of the Forces Benefits Bill 1972. This bill ensured that the repatriation benefits extended to Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal ex-servicemen were the same as those extended to other ex-service men and women. He was also responsible for the Repatriation (Torres Strait Islanders) Bill 1972, which brought Torres Strait Islander service men and women under the Repatriation Act. Mac recognised <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the disadvantage that geographic location could impose and ensured that it would be recognised and accommodated under the repatriation system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mac appreciated the difficulties endured by many families of veterans and service men and women. In 1972 he increased the living allowances paid under the soldiers' children education scheme and ensured the eligibility criteria was flexible. This ensured that those children of ex-servicemen who, as a result of war service, had died or been incapacitated or blinded had the best possible start in life. He was also responsible for introducing guide dogs for blind ex-servicemen whose blindness was caused by their war service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1974 he warned against the Australian repatriation system turning into a social service department. His warnings have ensured that today's repatriation system is one based firmly on the principle of compensation and not of welfare. He strived to make repatriation benefits less complex and better understood by all. I can understand Mac's quest to achieve such simplicity, given that I hold the portfolio today of veterans' affairs, and it is a quest that goes on today, some 25 years later after his work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mac was also a very keen supporter of Australia's ex-service community, giving them a voice in the way the repatriation system was developed and working with them on a regular basis. As I extend my condolences to Mac's family and extended family, I know that I do so also on behalf of the  ex-service community, our veterans and the war widows of this nation, who are grateful to have had Mac Holten as their Minister for Repatriation during his time in parliament.</PARA></SPEECH>

I can recall him speaking of Mac Holten with great affection and respect many times indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is significant, and a way to evaluate how any of us perform in our duties in this place, to look at the way the people you <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5711"> are there to serve regard you.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would just like to make a very small contribution to this debate this morning. I knew Mac Holten for some 30 years. I could not claim a close friendship with him, but he was one of the most impressive stalwarts of the party. Back in 1969, when I was young and foolish, I got very much involved in politics and I actually stood for the federal seat of Wide Bay. Mac Holten came to Bundaberg and Maryborough and campaigned for me. Some of the things the member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) has said were etched on my political psyche. One of them was that, as the member for Gippsland said, you must always ask for their vote.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing I remember of him distinctly was his great ability to move in any conceivable community, whether it was on the floor of a sugar mill, to the blue rinse set of the ladies committee or to a CWA branch. He translated right out of Victoria into a Queensland setting and he had that great ability to nurture a new political candidate. I have often thought that, if it had not been for people like Doug Anthony, Ian Sinclair and Mac Holten, I probably would not, over the 20 to 25 years when I stayed active in the party, have ever stood for a seat again. Perhaps I am here today because of people of that era. I would like to add my words of gratitude to him and condolence to his family.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to support the government's initiative today in the debate of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill 1996. The government is taking a holistic approach to the environment and what we need to do with the environment for the future, not only as far as environmental protection measures are concerned but also as far as sustainable development is concerned, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5712"> in recognising some of the degradation that has taken place around Australia over the past 200 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important thing in the debate this morning is that the government is not going to walk away from the linkage of the partial sale of the Telstra bill. We are taking a holistic approach to addressing the environment problems that are very evident in Australia right across a number of different aspects. The establishment of a trust is an innovative way of approaching this problem. Instead of addressing individual elements of environmental problems on an ad hoc basis, the government is proposing to address the entire gamut of environmental problems in, as I say, a holistic way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of the bill is to a establish a Natural Heritage Trust of Australia reserve with some of the proceeds from the partial privatisation of Telstra which will fund certain environmental projects. In the pre-election policy document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Saving our natural heritage</EMPHASIS>, it was announced that a coalition government would establish a $1 billion Natural Heritage Trust of Australia, which would be devoted to protecting and rehabilitating Australia's natural environment. This trust will integrate the joint interests of environmental protection and sustainable development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The document announced funding measures in the order of $318 million over five years to the national vegetation initiative; $32 million over five years to the national land and water resources audit; $163 million over five years to the Murray-Darling 2001 project; $85 million over five years for the national river care initiative, an initiative that is particularly relevant to my electorate; $100 million over four years to the coasts and clean seas initiative, another initiative that is particularly relevant to my electorate; and $80 million over four years to the national reserve system to preserve Australia's biodiversity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, during the election campaign the now Prime Minister, the then opposition leader, John Howard MP, confirmed that a coalition government would not provide additional funds to pay for its $1.15 billion environment policy if the parliament refused <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to approve the one-third sale of Telstra. The government does not fade away from that commitment and the linkage between the passage of these two very important pieces of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very easy to reconcile&mdash;any reasonable person can very easily reconcile&mdash;the sale of one part of a publicly owned capital item for investment in another. We are selling a part of a government business enterprise in which the government is going to maintain a majority shareholding and reinvesting in another capital item, our environment, for the future of Australia, for our children and their children and for the future of the development of this country. That is putting it in the simplest possible terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commitment that the coalition made prior to the election on 2 March and also the commitment the Prime Minister clearly enunciated to the people of Australia is that if the government today is not able to get the bill for the partial privatisation of Telstra through the Senate then we cannot implement this package of environmental measures. As I said earlier, this package is a very innovative way of dealing with a major problem in a holistic fashion for the betterment of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting that when introducing the bill into the House, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), said in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the key challenges this nation faces is that of preserving its natural environmental capital for the benefit of our children and grandchildren. Australians overwhelmingly believe that environmental protection and economic growth are equally important. The challenge for Australia is to sustain the rapid advances in living standards that have been achieved in the 20th century in a way that protects the life support systems which are increasingly threatened. This is a challenge that all governments around the world must accept. Every society has a responsibility to future generations to leave an environment which is at least as healthy and productive as the one they inherit.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what the government is proposing to do as far as this bill and the linkage with the part privatisation of Telstra bill, which is over in the Senate, is concerned. It <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5713"> is about selling a part of a capital item and reinvesting that capital elsewhere. We all do it in our daily lives. The business community does it. That is what we are proposing to do in Australia. That was clearly spelt out to the Australian people prior to the election on 2 March, and they voted in droves to put the coalition into government&mdash;94 members in this House, 37-odd senators in the other place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats, who I think have seven senators in the other place, maintain that they have a mandate to block the Telstra bill. Only yesterday Senator Lees was reported as saying that she is going to move amendments to split the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill so they can vote in favour of the consumer protection provisions and vote against the part privatisation provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats want to vote against these environmental measures. There is no backing away from that. No amount of rhetoric will convince the people of Australia that what they are doing is voting against a measure that the government wishes to introduce. That measure is without equal in the public management of Australian affairs in the history of this country; that is, putting over $1 billion in a trust to address those measures I enunciated earlier that need addressing as far as the environment and sustainable development in this nation are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let there be no mistake. When the voters of Lindsay go to the polls on Saturday, they should ask themselves who is going to do the best job as far as the environment and the future of our children and our grandchildren and what they are going to inherit in this country are concerned? Is it going to be the ALP candidate, Mr Free, or is it going to be the Liberal Party candidate, Jackie Kelly?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP are going to oppose these measures. They do not want to see this government address the environment problems through the measures that have been clearly spelt out to the people of Australia and clearly supported by the people of Australia in droves. They are going to try to stop this government from introducing one of the key measures that the government ran during that election campaign and got an unarguable and demonstrable <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mandate from the people of Australia to implement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let the people of Australia know, watch and be aware of how all members of this place, but, more importantly, all senators, vote on this measure and on the part-privatisation of Telstra. It is a very common practice, a very common occurrence, to divest oneself of one capital item and reinvest in another capital item for the benefit of all Australians. All Australians own Telstra. All Australians own and are responsible for our nation's environment, for its future and the future of sustainable development. We are selling one asset and reinvesting in another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have highlighted those measures that are part of this bill that are going to receive attention. I want to quickly run through two of those that are of specific interest to my electorate. The first is the $85 million national river care initiative. It will focus on six core priorities for river systems outside the Murray-Darling basin; namely, catchment management, pilot storm water management projects, nutrient control plans, low-cost water reuse pilot projects in regional areas, community based river action plans, community education and monitoring programs for river health, the measurement of the ecological health of rivers including environmental flow requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My home town of Taree, on the Manning River, has a few problems with the river, which the local government authority and state government representatives have been working together to address. We have a Total Catchment Management Committee in place for the Manning. It is managing the total catchment area, because what happens upstream has a profound effect on the activities of the river downstream.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Incidentally, the Total Catchment Management Committee on the Manning is chaired by my predecessor in this place, Mr Bruce Cowan, who has continued with his community service in a very admirable way and is making a major contribution to the total management of that catchment and of the Manning River. This national river care initiative will help in managing that catchment and in managing how that river is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5714"> treated from here on. It is the lifeblood of the entire rural community in the Manning Valley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend this bill to the House. I challenge those senators who are considering voting against the bill on the linked partial privatisation of Telstra to reconsider their position and think about what the people of Australia voted for on 2 March&mdash;this key element of the coalition's policy when it was elected to government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill is the child of the marriage between the Liberal Party and certain sections of the environment movement, which decided to run away and elope at the last election. Before I talk about the product of this union, I want to say something about the marriage itself. It was well documented in an article by Simon Benson in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS>  of 8 June this year, a very revealing article indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Benson said that the coalition realised that their win in the Canberra by-election in 1995 was helped by a large green vote and sought to translate that into a federal campaign. He said that the federal director of the Liberal Party, Andrew Robb, and the environment spokesman, the now Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp), went on a recruitment drive of environment groups to try to win them over. He said that Mr Robb, Senator Kemp and the now Leader of the Government in the Senate, the Minister for the Environment  (Senator Hill), `went into serious negotiations with the conservationists' and that Mr Robb `was on the phone or meeting one of six key green group representatives on an average of once every 14 days until the Christmas before the election'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the final meeting, Mr Robb brought in the would-be Prime Minister. It was described as `make or break'. Benson reported that Australian Conservation Foundation's Jim Downey and Wilderness Society campaigner Alec Marr had believed, upon leaving the meeting, that they had converted the inconvertible. As events have shown, they were certainly conned. The article went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may come as no surprise then that two weeks ago&mdash;  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>this article was written back in June&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Robb and Marr went for an ecohelicopter ride together surveying wilderness areas in south-west Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA>He pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Wilderness Society stuck with the Coalition and its $1 billion environment policy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which this bill reflects&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">when others abandoned it at the 11th hour.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While not openly supporting the Coalition, in an unprecedented move the society declared the coalition's policy was as good as any previous Labor policy, if not better&mdash;regardless of its funding dependence on the partial sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA>The article went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Coalition has not fared well on its promise of environment protection . . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Already it has attacked what many believe are the crown jewels of the environment movement&mdash;Kakadu and uranium mining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has also rejected one of the "grand challenges"&mdash;greenhouse gas emission&mdash;and decided to snub its international obligations and kowtow to industry.</PARA>
<PARA>It then refers to a possible raising of the woodchip export quota, which, of course, has happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While claiming that the Wilderness Society never supported the Liberals, Mr Marr, as reported in the article, said that from an environment point of view, Telstra was a red herring and was not going to influence their assessment of the billion dollar environment package. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compared with what we would have got under Hewson we are doing all right . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What a lame defence. What a pitiful defence. I do not know whether Alec Marr noticed it or not, but John Hewson was not the alternative to John Howard at the last election; it was, in fact, the Labor government. It was that same Labor government which had saved the Franklin River from being dammed, that same Labor government which had saved Coronation Hill, that same Labor government which had saved the Daintree wilderness area, and that same Labor government which had put into action steps to protect Antarctica and other important heritage areas.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5715">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had nominated the Great Sandy Region, including Fraser Island, for world heritage listing and put Shark Bay in Western Australia on the list. We had led the push to make Antarctica free of mining for the next 50 years, incorporated Coronation Hill into Kakadu National Park, formed the EPA, increased funding for railways, set up the Wet Tropics Management Authority to manage the wet tropics world heritage area and we had increased the funding for programs to combat land degradation. We were the alternative. And what a pack of phonies this government has turned out to be when it comes to the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First, you had export controls on minerals. No sooner had the ink dried on the new ministerial letterhead when the government moved&mdash;unsuccessfully, I am pleased to say&mdash;to remove export controls on minerals. This would have removed the Commonwealth's ability to stop mining projects in certain areas of key environmental significance. It was this power that enabled the former Fraser Liberal government to ban sandmining on Fraser Island. When he was reminded of this fact, the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Parer, described that decision as an abuse of power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this is a government which is less environmentally sound and less environmentally committed than the Fraser government! It was the clear intention of this government to allow unfettered access for mining companies to mineral deposits and exports regardless of the environmental consequences. When you look at the shareholdings of certain ministers and members, it is hardly surprising that they should have attempted to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Second, you have had the proposals for further uranium mining in Kakadu. The speed with which the coalition government has begun consideration of a major expansion of uranium mining in world heritage listed Kakadu is breathtaking. Yet you have the Minister for the Environment completely ruling out a public inquiry into the proposal&mdash;and that is usually considered to be the most rigorous process for considering a mining project in such a sensitive and important area <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as Kakadu. Instead, all we are to get is a limited environmental impact statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to the election, there was quite a lot of equivocation by the coalition on uranium mining in Kakadu. On the Paul Lyneham program, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nightline</EMPHASIS>, on 14 February, John Howard, responding to Mr Lyneham's assertion that Australians would not want Kakadu touched, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I mean I have to say to you as a personal gut reaction, I wouldn't want to see it either.</PARA>
<PARA>But a month later, with an election win in his pocket, when he was asked again whether he would allow uranium mining at Jabiluka in Kakadu, he said that after it passed some yet to be determined environmental considerations `then things ought to be given the green light.' Even more illuminating, we have had the comments to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  by a spokesperson for the Minister for Resources and Energy that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under our policy, Jabiluka can be opened up. If they (Energy Resources Australia) think they can sell the ore and it's economically viable then it is up to them.</PARA>
<PARA>Third, we have had the woodchip export changes. If you go back to the pre-election period, the Prime Minister described Paul Keating as `Australia's champion woodchipper' and he said in a statement to the House in 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition believes that as a fundamental priority we must protect our high conservation value native forests.</PARA>
<PARA>But once they got into office you had the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) moving to disallow the current woodchip export regulations and you had the coalition government bringing in a new policy allowing for a one&hyphen;million tonne increase in export woodchipping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have also allowed for unlimited logging on privately owned land, which is a terrible mistake. It provides private landowners with an incentive to clear more land, when every environment report recommends against such practices. They are removing the penalties for states which do not make sufficient progress towards a comprehensive system of forest reserves and that, in turn, is likely to completely derail the national forest <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5716"> policy. Furthermore, you have had the government moving to water down the Commonwealth's criteria for a national system of forest reserves. In a departmental position paper released in July, they proposed to scrap the minimum forest conservation benchmark of 15 per cent of pre&hyphen;European forest type to be protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under that proposal, there are no guarantees that the goal of establishing a truly comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system will be achieved. In addition to scrapping that 15 per cent benchmark, the coalition has abandoned the previous government's sliding scale to protect 60 to 100 per cent of old growth forest depending on the percentage remaining in each forest type. This is what the government has moved to do in relation to forests and export woodchipping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You might say that forest policy is a very difficult area, and it is. There are competing public considerations and public interests. You might say that the government is endeavouring to make a tough and difficult decision. But it is more than that; they are proud of it. I draw the attention of the House to a question on notice asked by the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) back in August about what the government was doing for regional Australia&mdash;noting their many broken election commitments to regional Australia. The first response from the Prime Minister was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first and most important thing that should be said about the government decisions that have had a beneficial impact on the regions of Australia is the decision that this government took in relation to the woodchip industry.</PARA>
<PARA>And he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The path down which you were going in relation to the woodchip industry was a path that would have destroyed the livelihood of thousands of people in regional communities in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Before the election, the Prime Minister described Paul Keating as `Australia's champion woodchipper'. But after the election he refers to the importance of the woodchip industry in regional Australia and increases woodchip exports by one million tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only have we had their decisions in relation to woodchipping and their proposals <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in relation to uranium mining and export mining controls, we have also had the coalition going soft on greenhouse. Cabinet has decided to take an entirely defensive negotiating position on greenhouse gas emissions in international forums. The rising international tide is for stricter controls on greenhouse pollution, but the coalition's position signals a desire to stall this process which significantly threatens southern hemisphere countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have also had the coalition putting the future of the Environment Protection Agency in doubt. You have had the coalition approving the Hinchinbrook resort development and the destruction of mangroves without due consideration for the world heritage values of this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At every opportunity this government has taken a machete to the environment. Take a look at the budget. The environment budget was cut by $28 million with the Australian Nature Conservation Agency having its funding cut by $18 million, the Australian Heritage Commission having its funding cut by $3 million, the Environment Protection Agency having its funding cut by $4 million, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority having its funding cut and visitors to the Great Barrier Reef being subjected to increased fees. National landcare funding has been slashed by $200 million over a period of four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say that those green groups which were silly enough to fall for this have done their credibility a great deal of damage. Now there is to be increased woodchipping in this country and they will have to take their share of responsibility for that, having sold out the things they hold dear. If there are new uranium mines in Kakadu, they will have to take their share of responsibility for that, too, because the Labor policy was for no new mines in Kakadu or anywhere else. If Australia drags the chain on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, they will have to take their share of responsibility for that. If the Commonwealth abandons the Environment Protection Agency they will have to take their share of responsibility for that, too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They really should have known better. The Liberal and National parties have, after all, a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5717"> record of environmental vandalism as long as your arm: going back to the halting of the flooding of the Franklin River, the coalition opposed that; going back to the halting of mining at Coronation Hill, the coalition opposed that; going to the use of the external affairs powers to override the states on matters of critical environmental importance, the coalition opposed that, too; going to the use by the Commonwealth of its legal capacity to intervene to protect world heritage areas, the coalition opposed that, too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conservation movement in the last six to nine months has looked somewhat stunned but their response, in my view, has been pitiful. Where are the protest rallies? I marched in some of their protest rallies earlier on and it did not necessarily do me a lot of good in some quarters. A lot of people say, `Well, where are your environmental friends now?' Environmentalists need to understand that they have credibility only when there is a Labor government; they are on the agenda only under a Labor government. Their actions before the election and their lack of action since the March election have been highly damaging to their credibility. It is my experience that in Victoria in particular the public transport movement and the public housing movement have suffered from poor leadership. I certainly do not want the environment to go the same way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation, as other speakers have pointed out, is inextricably linked with the coalition's plan for the partial sale of Telstra. They have taken the environment hostage to the sale of Telstra and have pointed out many times that if the partial sale of Telstra does not proceed the items in this bill will not proceed. We know that the hostage taker never values his or her victim. What we have here is a mere stalking horse for privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nothing could demonstrate more clearly the coalition government's lack of commitment to the environment than the fact that it is this item which is made dependent on the partial sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You do not have the diesel fuel rebate being made conditional on the part sale of Telstra! You do not have the defence budget being made conditional on the part sale of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Telstra! It is a piece of massive hypocrisy. The environment is the lowest priority on the Howard government's shopping list. This is the one item that is expendable&mdash;and people who are concerned about the environment ought to think about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government is doing is asking the Australian community to preserve one essential national asset by selling another equally essential national asset. There can be a role in public policy for asset sales but the test must be the dependence of the community on that asset and whether the community's interest is protected by a sale. In this case the answer must be no. Privatising Telstra does not protect or enhance the community interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we were to accept that the Telstra&hyphen;environment trade&hyphen;off is a legitimate public policy position, what is likely to follow? Perhaps we could have the minister for territories selling off Christmas Island in order to give us a better transport infrastructure; or the foreign minister ceding to the United States control of parts of northern Australia so we could upgrade our defence forces; or the selling off of universities so the minister for education could boost our research and development funding; or the minister for sport selling off the Australian Institute of Sport to fund some health initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those examples sound absurd but they are no more absurd than the example before the parliament at present. The $1 billion supposed to be committed to the environment from the passage of this bill is entirely contingent on the one&hyphen;third privatisation of Telstra. This funding blackmail is unprecedented in Australian federal politics and opens the way for similar unprincipled deals from this government in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the environment is regarded as important it should receive certainty of funding from the consolidated revenue fund. Anything short of this exposes the government's lack of commitment to the environment. What will happen when the money runs out? I draw the attention of the house to a statement recently appearing in the science and technology magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Scitech</EMPHASIS>. It is headed `Natural Heritage Trust a fraud: admits Coalition senior adviser'. It says:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5718">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Howard Government's proposed Natural Heritage Trust is a "blatant and cynical political fraud", a senior Government adviser has admitted to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Scitech</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said this policy . . . was "invented overnight" as a means of attempting to soften potential public reaction against the planned sale of one&hyphen;third of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The plan had been . . . devised&mdash;as a "purely political exercise"&mdash;by the Federal Director of the Liberal Party, Mr Andrew Robb'.</PARA>
<PARA>It says that the adviser goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.. the extent of the deceit had "sickened" him&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Well it might&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;and a number of other Coalition staffers who were genuinely concerned about the national environment for the sake of their children and the nation's long&hyphen;term future.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>That gives the game away well and truly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to express a concern that the trust fund being established under this bill evades the scrutiny of parliament. Convention dictates that, prior to the establishment of a trust fund under the authority of parliament to meet further expenditure, the government should demonstrate that alternative arrangements are unsuitable. This has not been done and trust funds restrict parliamentary scrutiny. This bill will diminish parliament's ability to vet expenditure of the order of $400 million. We need to have program funding of this character scrutinised by the parliament each and every year. The fund is to be administered by a board consisting of only two members&mdash;the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. This is, to say the least, a most unusual arrangement and may well lead to rorts in the electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is a ransom note to the Australian public, and the government is saying we can only protect and enhance our environment if we hand over Telstra. The opposition supports the measures in the bill, but we do not support the sale of Telstra. We believe that this kind of expenditure ought to come from consolidated revenue, and we regard the bill as a piece of monumental hypocrisy. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, I welcome the opportunity of speaking on the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill because I share your compassion for the environment. I am sure most members in this House have a great and undivided respect for the environment. In this bill, we are actually arguing over the mechanics on how to maintain and look after our heritage for future generations. Part of this bill is the appropriation of funds&mdash;$16 million&mdash;to look after and protect the native fauna. I want to address my comments today specifically to native fauna.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am about to say to the House may be derided and may concern some within the community because I am calling for the total eradication of domestic and feral cats from the Australian mainland and offshore islands by the year 2020. I make this statement without malice but with the utmost compassion for our native animals, a passion for Australia and its flora and fauna and with the deepest respect for cat owners within the community. I have family members who are cat owners and I am sure there are many people who have a great love for cats. It was Mark Twain who said that a home is not a home without a much loved, much petted and very well fed cat. Albert Schweitzer had a cat called Susie and he trained himself to write right&hyphen;handed because Susie used to snuggle into his left hand which prohibited him from writing. Florence Nightingale had 50 cats at home which she looked after. A lot of things I am about to say today are supported by the cat protection society of Victoria as well, but not the total eradication of cats, which is what I am calling for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all seem to be aware of the introduced species such as the Queensland cane toad, rabbits, foxes, camels or even goats. However, by far the most destructive to our environment is the cat. I was not aware of the full impact of the cat on our environment&mdash;I believe few Australians are&mdash;but it was with somewhat of a shock that I learned through research that the domestic cat or, more correctly, the owned cat as well as the feral cat is a carnivore of the first order, eagerly and willingly eating its way through our precious and unique native fauna. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5719">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cats of Australia have certainly made their choice, and it is the millions of native animals that they eat or kill each year. Let me make it perfectly clear. The difference between the moggy next door and the feral cat is only one meal. A hungry moggy can and does kill native animals. I say again that we really must, for the sake of our environment, change our way of thinking about cats. They are not, nor have they ever been, the cute kitten featured in children's books and gift cards and found in one in every three homes in Australia. The domestic cat is an efficient and indiscriminate killer. It can quickly and easily revert to its wild state and live as a feral animal without any human contact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This cat problem is a huge problem for Australia. Their impact on the environment is huge and the solution demands a huge undertaking by government and the community, as well as a huge sacrifice by cat owners. Essentially, moggies are only domestic when they are properly cared for, well fed, de&hyphen;sexed, trained and kept indoors. Indeed, cats move from domestic to feral and back to domestic depending on their circumstances. Most importantly, it is only domestic when it is well fed by humans. At any other time and in any other circumstance it is a known killer of native animals. Its natural instincts make it an irrepressible killer and hunter, with a preference for native animals either as food or sport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even under household circumstances, domestic cats bring home five to 10 birds each, on average, per year. This results in millions of birds being killed annually in large cities like Melbourne and Sydney. This predation accounts for most of the young birds bred in suburban areas each year. In addition, cats are known to kill and eat more than 100 species of birds, 50 species of mammals, 50 species of reptiles, three species of frogs and numerous invertebrate animals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have in my box today a number of animals supplied to me by the Museum of Western Australia which I was going to table, but I think it is probably not appropriate. They include a western rosella, a bandicoot, a chocolate wattled bat, a possum, a native rat and a honey possum. These have been killed <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by cats. I thank the Museum of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cats kill prey up to their own body size and most of Australia's endangered and vulnerable mammals, birds and reptiles are in this category. They are aggressively adaptable, vary in size depending on their preferred prey and vary in colour depending on their environment. I spoke to a ranger from the Northern Territory who told me that the biggest feral cat he has seen in the Northern Territory was the size of a dingo. That concerned me and certainly concerned him when he was chasing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exact numbers of feral cats differs depending on whom you speak to. Mr Bob Martin, the then New South Wales opposition spokesman on agriculture, claimed in 1993 that feral cats numbered around 18 million. In 1994, the then Queensland land minister, Molly Robson, claimed numbers to be up to 12 million, and other sources suggest 5 million. Although these numbers sound significant, they must be considered and understood in appropriate terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is necessary to briefly review a few facts about Australian native animals in general. In this case I have chosen some examples that are part of a feral cat's dietary menu. These facts are both alarming and a sad indictment on our understanding of our native species. However, the facts speak for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has more threatened species of amphibians and reptiles than any other country in the world. In this century alone, Australia has one-third of all recorded world extinctions of mammal species. Since the European settlement of Australia&mdash;a comparatively short period of time&mdash;more than one-third of arid Australia's original mammal species have vanished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Medium&hyphen;sized mammals such as bandicoots, bilbies, hare&hyphen;wallabies, woylies, boodies, possums and numbats have become either totally or locally extinct in Australia's arid zone. It has been determined that Australia has 1,031 threatened species&mdash;we are only second in the world to the USA in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To realise the significance of this in real terms, I take the example of the 81 species of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5720"> Australian native wombats, possums and kangaroos. Of these, six are now extinct, 11 endangered and a further 23 are vulnerable. Another example is: of the original 11 species of bandicoots and bilbies, three are extinct, two endangered and four vulnerable. Nine of the original species are in real trouble.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A long list supplied by the Australian Bureau of Statistics specifying the main species particularly affected by cats has 38 specific examples. They include the Antarctic tern, the red&hyphen;fronted parrot, the bilby, the long&hyphen;footed potoroo and the numbat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Current figures supplied in my research assume that, on average, there is one feral cat for each 15 square kilometres. This means that there may be around 130,000 feral cats in the arid interior of Western Australia alone. Let me be perfectly clear that this example we are speaking about represents only a small proportion of the Australian continent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A feral cat kills at least three native animals each day. On those figures, in one year the total number of native animals killed by cats in the western desert alone could be a staggering 142 million. Alarming as this figure of 142 million is, it is only the tip of the iceberg. Cats in extreme densities can peak at around 220 cats per square kilometre, as recorded in the Seychelles this decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This could loosely mean that the figure of 142 million may well represent less than one per cent of the total carnage of our native fauna. One can only speculate as to the devastation across Australia, but the actual numbers may well be simply mind&hyphen;blowing and well into the hundreds of millions each year, if not more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Seebeck of the Victorian Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, when speaking of cats, declared that it is high time these marauding bushrangers were locked away. The same document states Victorian scientist B.J. Coman's opinion as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let a cat out the house door and it should be immediately regarded as feral.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me be very clear on this issue. Australia is currently experiencing an ecological tragedy. For the most part today I have focused the argument of cat eradication mostly on one <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> issue&mdash;the diet of and the carnage inflicted by cats. However, the impact on wildlife is not limited to kills; it includes the transmission of disease and death from those diseases. Injured animals and birds often die from cat bites within 36 hours either from shock or disease inflicted by cat bites or scratches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further studies have shown that 10 per cent of urban and 20 per cent of unowned cats are infected with larval stages of tapeworm and that cats carry ringworm. To my way of thinking, cats are killers either through their diet in that they consume native animals, through their habit and character in that they are natural hunters and killers who can kill without the need to consume their prey, or through hosting a suite of diseases and parasites that may not affect humans but do have an impact on other animals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This option of eradication of all cats by the year 2020 to save our wildlife will not be accepted without some strong opposition. Let us look at the usual range of reasons for Australians keeping the more than three million domestic cats that we have in Australia. There is no question that most families with cats look after them&mdash;they are well fed, well petted and well loved and they stay inside at night-time&mdash;but a lot of cats do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The companionship argument is somewhat short&hyphen;lived because in South Australia, for example, animal welfare agencies destroy more than 10,000 unwanted cats each year and Victoria is said to have some 300,000 stray cats. Multiply this figure across Australia and maybe the companionship offered by cats is not all that popular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the argument that they are effective in rodent control of the house mouse, the report of the Cat Working Party of 1992 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no evidence that cat predation has any significant impact on the population size of any introduced rodent in Australia . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The argument that cats are easier to control than dogs does not really hold up either. All you need to do is ask a cat owner who is trying to confine a cat to their own backyard. Cats may not keep you awake at night by barking, but they sure make a considerable racket when on the prowl for a mate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5721">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the decision will be tough. We, the people of Australia, must make a conscious decision as to what is more important. We have a clear choice. We can choose either to have cats and risk the rapid decline of native animals or to seek the elimination of cats and the retention of our native fauna.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am conscious of the time so I am going to wind up my speech by making a couple of recommendations. These are the recommendations that I think will help the eradication of the domestic cat and, subsequently, the feral cat because, as I said before, the domestic cat is only one good meal away from being feral. They will go far to restoring the natural balance of fauna in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am calling for the registration of all cats and a display of cat identification at all times. I am also calling for the registration of litters&mdash;how, when and where the disposal took place. I am looking for mandatory veterinary reporting of cat mistreatment and neglect. I am looking for the total ban on experimentation on cats. I am looking for ownership by law to establish ownership and change of ownership registration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also calling for the mandatory sterilisation of all cats over the age of six months unless owned by a registered breeder. I am also asking for limiting the number of cats to two per household, impounding stray and nuisance cats and a cat curfew. I am asking for an education program for owners, potential owners and school children on responsible care of pets as well as wildlife warnings on the damage they do to the environment. I am also asking for the registration of cat outlets and suppliers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just conclude by putting this argument in the hands of experts. I quote from an article by Mr Jack Kinnear from the Wildlife Research Centre at Woodvale in Western Australia, which is in the electorate of Cowan. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From a strictly scientific viewpoint, the jury is out regarding cats because the necessary research has not been done.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From a common sense viewpoint, the jury is in because, all things considered, it is hard to dismiss this adaptable carnivore as a bit-player in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> struggle for existence in the Australian bush. It is time to get serious about cats.</PARA>
<PARA>I reiterate: it is time we in Australia get serious about cats.</PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (Jagajaga)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.45 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are talking about our natural heritage, and what I want to focus on in my remarks today is the need for our natural heritage to extend to the urban environment where most Australians live. To talk about the natural heritage, what I want to do is emphasise the way in which that heritage can enhance the lives of the majority of Australians. Of course, that depends on how it is treated by individuals, communities and all levels of government. It is very important to emphasise that our natural heritage should not be seen as only those very special places that are protected by world heritage or national parks. They are very special places that should be protected, but we need to take a much broader view of our natural heritage&mdash;an all&hyphen;embracing view that extends to those places where the majority of Australians live.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the case that local communities do not wait for governments to take practical steps about enhancing their local environments. That said, however, it is incumbent on governments at all levels to support and facilitate these activities of local communities through funding, regulation and, of course, overall protection. I will have more to say about governments a little later on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own electorate of Jagajaga, we have the perfect example of the way in which local communities get involved in protecting, enhancing and improving their local environment&mdash;both the heritage of our local area, which is very special, and also our natural environmental assets. The most practical example of this&mdash;which I know Deputy Speaker Jenkins will be very familiar with&mdash;is the sheer number and diversity of local groups involved in this endeavour. Since becoming the member for Jagajaga, I have established a local group called Envirowatch, which involves all of the local environmental groups that are individually and collectively seeking to enhance our environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These groups are very diverse. They cover the Darebin Parklands Association, Friends of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5722"> Diamond Creek, Friends of St Helena Bush Reserve, Friends of the Eltham Copper Butterfly, Friends of Yandell Reserve, Friends of Yarra Valley Metropolitan Parks, the Latrobe Valley Metropolitan Parks, the Latrobe University Friends of the Wildlife Reserve, Lower Plenty River Support Group, Montmorency Field Naturalist Club, Protection of Public Lands Coalition, the Riverland Conservation Society of Heidelberg, the Rosanna Parklands Protection Association, the Warringal Conservation Society, both the councils&mdash;the shire of Nillumbik and the Banyule City Council&mdash;and I am pleased to say that Greening Australia Victoria is located in the electorate of Jagajaga.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of these groups are very active at a very practical level in protecting our local waterways, in protecting public land and in trying to do some very practical things such as controlling weeds and planting trees. What they also do is lobby, organise and, through all of their activities, seek to protect the local environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no question that they are the foundation on which any national environmental policy can work. It is the case that these groups not only care about their local environment but also care very much about what is happening globally. They care very much about the effect of local activities on both the nation and our global environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is the case that they decided locally that their priorities would focus on air pollution and related transport issues. They see the Kennett approach to the environment. I would have to say that our Premier in Victoria seems to have a love affair with the car, and this is extending into our local electorate, because we are seeing more and more proposals for extensions of roadways. But what our local environmental groups and communities are concerned about is the rapid increase in asthma amongst our children, the deterioration of air quality in our local area and the decrease in use of public transport. So we have decided as a community to actively lobby and make this a priority in our local area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is&mdash;as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;a very special part of Melbourne. It is a special part of Melbourne because of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Yarra River, the green wedge and the many parks and waterways that need to be protected. What is it in this Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill that might help this protection? I am afraid to say that there is very little, largely because this bill does not go to some of the critical urban environmental issues with which I am very concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to just turn to the latest StreamWatch report from Melbourne Parks and Waterways, which lists its key concerns about water quality and the very high levels of sediment and nutrient and poor microbiological quality that exist in our local area in the Yarra River, the Plenty River and the two major creeks. The reason for this poor quality in our waterways is, of course, the result of our urban development policies. Urban stormwater run-off is a bit like the emphasis on cats by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Cowan, (Mr Richard Evans).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Urban stormwater run-off is never seen as a very exciting issue to pursue, but it is this issue of urban stormwater and urban development that is leading to a major continuing deterioration in the quality of our waterway. There is limited treatment of run-off before it enters our waterways through the stormwater drainage system, and it is the result of construction activity, vehicle movement, agricultural activities, manufacturing air emissions and the day-to-day living that generates the contaminants. Those remarks are taken from this latest StreamWatch report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly want to emphasise in the StreamWatch report two areas in my electorate: the lower reaches of the Yarra River downstream from Warrandyte and the Darebin and Diamond Creeks. I am sorry to say that in both those areas the StreamWatch report rates water quality as moderate to poor and as containing increasing levels of sediment contaminations. These are areas which need an enormous amount of our attention and effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, Labor supports many of the things in the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill. It is the case that many of the things contained in the bill are Labor policy. If we look at the support for the Murray&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5723">Darling or the coastal initiatives, all these things could be found in Labor's policies before the election. But we do not agree with the way in which this government is seeking to raise the funds for the environment. As the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) said, we do not agree that we should be holding the environment hostage to the sale of one of Australia's pre-eminent assets&mdash;Telstra. It is important to say in this regard that, although there are many things in this bill that we do support, we have to look at the government's pre-election promises. The sale of Telstra and the $1 billion going into the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia would be on top of the environment budget. But we find that the environment budget for 1996&hyphen;97 is in fact only $190.5 million&mdash;a cut of 13 per cent in last year's allocation by the Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also seen the abolition of the better cities program&mdash;a program which enabled the related issues of urban development and environmental degradation to be addressed. We have seen both a reduction in the overall environmental budget and a massive cut as a result of the better cities program. These are the reasons we oppose this bill. We oppose this bill because it is holding this country to ransom. It is saying, `We'll only take this issue of the environment seriously if Telstra is privatised.' Once Telstra is privatised and there is no more income from this magnificent publicly owned enterprise, what will be the result for the environment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to look at this government's environmental credentials more broadly. There are dramatic changes to federal export controls on woodchipping which mean that we will see a significant increase in woodchipping in our native forests. There is a cut to the Environmental Protection Agency. The government wants to approve a new uranium mine in Kakadu National Park. It wants to back away from our commitment to greenhouse gas reductions. It has given the green light to Hinchinbrook which, of course, threatens one of our world heritage values.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government also said before the election that, in dealing with world heritage <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> issues, it would consult the states when making recommendations on world heritage listings. The government is now saying that states can have a veto on any area that might be listed for world heritage. I suggest that this is yet another example of the lack of leadership of this national government. Basically they are saying to the states, `If you don't agree with it, we won't push for it. It doesn't matter how special it is. It doesn't matter how important it is to our nation. If you've got a problem we won't be showing any national leadership.' It is the same sort of approach that we have seen over the last few days with ministerial conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to go back to the issue of urban development because this is an issue with which I have quite a long history. It is something that I am very pleased to be able to add to in this debate. In my previous life as the Director of the Urban and Regional Development Review, I was responsible for putting together a major study called Green Cities. We actually looked at the way in which the ecological sustainability of Australia's urban areas could be enhanced. I think it is time that the sustainability of our urban areas got as much attention as the sustainability of other parts of Australia. It is the case that the structure of Australian cities&mdash;where the vast majority of Australians live&mdash;contributes significantly to a range of environmental problems. I want to touch on the most significant of those problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first problem is urban air quality. There is ongoing concern about urban air quality in Australia, primarily because of our significant dependence on motor vehicles. It is our reliance on the car that is central to our concerns. The second problem is Australia's high level of urbanisation and low density settlement patterns. Of course these are related to our high rate of use of the car and our poor fuel economy. These things are leading to the high level of per capita energy use and, of course, our high per capita greenhouse gas emissions. What do we see from this government on greenhouse gas emissions? No attempt to deal with urban development, no attempt to deal with energy use and no attempt to deal with issues around motor <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5724"> vehicles. There is a movement away from any commitment to reduce Australia's contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government think it is too hard. They will not put the money in. They will not put the effort in. They will not get into the difficult negotiations. Difficult discussions and negotiations have to surround urban development and use of the car. They are things that affect the way we live our lives. Unless we get serious about these issues our urban environment will continue to decline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third area is urban waste. Australians are very large generators of waste across a wide range of different types of waste. It is the case that Australian governments previously had set a target of halving the amount of waste by the year 2000. Unless reduction initiatives are put in place we will have no hope of addressing this target. Of course, we have had complete silence from the other side about this very critical issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Urban water, as I have already indicated in my previous remarks, is another matter of great significance for our environment. Once again, the impact of urban development on the environmental quality of our waterways is substantial. Health threats, loss of recreational amenity from bacteria, blue&hyphen;green algae, loss of aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity by habitat destruction and polluted waters all come as a result of urban development. All of these things come as a result of not taking seriously the environmental impact of our urban development practices. These are the things that have to be addressed as part of our thinking about our natural heritage if we want to make sure that our urban water quality is improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final issue I want to talk about is coastal  urbanisation. It is the case, as everybody in this place would know, that recreation and conservation values are threatened by the continued scale of urbanisation, particularly in northern New South Wales and south-east Queensland. The major problem once again is the result of increased water pollution, which of course is the almost inevitable consequence of a general process of coastal urbanisation. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the priorities of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill, we need to see each and every one of these issues&mdash;coastal urbanisation, urban water improvement, urban waste reduction, urban energy use reduction and urban air quality improvement&mdash;addressed by a serious analysis and change to the way in which we develop our cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that we can improve the sustainability of Australia's urban areas, but to do that we need to take serious action on our planning and development processes. It is not good enough for the national government to just wipe its hands and say, `These aren't matters for us. We'll just leave that to the state governments or to local governments. We won't get involved in these national planning issues.' I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that these are now national planning issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot meet our international obligations for protection of the world's greenhouse arrangements if we do not act as a nation. We will not address our problems on the coasts unless we take national planning action. We will not address the waste problems in this nation unless there is national action. It cannot be the case that the national government washes its hands of these problems, because they are national problems. They require national leadership and action that needs to come from this Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill&mdash;a bill that must be funded honestly and up-front through the consolidated fund, not through the sale of one of Australia's most wonderful assets, Telstra.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is one of the most satisfying moments of my professional career. Eighteen months ago I accepted the challenge from the now Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) to be involved in the development of the finest environmental program this country had seen. Senator Kemp was intent on reminding the nation that, over the decades, the coalition had led the environmental reforms in Australia and, given a chance, would again. He did and we have. Witness the coalition's saving our natural heritage policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of late, Labor might claim the patronage of green issue activists as it fuelled, fanned and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5725"> fondled environmental hot spots before dousing the flames of their own creation, to the joy of those drawn into the smoke. But on a clear day, away from the frenzy and Labor gum flapping, ordinary people with a genuine concern for our environment could see it going backwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our natural systems were decaying, our ecology was under stress and the productive capacity of what nature passed to our care was threatened by Labor's inactivity. Australians everywhere grew tired of waiting, disillusioned by more and more Labor big talk and continuing inactivity, with the only gain being the inclusion of a new phrase in our vocabulary&mdash;`greenwash', the environmental equivalent of `whitewash'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Greenwash is the best description I have heard of Labor's often pronounced initiatives and convictions about the proper care and management of our environment, for the big talk, while almost every measure they talked about still led to the environment declining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the environment is another example of what Labor does best through its condition, creation and care cycle towards constructed political dependency. This distinctly Labor approach to politics sees it create a condition or allow one to develop, assert that it is the only party who can care for those affected by the condition and the condition itself and claim to be vigorous and committed to rectifying the condition while all the while allowing the condition to perpetuate. So the building blocks of politically dependent strategic constituencies begin to be formed. But the degradation continued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People are tired of waiting. They wanted the  environmental and political rot to stop. Fifty&hyphen;two per cent of Australians surveyed in a 1993 ANOP opinion poll believed that the Australian environment had deteriorated over the last five years. The facts back up this perception.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's practical plan of direct action and investment in the care and recovery of our nation's natural systems is embraced in the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill currently before the House and is fully funded through the companion legislation for the partial sale of Telstra. The Natural <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Heritage Trust program is a tangible and targeted set of initiatives that will make substantial inroads into the significant environmental challenges facing our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All Labor can offer is the well rehearsed hand wringing of the opposition spokesperson and claims about what Labor would have done if re-elected. The majority of Australians agreed that we could not afford another term of Labor standing by wasting time and resources while the environment continued to deteriorate. The member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) tried to talk up Labor's expenditure plans for the environment and overlooked or simply failed to recall the $11 billion Labor would first have to find to fill the black hole in its forward estimates before finding any new funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The environment would have taken a hit under a Labor government, if re&hyphen;elected, as it tried to recover some fiscal credibility. True to form, Labor would have punished those environmental groups and interests who praised the coalition's policy after objectively comparing it with Labor's track record. In fact, the member for Fremantle dished out a backhander to the Surfriders Foundation for being supportive of the coalition's program in her forgettable contribution to the debate on the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) was standing up here earlier criticising environmental groups who praised what we were proposing. He went so far as to say that the only way environment groups could retain their credibility was to support the ALP. Most people who are genuinely concerned about the environment cannot overlook the fact that the environment went backwards while Labor sat and watched. The politics of punishment would probably ring true when the Labor people opposite looked at the Senate committee report and found that the World Wide Fund for Nature said of the bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We feel that, in general terms, the thrust of the Natural Heritage Trust Bill is excellent for the environment.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Conservation Foundation said in its 24 July 1996 submission:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5726">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If implemented, the initiatives outlined in the Bill should achieve significant environmental gains in the areas of land and waste management.</PARA>
<PARA>The CSIRO, in its 22 August submission, reaffirmed the government's view that something significant had to be done:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to halt any further deterioration of Australia's resource base, to support its rehabilitation, and to secure our country's future on a basis which is sustainable in both economic and ecological terms.</PARA>
<PARA>Those people probably came out speaking about the coalition's program knowing that we had won the election on 2 March and the politics of punishment were not going to swing by their way. While the opposition begrudgingly recognises the obvious merit of the Natural Heritage Trust's program, it seeks to undermine the benefits that will accrue to the environment and our nation by obstructing the secure funding mechanism proposed for the trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill is about maintaining, restoring and improving Australia's natural capital&mdash;our waterways, our coasts, our ecosystems and all the species that benefit from and thrive within them. Because $700 million of the trust's money will be expended on five interdependent environmental packages covering vegetation, rivers, biodiversity, landcare and coasts and oceans, $300 million will be left at the end of the five years which will be held in perpetuity as a capital base. Interest earned from those funds will continue to enhance the Australian environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will briefly discuss some detailed aspects of the bill. The first part I would like to talk about is the national vegetation initiative&mdash;that is, $254 million over five years to begin in 1997-98. In the coalition's policy document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Saving our natural heritage</EMPHASIS>, mention is made that this proposal will greatly assist in revegetating degradated land, in conserving remnant vegetation and habitats and in rehabilitating our coastal zones while all the while adding to the natural greenhouse gas sink that vegetation presents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Over five years, the government will provide $163 million to implement the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin 2001 project plus additional measures. Unlike Labor's unfunded commit ment to the 2001 project, the coalition has included measures to facilitate the restoration of environmental flows and the regeneration of native fish populations in the basin's river systems. It was pleasing to listen to the experts at the recent meeting of the Prime Minister's Science and Engineering Council talk about the importance of environmental flows and native fish to the renewal of the Murray-Darling Basin in the knowledge that the coalition had already recognised these ecological concerns and proposed a plan to do something about them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's $85 million national river care initiative is one of the programs that adds to the restoration of riparian environments outside the basin. The program is particularly important to Dunkley by the bay. Community river and creek action plans, such as that prepared for Kananook and Sweetwater creeks, and stormwater management plans are two of the areas that will be considered for funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the national wetlands program is a lot smaller, an additional $8 million over four years is significant in that the best Labor could come up with during its 13 years was a draft national wetlands strategy. The coalition government wants to consult with the states to pursue this policy further. I am working to ensure that the Seaford&hyphen;Edithvale wetlands are added to the Ramsar sites while the other sites are removed from another list of Ramsar sites that the World Wide Fund for Nature says are being threatened by developments or poor management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coast and clean seas initiative of an additional $100 million over four years is most important, particularly to Dunkley by the bay. For those in the gallery, Dunkley by the bay is on the Mornington Peninsula in Victoria.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a wonderful part of the world, and I commend you all to pop down and see how wonderful it is for yourselves. This is double Labor's proposed spending over the same period. Our coastline is under threat from its own popularity and the inherent pressures that come with urban communities. I would commend to honourable <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5727"> members the Royal Australian Planning Institute's draft good practice guidelines for integrated coastal planning as a useful tool in ensuring that the multiple and often competing coastal resource values are properly managed. I would also commend it to the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), and that may give her a different impression of some of the comments she made earlier today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coast and clean seas initiative will support the continuing improvement in the condition of Port Phillip Bay. While the extensive 1995 CSIRO/Melbourne Water study gave the bay a very good bill of health, the threat posed by stormwater and the discharge of ballast water into the bay were identified as key areas of concern. The Natural Heritage Trust provides the capacity to support local and state agencies to tackle both of these concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed recently the installation of a litter trap in Kananook Creek at Frankston's Beach Street footbridge to collect litter washed down from Frankston streets. I refer to that particular point because the drainage manager of Melbourne Water pointed out and reaffirmed that urban stormwater run&hyphen;off is the biggest single contributor to pollutants in Port Phillip Bay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Mornington company Pollutec has also developed an innovative method of removing litter and residue from stormwater drains. The company currently has its people in the United States talking to very excited and interested American authorities about the Pollutec system and the technology it implements. I hope our domestic authorities do not require a US endorsement before we embrace Pollutec's home-grown ingenuity in environmental management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coasts and clean seas initiative also embraces the development of a long overdue oceans policy. It is a policy that would seek to improve our research and understanding of fish populations, model what sustainable use will do to them and also ensure that we fulfil our obligations for Australia's exclusive economic zone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The programs contained in the Natural Heritage Trust are quite exciting and very relevant to my local electorate. The most <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pressing point that comes forward when we talk about this Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill is that it is the Howard government's recognition that we have to work to a plan of action, not just formulate 50 different plans, as Labor did, without, as it was in their case, providing a fully funded means of converting those good words into worthwhile, meaningful deeds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By way of illustration, I am using just some of the catchment and land management plans from the Murray-Darling Basin as a lectern today&mdash;plans that have been prepared with community input and the best available environmental expertise but that wait for the formation and funding of the Natural Heritage Trust to be fully implemented. I will present these plans to the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) in recognition of the fact that the member for Murray with her coalition colleagues, this government and the Natural Heritage Trust are the best hope for the restoration of the natural systems in the Murray-Darling Basin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Natural Heritage Trust represents a commitment to act upon the countless plans for action and implement the expertise this nation has accumulated over many years. We cannot allow funds to be siphoned away from community activity on the ground. The community component of landcare was rightly criticised in 1993-94 for being only 13 per cent; it was lifted to 59.1 per cent in Labor's last year, 1995-96; and it was raised admirably by this government in its first budget, in 1996-97, to 81.5 per cent. This is the sort of coalition commitment to tangible activities and work benefiting and involving the community upon which the Natural Heritage Trust is based.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The development of key indicators of our environment's health, as set out and advocated by the 1996 State of the Environment report, is welcome. As the OECD has suggested, environmental indicators have four main uses. They can integrate environmental concerns into policy making, measure environmental performance, integrate economic and environmental decision making to give a better informed outcome and they can be used to report on the state of the environment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5728">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governments need to know the effects of policies and programs. We need to monitor and recognise changes in the condition of our natural systems. The community must be informed of the results of investing public money in this important area. In fiscally tight times the whole community will continue to support increasing government expenditure on the environment only if the benefits can be clearly demonstrated and communicated. This is the role of environmental key performance indicators. This is an area that I am sure the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) would love me to continue talking about ever so briefly. This is why environmental key performance indicators and the initiative of the Minister for the Environment in this area are so important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The challenge of incorporating environmental facts into economic decision making brings us into the area of environmental accounting. The task of accurately valuing our natural system is before us. The task of recognising the value of nature in the balance sheets of this country will reaffirm to many Australians how important it is to preserve those assets and how important it is to invest in their ongoing development and sustainability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point towards the work of the Australian Accounting Research Foundation in an area that I talked about in my former life with the Victorian government. That foundation is doing some work on the valuation of self&hyphen;generating and regenerating assets&mdash;like forest trees. It is on track to develop an exposure draft based on discussion paper No. 23, which talks about how to reliably value the growth that comes through certain self&hyphen;renewing and self&hyphen;generating crops such as plantation timber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is important. With that sound financial base we can draw superannuation funds, other investors, into investing in timber plantations and other self&hyphen;renewing crops and resources, recognising that they can reflect the growth in their balance sheets and report back to their shareholders that their asset is growing and that it can be transferred and traded as an asset. In Victoria's case, there is an examination of the creation of a separate property <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> right so that the ownership of the asset, the tree, can be separated from the earth on which it sits. Then that asset, the growth in the tree, can be traded between different interests&mdash;again recognising the value of it, and again encouraging people to invest in that sort of investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Being able to demonstrate results goes further to support the restoration of our natural system by encouraging the volunteer efforts that are so much a part of contemporary environmentalism. While fewer than six per cent of Australians were members of an environmental group in 1993, according to an ABS survey, over 28 per cent said that they would donate time or money to activities that helped protect the environment. This generosity will continue only if the results can be demonstrated&mdash;and I am sure the Chief Government Whip (Mr Cadman) would agree entirely with that comment. This legislation is about real projects which will produce real benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The $1 billion Natural Heritage Trust is not just innovative but also worthy of the title of the best government environmental initiative since the Commonwealth was founded in 1901. The greatest feature of the Natural Heritage Trust is that the coalition is replacing Labor's mania for plans, plans and more plans with action, action and more action. Not only do I commend this bill to the House, but I publicly call upon those in the other place, such as the Australian Democrats and Independents, who genuinely care for our environment, to recognise just how important the fully funded Natural Heritage Trust is to Australia's environmental future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill for an act to establish a Natural Heritage Trust fund for environmental programs of natural significance is the classic piece of economic subterfuge. It is the government's way of ensnaring the collective environmental conscience of the nation. It questions the environmental bona fides of non-government members of this House&mdash;and I suspect there are those on the government side who also have grave doubts about this Telstra sale funded commitment to the environment. It is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5729"> slick politics and lousy policy, cobbled together as an election prospectus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without the sale of Telstra there is no heritage trust fund, no environmental fall back. During the election campaign, the then opposition leader, Mr Howard, confirmed that a coalition government would not provide additional funds to pay for its $1.5 billion environmental policy if parliament refused to approve the one-third sale of Telstra. Already the government's environmental credentials are evident in the budget where there has been a reduction in environment related commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Alternative energy research is one of those. The exciting ethanol fuel industry, which involved the Manildra Group in my electorate, had its program ripped from under it. To save $21 million in ethanol bounty incentives, and about $5 million for research and development and a pilot program, the government has buckled to the oil company giants who refuse to take part in the distribution of this ethanol fuel. Here we have an industry that could have generated jobs throughout regional Australia&mdash;in sugar cane areas, forests, grain growing areas, cotton growing areas, in urban areas, using waste cotton trash, crop stubble and even sawdust to create a product that would dramatically reduce greenhouse gas and environmental pollutants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has refused to endorse greenhouse emission targets the rest of the developed world regards as sensible. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We as a nation have obligations under international law to protect and conserve our environment, yet we have no environment commitment outside this Telstra sale. I realise we rely on coal fired power, but we must take every opportunity to develop alternative energy. We cannot delay the inevitable. We must take every opportunity to clean our air, but the funding provided for the environment through this fund is grossly insufficient. The former Labor government had refused to renew its commitment to solar power car visions, like those of Hans Tholstrup and others. This government too has confirmed that ruling. This fledgling research may well be headed offshore. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dramatic growth of the timber industry in my own electorate, around Oberon, shows what can be achieved through expansion of production in the softwood industry without relying on native forests. We cannot forever argue that jobs in the timber industry should be the sole judge of our forest policy. That sort of thinking belongs to the bad old days of the 1960s and 1970s in Australian forest management. Forestry plantations are our future. New forests, new resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyone without prior research of our inland river crisis, which I have watched and reported with growing concern for almost 20 years, who attended the Prime Minister's science council meeting recently will be staggered by the extent of the problem in the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin. The removal of trees and land clearing over the greater part of this and last century has left a legacy that will take generations to correct, if ever. A billion trees will be just a blur on the landscape with two to three times that number, I am told, expected to disappear in the interim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The salt map of the Shepparton area in Victoria displayed at the seminar showed excessive salination in 1987 and a projection of these areas the salt would spread to by the year 2020. That projection is with us now. The blue&hyphen;green algae problems of the Darling have been well documented in recent years with the aerial shots of the green, turgid Darling of the 1991 summer still etched in our minds&mdash;or they should be. It was a graphic reminder of what we have done to our environment in a little over 100 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The blue&hyphen;green algae crisis, born not of farm chemicals and fertilisers alone but mainly from urban phosphate run&hyphen;off, has caused major problems not only on the Darling but also right back through the system&mdash;along the Macquarie and back to Burrendong Dam and even further back, to the very top of the water catchment system in the tablelands area of my electorate. In recent years too, blue&hyphen;green algae has appeared in Wyangala Dam, once thought to be pristine, pure mountain water. Downstream of Wyangala we have vast environmental problems along the Lachlan.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5730">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyone who has driven the Cowra to Boorowa road, as I do regularly, knows not only of the terrible state of the road but also of the salt problems of much of that country. The salt has in fact risen beneath the road in sections and is part of the cause of road surface break-up. But that rising salt is also flushed down the Boorowa River, joining the Lachlan above Cowra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was horrified to hear from a senior water resources officer late last year that fresh flushes of water from Wyangala Dam are released at regular intervals to dilute the salt in the Lachlan. That part of the Lachlan is way upstream of the area south-west of Condobolin where salt is a major and obvious problem, with thousands of dead trees testament to the insidious climbing water table pushing salt ahead of it. In Forbes the salt has broken out in parks, streets and other areas around the town.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin Commission has just released survey data showing that the salinity trends in the rivers and streams of the Murray and Darling drainage basins have increased alarmingly in the past 20 to 25 years. If these trends continue, says the commission, the salt levels will be almost seven times greater than previously estimated. The commission also says that if present land management practices continue up to five million hectares of New South Wales could be at risk, which compares with the previous predictions of 1.5 million hectares throughout the whole of the southern part of the basin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Increased salt loads and rising ground water levels are combining to create a salination environmental disaster. Land use and water use practices must change. We may be talking about rural adjustment programs perhaps to help tackle this problem, quite apart from the spending needed to start redressing the crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there was one thing I learnt about the Murray&hyphen;Darling crisis at the recent Prime Ministerial Science and Engineering Council Forum it was that the experts have no answers at the moment. Research is in its infancy. The scientists are surprised at the findings showing how quickly the situation is worsening. It is a far bigger problem than this motherhood statement, this bill about the environment, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> addresses. We need renewable resources to repair the environment. We need renewable financial resources. It would cost a billion dollars to grow and plant a billion trees. This bill is not the answer, I am afraid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While rising salinity is quite obvious in many parts of Australia, equally as great a problem is the rising levels of acidity in our soils and the ever present spread of noxious weeds. Elsewhere, the remnant bushland of the western slopes is under constant challenge from dubious land practices, hobby farming being one major source with subdivisions of marginal scrubby country. I know, my property is one such subdivision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mistletoe and dieback have affected many millions of trees right across the northern and central tablelands. In 1983, the Year of the Tree, I produced a major documentary program, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lament for the rural gum</EMPHASIS>, depicting the devastation caused by dieback on the northern tablelands of New South Wales. Experts then predicted a similar scenario on the central tablelands if something was not done. Well, something was done. The landcare movement has produced remarkable results in a short space of time, but the impact is so very slight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Treelot plantings and land rehabilitation have exceeded all expectations, but the surface has literally only just been scratched. Quite clearly the prime agricultural areas of Australia are under grave threat. We are kidding ourselves if we seriously believe that Australia will be the future food bowl for South-East Asia unless we take more urgent steps than this bill and this trust provide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our soils are ancient and fragile&mdash;only a very small percentage are considered high standard by world standards. We have to face up to the fact that our soils are declining and water quality problems are on the rise. Looking at the problem globally, the Washington based International Food Policy Research Institute predicted last year that a worldwide water shortage will more than likely be the biggest cause of global conflict next century. It also forecasts that our farming systems will need to support twice as many people over the next 30 years as they do today. Quite clearly, here in Australia, we really have to turn around the problems we have set in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5731"> course over the past 200 years, particularly the last 100.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I use the examples I have outlined in this statement as an indication of the enormity of our environmental challenge. Any reading of the submissions from conservation and environment organisations to the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee&mdash;from very conservative conservationists, I might add&mdash;shows a real concern that the funding mechanism for this Natural Heritage Trust is not the answer to the enormity of the environmental crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A billion dollars from the Natural Heritage Trust will not go anywhere near servicing the desperate needs of our environment. I do not believe either the Labor government's program would have prevented a gradual slide down the slippery pole that our environment crisis has become. No&hyphen;one with concern for the environment crisis can object to the list of environmental objectives set out by the now government in its pre-election policy document. I have no problems with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The list includes $318 million over five years to the national land and water resources audit, $163 million over five years to the Murray-Darling 2001 project&mdash;the Murray-Darling 3001 project, I would suggest&mdash;$85 million over five years to the national river care initiative, $100 million over four years to the coasts and clean seas initiative&mdash;great figures, great rhetoric but not sustainable from this one-third sale of Telstra&mdash;and $80 million over four years to the national reserve system to preserve Australia's biodiversity. It is sobering to note Australia's sad record on the loss of biodiversity. Of our 258 known species of mammal, 138 species are either extinct, endangered or potentially vulnerable. The debate in scientific circles now is whether we should spend what money we have on the potentially vulnerable rather than trying to save some of the endangered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its policy document the now government spelt out smaller financial commitments to national wetlands, world heritage areas, waste management and measures designed to combat air pollution&mdash;all very admirable. But, with that lack of commitment I mentioned <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> earlier to the international climate change convention, this government has failed to meet the agreed timetable for interim measures to reduce greenhouse gases. I really question the underlying commitment of this government to the hard environmental questions. It is a century&hyphen;long task ahead of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the package announced could not be denied for its attraction to all who are concerned about the environment, but the whammy, the crunch, came though with those words from Mr Howard during the campaign that the government would not be providing additional funds to pay for its $1.5 billion environment policy if the one-third sale of Telstra did not go through. That is the bottom line: sell our greatest asset or the environment can suffer&mdash;economic blackmail driven by economic rationalism gone mad.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The environmental crisis I have outlined is not something privatisation can provide for. The same old economic philosophy is being used to try to cope with a problem that will only get worse. Privatise Telstra, use some of the money, set up a trust and all will be solved. Well, it will not be solved. The environment needs to be funded from normal outlays, perhaps an environment levy, and far more commitment from mining companies and others whose environmental impact is a by-product of the benefits they derive from that environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The obvious source of funds could well be Telstra itself, retained in public ownership and delivering, apart from affordable services to rural and remote areas, a $1 billion plus to the Australian shareholders each year by way of a dividend which is sure to go up. Telstra's revenues are currently three per cent of national income. Why create a black hole of these proportions in our public revenue? It is short-sighted; it is economically irrational.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently I chaired a discussion in this building on infrastructure development, or the lack of it, in Australia. But there among the statistics delivered by Emeritus Professor Maurice Daly was the fact that the South&hyphen;East Asian tiger economies will be seeking $3 trillion worth of infrastructure development in the next few years. Two of the major areas of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5732"> that development will be transport and communications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Communications&mdash;think about it. Think about Telstra&mdash;the highest profit earner in Australian corporate history beating the corporations at their own game, delivering a huge dividend to its shareholders, not the Packers or Murdochs or Bonds or Skases or eventually their counterparts in the US, Europe, Japan, China or elsewhere but the current shareholders: us, the shareholders of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Think about Telstra still publicly owned, still getting a share of that $3 trillion action in South&hyphen;East Asia and northern Asia in the years ahead. Telstra is the world's best at what it does without private ownership. Even with its irritations and shortcomings, Telstra is the richest asset we have. We own the telecommunications infrastructure around this vast nation&mdash;an asset any other country in the world and certainly any entrepreneur would love to get their hands on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why we cannot sell Telstra. That is why its dividends should be used to help repair the natural infrastructure of this country. That is why its dividends should be used to set up this Natural Heritage Trust&mdash;its dividends, not its sale. I like the concept of the trust, but I believe the means being promoted of establishing the trust are deceitful and cynical and have more to do with a narrow determination to get rid of all public assets than with any real concern about degradation of our environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is very clever politics: to draw up a motherhood statement on the environment, to snooker the conservation movement and any Australians with a deep concern about the environment and say, `All these things that you want for your environment you can have'&mdash;it will certainly not be all the things I want for my environment&mdash;`but you can only have this bundle of tricks if you let us sell off our greatest asset.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I note the serious concern raised by the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) earlier in this debate about the impact cats have had on our environment. We must take steps to sterilise these animals and insist on curfews, voluntary or by regulation. But I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> doubt very much whether the call by the member for Cowan for the eradiation of cats by 2010, or whenever, is practical. We would need another buy&hyphen;back scheme, funded no doubt by the sale of more of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The electoral implications would be enormous. Cats are non-party partisan. In fact, they are very independent, I would suggest. We do need more control of domestic cats. The subject is serious. I am not being flippant about it. The feral cat problem in the bush can only worsen when calicivirus makes inroads into the rabbit population and cats look elsewhere for their food. Feral cats should be the next target of rural lands protection boards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major environmental crises facing this country are the decline in quality of our rivers and agricultural land and the decline in our urban air quality&mdash;crises a one-off sale of our richest national asset would not solve. Apart from being morally wrong, this bill is dishonest. I would like to support the establishment of this trust by other means. To that end, the amendment moved by the opposition spokesperson makes far more sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge all members and ministers to examine the data delivered to the Prime Minister's science forum on 13 September. You will quickly realise that $1 billion will not be enough. It will not be enough for the Murray-Darling Basin, let alone the cat problem.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It really is a great pleasure to speak on behalf of the electorate of Eden-Monaro on this Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill. I am quite staggered that the member for Calare (Mr Andren) would refer to this as motherhood legislation. We have here an opportunity to really lock in environmental management for some time, and exactly what we are not doing is espousing some motherhood statements, which seem to occur year after year by many governments. We are actually putting it up there in legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His comments on the partial sale of Telstra are very naive. We will not debate that particular legislation now, as we already have. If he thinks that the sorts of things that happen in telecommunications will continue to happen for a long time, he is showing a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5733"> remarkable naivety as to where telecommunications is going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill really is landmark legislation for Australia. It is landmark legislation that our opponents would never have dreamed of considering. They would never have dreamed of it, because it establishes a long-term commitment to real environmental control, not short-term, quick political fixes, which have been the hallmark of the previous Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really do not understand why those opposite are opposing this legislation. Perhaps it is because, if they did support it, it would be an admission of their failures, their failure after 13 years in government, to properly address environmental issues in a real, sustainable way. Their methods comprised grabbing the headlines and working the media hard, all just designed to create perceptions that they were the salvation of the environment&mdash;most of it rhetoric with little substance. But, like so many areas of reform over the decades, the coalition are the ones who will make the real decisions&mdash;the landmark legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as the Labor Party claim the high moral ground on such things as Aboriginal affairs&mdash;a matter we were recently reminded of by Mick Dodson, that it was the coalition that introduced the landmark legislation in that area and not the Labor Party&mdash;just as they try to grab those accolades, they are trying to do the same with the environment. This legislation will defy that. This legislation is a statement by the coalition that locks in environmental management for the long term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently the programs that are included in this legislation have to run the gauntlet of yearly budgets. With the passage of this legislation and the partial sale of Telstra legislation, that will not be necessary any more. Let me remind the House of why we were directed towards this innovative scheme. Besides a great desire to take the yearly politics out of environmental management and to set in place a long-term strategy, we moved in this direction because of the horrendous budget situation we were left with by the previous Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is appropriate to quickly relive those numbers. Recently I met with a group of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> constituents in Moruya on quite another matter not related to this. In the course of our discussions, I commented upon the budget deficit left to us and how the accumulated deficit over the last five Labor budgets was nearly $70 billion. One lady would not believe me. `No way,' she said, `that's just the line you politicians run. It couldn't be true.' Rather than argue with her, I undertook to send the detail&mdash;the facts and the figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I sent her a copy of page 1&hyphen;24 of Budget Paper No. 1. All was there to see: budget deficits on a yearly basis, going back to 1960-61. Boy, oh, boy, do the last five budgets really stand out. Every single year since 1991-92 the deficit has been in excess of $10 billion. Let me read them: 1991-92, $11.493 billion; 1992-93, $17.032 billion; 1993-94, $17.102 billion; 1994-95, $13.221 billion; and 1995-96, $10.317 billion&mdash;giving an accumulated deficit over those five years of $69.165 billion. It is a disgraceful example of financial management. That was a treacherous budgetary path that good environmental management was to encounter on a yearly basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to change the spending regime of government, and we are doing that through the budget brought down in August. But we want to safeguard those urgent and ongoing needs of the environment&mdash;thus the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Allow me to show how this legislation will impact on my electorate of Eden-Monaro. There are five key provisions in this bill, namely, the national vegetation initiative, the Murray-Darling 2001 project, the national land and water resources audit, the national reserve system and the coasts and clean seas initiative. Each one of these is crucial and relevant to Eden-Monaro.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take the national vegetation initiative: $318 million will be spent over five years to support the revegetation, protection and sustainable management of remnant native vegetation. With Eden-Monaro stretching from the Snowy Mountains to the coast, including regions like the Monaro, and running from the ACT border all the way to the Victorian border, it is easy to see the benefits of these initiatives. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5734">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Murray&hyphen;Darling 2001 project will also impact on my electorate. Many people probably are not aware that enormous volumes of water are diverted from the Snowy and Murrumbidgee rivers to the Murray&hyphen;Darling to sustain irrigation and water quality. People in Adelaide, South Australia, can thank the electorate of Eden&hyphen;Monaro for some of the water that ends up down there so that they can have some clean water when it comes out the other end. By addressing the problems in the Murray&hyphen;Darling, we will have much greater scope and flexibility with the waters controlled by the great Snowy Mountains scheme. Over five years, $163 million will be spent on this project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national land and water resources audit is probably the most crucial and urgent project not only for Eden&hyphen;Monaro but for the whole of Australia. We are a very dry country and this has been starkly demonstrated in recent years through horrendous drought. Even the normally lush dairy country around Bega has seen drought in recent years. I would never have thought that I would see the day that dairy farmers in places like Bega and Cobargo and similar areas would have to buy feed for their stock, but that was actually the case last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Eden&hyphen;Monaro is blessed by some magnificent country and superb rivers, but the land and water audit is long overdue. Rivers like the Clyde, the Snowy, the Murrumbidgee, the Bega and the Tuross are all under threat from a number of directions. I recently noticed just how clogged and overgrown parts of the Bega and Tuross rivers were from imported willows that are spreading right through these river systems like wildfire. Once seen as a lovely tree, the willow is now becoming an incredible environmental headache for all those who rely on those river systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These things will be addressed properly. Their management and control will be properly planned for as a result of this legislation. Over five years, $85 million will be allocated. Over four years, $80 million will be spent on the national reserve system to preserve Australia's biodiversity. The forests of Eden&hyphen;Monaro are well known and already the greater part of them are included in a reserve <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> system. We have to ensure that the correct areas are included in reserves and this funding will allow the correct scientific&mdash;and not political&mdash;work to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final provision in the legislation is the coasts and clean seas initiative. One of the most magnificent parts of Eden&hyphen;Monaro is its coastline. Stretching from Batemans Bay all the way down to the Victorian border, it is the best kept secret in Australia. I am sure that many members of this House often spend a weekend in the middle of their sittings heading off to various spots&mdash;Batemans Bay and Merimbula&mdash;to enjoy parts of this area. I see my colleague the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) nodding. He obviously gets down there as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Places like Batemans Bay, Moruya, Tuross Heads, Narooma, Bermagui, Tathra, Merimbula, Pambula, Eden and Wonboyn are all situated along this magnificent coast. We have probably cleaner seas than many other parts of Australia and we want to keep it that way. We want the magnificent whales and dolphins that are found all the way along the coast to keep coming. In fact, I was in Eden last Sunday for the opening of the sailing season. It was a most magnificent sight as great masses of dolphins were throughout the bay as we went out and started the sailing season. That is an aspect that we really want to keep, and $100 million spent over four years will ensure the current management and make sure that we keep it that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This really is landmark legislation. It is innovative, it guarantees long&hyphen;term management and control of our environment and of those areas under threat. Eden&hyphen;Monaro will be protected under this legislation once it is put in place. It will be put in place, and I call on our opponents to put politics aside and vote for sound environmental management for the future. I can assure them that their grandchildren and beyond will thank them for it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have tried to listen in to as many members as possible who have spoken on this Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill 1996. I heard all of what the member for Calare (Mr Andren) said and the member who preceded me, the member for Eden&hyphen;Monaro (Mr Nairn). <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5735"> Let me refer to a couple of observations that were made by the member for Calare, an Independent member of this parliament, as you know, Madam Deputy Speaker, who was elected to this parliament without a party tag and, from that point of view, is certainly free to make an independent judgment about the legitimacy and the value, the motivation and the purposes of this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He referred to what he called the enormity of our environmental challenge. He said in relation to this legislation that the funding mechanism is not enough. He said that what we should be doing is financing the environment from the dividends of Telstra and not from its sale, and then he went on to say something which was even stronger. He said that this legislation, apart from being morally wrong, is dishonest. I endorse that absolutely, with all respect to the member for Eden&hyphen;Monaro, who preceded me. I am going to make the claim that this legislation is ideologically driven, that it is public policy gone mad and, putting it as softly as I can, it is simply bizarre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me refer to the explanatory memorandum, which, of course, is the product of the government. The explanatory memorandum to the bill identifies the essential elements of it. The bill, in the preamble, says things like this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliament of Australia recognises the need for urgent action to redress the decline in Australia's natural environment.</PARA>
<PARA>It refers to a national crisis in land and water degradation. This legislation, including this preamble, was prepared by this government. It refers to the need to conserve Australia's environmental infrastructure. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's natural environment is central to Australia's well&hyphen;being and to Australia's future economic prosperity.</PARA>
<PARA>It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A comprehensive integrated response to these matters is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA>Not desirable&mdash;necessary. The whole import of this legislation is that if the parliament does not allow one&hyphen;third of Telstra to be privatised, to be sold, the environment can go to hell. That is the import of this legislation and this government's approach to it. Let <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there be no mistake: that is the implication of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is Australia's natural environment central to Australia's well&hyphen;being and to Australia's future economic prosperity? Of course it is. Do we need a comprehensive, integrated response to these matters? Yes, of course we do. Is there a national crisis in land and water degradation? Yes, there is. Does our response to that depend upon whether or not this parliament agrees to the sale of one&hyphen;third of Telstra? Are those things which can be delayed if Telstra is not sold, if one&hyphen;third is not privatised, if $1 billion is not thus provided and allowed to go into that trust fund? The member for Calare also made the valid point that that is insufficient provision for Australia's approach to this question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister for the environment, the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), who led for the opposition in relation to this matter, referred to this legislation as a 25&hyphen;page ransom note. Yes, it is, because the government, in effect, is saying to us and to the Australian people&mdash;and to those people concerned about the degradation of the environment over the last 200 years&mdash;`Sell Telstra or the environment can go to hell.' Is that national leadership? Is that a commitment to Australia and Australia's future? Is that a commitment to our environment, to the Australian people and to our capacity to use an environment to sustain the Australian people? Is that a commitment to the welfare of the Australian people? Is that national leadership?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is a disgrace. Let there be no mistake about that. The government has said to us, `Pass this legislation or the Australian environment will suffer.' The coalition obviously considers the Australian environment to be expendable. Should it be funded according to the way the government proposes to fund it and, in the absence of that proposal, allow the environment to continue to deteriorate, or should the preservation, restoration and the maintenance of the environment&mdash;we all depend upon it&mdash;be funded according to conventional funding arrangements? The answer to the question is yes, of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5736"> course it should be funded according to conventional funding arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no trade&hyphen;off. The wealth of this country and the income generated by it feeds government revenue, and normal sources of government revenue should be applied to maintaining that productive capacity, the environmental competence of Australia to continue to provide for the Australian people now and into the future. The protection of that wealth&hyphen;producing base should be funded by ordinary government revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has an appalling and threatening agenda on the environment. When people talk about the rhetoric of the opposition on this question we may well consider the rhetoric of the government. We are concerned about the government's intentions on mineral exports. We are concerned about the proposal for woodchip exports. We are concerned about the government's attitude towards greenhouse emissions. We are concerned very much about the government's attitude towards the Environment Protection Agency and the government's use of that as well to threaten so much of this very area which the government claims it is seeking to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of particular and continuing concern is that the proceeds of the sale of one&hyphen;third of Telstra, one of our capital assets, will be used to finance recurrent expenditure. I know it has been referred to as natural capital but it will be used to fund recurrent expenditure. What I want to know and what the rest of the Australian people want to know is: after the one&hyphen;third of Telstra has been sold and those funds have been applied, and the problems continue, what will we do then? We know what we will do then. The Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, has already let the cat out of the bag. The claim of the government was that they wanted to sell only one&hyphen;third of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me quote a newspaper report of what Senator Alston said. He was asked about his preference in relation to the possible future sale of the whole of Telstra&mdash;not just one&hyphen;third; that is the first stage. He was asked whether his preference was for the sale of the whole of Telstra. He said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed it is. It's not only inevitable but highly desirable.</PARA>
<PARA>But he did not leave it at that. He then clarified his remark. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You do these things in stages.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a minister of this government speaking, not me trying to misrepresent it. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We made it very clear&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, during the election campaign&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">we would not seek to go beyond the one&hyphen;third in the life of this Parliament, and that to go any further we would seek a specific electoral mandate.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Then when he was asked if that meant that they would be asking, at the next election, to sell the rest of Telstra, his reply was, `That's quite a possibility.' That was the response of</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5737">
<PARA>the minister of this government, letting the cat out of the bag. A sale of one&hyphen;third of Telstra&mdash;that is nonsense. This represents the sale of the whole of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Calare quite correctly said, `If we are going to fund the environment in any way from Telstra, let's do it from the normal dividends being generated by Telstra.' Let me give some of the figures. I seek leave to incorporate this table in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This table contains selected financial results concerning Telstra in the four years from 1991&hyphen;92 and the source is the Telstra annual report. Among other things, the table indicates, in part, that Telstra has paid income tax to the government, only in those four years, of almost $3,000 million. You can say that, if we privatise Telstra, it will continue to pay tax. Yes, it will. But let's go into some of these other things which are exclusively public property, public assets and public income at this stage. Telstra paid dividends to the government of $2,834 million out of a total operating profit, after tax, during those four years of over $4&half; billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People know the inclination of this conservative government. They know its ideological bent and they know who its mates are. Its <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mates are not the ordinary wage, tax paying people in this community; its mates are the people who are going to buy Telstra. Let us not make any mistake: they know they can sell it. The sharks are out there already lining up to buy it. Look at what we are going to sacrifice when it all goes, according to Minister Alston's remarks: dividends to the government of almost $3,000 million since 1991&hyphen;92, and total operating profit after tax of over $4&half; billion in those four years. That will continue to flow into the future. In the past it has flowed into the coffers of the national parliament to fund developments for the Australian people. You watch where it goes in future&mdash;straight into the pockets of the sharks, straight into the pockets of the friends of the people who form this government. All of those funds will be sacrificed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we have sold it and we have put that money into the environment, when the money has run out and the environment continues to deteriorate, then they will come and take what is left in your pocket to continue to fund the necessary development as far as the environment is concerned. Let there be no mistake: this government can go on with as much rhetoric as it likes, but it does not have to think that we are going to allow it to get away with it. The Australian people are a little more sophisticated, a little more understanding, a little better educated and a little more concerned than you people have ever given them credit for. We are going to expose this behaviour on your part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of more recent relevance is the fact that the operating profit after tax, from which dividends were paid, amounted to $1.7 billion in 1994&hyphen;95&mdash;almost $2 billion in one year alone. They say, `Let us flog it off to our mates, or the environment can go to hell.' That is what they are telling us, that is what they are telling you and that is what they are telling the Australian people: `Let us sell Telstra to our mates, to the big institutional investors, to the big superannuation funds and eventually to overseas investors. Let us sell it&mdash;or the environment can go to hell.' National leadership&mdash;what a disgrace!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sale of one&hyphen;third of Telstra means that one&hyphen;third of the after tax profit will accrue either as dividends or further shareholder equity to the buyers&mdash;not to the Australian people. In 1994&hyphen;95, that would have amounted to $584 million. However, only an extra $96 million each year is going to be provided for the environment anyway. So we sacrifice $584 million and we put into the environment an extra $96 million over what a Labor government would have been committed to provide for the environment anyway.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Deputy Speaker, you know I would not seek to put you into such an embarrassing position as to insist on an answer, because both you and I know what the answer is. It is certainly not one of support for a bizarre proposition of that kind. I said this was a crazy public policy. It is crazy indeed. Let me put it another way. This government will sacrifice one&hyphen;third of its investment value in Telstra on which it currently earns a return of about 18 per cent&mdash;if you could get some investments that gave you a return of 18 per cent, you would go for it&mdash;in order to retire debt which currently costs about 7&half; per cent. So we are going to give away our income earning capacity that is earning us 18 per cent at the present time to retire debt that is only costing us 7&half; per cent. That is crazy portfolio management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will tell you who it is not crazy for: the mates of the government, the big institutional investors&mdash;those people you have seen along the front bench here and over in the Senate. Two of them have gone by the way at the present time. They will line up for their share.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to put some of this into perspective, let me say in the few minutes that remain for me how big this problem is. The government members are the free marketeers, the economic rationalists and the ones who say, `Leave the market to itself. It will look after our problems. Get the government out of the way. Let us have small government. Don't intervene. Let the market look after it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us see how the market has looked after the Australian environment over the last 200 years. We have lost 75 per cent of our rainforest and 40 per cent of the total forest area in 200 years&mdash;that is the market. Native vegetation is being cleared at a rate of over 600,000 hectares per year&mdash;that is the market. Five per cent of plants, nine per cent of birds, 23 per cent of marsupials, seven per cent of reptiles, 16 per cent of amphibians and nine per cent of freshwater fish are extinct, endangered or vulnerable&mdash;that is the operation of the market. Fourteen billion tonnes of soil is moved by erosion every year&mdash;that is the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> operation of the market. Only six per cent of the continent is arable compared with 20 per cent in the United States, and we rape it&mdash;that is the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we are finished doing all of that damage, the government says to us, `Sell one-third of Telstra or it can go to hell.' That is what we have been told. That is the ransom note. That is what the Australian people are being told. Our country is blowing away from under our feet and the government says, `Sell Telstra or the lot of it can disappear. The environment can go to hell.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another message in this. At the present time we have a population of 18 million. In the early part of the next century it is estimated that it will be 25 million. Some people are saying at the present time that Australia can support adequately a population of only about 10 million to 12 million. So they are big issues and big questions of public policy to be addressed and resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why has the environment deteriorated? Because of the operation of private property; the right of people to make their own decisions about whether they rip the forest off the land, whether they allow the land to be degraded and whether they allow the soil to blow away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the people who believe that that is the way you operate national policy. We do not. We believe that there is a role for the public sector. We believe there is a role for national economic planning. We believe there is a role for parliaments to exercise restraint and to impose restraints on those people who would rape our environment. That is one of the reasons for our existence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have an honourable and comprehensive record as far as the environment is concerned. The thing that distresses me is that in March of this year the Australian people did not re&hyphen;elect a Labor government to make sure that these things would be done whether or not Telstra was sold.</PARA></SPEECH>

They do it with a view to obtaining minor party preferences. They have won a few elections because the environmental lobby was conned, robbed and cheated into giving its preferences to the Labor Party. The Labor Party was elected and yet Australia's environmental degradation continued. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor has done absolutely nothing to repair the environment. We come forward with a very detailed plan. We have a number of very major initiatives. We have the national vegetation initiative, the Murray-Darling project 2001, the national reserve system, the national land and water resources audit, and the coasts and clean seas initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is going to cost a lot of money. It is going to cost more than $1 billion. We believe that this $1 billion is an investment in Australia's environmental future. It is not spending the proceeds of the sale of one-third of Telstra on recurrent expenditure; it is an investment in the future of this nation. It is an investment in making sure that our children and grandchildren inherit an environment which is better than that which we inherited. Yet the Labor Party says it supports the principle of the National Heritage Trust of Australia Bill in so far as it likes the expenditure, but what it wants to do is simply fund that $1 billion from consolidated revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can see the honourable member for Charlton is smiling because he knows that the Labor Party over the last 13 years was an economic disaster. He knows that his own leader, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), when he was the Minister for Finance prior to the last election, told us that the budget was in surplus. The Labor Party told us that it could not actually tell us what the figures were because they had not been worked out. Yet on the Monday after the election the bad news was given to the incoming government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Labor Party sought to perpetrate on the Australian people prior to the election was absolute fraud. They sought to tell us that the budget was in surplus. They knew it was not in surplus. We made our promises on the basis of the published figures and the simple situation was that Beazley's bankcard had built up to $10.3 billion. When one looks at the way they suggest that this environmental trust should be funded, they are simply saying that we should add another $1 billion to Beazley's bankcard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You simply cannot run a country's finances in such a way. You simply cannot spend, spend, spend. You simply cannot keep the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5740"> printing presses running, as Dr Cairns wanted to do. What you need to do is fund your expenditure. What the coalition is seeking to do through the one-third privatisation of Telstra and through the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill is to sell one-third of Telstra for an estimated $8 billion. Seven billion dollars will be used to retire debt&mdash;something that you people did not do in 13 years. You flogged things off after saying that you were not going to sell them, and you used the proceeds for recurrent expenditure. We are paying $7 billion off Australia's foreign debt, and we are using $1 billion as an investment in Australia's environmental future. I think that is an excellent way to approach it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are saying is that we want to spend $1 billion repairing the impact of 200 years of European settlement, but we are prepared to fund it. What we are prepared to do is fund it in a way that guarantees majority Australian ownership of Telstra. We aim to fund it in a way that will guarantee, through the community service obligations which will remain, that all Australians have access to reasonable telecommunications services. We will expose Telstra to the marketplace. We will enable Telstra to become an even better company. The simple fact of the matter is that from Australia's point of view our policy is win, win, win. We will have a more efficient telecommunications system, and we will have $1 billion spent in repairing Australia's environment.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact of the matter is that the hypocrisy of the now opposition is mind-boggling. The honourable member for Charlton is not a bad sort of guy. He is one of the last socialists left in the Labor Party. I respect him for that. He stands for something. I might disagree with almost everything that the honourable member for Charlton stands for, but at least he has a position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party was respected when people like the honourable member for Charlton held positions of great importance, but he is clearly wrong on this issue. He failed to tell us about the actions of the former government in privatising a number of assets such as the Commonwealth Bank and in attempting to privatise ANL.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mr Robert Brown interjecting&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0V5">Mr SLIPPER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that you spoke against that. You also failed to tell us how the then government promised not to sell all of these assets. Then, of course, it gained re&hyphen;election and sold them. He failed to tell us that the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, told the people of Australia that it was not of itself important whether Telstra was in public or private ownership. He failed to tell us how the former government was going to flog off bits of Telstra piecemeal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the reality is that, however honestly the honourable member for Charlton might hold his convictions, the way he criticises us is very shallow when one looks at the program of privatisation of the former government. I know he did not like that program of privatisation, but it is a fact that the former government privatised a large number of what he would consider to be Australian icons, having promised the Australian people that that would not happen. But all we are doing is privatising one-third of Telstra.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We went to the Australian people and we said, `We have this comprehensive environmental program. It's going to cost $1 billion. We need to fund it. The way we're going to fund it is by selling one-third only of Telstra.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Communications and the Arts <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5741"> (Senator Alston) have said that there would be no further sales of any part of Telstra without a further mandate from the Australian people. We have made no decision on whether there would be any sale of any additional portion of Telstra, but what we have done is guarantee to the Australian people that we would not endeavour to sell any further part of Telstra without a further mandate. So obviously between now and the next election we are going to have to decide what our policy is, but we have given an ironclad guarantee. We have pledged that two-thirds of Telstra will remain in public ownership unless we receive a further mandate from the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hypocrisy opposite is further highlighted by comments made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) on 1 October. He said that Australians are undertaxed:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I think, since we are so undertaxed by any relevant international standard, there is a case for having some overall revenue increases," he told Melbourne radio station 3AW.</PARA>
<PARA>So their secret is, on the one hand, to build up the bankcard debt&mdash;it was $10.3 billion when we came into office&mdash;and on the other hand, if they need more revenue, what they aim to do is raise taxes. So what the honourable member for Holt is saying is that a vote for Labor will be a vote for higher taxes. That is the way that they would fund any improvements to the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They had 13 years. They did absolutely nothing. Environmental reports show that our environment is in a perilous and parlous state. This government, when in opposition, brought forward a comprehensive program. The policy which is implemented through this bill is the mandate given to us by the Australian people. All I ask is that those opposite respect the mandate from the Australian people and, in their doing so, we will have a win-win situation. We will have $1 billion-plus invested in Australia's environmental future, and we will also be paying off some of Australia's foreign debt, which has built up through the inadequacies of those opposite. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1955, during the golden era of rock and roll, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the popular vocal group The Platters released a wonderful piece of music. It was called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Great Pretender</EMPHASIS> . The lyrics went something along the lines of, `My trouble is such, I pretend too much.' I am thinking of a 16-year-old man listening to that song on his wireless in suburban Sydney, let's say Earlwood, that same year. Perhaps he is lending a hand in his father's garage. He is in his bobbysocks and his hair is slicked back. He shuts his eyes, sticks his hands in his pockets and sings along with the words that he loves so much, `Oh yes, I'm the great pretender.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The years have passed&mdash;over 40, to be exact&mdash;and the young boy has now become a man of some influence, but he has never forgotten the words of his favourite song. He is probably singing them now as he shuffles the papers around his office as the 57&hyphen;year&hyphen;old Prime Minister of this country. In fact, I know he is, just by looking at what lies behind this seemingly inoffensive Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill. Looking at what we have here, he is not just singing the song `I am the great pretender'&mdash;he and his government are living it. Of all the transformations that took place in the Liberal Party in the lead&hyphen;up to the last federal election, it was the sudden interest and concern displayed for the environment by the party's parliamentary leaders which I believe took most Australians by surprise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Remember that this is the team which opposed the halting of the flooding of the Franklin River. This is the team which opposed the halting of mining on Coronation Hill. This is the team which opposed the use of Commonwealth powers of external affairs to override the states on matters of critical environmental importance. This is the team that opposed the Commonwealth's legal capacity to intervene to protect world heritage areas. The Liberal Party's green tendencies, hitherto denied, were paraded for all of us to see. We saw the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) rambling through the bush of the Dandenong Ranges with his moleskins on and in his open&hyphen;necked shirt. He may have even hugged a tree or two.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5742"> While it was a shock for all of us to see a conservative politician displaying such earnestness towards conservation and the envi ronment, I think many of us would have been prepared to believe that the Prime Minister's heart was in the right place. We asked ourselves, `Perhaps he and his coalition have found a little green corner of their consciences after all'? However, it was when the Prime Minister announced that he had tied the conservation of the Australian environment with the one&hyphen;third sale of Telstra, and in the process he announced that its sale&mdash;and its sale only&mdash;would fund the natural trust, that the penny dropped. The Prime Minister had been pretending all along. The Prime Minister was no born&hyphen;again environmentalist. Indeed, so clearly is his and his government's contempt for our environment displayed by their demand that our natural heritage can only be preserved if they sell one&hyphen;third of Telstra that their credentials in this area lie in tatters and rags&mdash;a perception neither he nor the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) have done much to alter during their term in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has no objection to the setting up of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia if that is what the government wants to do. We see no good reason which would impel the Prime Minister to do so, but if he and his government want to go ahead with it, I wish them the best of Irish luck. What the opposition objects to and what the clear&hyphen;thinking environmentalist groups object to&mdash;along with thousands of Australians, I might add&mdash;is the obvious lack of commitment the government has displayed to the environment in its establishing the link between the trust and the sale of Telstra. What the opposition objects to are some of the completely inadequate provisions contained within this bill which we are now debating. They are just so indicative of policy formulated on the run. What the opposition objects to is the hypocrisy that blankets this government on environmental matters. We object to the government preaching conservation like a bunch of converts to the cause while at the same time making decisions on such issues as uranium mining in Kakadu, greenhouse emissions, woodchipping and the development of environmentally sensitive areas such as Port Hinchinbrook&mdash;decisions which have the `develop and be damned' philosophy of the coalition of old stamped all over them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there was one attitude that permeated the Labor government during its 13 years in office it was the primacy that needed to be placed on conserving the Australian environment. It was under Labor that Australia moved towards ecologically sustainable development. It was under Labor that the national landcare program really took hold, with over 2,200 landcare groups currently active around the country. It was under Labor that Australia took its place as the international leader in the management, protection and presentation of world heritage areas. Transcending all these initiatives and developments was the fundamental notion that all spending on the environment should be paid for directly from the consolidated revenue fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to the attention awarded to the environment by the Labor government since 1983, the people of Australia developed a greater maturity in relation to all environmental matters. Public concern for the conservation of our natural heritage reached an all&hyphen;time high: people recycled more than ever before and political candidates at all levels and from all political parties watched their fortunes rise and fall according to the public's perception of their environmental abilities. For the last 13 years we have had a situation where we considered it essential that the environment had some degree of supremacy over other matters of government and the people of Australia demanded it of us as well. The environment had become a mainstream issue, just as education, employment, health and social security had become mainstream issues before it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this context it is difficult to see the logic or even the commonsense in basing the Natural Heritage Trust on the sale of a Commonwealth asset, however major. It is the same as saying, `We'll only provide funding for social security if we can get the money by selling Telstra.' It is the same as saying, `We can only provide funding for the defence forces of this country if we can get our hands on the profits of the sale of Australia Post.' Of course it could not be done&mdash;there would be a national uproar. It should never have reached the stage that the environment of this country, on which all our livelihoods depend, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5743"> should be treated so insignificantly as to depend for its funding on the sale of a major Commonwealth asset.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It sounds ludicrous, doesn't it&mdash;the future of our environment depending on profits from the sale of a Commonwealth asset? It is ridiculous and yet frightening that our environment lies in the hands of a government which sees this as a sensible arrangement, as a sound idea. It is less surprising when you look at what other supposedly sound ideas the Prime Minister and his cohorts have come up with for the environment during their very short term in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pristine wilderness of Kakadu now stands threatened by the government's fondness for allowing open slather uranium mining in the area. I remember seeing photos of Senator Hill, the Minister for the Environment, and Senator Parer, the Minister for Resources and Energy&mdash;some would call him the de facto environment minister&mdash;in their `regulation conservative politicians on casual fact-finding tour' fatigues on location in Kakadu soon after coming into government. Senator Hill looked decidedly uncomfortable&mdash;I suppose because he was in the process of being done over, good and proper, by Senator Parer, who is a gung-ho supporter of, shall we say, a spirited approach to mining and mining in wilderness areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Parer's views should not come as a surprise, seeing as he is the former chairman of both Australian Coal Exporters and Queensland Coal Mine Management Pty Ltd. Senator Parer wants us to open Australia's pristine wilderness areas to, and I quote his words, `multiple uses'. For `multiple uses' read `mining and development'. Remember that this is a senior member of the new `green' Howard government. Senator Hill is looking decidedly uncomfortable about his colleague's rantings as each day passes. I imagine he is feeling uncomfortable about his own impotence as developers and mining companies come by the truck load to line up and knock on our Prime Minister's door. They must be saying, `Oh yes, this is a real green government&mdash;nod, nod, wink, wink.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take a look at Senator Hill's actions over the Port Hinchinbrook development. The <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> environment minister has well and truly buckled under the weight of the Queensland resort tycoon Keith Williams and the pro-development elements of the cabinet. Senator Hill granted Mr Williams permission to go ahead with his development after he elicited from Mr Williams a promise to ensure that the environment was protected. Well, now we can all sleep soundly in our beds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Keith Williams has nothing but contempt for the environmental laws and regulations he is supposed to adhere to. He says that the conditions are `neither necessary nor fair'. And we are supposed to trust him with building Australia's largest resort between two of the most delicately balanced world heritage areas in this country? Senator Hill, our environment minister, thinks we should. Our environment minister has received another thorough going over at the hands of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable compromise established by the previous Labor government over woodchips has been shattered by this government's decision to export more of them against all environmental advice. The government says its trust will spray $318 million over five years towards a national vegetation initiative. Yet Senator Hill has been rolled by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, whose woodchip regulations will actually ravage important vegetation areas by encouraging the clearing of forest on private land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can look at the government's environmental credentials as displayed in the budget. Overall, the environmental budget has been slashed by 13 per cent, with a massive decline in the environment department's forward estimates. `I'm not going to touch the environmental budget,' the Prime Minister said during that campaign. Remember his favourite song? Don't forget <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Great Pretender</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we have a 15 per cent cut in the budget allocation for the Australian Heritage Commission&mdash;a move which will have a devastating effect on the identification and conservation of Australia's natural, cultural and indigenous heritage. And it goes on: $15 million cut from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, a 21 per cent cut in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5744"> the budget of the Environment Protection Agency, a nine per cent cut in the budget of Environment Strategies Directorate and a 17 per cent cut from the Australian Nature Conservation Agency. This is the climate which debate surrounding the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill now enters. This is the context in which this bill before the House now must be seen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How are the Australian people supposed to enjoy a confidence in the trust and in its operation when their government has set about destroying all its credibility on environmental matters over these last eight months? Of course the answer is that the government cannot be trusted to oversee the running of the trust as it now stands. The fact that the government has shown itself to be so weak and ineffective in taking a strong and principled stand on environmental matters, the fact that it has shown itself to pander to the beck and call of mining and industry interest, makes it imperative that the Natural Heritage Trust Bill be amended so as to allow closer scrutiny by the parliament and to allow for greater accountability to be built into its structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take, for example, the Natural Heritage Trust Board, as indicated in the bill. At the moment, the bill provides for the board to include only the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Knowing as we do, and as I have just very quickly pointed out, the weakness of the present environment minister to stand up for his portfolio interests and the less than sterling environmental credentials enjoyed and displayed by the primary industries minister, this is an arrangement that we can quite obviously not allow to take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The board has to be expanded so as to include other members who have had an important stake in our nation's environment. We should be seeing well-known environmentalists invited to join the board. Neither am I so one&hyphen;eyed that I would not think it proper to have representatives from other interested parties given places as well. At the very least, the role of the Minister for the Environment should be given primacy over that of the Minister for Primary Industries and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Energy so that the conservation focus of the trust is maintained. This is the same suggestion that has been made by the Senate communications legislation committee, and there is nothing wrong with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless this occurs, as the shadow minister for the environment quite rightly pointed out in her second reading speech on this bill, we could have a disastrous situation because, as the bill stands at the moment, there exists no mechanism to resolve a deadlock of opinions between the two ministers on the board. Who loses if such a deadlock eventuates? Of course, the loser is our environment. Obviously, there are major inadequacies in the bill regarding the  Natural Heritage Trust Board. If the government really wants to live up to its rhetoric on the environment, if it wants to put the last eight months behind it and put a few brownie points on the board, it would start by looking at agreeing to amend just this arrangement, for starters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition also wants to amend the bill to allow for greater parliamentary scrutiny of the trust. Now it would seem to me that the parties on the other side, who came into the last election making such a noise about improving parliamentary standards and the stature of this place and increasing the relevancy of the parliament, could have no single objection to an amendment which seeks to do just that. As the bill stands, there is no device which allows for the parliament to go over the trust's operations with a fine toothcomb. We on this side of the House believe this is completely unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going back to a point I made earlier, it would be the same as funding the nation's employment programs, defence or social security by trust and then saying, `We can let the board or the trust do whatever they like. The parliament has no power to oversee or influence their operations. Therefore, we won't interfere and we will put a bill up to make sure we don't.' Where is this accountability? Where is this responsibility to the people of Australia and our environment in putting forward such a dangerous arrangement? None of these problems would have arisen if the government had seen fit to fund its Natural Heritage Trust from consolidated <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5745"> revenue rather than chase Telstra as if it were the goose that lays the golden eggs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the opposition, while we would be happy to see the amendments I have just spoken about put into place, none of them will mean anything as long as the government continues to insist on funding the trust via the sale of Telstra. The environment or Telstra&mdash;it should never have come to this. It should never have been a choice in the first place. The Prime Minister never should have forced it on the Australian people. The environment deserves better than being treated like an extravagance that we can afford only if we sell a portion of the farm. The Australian people deserve better than being treated with the contempt that such an unbalanced view carries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister says that by opposing the sale of Telstra we are opposing the saving of our environment. On the contrary, I say opposing Telstra's sale is signalling our support for the environment. It is telling the government that it must consider Australia's environment important enough to deserve independent funding. It is telling the government it cannot use the environment as a tool of extortion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, apart from objecting to the government's twisted morality on this issue, we object to the two being attached simply because it fails to make environmental sense. There is no flexibility in a trust funded in this fashion. How can the government predict the environmental future of Australia? How can it predict that the money it will inject into the trust will be sufficient? Without a doubt, the future will bring new environmental priorities and problems. It is more than likely the trust will need to be modified or perhaps closed with the balance being repaid into consolidated revenue&mdash;the place from where it should have been funded from the start.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bottom line is that, from the very beginning, the government has displayed unctuous leadership over the whole issue of the Natural Heritage Trust. From the moment it linked the trust to the sale of Telstra, it deservedly earned our disdain. Combined with its unmitigated failure to live up to its promises on the environment, it should be enough to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> strike fear in the heart of every Australian who places any importance on the conservation of our natural heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's bleatings over its environmental credentials, made while it pistol&hyphen;whips the very same portfolio and blackmails the electorate over the sale of Telstra, demonstrate better than anything else the truth of that famous quote by that great British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli&mdash;`a conservative government is an organised hypocrisy'. I wholeheartedly support his statement and I support the amendment we have moved to this bill in the House today.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There can be no question that the environment has become increasingly important to Australians in the last two decades. It is equally true that much of Australia's natural environment is substantially degraded or in need of repair. The $1.15 billion Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill 1996 is a response to these two undeniable facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Natural Heritage Trust, subject to the one-third sale of Telstra, which the previous speaker, the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), referred to in her speech&mdash;and I have no doubt the good sense of the Senate will pass it&mdash;has the potential to reverse the decline in our environment and rebuild Australia's natural capital. If we are to achieve this, we need to be mindful that it will take more than money. The government alone cannot fix problems. It is an illustration that the emergence of the welfare state may assist people in need, but it does not fix the problem. In fact, it perpetuated the underlying cause of poverty by eroding personal responsibility and crowding out the private charity and community effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must avoid at all costs these same things happening to the environment as a result of increased government involvement. We need to make sure that private individuals continue to take responsibility for their own environmental backyard and that voluntary associations continue their valuable work on the ground. To do this, the Commonwealth must make use of structures which already exist in local regions to tackle environmental problems and must be mindful of the fact that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5746"> commercial incentives and property rights can often be the most effective in promoting conservation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate of Corangamite, I have organised meetings of local landcare groups to discuss common experiences, funding issues and strategies for the local implementation of the Natural Heritage Trust, if it comes about. The issues they raised with me included the eradication and control of the serrated tussock weed, which I have raised in this House, tree planting for salinity control and biodiversity importance and the erosion and pasture productivity improvement with the control of rabbits through the calicivirus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They raised the issues of absentee landholders and increasing their environmental awareness, soil degradation&mdash;that is, the blowing away of soil and dust and the washing of the soil down the river systems&mdash;the environmental problems that average farmers are facing as well as salinity with raising water tables and dry land salinity increasing in all parts of Australia, particularly in parts of my own electorate of Corangamite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other issues include the support for landcare groups either voluntary or with some government funding and the processes of government funding; rivers, drainage and run&hyphen;off and the supply of water to both Melbourne and Geelong; the control of roadside weeds, which is now a major problem facing urban and rural communities; feral animals, which other members have mentioned already in the debate&mdash;foxes, cats and rabbits; and, finally, pasture improvement to maintain good environmental control throughout farming lands in my electorate of Corangamite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the Corangamite Catchment and Land Protection Board has been established to oversee local resource management, especially water quality and availability. The key question is: who pays for the collecting of nature's rain and distributes it to thirsty city dwellers? The board completed an environment stocktake of the local region last year. The results have been a coordinated approach but one with a voluntary grassroots flavour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another key conservation group is the salinity implementation group, which works with government and community groups to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> attack salinity where it emerges and take preventive measures wherever it threatens. Voluntary community structures are there for the Commonwealth to tap into to ensure that spending outlined in the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill is well spent on constructive and fruitful action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government must not displace the community goodwill and involvement which has emerged through the landcare movement over the last 10 years in Victoria. We must recognise that often the most effective strategy is to provide commercial market based incentives for conservation work. For example, farmers in western Victoria are seeing the benefits, both commercial and environmental, of increased tree planting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Otway Agro&hyphen;Forestry Network and Timber 2000 are two groups which have been at the forefront of this change of attitude at the local level. These groups sell the benefits to farmers of planting trees for commercial profit as well as for soil improvement and wind protection for livestock. The new techniques involved, especially those used by the Timber 2000 group, of deep ripping, moulding and weed control have seen tree growth expand dramatically. We now see the possibilities of commercial harvesting of eucalyptus globulus at 10 and 12 years. It used to take 30 and 40 years to reach a commercial objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But these landowners will only invest in farm forestry if they are assured that they will be able to harvest their trees with certainty and that they will be able to sell their product, for example, woodchips, on the best available market, possibly the export market. No-one will be encouraged to grow more trees if they cannot be cut down and sold as a commercial product. Harvesting rights and woodchip exports, far from destroying the environment as claimed by some, actually ensure increased plantings and more forest cover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of the House will be interested to note that when I was a member of the Australian parliamentary delegation to India, Bangladesh and Nepal in 1993, I saw first&hyphen;hand a good example of private incentive leading to good environmental work. The Nepal&hyphen;Australia community forest project is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5747"> a community based attempt to reverse the effects of total deforestation, resulting from 400 years of poor practice and exploitation by rich merchants of Katmandu, using timber products without consideration to growing the next forest. The report of the delegation in relation to the Nepal&hyphen;Australia community forest project states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The success of the . . . project is based on the principles of profit and sustainable development. Villages look after the forest because of the community gain.</PARA>
<PARA>The main point in the report is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Trees are grown for commercial exploitation and the plantations are safeguarded by the villages who use the prunings for fuel. There is a financial incentive to increase the amount of land under forestry, and so regeneration is encouraged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is another performance indicator . . . officers reported an increase in the number of leopards seen in the hills, indicative of the increased forest cover.</PARA>
<PARA>This is how the Third World countries have managed to regenerate their natural assets, not by regulation or government spending money they did not have but by changing attitudes. They have managed to regenerate forests in an area where forests had been completely depleted and ravaged by people who had the resources to use the timber. The answer has been to assign a property right and give villagers incentive to look after their own environmental assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Jeff Bennett, who edited the recent Institute of Public Affairs publication entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tall Green Tales</EMPHASIS>, discussed the experience of elephants in Zimbabwe. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The elephant in Zimbabwe was, until recent years, a publicly owned resource. The incentive for individual villagers to care for the animals was negligible, particularly as they were perceived as a pest that would periodically destroy their gardens. Poachers were therefore unhindered or even assisted by locals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a shift of policy, the rights to elephants have now been transferred to local villages. The bounty that these animals confer on the villages through the sale of viewing or even hunting rights has given them a status worthy of care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Poachers are now reported to the authorities. A reversal of the population decline of the species has occurred, and now culling programs are required to prevent overstocking from causing land degradation.  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>These examples indicate the need to get away from the old stereotype of profit versus conservation. Profit and conservation can go hand in hand where there is a financial incentive to preserve or enhance the natural environment. We do not necessarily need government schemes. Often it is a case of allowing commercial market incentives. For example, in the electorate of Corangamite, Midway Forest Products, a Geelong based woodchip exporter, has been pro&hyphen;active in establishing hardwood plantations on farmland through joint ventures with landowners west of Geelong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rise of ecotourism along the Great Ocean Road has increased the incentive to look after the coastline as an important natural asset. Ecotourism gives the locals an incentive to preserve the pristine eucalypt forest and rugged coastline with its unique scenic features like the Twelve Apostles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Alcoa, a private company, has been pro&hyphen;active in a number of landcare activities in the local area, including the Woady Yaloak catchment project. Farmers and industry are working cooperatively to enhance the local environment which had suffered damage from rabbits, erosion, salting and tree removal. By the end of 1995, Alcoa had contributed $9 million to various landcare programs across Western Australia and Victoria. Again, the private sector is leading the way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If positive environmental outcomes are to result from the Natural Heritage Trust, it will require that the Commonwealth make good use of existing local structures, and that the role of the private sector and the commercial profit motive are not forgotten as a means of delivering conservation of natural assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill devotes $1.15 billion over five years to five main environmental packages, subject to the partial sale of Telstra. The five main packages are the national vegetation initiative, the Murray-Darling 2001 project, the national reserve system, the national land and water resources audit, and the coast and clean seas initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One significant and much needed change is the introduction of tax credits for on&hyphen;farm landcare expenditure. There has been considerable criticism of the national landcare <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5748"> program for its emphasis on rehabilitating public land. Ultimately, if we are to make any overall environmental difference we need to encourage greater environmental efforts on farm. Farmers have been eligible for tax deductions on their on&hyphen;farm conservation efforts under section 75D of the tax act; however, tax deductions are only of benefit if farmers are profitable enough to be paying tax. Wool growers and some beefgrowers in my electorate are simply not in that position. What is required is tax credits for on&hyphen;farm conservation works, thus providing an incentive to improve land, even in poor years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other useful elements of the trust for farmers in the Corangamite region and other land&hyphen;holders will be the $19 million devoted to the national weed strategy, $16 million devoted to feral animal control, $85 million to the rivercare program and $8 million to enhance the national wetlands program. However, the success of the package will depend upon its ability to encourage rather than displace wider community involvement. The $1.15 billion Natural Heritage Trust has enormous potential to encourage practical conservation, but we need to be vigilant that we do not allow greater government spending on the environment to become the new welfarism of the 21st century.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to rise today and talk on the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill. I note that some previous speakers have raised their concern about mining. There has been a trend in this country over recent decades to denigrate the mining industry. My reality of the mining industry is that it has never done it better. If you look at the practices of companies like Western Mining, which operates the Olympic Dam mine in my own electorate of Grey, you can look forward with great confidence not only to the economic rewards of the mining industry but also to the progress that is made on general environmental issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noted that the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) had some comments to make about the feral cats. He might be interested to know that there has been a very concerted effort to eradicate feral cats on the land inside the mining area of Olympic Dam. The work <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the environmental people are doing there is quite remarkable. I have particular pleasure in acknowledging the great progress the mining companies of Australia are making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another group of people I would like to salute today is the group I call the forgotten people. If you watch the 6 o'clock news most nights, you will see a fairly regular  appearance of politicians or lobby group representatives, but you will very rarely see the person that has devoted their whole life to, say, soil conservation or revegetation. It is a great loss in this country that we do not see a greater focus on those people who devoted very much of their lives to conservation, well before it was fashionable. Today I would particularly like to recognise those people who have contributed&mdash;those people in soil conservation areas, on soil conservation boards and in the pastoral areas. The local townspeople have devoted many hours of their time in a voluntary way to protecting our natural heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the coalition announced its environment package prior to the March election, it was hailed as one of the biggest spending environmental packages in history and environmental groups applauded our ambitious acknowledgment of the importance of the environment. Today, that commitment to the environment still stands, despite the rhetoric of our opponents and some within the media. The coalition government remains committed to allocating historic levels of funding to the environment and seeks only the support of the other parties to make the means possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the amendment moved by the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) said that we would pluck that $1 billion from consolidated revenue. That, in one sentence, sums up the economic discipline of our opponents. I guess we as Australians should not be surprised that we run into the budget deficit problems we have when we see this sort of amendment, which simply says, `We will pluck $1 billion from consolidated revenue, just like that.' But the party that sold the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas has now decided that selling one-third of Telstra and devoting millions to the environment is not on. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5749">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many parts of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill which will benefit the electorate of Grey and other regional and rural electorates. The landcare package will be particularly welcome. The Natural Heritage Trust will allocate $279 million in additional environmental funding for landcare and farm forestry and $32 million for the national land and water resources audit, the national weed strategy and the national feral animal control strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am on the subject of feral animals, the release of the calicivirus to combat our huge rabbit problem is  particularly noteworthy. It is to be hoped that that will enhance the environment of this country in a reasonably profound way. It is a small beginning on the curse of the rabbit. With a recognition that there will need to be a fairly vigilant and strong follow&hyphen;up to the advantage that the calicivirus will give us, it is nevertheless very welcome. Some people in my electorate, such as the Friends of the Whyalla Conservation Park, have contacted me about the rabbit problem in the past. They will be pleased to see the release of the calicivirus finally getting the go&hyphen;ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Back to the landcare funding to be contained within the Natural Heritage Trust. The $279 million landcare program will help with the development on community based and managed projects, on both public and private land. Consultation with the community is essential for these types of projects to be successful, and I am pleased to see that within the bill. Australia still relies strongly on its farming community, and it is important that we take steps in our environmental program to help protect and sustain our farming lands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this bill, the coalition government will take practical action to protect and conserve the environment and achieve sustainable agricultural production. Of course, these parts of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill which I have mentioned above are only some of the environmental areas we intend to tackle and devote resources to. We have, as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) has acknowledged, the national vegetation initiative, the Murray&hyphen;Darling 2001 project&mdash;it is pleasing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to see strong commitments from the states, particularly from Premier Brown of South Australia&mdash;the national reserve system and the coast and clean seas initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Together with the national land and water resources audit, these five capital projects are a part of an overall $1.5 billion in spending over five years. I am particularly pleased to see the coalition government commit environment funding to Grey again this year, despite the difficulties in the Senate. Just last month more than $60,000 in environment grants were allocated to around 20 groups in Grey, under the save the bush and one billion tree programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Among the groups to receive funding was the Petherton Road Tree Plants of Mount Bryan. The group's coordinator, Mrs Rosemary Quinn, wrote to me last week after hearing of their successful grant application.</PARA>

We are pleased to be selected to receive this funding.</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure the other groups that have received funding will also be similarly pleased with their grants. I commend the volunteers who devote their time and energy to these groups to help restore and maintain our environment. They are playing a vital role in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly proud of the coalition commitment to the environment, and this historic initiative which we are working to implement. I urge the opposition and minority parties to pass the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill and to allow the coalition to fulfil the mandate it was given in March, which most certainly included many thousands of Australians who voted for this commendable environmental package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, there is much talk in this place of lofty ideals and strong rhetoric but I cannot help but believe that the Democrats, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5750"> the ALP and the Greens, particularly, believe that they have a monopoly on environmental issues: how dare the coalition have the audacity to offer a package which may address many of our outstanding environmental issues. How dare the coalition offer a package which may solve some of these outstanding and longstanding issues. That is at the heart of the refusal of the Senate to pass this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not about the privatisation debate&mdash;that is easily dealt with under the Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank principle&mdash;it is much more about our political opponents not allowing us the opportunity to be seen to do something positive in the environment. It is a purely selfish, political means, and I am quite dismayed by their whole approach. They believe they have the monopoly; they believe they are the only people that can solve the environmental issues of Australia. It is purely political selfishness which restricts us and will not allow us to get on with the program the people elected us to do in March 1996.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to start rather immodestly and suggest that few people know more about the River Murray or irrigation systems in the Murray than do the member for Mallee and I. In fact, the member for Mallee was an engineer involved in irrigation projects in the Sunraysia area and knows a great deal about soil saturation and the effective drainage of River Murray water. I was also an irrigator. We, between us, have a commitment to a better River Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin system and we share in common with everyone in this House a commitment to a better environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have listened to this debate and I have been astonished at the self-righteous indignation that has come from members opposite, and from the Independent members, about the environment. It is as if they had some sort of monopoly on environmental goodness that is completely absent from this side of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> House. That is absolute nonsense. The truth is that there is not a parliamentarian in this parliament who is not committed to an environmentally sustainable future for Australia. The commitment of the government to that sort of progress is shown by this bill, the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill, and our enthusiasm to generate over $1 billion in a special package solely directed to a better environment for Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I sat in my office and in this chamber and listened while the member for Calare (Mr Andren) poured out all that was wrong with the Australian environment as if we, the government, had created the dilemma and were not prepared to do anything to solve it. He rightly said that there were changes that must occur, but what he failed to acknowledge was that those changes can occur when we pass this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was particularly indignant, as was the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), because he said, `If you sell Telstra you are selling something that generates money. You are giving away something that will produce the sort of income that you need to address the environment.' Superficially, that is right. In fact, if you listened to the debate from those opposite you would have the impression that the government desperately wants to sell Telstra because for some sort of ideological reason we want to dispose of it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Stirling for his interjection&mdash;by the economic mismanagement of those opposite. We did not generate it but we have inherited a deficit roughly estimated at $10 billion in annual terms. We are determined to address it by pruning $7.5 billion from it. In addition to that, we have inherited government borrowings which currently run at something <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5751"> like $80 billion as part of a $180 billion overseas borrowing the nation is committed to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Responsibly, we have then asked, `How do we generate something like $7 billion or $8 billion to pay off our debts to reduce our monthly commitment to principal and interest so that we can have a more sustainable economy?' We cannot sell the Commonwealth Bank and we cannot sell Qantas because those opposite have already done so and the money that was generated from those sales has been frittered away in annual expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have said we will be different, that we will partially sell Telstra&mdash;let me underline and stress the word `partially'&mdash;and prune 10 per cent from our recurrent expenditure and increase the economy. Part of the revenue generated by that partial sale of Telstra, $1.2 billion, will go to the next most important and essential work Australia faces, and that is some sort of way to redress our environmental degradation. It is an entirely sustainable, unselfish and responsible approach that is currently being frustrated by the ideologues opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are committed to doing nothing more than exercising a partial sale of a government asset and directing the money generated to reducing debt. If only those opposite had been equally as responsible instead of frittering away the money generated from the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas sales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of our capacity to fund the environment depends on this partial sale of Telstra. We have not stopped environmental funding. The sort of funding that has gone on year in and year out has been once again underwritten by the Liberal and National parties in government, but in addition to that funding we have said, `Let's set aside a capital fund that would be ongoing.' It is that capital fund that these bills are all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My particular interest is in the Murray&hyphen;Darling and what these bills will do for the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin. The Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin generates $10 billion to $12 billion worth of earnings to the Australian economy every year&mdash;$4&half; billion comes out of our irrigation schemes. The general impression abroad is that those irrigation schemes and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those irrigators are the rapists who are ruining the environment. The truth is that those irrigation schemes are the way to go about feeding a nation that otherwise could not feed its resident population, let alone generate the export income that we have come to take for granted from primary production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last time the Liberal and National parties were in government, we were pretty serious about the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin and irrigation. In fact, we introduced a tax write&hyphen;off on irrigation rehabilitation which ran at 150 per cent. That meant that all of those who were in flood irrigation schemes, being watched by the member for Mallee, had an incentive to convert their flood irrigation schemes to sprinkler or drip irrigation&mdash;a very important step. Flood irrigation takes the soil and fills it well beyond saturation. It generates a huge amount of drainage water that takes the salinity it has picked up in the soil and puts it back in the Murray&hyphen;Darling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We took a step to address that by encouraging people to use sprinklers, which put on little more than the amount of water the plant is going to use. What happened? The ALP came in and within one parliament that tax write&hyphen;off had gone, because they thought it was some sort of rort. And so the real incentive that had been there for every individual irrigator&mdash;and I was a beneficiary of the system&mdash;to upgrade their irrigation went. I am not here this afternoon painting the ALP as doing it all wrong; I am just saying that was an absurdly short&hyphen;sighted measure. They still spent money on the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin and some important scheme such as the Woolpunda scheme came into being to address some needs in the Murray&hyphen;Darling, but an opportunity for every individual irrigator to get on with rehabilitating their irrigation was lost. I regret that because as a result we have had increasing flows of drainage water into the Murray&hyphen;Darling system. As a result of that, the average water available to South Australians in general has deteriorated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think we should despair of the basin. I happen to think that, when you look at the number of people who are now making demands on the River Murray, we should be celebrating the fact that it is as good as it is. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5752"> We certainly should celebrate the fact that the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin Commission now incorporates all of the catchment states and now sits down in a ministerial council and agrees on the action it will take. We should certainly celebrate the level of river management which has meant that in 1996, in what has been a year of very high flows, we can now accommodate an additional unexpected outflow from the Hume which will also make its way down the river and do very little damage in relative terms. If you are a South Australian, the higher flow that is going to result from the Hume outflow and from the particularly good management that the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin Commission is now exercising will be nothing more than a very necessary environmental flow which with a bit of luck will last through until mid&hyphen;January of next year and mean that we can take the most saline water out when the irrigation season is past its prime. There has been some very good management, but there have also been some very short&hyphen;sighted views of environmental issues from those opposite when they were in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we have come in and asked for a longer term view. We have said, `Let's establish a capital fund which can go on and be self&hyphen;generating, and let's direct the money from that capital fund to environmental issues, including the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin,' and we have said, `Let's establish that capital fund by the partial'&mdash;I stress partial&mdash;`sale of Telstra.' It is not because we want to be rid of it but because we need that partial sale to address our economic problems and do something about the environment. Yet speaker after speaker rises and gives the impression to the chamber and the impression to every Australian who cares to listen that all of Telstra is going to be sold and all of Telstra's capacity to generate funds for the government will be lost. That is arrant nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a responsible bill which is designed to guarantee for future generations of Australians a capital fund with which to do something about the environment. In addition, it will generate sufficient funds to wipe about 10 per cent off our overseas outlays. The way the opposition, the Independents and the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian Democrats have carried on, one would swear we were selling an Australian icon. We are reluctantly parting with a portion of Telstra in order to do something about the environment&mdash;a portion, I would ask the member for Cunningham to note. This is a portion that we do not want to part with, but we are forced to by the economic mismanagement of those opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a bill designed to ensure that the Australian environment continues to be addressed. As I said earlier, I do not stand here pretending that the ALP, when in government, ignored the environment&mdash;it did not. There is not a member of this House who would choose to ignore the environment. But in the economic situation that Australia now finds itself, we have no choice but to address both the economy and environmental issues as priorities. That will be done through this partial sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill before the House is designed entirely to do something about the environment&mdash;about things like the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin, in which both the member for Mallee and I have a direct interest&mdash;and I support the legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill is a historic piece of legislation. It ensures that our environment will receive the funding that it needs and requires. The shadow minister for the environment, the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), has moved an amendment that all words after `that' be omitted, with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the House is of the opinion that the Bill should be withdrawn and redrafted to  provide, in the interest of certainty, for $1 billion from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to be credited upon enactment to the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The shadow minister says that we should provide the $1 billion to the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia from the consolidated revenue fund. My question to the honourable member for Fremantle is: where will the money come from? Does she believe we should increase taxes and, if so, which taxes? Does she believe we should cut spending and, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5753"> if so, from where, or does she believe we should accumulate debt?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is well and good for the shadow minister to call for the funding to come from consolidated revenue, but she does not say how it will be funded. It is ironic that when the shadow minister was Premier of Western Australia she added to the state's debt at a rate of $1 billion per year. Having done that, she now wants to do the same at a national level. She wants to throw at young Australians a debt of $1 billion because, while she acknowledges that significant funding is required, she does not know from where it will come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister calls this a ransom note. On the contrary, it is a guarantee. It guarantees the preservation of our environment. It is a substantial step away from the tinkering at the edges of the former government. There is no denying that our environment needs a massive injection of funding. What the coalition is proposing is that that funding come via the partial privatisation of Telstra so that we can provide the significant funding that is so desperately needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In formulating our policies in the lead&hyphen;up to the last election, the coalition acknowledged that the environment needed a significant boost in funding. It is a challenge we refuse to shy away from. We saw that the only way of finding that sort of funding&mdash;without otherwise increasing taxes or debt or cutting services&mdash;was via the partial privatisation of Telstra. We considered it appropriate and worth while that we sell off one&hyphen;third of a capital asset and transfer the funds to another asset&mdash;that of our unique natural environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members opposite argue that we cannot sell Telstra. This is despite their having sold the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas, two icons they previously pinned to their hearts and said would always remain in public hands. The speech of the shadow minister for the environment was pure opportunism. She says we need to spend money on the environment, yet she condemns us for our attempts to do just that. The honourable member wants to have it both ways. She says that the environment needs funding&mdash;and, for the first time in our nation's history, the coalition is providing that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> funding&mdash;yet she runs off when it comes to finding where that money will come from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill establishes the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia reserve to which $1 billion will be allocated. Of this amount, $700 million will go towards the national vegetation initiative, the Murray&hyphen;Darling 2001 project, the national land and water resources audit, the national reserve system and the coasts and clean seas initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As outlined in the explanatory memorandum, the other $300 million will remain in the reserve in perpetuity, held on behalf of all Australians to enhance the quality of our environment. As I said at the beginning, this is a historic piece of legislation not just for today's Australians but for the future generations of Australians who will inherit our environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Notwithstanding that, there is the potential that this funding will not eventuate because of an ideological hang&hyphen;up of members opposite. If I had told honourable members 20 years ago that a Labor government would sell Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, they would have had me committed. They would have done some backflips and would have said that I did not know what I was talking about, that these public assets would always remain in public hands. Yet today those particular assets, those Labor icons, are no longer 100 per cent government owned, as Labor promised they would always be. Given their hypocrisy on Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, who is to say that a future Labor government would not sell off one&hyphen;third, one&hyphen;half or even the whole lot of Telstra? There is no guarantee that they would not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At least under our government, only one&hyphen;third of Telstra is to be sold. Two&hyphen;thirds will remain in the ownership of the government and a significant portion of the one&hyphen;third that is sold will be in Australian hands. The proceeds of the sale will provide the biggest injection of funding into our environment in the history of this nation. There is no such guarantee in the future if and when the Labor party would agree to be selling part or all of Telstra. At least under this government the environment will win, and that means all <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5754"> Australians, particularly future generations of Australians, will win.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Labor will not support such funding. They would rather our children and grandchildren and future generations of Australians inherit an environment in decline. They do not have the foresight nor the political courage to face the challenge of addressing the significant environmental problems which are confronting our nation. They would rather hang their hats on the tired old worn&hyphen;out ideology which most other nations have discarded than agree to a progressive policy which would allow Australian mums and dads to invest in a great national asset while wiping out debt and resuscitating our environment. They are political dinosaurs who need to be dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Listening to the speech of the shadow minister, which was made some time ago now, I was delighted to hear her support for the commitments to the various initiatives in the bill. As she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We on this side of the House do not question the need for such environmental funding at all, in fact our support for these projects is absolute.</PARA>
<PARA>Then she goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We see no reason at all, and none has been given, to depart from the conventional funding approach.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a little bit rich coming from someone who, when she was Treasurer and Premier of Western Australia, borrowed money and called it revenue. She says there should be no departure from conventional funding approaches, yet she thinks it is conventional to borrow money and call it income. That is what she did when she was Premier of Western Australia. So, if anyone opposite should refrain from lecturing on financial management and conventions, it is certainly the member for Fremantle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister says that the Labor Party sees no reason to depart from the conventional funding approach. The fact is we are not. We are selling part of one asset and using the funds to invest in another, and that is our environment. That is not unconventional; that is just plain commonsense. It may be unconventional to the member for Fremantle, but one need only look at her record when <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> she was Treasurer of Western Australia and one can see she knows very little about convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recent release of the State of the Environment report highlighted the problems faced by our nation. These problems will be exacerbated if this legislation, and in particular the funding for it, is not forthcoming. The State of the Environment report shows there are pressing problems in both urban and rural areas requiring attention from all levels of government. This legislation we are debating will provide $1 billion for improving the environment&mdash;$1,000 million. Yet we have the likes of the member for Fremantle, the Democrats and the Greens saying that they, too, care about it&mdash;but not enough to provide the funding that is required. We are addressing the problems, and these are significant, and when they are properly funded we will ensure the preservation of our environment for future generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members opposite, the Democrats and the Greens would rather make a political point than, for example, allow the funding of the national vegetation initiative, which will ensure that for the first time since European settlement the rate of vegetation establishment exceeds the rate of vegetation clearance. This is a policy of profound foresight, yet members opposite would rather follow a politically bankrupt ideology than ensure that future generations of Australians will inherit a better, more sustainable environment than our generation enjoyed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year the Democrats had a campaign identifying the worst ocean fronts in the nation. We have gone a step further than their rhetoric by providing $100 million for our coasts and clean seas initiative. Now, despite the rhetoric and the hot air of the Democrats&mdash;which probably does more damage to our environment than car exhausts&mdash;they will not allow the funding. This initiative would tackle coastal pollution hot spots and threats to Australia's coastal water quality and marine biodiversity. So much for the Democrats' concern for our coasts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefits of this legislation are plain and clear for all to see. It addresses a range of areas of extreme concern which require urgent <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5755"> attention. Everyone with any concern for our environment would agree that this legislation, without looking at the funding side of things, is a significant and important step forward in the protection and rehabilitation of the environment. I am proud to support the legislation. It will be one of the greatest initiatives to come before this parliament in years and for years to come. It is legislation not simply for today or tomorrow or for the next election but for the next century. It is legislation for the generations to follow. It is legislation of great foresight. It disappoints me that the funding package, the part sale of Telstra, may not be passed. Not only will that leave our nation with a second-rate uncompetitive national carrier, it will bequeath the future generations of Australians a substandard environment in decline. This legislation and the corresponding part sale of Telstra legislation will ensure we go into the new millennium with a progressive electronic communications provider coupled with a program which has laid the groundwork for the conservation, repair and enhancement of our unique environment. I urge members opposite to open their eyes to the future, not three years down the track to the next election but the future beyond our lives, and think about the sort of nation that our grandchildren's grandchildren will inherit. I urge members opposite to support this legislation for them if for no-one else. I commend the bill to the house.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) has said, nobody rises with more enthusiasm than I to embrace the concepts behind this Natural Heritage Trust legislation. It is the bill or the environmental package that the community has been waiting for for decades, especially the sort of communities that the member for Wakefield and I represent. I have spent a lifetime working in the area of water resources and on many occasions seen the need for a capital investment in what is probably this nation's most vital resource. There is no doubt that it is a key challenge for this nation to establish once and for all a determination to preserve its natural environmental heritage&mdash;not just to preserve the environment for the benefit of our children and their children but to preserve it as a capital asset, an asset <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which creates the wealth on which we so depend in order to pay our way in the world. It is a difficult task always to walk the fine line between preserving the environment from the pressures that are created by economic growth, but it is not impossible. Australia is in a unique position, I believe, having learnt from the mistakes of many of our older cousins in other nations and it is not too late. Australians overwhelmingly believe that environment protection and economic growth are equally important. Our responsibility to future generations is to leave our natural system in as healthy and productive a state as possible. It is true that, sadly, as a nation we have made mistakes in the past as we came out here and enthusiastically developed the land which we did not necessarily understand, coming from European backgrounds. Hindsight is always a severe judge and it takes great maturity to recognise these mistakes, to have a healthy debate about them but to learn from them and get on with it. Australians are good at that and, as I have said, despite these mistakes we are at a crucial point in the matter of this nation's environmental degradation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must now seize the chance to embrace this great opportunity. As other speakers have said, it is a disappointment to me, having waited for something like this for decades, not to have it equally and enthusiastically embraced across the political spectrum. It is time to take advantage of our clean, green image particularly in regard to the production of food and with the great emphasis now being put on our capacity to be the food bowl of the massive and expanding market of Asia. We must invest in the sustainable future of the environment that produces that asset. This will need a major injection of capital and this is the purpose of the trust which this legislation will establish. The trust and the range of initiatives it will support are based on the need to establish an integrated approach right across the breadth of the challenges which confront us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are significant difficulties with our rivers and streams, nutrient loads are excessive and the algae that feed on those nutrients have been shown, in the past, on far too many <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5756"> regular occasions, to have reached epidemic proportions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not a fatalist; I see these things as challenges, not problems. In our present circumstances we are in the  position of not being too late: we have time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of these challenges need an integrated approach; they need to be tackled in parallel. When you investigate the detail of the package that is contained in this legislation, which I have no time to go through, you can see that the integration is very solidly settled in the manner in which the heritage trust funds will be spent investing in the environment of our great nation. It is a historical bill. It represents the most comprehensive capital program to restore our environment that any government that I am aware of has ever attempted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trust will allow us to take a quantum leap in preserving the productive capacity of our land, preserving the water quality of our streams, arresting the decline in rare species of flora and fauna and overcoming the deteriorating state of our coastal waters. Our generation of Australians has taken much for granted in the endowment that has been granted to us. As a member of that generation, I am now very keen to play my role in restoring the depletion and degradation that has occurred so that my children and their children achieve the rich heritage to which they are entitled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Mallee electorate has developed a reputation as being an essential contributor to this nation's economy. There are oceans of grain out there. The grain crop that will be ready to be harvested this summer, if it reaches the silo safely, will probably contribute at least $1 billion to the nation's wealth. It is earning its way and it is, therefore, vital that many of the mistakes that have been made in developing the Wimmera&hyphen;Mallee, where this rich grain is developed, are arrested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These productive grain fields were achieved by the clearing of extensive mallee and wimmera scrub. This has substantially modified the natural environment and the challenge now is to recognise the economic productivity whilst at the same time attempting to ameliorate the downside impacts that such massive <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> change has had on the environment that created it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been well recognised in many of my local communities and groups of land&hyphen;holders that it is time for them to take some positive action. The communities down there have enthusiastically embraced the concept of landcare. Initially, the landcare focus was one of raising awareness and establishing an ethos of ownership by communities. Landcare has now moved on to what is an advanced stage of on&hyphen;ground action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am delighted by the renewed commitment by the government to the national landcare program, which the Natural Heritage Trust will enthusiastically embrace. It is not just about the land itself, it is not just about weeds; it is about feral animals, it is about salinity in our rivers and streams. I have sat out there in the community for 15 years, as a consulting engineer, trying to help irrigators and land&hyphen;holders develop their land management in a sustainable way. Now we have provided for us an opportunity for the Commonwealth to play its role in assisting them to meet the many challenges with which they are confronted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a range of projects that I would love to have the time to refer to, where this trust will assist my electorate in a very direct way. I could talk about vegetation biodiversity; but there is one project which I would like the House to be aware of, and that is the piping of the Wimmera&hyphen;Mallee stock and domestic system. It is a water supply scheme which covers 25 per cent of the state of Victoria. It is entirely contained within the electorate of Mallee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the last 30 years there has been a raging debate about the need for funds to convert the system from an open channel system into a pipe system. This would conserve water supply and reduce accessions into the ground water, which is creating a very serious salinity problem in the dry land regions of the north&hyphen;west of Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was delighted back in the early 1980s when the Fraser government made a commitment to provide almost $40 million to fund the piping of this essential infrastructure scheme, but I was extremely saddened when <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5757"> as soon as the Hawke government was successful in the 1983 election that that commitment was rescinded. Since that time there has had to be a cap in hand approach made to governments&mdash;and sadly I have to say even to the current government&mdash;to have a commitment made to the different stages of development of that pipeline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This infrastructure fund created by the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill will provide a mechanism by which the piping of the Wimmera&hyphen;Mallee stock and domestic system can finally be achieved. It stands in the history of civil engineering achievements as an achievement of great note. It was created in the past but now it is time to move on and embrace the new century. We have to save the water that was otherwise wasted and we have to prevent further degradation to the environment and this legislation will enable that to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like other speakers from the government side I urge those on the opposite side of politics to support this bill as a positive initiative. Overcome your philosophical reservations about where the funds come from and recognise that this legislation is necessary. There are many of us on this side of the House who feel equally concerned about the sale of one-third of Telstra, but a concept like this where the capital fund can be reinvested so that our future sustainable development is assured is a positive thing and it ought to be embraced. Therefore, I urge all members to support this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr MILES</EMPHASIS> (Braddon&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (1.37 p.m.)&mdash;I want to follow on from the comments of the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) in this debate on the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill. He has outlined very clearly to people listening to this debate how important this program is. It involves spending $1 billion for the environment of Australia and yet we have the opposition in this national parliament opposing it. It is absolutely amazing that we would have members within the opposition&mdash;members of the Labor Party and other parties&mdash;who do not agree that we should do something about cleaning up the Murray River. That river is very <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> important to the member for Mallee and he has outlined just how important it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing which is very interesting about the opposition is that they say that this money should come out of general revenue. However, this country has been left with a huge deficit already. There is no doubt that there is a great need for long&hyphen;term planning and there is no way in which this country can continue to spend money without knowing where it is coming from. It is up to the shadow minister to come in here and tell the House where this $1 billion will come from. I guess you would take it out of nursing homes or child care or education or health. Is that where it is going to come from?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When proposals are put up to spend money then governments have got to be able to say where the money is coming from. The government has a very clear position on this. Historically, Australia had governments get involved in a whole range of areas and financed them. There was a period in Australia's history when there was nobody in private enterprise who was able to provide financial assistance to various programs. Of course, in regard to the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia, this money is to come from the part sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Early on, governments needed to be involved in telecommunications in this country, there is no doubt about that, but now the government needs to put a huge injection of money, $1 billion, into the environment. Private enterprise is not able to do that but the government can do it. What this government has decided to do is to shift capital owned by Australians out of bricks and mortar, lines and  communications into the Australian environment for future generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians are still going to have this money. It is just that it is going to be taken and placed in a more appropriate place at this stage in our history. If governments are going to be bound by decisions made 30, 40 or 50 years ago and just hang on to them then they are never going to be able to allocate money to where it is needed at any particular future time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unbelievable that members of the Labor Party come here and indicate that they <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5758"> do not want a billion dollars spent on the environment of Australia at this time. It is beyond imagination that the opposition is opposing our putting up $1.15 billion over five years to rehabilitate Australia's environment. They do not want money going into revegetation. They do not want money going into cleaning up our rivers. They do not want money spent to protect our biodiversity. They do not want money spent to improve our landcare arrangements. They do not want to clean up our coastal areas and our oceans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overwhelming majority of Australians believe there is a great need for us to inject money in a big way into the environment. The government is responding to the needs that the country faces in this area, but we are being opposed by the opposition parties in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now highlight some of the areas which could be assisted in my home state of Tasmania. Tasmania has a tremendous interest in the environment. About one&hyphen;third of the state is already designated as world heritage areas. They are beautiful areas of the state. We want to do something about Australia's coastlines, and it is highly relevant that Tasmania has a longer coastline than Victoria and New South Wales put together. It is important for Tasmania to have financial help from the Commonwealth in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Money would be injected into the national reserve system throughout Australia. In Tasmania, we would like to have an assessment of decaying and fallen log resources and their contribution to biodiversity. We need to understand more fully the contribution that trees which fall over or the remains from the timber industry make to sustaining the soil in those areas. This is important for Tasmania because it grows a tremendous amount of timber for export.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area which Tasmania would like money for is to produce an atlas of Tasmanian birds, particularly the migratory species of birds, so that we can identify the hot spots where better conservation management of their habitats is required. This is another project which could be assisted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to the national vegetation initiative, in Tasmania there is a great need to look <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> at the fencing and protection of remnant vegetation to encourage people who own private land and also land around public areas to fence those areas so that we do not lose remnant vegetation forever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment, the opposition is saying to the Tasmanian people, `This is not very important because we don't want you to go ahead with these projects. We are not going to assist in the passage of this legislation.' Tasmania also has numerous rivers and streams, and we need to protect the riparian vegetation along those streams. To do this, about $3 million is needed to protect the flora and fauna of those stream&hyphen;side reserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, around a $10 million project would be most useful to the Tasmanian state in regard to tree planting programs. This amount of money coming from setting up a Natural Trust would provide financial resources to community organisations, community groups, individual land&hyphen;holders and state agencies involved in tree planting or on private land. I do not think there is anybody in this country of ours in any state who would say that we do not need more trees or we do not need to revegetate. It can be done with an interest in agroforestry with some commercial purpose to it but also in revegetating for the sake of stopping soil degradation in vast areas particularly on the mainland so that soil is not washed away. But if we do not have this bill passed, if this legislation does not go through the parliament, then of course we are not going to have this money available to assist in revegetating large tracts of the Australian landscape.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A third area of concern for Tasmania is needing financial assistance in the national land and water resources audit. In particular we would like to spend some of this money on acid drainage inventory. In other words, we would carry out an inventory of areas at drainage sites in the state in which we get acid drainage coming off those sites and then develop a remediation strategy for the major sites. Of course this would help in the water quality of many of the streams and different areas within the state, but if we do not get this legislation through then the fact is we are not going to have the resources under the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5759"> Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill to actually implement programs like that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second area in water resources which is important in Tasmania is to monitor the health of rivers. As there is an increasing use of the farmlands in Tasmania, there is a greater run-off of fertilisers into the streams, and for us to know how to adequately handle them, whether it be in Tasmania or throughout Australia, we need adequate monitoring of the stream so that the management in the future can be done on a scientific basis. All of this does require money. I know our time to debate this has been limited to approximately 10 minutes and my time has nearly expired. I just want to make one more brief comment and that is to say that it is just amazing to come into this parliament in 1996 to oppose a government spending $1.15 billion on the environment over a whole range of projects. What we are going to do is to fund it out of the partial sale of Telstra. We are just changing the capital out of being in bricks and mortar and putting it out into the environment and into the rivers, making better coastal areas, better stream&hyphen;side reserves, better wilderness areas and so forth in this country. For the opposition to be opposing this is really beyond belief. </PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (La Trobe)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(1.48 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to have this opportunity to rise and support the government's Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill 1996. I can think of no more important piece of legislation that has come before this parliament this year. I would like to remind honourable members that it was in early February of this year in my electorate of La Trobe in the beautiful Dandenong Ranges in Victoria that the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard), then Leader of the Opposition, chose to announce this policy and release our environment policy in the lead-up to the election campaign. That he chose such a beautiful area was important to me and was important to my constituents. The environment is something that is very close to our hearts and we live with it every day of every week of every month of every year. The Dandenong Ranges is a regrowth area with beautiful forests, lovely reservoirs and streams and  beautiful wildlife and birds in a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> natural habitat. It is an absolutely magnificent place. In fact, I said in my maiden speech that my electorate of La Trobe is arguably the most physically beautiful in all of Australia and no-one has ever been seriously able to challenge me on that statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is important to me that the now Prime Minister chose to release this very important policy in my electorate, and it is important to Australia. What is proposed is that in privatising part of Telstra we use a portion of the proceeds of that sale to finance rehabilitation of vast parts of Australia. Some of these initiatives are terribly important to us as a nation and they are important to regional and local areas. In particular, the work that will be done on the Murray&hyphen;Darling is of critical importance to all of us everywhere, no matter where you live in Australia. If you have travelled around that region and you have seen the salt encrusted and desecrated land, you have seen the dead trees standing like tombstones out there along the flats, then you know that we have got to learn to deal with this problem. We have got to learn to be able to rehabilitate our thin topsoil.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We desperately need to do everything we can to clean up our water resources&mdash;in fact to improve on them. We all know that we have a vast island continent nation, and two of the things that we are most lacking is deep topsoil and water. So our population demands make it incumbent on us to do everything that we can not only to take care of what we have but to make sure that we regenerate and improve it for future generations. There is no more important part of that than trees, than vegetation. Part of the proceeds from this trust will be used to help plant more trees, to help revegetate Australia and also to help stop us removing parts of our natural vegetation which inappropriately are being bulldozed year after year after year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5760"> In my electorate there are two small initiatives which I helped encourage my political party to put into our policy platform. Those two issues are very important to us in the electorate of La Trobe. One of those is feral animals. We have a real problem because in those beautiful Dandenong Ranges we have many villages and numbers of private proper ties where cats roam wild and foxes roam, and our native animal and bird stock is under terrible pressure from feral cats and from foxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have in Victoria managed to increase, over time&mdash;and I have to say increase over time under Liberal governments&mdash;the amount of publicly owned land in those hills and regenerate the forests that once were cut down to build paling fences. While we have done that, nonetheless we have a terrible problem with environmental weeds. They include thistles and blackberries and pittosporum and ivy. Have you ever seen what ivy can do to the trees? It is a beautiful, absolutely beautiful, but terribly strangling plant and it is very difficult to get rid of. We need money and part of the strategy of this trust is to implement a national strategy for weeds. I support this government's attempts to try to deal with the national problem of weeds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another area of environmental concern that I have talked about in this place a number of times. That has to do with our carbon based economy. I would like to note that this week in Parliament House there has been a youth conference on the environment. One of the issues they have been dealing with is our overuse of petroleum and petroleum products. The world is consuming its carbon based fuel resources, oil, coal and gas, at an ever increasing rate. Humanity's demand for consumption of energy is seemingly insatiable. We are using our natural resources at what should be an alarming rate. Burning natural gas is relatively environmentally friendly; burning coal or oil is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time as we burn carbon we know, and we have known for a long time, that we have available almost an unlimited supply of hydrogen. Hydrogen, I might note, is the world's most abundant element. There are no technical reasons why hydrogen should not be as effective an energy carrier as hydrocarbons, while at the same time offering significant environmental and eventually economic benefits as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have proposed that, as a matter of urgency, we should examine the medium&hyphen; to long&hyphen;term benefits of, over time, transferring our economy from one based on carbon to one <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> based on hydrogen. Examination of those issues might also include some subsets, such as engineering and scientific studies to improve the efficiency of hydrogen generation, to deal with safety issues surrounding the use of hydrogen, and to determine the most efficient mechanisms for the conversion of hydrogen to useable energy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also believe that we should examine the economic aspects of this proposal, including modelling, to estimate the real cost of burning coal and oil, including the environmental costs, projected costs of energy with tidal power/hydrogen models, and the potential export sales of hydrogen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many scientists and engineers believe that it is inevitable that we will gradually phase out burning our valuable coal and oil resources to save them for the other needs and purposes of future generations. It is my own view that, as an energy supplier nation, Australia should be at the forefront of research, development and practical mechanisms in using hydrogen as an energy source and carrier at the earliest possible date and that it should carefully manage that transition process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For several years, I have advocated the harnessing of our tidal energy resources in the Kimberleys&mdash;a renewable resource&mdash;in order to produce electricity. If the electricity generated is used, through electrolysis, to separate hydrogen from oxygen in seawater, the hydrogen gas can be used as an energy carrier to transfer what was tidal energy in the Kimberleys to all parts of Australia. The hydrogen might then be used in fuel cells, in low temperature burners or, indeed, to power motor vehicles. The by&hyphen;products of burning hydrogen are largely heat and warm water.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been estimated that the tidal energy generation capacity in the Kimberleys currently exceeds three times Australia's total energy requirements. We have a huge renewable energy resource available from the tidal flows in the Kimberleys and from seawater surrounding our vast island nation. These resources are unmatched by those in any other nation on earth and they are environmentally friendly and, I note, sustainable. I believe we <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5761"> need both vision and action to take up the challenge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is absolutely unconscionable that the few members of the Labor Party who are left in this place have had the audacity to oppose a bill designed to improve our environment. The young students who participated in today's conference on the environment say that we need urgently to address these environmental issues, but the Labor Party is not interested. The ALP mouthed a lot of words in 13 years in government, but did very little about protecting or enhancing the natural environment of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government brought to the election campaign a major proposal to use large amounts of money to help enhance, protect and regenerate our natural environment. I would have thought that the remnants of the ALP in this place would surely support such an important measure. The people in the gallery, the people listening at home, the young students who were here today for the conference support this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They want this money dedicated to fixing up the Murray&hyphen;Darling. They want it dedicated to planting trees. They want it used to help regenerate our depleted topsoil. They want it used to tackle our problems with environmental weeds. They want it used to deal with feral animals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an important piece of legislation. It is one that deserves the support of every member of this parliament and, indeed, of every man, woman and child in Australia. It is unconscionable that the ALP continues to oppose such a measure. </PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Mr GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Treasurer. How can he continue to trumpet the success of his budget when figures released over the last two weeks by the ABS, Westpac and NAB show that, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> since the budget, consumer confidence has fallen by over five per cent; 40 per cent of business says the budget will have a negative impact on business plans; employment growth has slowed well below Treasury forecasts; long-term unemployment is increasing dramatically; and the Reserve Bank yesterday made it clear that interest rates will only now be cut on the basis that the economy has stalled?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister says that it is the budget of the last two decades. I stand corrected by him as a consequence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The failure of Labor's economic administration is there for all to see. Labor was the party that took home mortgage interest rates to 17 per cent in a misguided attempt to try to bring on `the recession we had to have'; to put one million people out of work; to have an unemployment rate of 11 per cent; to have an employment minister, who now parades himself as the leader of an opposition, who presided over an 11 per cent unemployment rate; and to have a savings ratio which had gone down to 17 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was a government&mdash;the Labor government&mdash;which was unable to manage a modern economy; which could not do anything in relation to labour markets; which was engaged in a frantic selling of assets to try to cover its budgetary hole; and that in the lead&hyphen;up to the last election maintained the deceit to the Australian people that the Australian budget was balanced. And who was maintaining that deceit? The Leader of the Opposition, right throughout the last election campaign, said `We stand by the budget estimates.' And what came out in that budget was a deficit of $10 billion. You were wrong by $10,000 million. It fell to this government to have the courage to stand up and reverse it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the budget&mdash;the best received budget since polling began in 1978&mdash;we took <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5762"> a decade of deficit and debt and turned it around. We are going to turn around the Australian economy. You are beginning to see, in relation to interest rates, a 100 basis points differential on the US bond rate&mdash;something that you could never ever have attempted&mdash;a monetary policy which is locked in an inflation objective, a savings policy which will build Australia on a sustainable basis. We have the opportunity to grasp success, after a decade of failure. That is what this budget did. That is why a paltry opposition has not been able to land one blow on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the pretence today that this opposition is starting to get reinterested in the kinds of issues that worry the Australian people. But let me make a prediction: it will not last long. We will be back shortly on all of those other questions which they like to distract themselves with&mdash;whilst we go on with the real business of running the economy, whilst we go on with the real business of creating opportunities, whilst we go on with the real business of turning around a failed outfit under a failed leadership and making sure that Australians in the future have opportunities and the kind of good government that they so richly deserve after 13 years.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Mr Treasurer, can you advise the House of measures that the government is taking to promote fairness and equity in the taxation of superannuation?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="5762" SPEAKER="Costello, Peter, MP" NAMEID="CT4" ELECTORATE="Higgins" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Treasurer" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is not only a government that is determined to put the economy right but also a government that is determined to deal with all of the taxation concessions that the Labor Party put in place for the rich. Theirs was a government which was prepared to deal with the R&amp;D syndicates&mdash;and let it not be forgotten that the shadow minister for industry wants to bring back the most generous tax concessions that were available in Australia which made it optional for the rich to pay tax in R&amp;D <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> syndicates. Let there be no doubt: the Labor Party wants to make it optional for the rich to pay tax by reintroducing R&amp;D syndicates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there are other areas where this government, a government of vision and courage, has been prepared to move in relation to taxation concessions&mdash;and, of course, we had the courage to do that in relation to superannuation. I have said it before: for millionaires under Labor's policy, the top tax rate for superannuation gave you an 18 per cent concession whereas for people on $20,000, employer deductible contributions gave a five percentage point concession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party presided over a system outrageously weighted towards the rich in relation to superannuation. When this government had the courage to address it, the Leader of the Opposition stood in this House and said that he would support us. He said that he would support us&mdash;and yet your spokesman Senator Sherry, ever since that day, has been creeping around Australia defying you, absolutely defying you. His latest effort was in a speech to the ASFA yesterday which was entitled `Loping the super money tree'. I have heard of tree lopping but not tree loping&mdash;yes, both the speech and the press release: loping the superannuation money tree.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Anyway, the Labor policy on superannuation has been announced in the speech `Loping the super money tree', by Senator Sherry. Let me make it entirely clear: in the course of this speech, not once does he back up his leader's statement that they would support the measures to reduce the generosity of taxation concessions for employer deductible contributions. Not once. He has defied you again. He went to the ASFA, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5763"> and he put out this speech. He would not back his leader in relation to this.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Keep interjecting and keep interjecting loudly&mdash;it is an infallible sign that you are going badly, my friend. Not once did he support his leader in relation to that. He also had something to say about the so-called contribution. In his speech, `Loping the super money tree', he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On August 20 the Treasurer confirmed that the $4.5 billion required for the three per cent government contribution was budgeted. However, he made no statement about what this would mean for all Australians. Labor fears that the government will not honour its promise to the electorate. It is no secret that neither Mr Howard nor Mr Costello have any real commitment to what they perceive was Paul Keating's 1993 election promise.</PARA>
<PARA>What is he saying? That we may not deliver Paul Keating's 1993 election promise! Paul Keating's 1993 election promise was l-a-w. What does Senator Sherry say? He says, `Good heavens! We've defaulted on it. What's more, Howard may not make it good. He may not make good the central deceit of the Keating election in 1993.' Oh! What a terrible thing that would be, wouldn't it, if the coalition did not come in and pick up your deceit from the 1993 election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is absolutely clear that, whilst the Leader of the Opposition wants to pretend that Labor would support equitable measures, he has his spokesman sneaking around Australia doing everything he can to undermine them. I am told that, when Senator Sherry finished his address yesterday, questions were able to be called from the floor, and not one of the 1,200 delegates had a question to ask. Out of 2,400 hands, not one moved. Not one moved, because they knew entirely what Senator Sherry was up to. Senator Sherry was out defying his leader&mdash;a weak leader who does not have the capacity to discipline his own spokesman, who wants to maintain that he would do something about equity but who is unable to do so and is unable to take a stand on this issue. </PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KK6">Mr McDOUGALL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the House of the advantages to Australia of a balanced budget? What would be the consequences if the government's plans to achieve a balanced budget primarily through expenditure restraint were not adopted?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clearly, the advantage to Australia of a balanced budget is that the government would cease running down the savings of Australia and, as a response, would be able to maintain growth on a sustainable basis without the pressures of the current account deficit which became the problem bedevilling the failed Keating years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that, in addressing our savings problems, we have on occasions seen the Labor Party indicate some support. For example, the shadow Treasurer said before the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> budget that we should balance the budget over three years, which is what we did. After the budget he said that he was critical of us because we should have balanced the budget over three years, which is what we did, and of course he has announced on behalf of the Labor opposition that the Labor Party will oppose the measures that are required to achieve that objective. Let me make it clear that in opposing the measures that are necessary on the expenditure side&mdash;</PARA>

In fact, you might be heading for a promotion to his job, with the branch stacking that is going on out there in the Holt electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party opposing the necessary measures to get there make it entirely clear what their alternative strategy is. If their strategy is to oppose the expenditure measures and yet support the balance of the budget over three years, there can be but one alternative, and that is the alternative that the Labor Party always chose when it had the opportunity to do so&mdash;the tax alternative. Who could forget the record of the Keating years&mdash;the increases in the wholesales sales taxes, the increases in the petrol excise, the abandonment of the l-a-w income tax cuts and the increases in the company tax?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let it be entirely clear that there is but one alternative which the Labor Party, if it is to be believed, must have on its mind: it is the tax alternative. The Labor record was the trifecta in relation to high budget deficits, high taxation and high interest rates. Over the last five years of economic growth, the Labor Party accumulated $70 billion of underlying deficit. It is entirely clear they had no idea then how to amend their budgetary policy and get back to a balance, and they have no more idea now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A vote for the Labor Party in the Lindsay by-election is a vote for higher taxes. That is their policy. There is no alternative to that. This is an opposition which, because it is not prepared to stand up and it is not prepared to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5765"> support the necessary measures, yet wants to have the goal, must have exposed its tax agenda. It is a tax agenda for those who are lower down on the income scale, because at the same time this is a tax agenda where the opposition wants to reintroduce generous tax concessions for high income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is hit the poor and allow concessions for the rich. That is the Labor Party tax concession&mdash;concessions for R&amp;D syndicates. The shadow minister for industry wants to bring back for everybody who was in R&amp;D syndicates the option of paying tax. That is his policy. The shadow assistant Treasurer wants to give the Labor stick to the big end of town, but the reality would be that the Labor tax stick would fall where it always did fall. It would fall on wholesale sales taxes, it would fall on petrol excises, it would fall on the people of Lindsay and it would fall on the people who during the Labor years were left out in the cold. That is the inescapable logic of their confused economic position.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Werriwa for his question. I should firstly point out that the company is `Tunboa', not `Tunbora'&mdash;T&hyphen;u&hyphen;n&hyphen;b&hyphen;o&hyphen;a&mdash;just to assist you. I know you have spent a lot of time on this in recent days. You should at least get the company right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated to the parliament yesterday, and I have said publicly on a number of occasions since, the company Tunboa Pty Ltd was a small service company that was part of my business as a legal practitioner prior to 1986. It was a service company. It provided secretarial services, stationery, photocopiers and a few things like that within the small legal practice. My interest in that practice ceased in 1986. I withdrew from the partnership. That partnership was dissolved. The practice amalgamated with the remaining partnership of another legal firm. The company was of no value at that stage. It had no assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the arrangements in the dissolution of partnership were for my partner&mdash;the one partner I had in that legal practice&mdash;to take over that company, which had no assets in it. That was the arrangement. Subsequently, of course, I put it on my register in New South Wales, as was appropriate at a time when I did have an interest in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsequently, I understand that my former partner has used that company. I have had no involvement, received not one red cent from it and have not had anything to do with any annual returns in the 10 years. I have allowed it to remain on the register in New South Wales. That is an oversight on my part. I have received nothing from it. My share is paper only. It is worthless. It is of no value to me whatsoever, and I have corrected the records in the last few days.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OT4">Mr CHARLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Could the minister please advise the House of the benefits contained in the unfair dismissal provisions of the government's industrial relations reform agenda?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="5766" SPEAKER="Reith, Peter, MP" NAMEID="WI4" ELECTORATE="Flinders" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Industrial Relations" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. He obviously has a longstanding interest in industrial relations reform. As he knows and as anybody in small business knows, a major disincentive to employment in Australia today, particularly in the small business community, but right across the business community, is the ongoing operation of the Brereton unfair dismissal system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think there is any doubt, whether you look at anecdotal evidence or whether it is as a result of talking to small business at a business breakfast or at chamber of commerce functions, that one of the major problems has <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been unfair dismissal. There has been a loud and consistent call from the small business community for that Brereton system to be abolished and replaced with a system which is fair to both employers and employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to say that the abolition of Labor's unfair dismissal laws is one aspect of the reform package that we currently have before the parliament. I am also delighted to inform the House that yesterday, with the sensible support of the Australian Democrats, we reached an important stage in the passage of that legislation when the Senate gave strong support to the second reading of the government's reform package. That does bring us closer to not only getting rid of the Brereton unfair dismissal system but also introducing all the other benefits for both employers and employees so that at the start of 1997 Australia can have a modern industrial relations system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be a fair question to ask: who is actually holding out against these sensible changes? We saw yesterday in the Senate the Labor Party lining up against a sensible set of reforms to fix up the very mess that they themselves introduced after the 1993 election. We know that the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;he who received $3,389 from the CEPU&mdash;is directing the senators to also vote against this legislation. The CEPU is the union that supplied 16 operatives to run around the seat of Lindsay to run the campaign for an ex-Keating minister. This is the failed Keating minister, the nobody minister. These are the blokes who sat around a kitchen table and filled in ballot papers, which has been one of the greatest rorts we have had in a union election for a long time. This is the same union which is cheek by jowl with the AAFI in a deal to direct preferences to the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also instructive to look at who voted against these reform measures in the Senate. If you look at the register of interests for senators, it shows that 19 of the 28 Labor senators are affiliated or have been affiliated with the trade union movement. The Leader of the Opposition says that the Labor Party is reflective of the community at large. But when you take out the numbers for the new <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5767"> senators&mdash;the magnificent seven new Labor senators who have come into the Senate since the last election&mdash;every last one of them comes out of the trade union movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Mark Bishop is the one who, as a union leader, lodged a submission to the committee looking at the workplace relations bill and ran around the counter and received his own submission as a senator. He is in for the conflict of interest of the year award.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sue Mackay is from the CPSU. They are an effective crowd in touch with their own union membership, aren't they? During their last strike they got less people out against us than they could get out against the previous Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then you have Senator Stephen Conroy of the Transport Workers Union. His union is the subject of yet another complaint about a rorted union ballot. Senator Conroy was so keen to defend his bent mates in the CEPU that on 12 December he may have misled the Senate by reading into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> an alleged submission to Justice Moore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then you have Senator Brenda Gibbs of the Meat Industry Employees Union. They are the ones who, together with the wharfies, ensure that, whilst an Australian steer at the farm gate costs 40 per cent less than its American counterpart, by the time it gets to a Japanese market it actually costs more. Put another way, they are an organisation dedicated to the subtraction of value from Australian primary produce. Then there is Senator Kerry O'Brien from the `Miscoes'; there is Senator John Hogg of the SDA&mdash;I do not know much about them&mdash;and then you have Senator Kate Lundy. She is from the construction division of the CFMEU, now infamous in the Australian community for specialising in the demolishing of front doors.</PARA>

I am pleased to inform the House that we have had very good progress in implementing the new government's policy on upgrading the Pacific Highway to a proper standard over the next 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, this Saturday the Chinderah bypass will be opened. This project will be of significant benefit to the users of the Pacific Highway. The new coalition government has contributed $21 million towards this project in order to assist in the upgrading of that highway. This is part of our quick start program that is designed to give the New South Wales government and our own coalition policy a chance of being implemented quicker than has been the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also pleased that the member for Richmond will be representing me at the opening of that Chinderah bypass. The member for Richmond has campaigned on this issue for as long as he has been standing up to be counted in public life on the north coast of New South Wales. The member for Richmond campaigned on this issue in 1993 and again between 1993 and 1996. He deserves congratulations for ensuring that this Chinderah bypass is in place earlier than scheduled, bringing safety to the motorists who use the Pacific Highway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a great shame that it has taken so long for these improvements to the Pacific Highway to take place. Without the assistance of new members to this parliament on 2 March this year this project would not be under way, as it is today. Without the assistance of people like the member for Richmond, the member for Lyne, the member for Cowper, the member for Paterson and the member for Page&mdash;all of whom have come to this parliament with the Pacific Highway upgrade as part of their policy commitment to their electors in that part of New South Wales&mdash;we would not see these types of projects being opened on Saturday, as we are.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Has the government changed Australia's position on the Cyprus question, particularly in light of recent events? Can the minister inform the House of the true picture concerning the government's position on this important matter?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="5770" SPEAKER="Downer, Alexander, MP" NAMEID="4G4" ELECTORATE="Mayo" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Foreign Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question about Cyprus. I think all members of the House would acknowledge the deep interest that the member for Kooyong has in the affairs of Cyprus and the tragedy of Cyprus. The government has called for a peaceful and lasting settlement on Cyprus and has, of course, done so for many years. We support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus and we support all relevant Security Council resolutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During my recent visit to New York, I not only referred to my desire for the issue of Cyprus to be adequately addressed during 1997 and for progress to be made towards a resolution of the problems of Cyprus but also raised this matter with Mr Boutros Boutros- <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5771">Ghali, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and, when in London, with the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, Chief Anyaoku.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tragedy of the Cyprus issue in Australian terms is that for many years it has been a matter of straightforward bipartisanship, but in recent months there has been a tendency for that bipartisanship to break down. The present government's position on Cyprus is, of course, a continuation of the position of the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice with great regret that one member of the Labor Party frontbench&mdash;none other than Senator Bolkus&mdash;has attempted to try to politicise the issue of Cyprus, and indeed other foreign affairs issues, in order simply to make political points. Senator Bolkus put out a press release on 21 August in which not only did he make gratuitous remarks about the government's position on Cyprus&mdash;which is a continuation of the previous government's policy&mdash;but he even went so far as to attack the government for `refusing to take a position on the Greek Islands in the Aegean, which are under unjustified Turkish attack'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Oddly enough, the previous government did not take a position, as the member for Holt knows only too well, and, naturally enough, called for arbitration&mdash;in particular, arbitration through the International Court of Justice. Senator Bolkus went on to say that apparently I have:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . instructed the Foreign Affairs Department to take a softly softly approach to the Macedonian issue in return for some European votes at the United Nations.</PARA>
<PARA>Not only is that statement totally untrue, but it beggars the imagination as to how such a strategy could possibly work. The fact is that it was the Labor Party which, before the 1993 election, laid down conditions under which it would recognise the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. Those conditions were not met&mdash;by the way, that was a commitment the Labor Party made to the Greek community in Australia&mdash;and the Labor Party breached that commitment and went ahead with that recognition. It was that, let me remind the House, which caused such outrage in the Greek community. The simple fact is that you in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Labor Party breached your electoral commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sorry to say that the situation gets a little worse, because a few weeks ago the member for Kingsford-Smith introduced a motion into this House on the question of Cyprus. This motion was discussed by members of the House, as I recall, in a rather civilised way, and it was approved unanimously. At the end of this discussion, the member for Kingsford-Smith and the Labor Party ensured that this matter was put to a vote. I think my recollection is correct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just say that this position was not, in fact, supported by all in the Labor Party. It was certainly not supported by all on the front bench. Indeed, the member for Reid, who is the shadow minister for administrative services, on 1 October wrote to the Turkish ambassador. I happen to have a copy of the letter&mdash;not, let me hasten to add, from the Turkish embassy but from a so-called internal source. In this letter the member for Reid says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent events have dramatically focused attention on the Cyprus issue. My electors were not impressed by rather inflammatory comments made by a group of Australian parliamentary representations&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I think it should be `representatives'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">when visiting Europe and the attempt to force a vote on a Private Members resolution relating to Cyprus.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, an attempt by the member for Kingsford-Smith. So there we have one member of the frontbench writing to an ambassador saying that the efforts of another member of the frontbench are basically unacceptable. That is the clear proposition, and he agrees with it. So you have two Lauries, don't you? Both are on the same side of the road but, unfortunately, are heading in different directions. Bang! They run straight into each other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here is the Labor Party on a very delicate and sensitive issue like Cyprus playing politics for all it is worth. The member for Reid is telling the Turkish community one thing, Senator Bolkus is telling the Greek community another thing, and the member for Kingsford-Smith&mdash;I am not quite sure&mdash;is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5772"> trying to work out where it should all end up. Where is the Leader of the Opposition in this? Whose side do you take? Are you on the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith's side, the member for Reid's side or Senator Bolkus's side? No, I know whose side you are on. You are on all of their sides, you take all positions. Every position is fine for you. It does not matter what it is as long as it is expedient. That is the real lodestar for you&mdash;the lodestar of expediency that you follow day in and day out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The positions that were fine in government are no good any more. If you support Senator Bolkus you have abandoned the position you took in government. Do you support Senator Bolkus? Silence, of course. Do you support your shadow minister for administrative services? More silence. Do you support the shadow minister for foreign affairs? More silence. The fact is that this is a rabble of expediency.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;General practice is central to primary health care in Australia. It is of great concern to me that over many years general practitioners have been progressively disillusioned, disengaged and deskilled. If we are to turn this around, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners is going to be the pivotal body in doing this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">General practice is important. I was pleased that the college is particularly supportive of a number of initiatives we have been able to take just in the last six months to try to improve the status of general practice. The first thing we have done is cut down intra&hyphen;specialist referrals and bring the GP back as the central point of referrals to specialists. This will take effect from next month. We have made general practice the central point of coordinated care. We have introduced rural initiatives with departments of rural health and the John Flynn scholarships. We have changed the better practice program formula to more reflect the realities of general practice. I was very pleased to have the college's support on these matters and their view that these are in the right direction for general practitioners and their patients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two issues, though, were the major issues of discussion. They were issues relating to training and training places in general practice <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and issues relating to the government's proposal that doctors should be fully trained before they enter general practice. With respect to training, it is my strong inclination and the government's inclination that we not fragment general practice training. There are already too many groups purporting to represent general practice. I am going to take a lot of convincing to change the position whereby the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners is the primary vehicle for training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other medical practitioner proposal is something that has generated a lot of heat. It is something I was able to discuss with the college yesterday. This proposal basically says that no longer should general practice be the dumping ground for all other specialities. It recognises general practice as a speciality in its own right, and says that before people enter general practice they must be fully trained. It is interesting that some people have been suggesting that this will do two things: first, that it will have an adverse effect on bulk&hyphen;billing and, second, that it will mean young doctors may miss out on opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was, in fact, only yesterday that I learnt of a very interesting piece of information: the previous government started the split within general practice whereby some were vocationally registered and the others were called other medical practitioners or OMPs. They put a firm quota of 400 places on the training position. They froze the rebates for four years for other medical practitioners and they made other medical practitioners not eligible for practice grants. What I did not know until yesterday was that, factored into the forward estimates of the 1995&hyphen;96 budget, there was no increase in the rebate for other medical practitioners for four years across the whole period of the forward estimates. So, in fact, the 6,000 doctors in Australia who are classified as other medical practitioners will have their rebates frozen for seven years on the decision of the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is very interesting, given that certain people are saying, `Well, we are going to take away the opportunity of young doctors,' when it was the other side who said, `We'll freeze the rebates for seven years at $17.85.' It is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5774"> interesting that the ALP should be saying, `Well, if you don't increase the rebates, you are going to reduce bulk&hyphen;billing,' when for 6,000 doctors they have frozen the rebates for the past four years and the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our proposal to say that no longer are we going to permit people into the other medical practitioner group is very simply this: young doctors who are not fully trained have a bleak future. Their rebate will be frozen for seven years on decisions of the previous Labor government. They are not eligible for practice grants; they are not able to earn a reasonable living. What we are doing is simply being up&hyphen;front and honest about it rather than trying to hide it.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the most serious failures of the previous government was its failure to address the literacy problems of a significant number of school students. The evidence available to the community so far suggests that as many as one in five students are leaving primary school with inadequate literacy and numeracy skills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sad fact is that the previous government in 13 years did nothing whatsoever to address this problem. It became almost politically incorrect to suggest that there was a problem. As soon as anybody suggested that maybe it would be necessary to look at the literacy skills of Australian students, it was said, `You're attacking Australian teachers.' That is not the case. Australian teachers were becoming increasingly frustrated under the inaction of the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who was responsible for the policy vacuum which existed under the previous government, the Keating government? It was none other than the Labor Party's candidate for the electorate of Lindsay, Ross Free, the man completely without an agenda, completely without any willingness to do anything in this area. It is no wonder that I discovered on coming into this portfolio he was known by many in the school community as `Agenda' Free. He had no agenda. He did not know <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what to do. That portfolio was a policy free zone. Nothing was done to help young people gain these vital literacy skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By contrast, this government not only will be establishing national literacy standards and measuring them but also has just announced a national review of how teachers are educated at university because teachers need to have the skills to deal effectively with these literacy problems. Teachers have been frustrated by the years of inaction and they want action. The government is working with the Australian Council of Deans of Education to conduct a review of teacher education programs in universities to recommend new national guidelines and new standards for preservice teacher training. These recommendations will be available to the government by April next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A vote for the Labor Party in Lindsay on Saturday will be a vote for a person responsible for years of inaction in the critical area of literacy and numeracy for young people. This was not cost free. The consequences of the failure of Ross Free, the Labor Party candidate for Lindsay, are being borne by tens of thousands of Australian students today who are finding it increasingly difficult to get jobs. A vote for Jackie Kelly and the government on Saturday, by contrast, will be a vote to give Australian children the best possible education by addressing this fundamental educational issue.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<ANSWER PAGE="5776" SPEAKER="McGauran, Peter, MP" NAMEID="XH4" ELECTORATE="Gippsland" PARTY="NP" MINISTERIAL="Science and Technology" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XH4">Mr McGAURAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Aston for his question. Some 170 opposition questions have gone by since the budget, and not a single one has been directed at me on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> science and technology. That is 170 questions, and how many have been wasted this week for no purpose, for no relevance, to the people we are all elected to represent? So I thank the member for Aston for his interest in science and technology, even though the opposition is not interested in the slightest. Yet the opposition should be interested because technology is the biggest single contributor to Australia's economic growth. Science and technology are the economy's power house, its engine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government increased spending for science and technology in the budget by 2.7 per cent when you exclude tax concession changes. We have, moreover, involved industry to greater enhance the opportunities for commercialisation than ever before. We increased the cooperative research centres program by six per cent in real terms because that involves industry, universities and public sector research agencies. We increased the Australian Research Council's collaborative research program by $30 million, which matches universities with the private sector. Moreover, we have maintained funding for rural research and development corporations where you see commodity groups, industry, matching funds with the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was listening to the comments of my colleague the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training on the record of his predecessor, Ross Free, as a minister. In comparison to Ross Free's record as Minister for Science and Technology, they were his halcyon days. That is when he really performed to the best of his ability. If he was policy free, agenda free, as Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, you should have seen him as Minister for Science and Technology between 1992 and 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I sat around this morning trying to recall the hallmark of his term as Minister for Science and Technology and I couldn't. So I went to the public record and there was nothing. I rang around the science community and they couldn't remember anything. They think there was a lunch in 1992 but they couldn't be sure.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5777">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He had a record that is unequalled by any minister anywhere, except perhaps Senator Schacht, who followed him as Minister for Science and Technology. There they both displayed the same characteristics. Some members will recall that in 1992 Ross Free blackballed fast the federation of associated science and technology societies. He blackballed them. They represent 55,000 researchers and scientists. Why? Because they dared criticise aspects of government policy at the time. Ross Free rivals Chris Schacht for having the most sustained breakdown in relations with the science community in history. Ross Free's whole tenure as science and technology minister was marked only by his capacity to pick a fight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is one thing he is still remembered for by the science community&mdash;his sheer aggressive anonymity. He came and went. They hardly knew he was there. You ask why he was there? Simply because he was a New South Wales right wing factional appointee. He wasn't there on ability, or commitment, or knowledge or experience; he was there simply because he was part of the Keating right wing team. He was there like so many of you on the front bench; you are there purely on factional grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Lindsay have a clear choice. They can choose Jackie Kelly, who is qualified, experienced and dedicated. The alternative is Ross Free, whose record between 1990 and his dismissal in 1996 is abysmal. For all of his colourless non&hyphen;ability, you do think at times he would have a real home amongst the opposition. He would be in good company. They can choose Jackie Kelly with all of her promise and ability or they can have a long-term New South Wales right wing foot soldier and a Keating acolyte.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would have thought that some of the questions people in western Sydney are asking at the moment, to the extent that any of them are following the proceedings in this place, are questions like, `Has the Labor Party really changed over the last seven months?' They would be asking, `Why should we return to parliament a bloke we threw out seven months ago?'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I tell you what they are asking. They are asking the sorts of questions that Labor Party members have sent in to the home page of the ALP on the Internet. It repays very interesting study. I really commend it. There is not much point having a home page unless you go home occasionally and have a look at it. I would suggest to the Labor Party that it have a look at that home page. In case it does not have a look at it, I will help it. I will give it the results of some research that has been carried out by one of my colleagues in relation to the home page. Here is what one member said. It is very relevant to the ques tion that was asked by the honourable member. This person said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been a member of the party for over 10 years&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the Labor Party&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and I have helped in every campaign during this time in various positions ranging from branch campaign director to state conference delegate. When tragedy hit my family, only two members of my branch bothered to contact me, and also Jim Anderson, member for St Marys. But those that I have known and helped the longest, such as Faye Lo Po' and the former member for Lindsay Ross Free, have all completely abandoned us, as have the Metal Workers Union.</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In absolute desperation I even approached the new member for Lindsay, Jackie Kelly. She and her staff actually did help us with a social security case within hours of being contacted, despite knowing fully that I was a member of the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA>That is typical of the sort of representation that the people of Lindsay have had over the last seven months. Despite all your noise, despite all your irrelevance, despite all of your static, my guess is that out there people want to know what you have got to say about their everyday, bread and butter issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you are spending the time of the parliament talking about matters that do not go to questions of propriety&mdash;they are not my words; they are words of your own leader&mdash;I can only say to you and I can only say to the people of Lindsay, to the people of western Sydney: you voted in on 2 March somebody new, somebody fresh, somebody energetic. You said no to a failed minister of a failed government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has been his great contribution and what has been the great contribution to public life and to politics in this country since 2 March? The great contribution is that out of one side of the mouth you have said, `How shocking, how terrible it is to talk about anything but racial tolerance and racial understanding,' but through the back door, hoping nobody would catch you, you do a sleazy deal with people who would peddle racial intolerance in the Australian community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What an extraordinary performance we had from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in question time today. In every newspaper of this country today and in every television station which he has appeared on, his standards and his administration have been called into question. What we saw from the Prime Minister today was bluster&mdash;bluster to evade the responsibilities that are upon him as Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have never seen a more undignified performance by a Prime Minister in this place than the Prime Minister in his answer to that last question. He debauched his position as a Prime Minister in this place by a standard of behaviour here which matches the performance of his administration over the last few weeks. Mr Nice Guy out there in the public, the man who stands above it all, the man who represents the nation with dignity&mdash;this person has been exposed more and more <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5781"> during the last fortnight, and absolutely in his performance here today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me nail a couple of untruths. Firstly, there is the notion of a deal in Lindsay with the AAFI. Forget it. There is no deal in Lindsay. The only people with confusion in this place about their immigration policies or any other matters relating to race are you, and that confusion has been fomented by you. I offer you the opportunity to change your effort in that regard. I point out to you that, whether or not you like it, that impression now reverberates around the governments and newspaper offices of all the major nations with whom we trade in the region around us. Your unwillingness to cope with that and to deal with that is now a matter of international&mdash;not national&mdash;scandal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are in no position to come into this chamber and lecture me or anyone else on this side of the House about your performance or our previous government's performance or this opposition's performance in defending the national interest as far as our national dignity is concerned. Not only do you stand condemned in editorials around this country; you stand condemned&mdash;and I will have more to say about this later&mdash;by the situation we find ourselves in overseas. There are issues there to raise. If you do not think those issues go to jobs and security in this country, then you are further not fit to consider yourself a Prime Minister of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go to one or two other matters that have been raised here by the standards that the Prime Minister is adopting. The papers here are replete today with the great inconsistency: the demise of Senator Short, the demise of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator Gibson&mdash;and the survival of the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) and others. They have gone to that position for the simple logic of the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister talked today about people in question time taking a `bridge too far'. Let me digress for a moment on the `bridge too far' notion. That is how he sought to intimidate us in this place for asking questions of him that hold his government accountable. Where else in the nation is there <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> an opportunity in the structure that was provided by parliament to hold the government accountable? Nowhere&mdash;not between election time, anyway. The notion that it is excessive to spend four days in this place on the question of the standards of this government is purely a defensive mechanism for a government on the run, a government disgraced; a government that cannot explain itself to the people of this country on matters that it has defined as key&mdash;it has defined as key, not us&mdash;and then, in answer to the proposition here, tries to hide behind a set of arguments that are not being made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The arguments we are making go to conflict of interest and appearance of conflict of interest. That is what we have been arguing all week. What you have tried to do is to scuttle out from under that, as you have been scuttling around to the various stations, newspapers and television stations over the course of the last few days desperately trying to explain yourself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having given an extraordinarily weak and defensive performance at your press conference yesterday, your advisers have clearly told you to come into this place and shriek and blackguard in the course of question time. `Get in there and kick heads. Demand that nobody dare raise issues with you about accountability. Demand that nobody raise issues with you about whether or not you have sufficient standards when it comes to the performance of people like Senator Vanstone'&mdash;a joke in the Senate, a bad joke of a minister who went out there perniciously to argue in order to destroy social benefits for the people of this nation. You talk about the battlers of Lindsay. What was her intention? Her intention was to defend the notion of putting in place a set of criteria which hit at the heart of the ability of poor Australians to access an array of social benefits by inventing&mdash;it is really an attack on them&mdash;a bogus rich family and saying, `I am not attacking them; I am attacking a rich family, and that is all these changes are related to. They are not related to trying to skin money off the poor but related to skinning money off the rich.' </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5782">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They invented a bogus family and a set of bogus circumstances. One extraordinary explanation was, `The family was not completely satisfactory, so we added two kids. We tapped up the family home page and put two extra kids on it.' Having invented that bogus family, Senator Vanstone then had to be corrected by Senator Newman that, even with that added in, her calculations were awry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact of the matter is that we do not take bridges too far in this place on these issues. I am afraid that four days debate on the incompetence and lack of accountability, or failures of accountability, of your ministers is not too short a time to give those serious matters consideration. No amount of shouting or demeaning your office's dignity&mdash;which is something you have tried to convey in this place over the last six or seven months&mdash;will restore the sorts of headlines that you have got. Above all, no amount of it will deal with the problem that you have created for us internationally, that massive problem that we now confront of explaining ourselves in the region around us, wherein our fate, our economic security, lies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why this is a broadly based censure motion. The dishonourable behaviour of some of your ministers and the erratic performance of your government impacts not on the niceties of debate around this chamber or the good feeling amongst us all here, but on the lives and livelihoods of the people of this nation. That is what is we are engaged in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Underneath the bluster and underneath the persiflage lies a central defensive problem for you, Prime Minister. You know, because you have been educated from ignorance over the course of the last four days, that your minister for industry in particular has a very substantial problem, a problem that he defined as possessing for himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He did not sell his shares quickly enough&mdash;though, looking at the rate at which they are being sold today, I suspect he may have sold today. If he did not sell in a day in which 100,000 shares exchanged hands in that particular company, then, indeed, he would put pay to that argument that it was impossible for him to do so. That minister is absolutely front and centre the person who ought <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to go. At the end of the day, all your bluster is there to protect him. I refer to one or two articles in relation to this issue:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's defence of Mr Moore&mdash;that Bligh Ventures does not get any direct benefits from government industry policy decisions&mdash;was made to look absurd when the Opposition pointed out that associated companies which do get direct benefits have the same office, the same management and even the same phone number as Bligh Ventures.</PARA>
<PARA>In case we are in any doubt at all:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The chief executive of Techniche, Mr John Riedl, confirmed that Mr Moore was in a position to influence the financial fortunes of Bligh Ventures and Techniche . . . </PARA>
<PARA>By implication, Riedl goes on to say that he did not do his job well enough. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . but . . . the Government's policies on research and development . . . had had a negative impact on technology companies.</PARA>
<PARA>The reason, I am afraid, Mr Prime Minister, that we must persist with this motion is that there is, in fact, a deal of difference between the situation of your minister for industry and those of the two ministers whose resignations you have finally accepted. It was not forced. You did not force their resignations. You were defending them. You were running around the back of the pack hoping that none of the sheep would break out. But they did. They subsequently resigned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The position they were in is not directly comparable with the position of the minister for industry. His position is worse&mdash;by a country mile. He subsumes the problems that they had and added a few to them. He had the same problems but has added a few. At least the dealings they had in their companies were light-years away from the personal involvement that the minister for industry had in his in the past, light-years away from the day-to-day life of the ministries that they operated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this particular company is front and centre the creation of the minister, along with others. It is front and centre in his concerns and front and centre across a whole array of government programs whose policies are determined and administered by the department of industry. You could go on with all the bluster in this place that you like. But you know very well that out there is at least a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5783"> degree of resistance to a politician's bluster and a comprehension that, when that smokescreen goes up, when that bluster comes into play, it is a bevy of persiflage to try to outweigh a core of embarrassing truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That core of embarrassing truth is there. We will not let you, in question time or anywhere else, intimidate this parliament into not questioning your standards, or the standards of ours that you consolidated, although you have said they were something much more. You have said now that you have got yourself into a position where you accept the standards that we had and you are in a situation where you do stand totally exposed. There is more in this censure motion. Whilst you have been concerned with the structure of your government and what has been happening in your government&mdash;as was pointed out by the shadow Treasurer today&mdash;whatever may be the great gains that you expect from your budget, nobody else expects them any more. Industry out there are saying that, directly as a result of the budget, they expect their situation to worsen. Confidence amongst them is falling. They are confronting a situation in industry where they are contemplating lay&hyphen;offs and where there are no solutions for the long-term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do not forget the sorts of activities that people like Senator Vanstone and Senator Newman have been getting up to and what your government as a whole has been getting up to. When you come in here and lecture us at question time on whether or not the Labor Party has changed and whether or not we are standing for the needs of the ordinary, average Australian, it is they who are launching a direct attack upon them. It takes some time to change the public mind. We are not unrealistic about those things. We know that the public mind, once set in a political process, particularly after a government has been in office for some years, will give the government of the day a very substantial amount of ice to skate on. But the first point at which that government starts to expend it is when there is a difference between the undertakings they give at elections and the actual performance that they put in place subsequently.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The undertakings that you have given at election time have been massively offended against, both by your proposals in the budget and by the standards that you said you would uphold when you came into this parliament, by your activities since you have been in office. That is when the first skid begins. The second skid begins when particular policy initiatives do not produce the claimed policy outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The particular policy initiatives that you have been making claims for in this exercise are those that are related to employment, jobs and job security. Your industrial relations legislation is an attack on these. The position that you are now getting into in regard to the economy&mdash;even with the assumption that your entire economic strategy succeeds&mdash;is that, at the end of the day, what is going to happen is that long-term unemployment is going to rise, unemployment is going to rise&mdash;a signal of failure&mdash;and growth is going to fail. That is well and truly understood by the population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, what starts to undermine the standing of a government is when it appears to fail to cohere on the standards that it sets itself. This has all happened to you within six months. If people out there in the electorate have not caught up with it yet, as you maintain that they have, it is because the pace of decline is so breathtaking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within six months of gaining office you have already acquired 10 year's worth of government headlines: `Share the shame'; `Strike two'; `Top Tassie Libs resign'; `Share row forces PM to back down'; `PM calls inquiry as share row worsens'; `Howard prompts the great ministerial share sell-off'; `Howard's defence of shares backfires'; `Vanstone misled the parliament'; `Sins of the coalition D-Generation'; `Vanstone's sorry for not being on the right track'; and `Noose tightens on Moore'. The noose should tighten on Moore because there is absolutely no logic in his being sustained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to come back to another element of your situation. You stood over there and effectively accused me of being a racist and accused the opposition of being racist, but there is, regarding the remarks that you have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5784"> made, no lack of clarity in the mind of the nations around us as to where responsibility lies. There is, though, now some confusion as to the standing and nature of this nation in the region. There is confusion as to whether or not we can connect with, effectively and economically, this region; whether we can bat clever in the way in which we have over the last 13 years, putting a brand of cleverness, sophistication and understanding on the Australian brand name as we sell ourselves as a nation in the region around us, securing security and job security for our people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have indicated to them is that we have walked away from those achievements. Our educators up there in Singapore now are being quizzed as to where we really stand. Every day there is a new editorial quizzing where we really stand. The problem is, Prime Minister, you stand nowhere. The problem is that you need to be brought to account in this parliament so that, at the very least, your government can improve. You will not do it unless the parliament takes it in hand via this motion. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) was a very interesting finale to four days work in trying to whittle away at the credibility of the coalition government. I listened very carefully to what the Leader of the Opposition had to say because these censure motions provide a very important opportunity for the inspection and revelation of the attitudes, the capacity and character of the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I start by saying, as is well known around this place, that I bear the Leader of the Opposition no personal hostility. In fact, I rather find the Leader of the Opposition's company to be pleasant on occasions. I have a certain respect for the Leader of the Opposition as a figure within the Australian Labor Party. That does not mean, of course, that the Leader of the Opposition as the leader of the Labor Party, and thereby my political oppo nent, is in some way immune from attack. What I found quite extraordinary today was the remarkable sensitivity of the Leader of the Opposition to the fact that I should have attacked him politically. I know it is good to have a certain amount of bipartisan camaraderie but there comes a time, when you nail your colours to a preference deal, for example, when you have to be held accountable for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember in the Canberra by-election last year&mdash;the one we won with a 16 per cent swing&mdash;that there was some allegation about push-polling&mdash;quite erroneous, as found by a parliamentary committee. I had absolutely no connection at all with it. It was not something that involved me. In fact, I publicly repudiated the practice. Yet did that stop the then Prime Minister and the then Deputy Prime Minister using their weight of numbers as the government to identify me with that? The truth is that the leader of a political party is ultimately responsible for things like that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was expected, as leader of a federal parliamentary party, to have a view on affairs that were occurring within the Western Australian division of my party last year, and I did. I did not shirk that responsibility; I involved myself in those affairs. You had a responsibility to stop the New South Wales branch from doing that sleazy preference deal, and you failed to do it. Nothing can alter that fact. I know you are sensitive about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My reference to the Leader of the Opposition by reference in turn to the name of a movie called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A bridge too far </EMPHASIS>was that I believed he demonstrated today that he moved a censure too far. I would have thought that a man whose parliamentary skills and a man whose understanding of parliamentary matters on the Labor Party side is greater than most would have understood that you do not use the most serious parliamentary tactic four times in one week. You really show that you have no sense of proportion. You demonstrated today in two very important respects that you have absolutely no sense of proportion. Sense of proportion is very important in politics. You demonstrated that with that absolutely ludicrous time-wasting attack on the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey). You had <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5785"> no allegation of substance against the Minister for Finance. You even failed your own test. On Melbourne radio yesterday you said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now nobody is here suggesting about any of these activities that people have acted with a lack of propriety . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Let me just say that again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now nobody is here suggesting about any of these activities that people have acted with a lack of propriety . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I say again that nobody is suggesting that people have acted with a lack of propriety. Yet you got up here and talked about standards, you talked about behaviour and you talked about honour. You talked about all of those high&hyphen;sounding things and those very important things, yet at no stage have you been able to dishonour any of my current or former ministerial colleagues. At no stage have you been able to demonstrate any impropriety. At no stage have you been able to demonstrate any dishonesty. At no stage have you been able to demonstrate what is the kernel of the principle of conflict of interest&mdash;that is, private advantage ahead of public duty. At no stage have you been able to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your attack on the Minister for Finance by questioning has been exceeded twice this week by your absolutely outrageous attack on the character and personality of the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia and Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer). You impugned the credibility of Tim Fischer. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot get up and ask a question which implies that somebody has personally gained and then say, `Oh no, I'll make the allegation but I don't really mean it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You know the forms of this place. You know that, in the words of the former Governor-General, words can be bullets in this place and you know every time you get up and ask a question, which relates to public responsibility with private advantage, you are, in effect, implying that somebody has done something sleazy. That is what you have done. You have demonstrated completely by the course of the debates over the last few days to have arguments without any substance. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to your own criterion&mdash;that is the criterion of propriety&mdash;at no stage, using again the words of the Leader of the Opposition, has anybody on our side been guilty of any impropriety. I could tell by the reaction of those on your backbench when the matter was raised in question time that, increasingly, the people out there are saying, `What are they going on about? If anybody has done anything wrong, let us know the wrongdoing.' People are saying, `What is wrong with owning shares?' People are saying, `Why do they attack people's wives who own shares?' People are saying, `Why don't they come forward with any allegations?' That is because the Australian public can see through what you have been doing this week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition was good enough, perhaps not intentionally, to say during the debate that they were really his guidelines which we had consolidated. That was a very revealing statement: they were his guidelines which we had consolidated. I thank the Leader of the Opposition most heartily and most warmly for saying that the guidelines that we are now talking about were his guidelines, which the current government has consolidated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the central principles of your guidelines&mdash;that is our guidelines or the guidelines that belong to all of us, if I may coin a phrase&mdash;is that ministers should be honest in their dealings with the public. That is a very interesting proposition. The Leader of the Opposition has said that the guidelines we are talking about require honesty in ministers' dealings with the public. If they are your guidelines, why didn't you apply them to somebody who was found by a royal commission to have lied to the Australian public? If they are your guidelines&mdash;they are your words&mdash;if you had said, `Our guidelines are different from your guidelines and our guidelines did not require honest dealing with the Australian public,' then it might have been a different situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that I hear lectures from the Australian Labor Party about honesty in public life and I hear people from the Labor Party criticising the Minister for Finance when your former Prime Minister was guilty <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5786"> of the clerical oversight of twice failing to lodge a taxation return, yet did the former Prime Minister resign? No. In a brazen fashion, he came into the House and told us he was too busy. Let's face it: nobody in this world is perfect. All of us have been guilty of carelessness or clerical oversight on occasions, but to forget two taxation returns remains a monumental effort in amnesia the like of which I have not seen in my public life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know about all the other defences: the clerical oversight of leaving a $5,000 travel allowance in your safe, the clerical oversight of two taxation returns, the clerical oversight of awarding all of those sports rorts payments to marginal Labor Party seats, and all of those things. What I am talking about in relation to your behaviour goes to real impropriety, not the appearance, and throughout this whole debate the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) particularly has demonstrated a very significant misunderstanding of the concept of the conflict of interest. In order to establish that there has been some wrongdoing, it is not sufficient, I say to the House, to the minister and to the Australian public, to establish that somebody owns something; it is a question of whether that ownership is properly taken into account if a conflict of interest arises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition tried to allege that because the Deputy Prime Minister owns some shares in BHP he was automatically required by that ownership to get rid of those shares while he remained Minister for Trade. They completely overlooked the fact&mdash;and I can certify to it because I had been present at the meeting&mdash;that, even in situations where BHP had virtually nothing to do with the item under discussion, the Deputy Prime Minister would say, `I have to declare to the cabinet that I own some shares in BHP.' It almost became a record, but that is typical of the man. That is how the system operates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are not forbidden to own something. You have to make certain that your ownership does not take precedence over your duty to the broader public in relation to the government. That is what it is all about. It is as simple as that. The Leader of the Opposition <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has even endorsed it. This is what he had to say yesterday. This was a terrific interview. He not only said that it was all about propriety but also had this to say. He was asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Announcer:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Do you have any shares?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">KB:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> No, I don't have any</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . but look, don't get me wrong on this. I don't think there is any problem with share holding. I mean I think share holding is a good thing to be engaged in and you know it is possible to devise rules.</PARA>
<PARA>It gets down to a question of whether you handle a conflict of interest appropriately. On occasions, we all have conflicts of interest. Your obligation, when you have a conflict of interest, is either to get somebody else to decide the matter or to bring it to the cabinet, to declare your conflict of interest, and the cabinet, in full knowledge that you have an interest, takes the decision. That is how the system works. That is how the system has always worked and it always will work, according to your guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I assume, for example, that when the former Senator Peter Walsh, who owned some shares in Wesfarmers, was the Minister for Finance, if a conflict of interest arose he would have declared it. I would have thought former Senator Walsh, being correct and punctilious, as I think he usually was in those matters, probably did declare it. This motion is rejected by the government. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition has gone a censure too far and therefore I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"this House censures the Leader of the Opposition for the abuse of parliamentary process in pursuing groundless allegations against some Government Ministers when he himself has stated publicly that there is no suggestion of any impropriety by those Ministers and when he should have spent his time pursuing the proper interests and concerns of the Australian people".</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a defining moment in the life of every government when its true and basic character is revealed. That defining moment came for this government in this last week in a parade of unfolding events which have seen revealed <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5787"> as the defining characteristics of the Howard government hypocrisy, incompetence, utter remoteness from the world of ordinary Australians and an utter lack of dignified and effective leadership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been a very unedifying week, but it has been a watershed week which has spectacularly revealed that the government and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) do not deserve the confidence of this House and most definitely do not deserve the confidence of the Australian community. The only blind trust we should be talking about this week is that given at the last election to John Howard by a misinformed electorate&mdash;trust which has now been nakedly dishonoured by this Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hypocrisy is self&hyphen;evident. The Prime Minister came to office claiming exalted new standards in this government, exalted new standards in parliamentary life and exalted new standards in public life. Despite the rhetoric to the contrary, the standards in relation to pecuniary interests that were laid out in the Prime Minister's code of conduct were pretty much those spelt out and applied over the last 20 years, certainly by the last Labor government. The only change was that the Labor Party in government maintained those standards for the last 13 years, but they could not last seven months under this coalition and they could not last seven days without being abandoned once their actual force was felt last week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extent of the abandonment of those guidelines, that code of conduct, became very clear today at question time and in what the Prime Minister has just said. The Prime Minister has repeated over and over again that the only thing that matters is actual proven impropriety, actual proven dishonesty&mdash;not apparent conflicts of interest, not the apparent opportunity for personal gain, but actual proven impropriety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What he is doing thereby is cutting out something that has always under the Westminster system been absolutely at the heart of the principle of ministerial responsibility when it comes to pecuniary interests. It is not just actual dishonesty, it is not just actual impropriety, it is not just actual conflict; it is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the appearance of conflict and the appearance of an opportunity for personal enrichment. That is what is in issue in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was not actual dishonesty in the case of Senator Jim Short. There was the appearance of a conflict of interest and that is why he went. He got caught short in the small matter of $50,000 worth of ANZ shares that he held. He had to go and eventually he did, not on the excuse that was offered of the particular transaction that he approved, but rather for the reason that he was in general breach of the principle in those guidelines which state that ministers must divest themselves of shares in businesses in areas of their portfolio responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Gibson had a similar problem. He divested himself of his bank shares, but not of the bundle of other corporate shares he held which were manifestly at odds with his continuing responsibilities as parliamentary secretary for the administration of companies and securities law. He had to go and he did go, not on the technical excuse that was offered of a particular decision relating to the subsidy of the company in which he held shares, but rather because he was in breach of that principle of possessing shares from which he had not divested himself in an area of his ministerial responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those two got caught and they went, but they are not the only two that should have gone. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) has put himself in an impossible position by his behaviour over the course of the last few days. He has obviously acknowledged holding until just a few days ago a very large parcel of BHP, Western Mining and other shares involving major Australian exporters. He has been, among other things, specifically engaged in promoting those big exporting companies abroad. Sure, it helped Australia, and of course he was doing it for that reason, not in order to enrich himself personally. But what he was doing was also helping BHP, Western Mining and the other companies in question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5788"> While his integrity is not in question, in helping those companies in which he held shares, he was necessarily benefiting Tim Fischer as a shareholder. There was necessari ly&mdash;there had to be&mdash;an appearance of conflict with a minister operating in that area doing what he did in a situation where he was holding shares. The Deputy Prime Minister has claimed that integrity was the basis for his divestment. That is why he did it&mdash;to put his integrity beyond doubt. No doubt, as always, he is sincere in making that claim. But integrity was not enough to protect Senators Short and Gibson. Why should that claim of integrity, actual integrity, be enough to distinguish the Deputy Prime Minister's case from that of the other two ministers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why was it that the question of integrity and the defence of integrity only became relevant in the last few days? Are we recognising here a situation of situation ethics&mdash;the ethics change when the situation changes? The only situation change here was that Senator Short got caught. We had the Deputy Prime Minister scrambling to sell, too little too late to get him off the hook of the charge of obvious and sustained breach of the Prime Minister's own guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we have had the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) in a comprehensively indefensible position, each continuing day in office making a mockery of the standards that have been set by the Prime Minister, which is no doubt why there was absolutely no defence offered by the Prime Minister of the industry minister in his speech today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have an industry minister holding substantial shares in a venture capital company which is, by definition, within his area of policy responsibility&mdash;a company whose sole business is investing in companies which in turn operate squarely within his portfolio, companies which are not at arm's length, but are intimately related to the company in which he holds shares through common chairmanship, common directorships, cross&hyphen;investments, shared nameplates and even shared telephone numbers. We have an industry minister taking decisions which manifestly benefited those companies, especially the computer bounty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had in reply to all of that self&hyphen;evident, damning indictment a series of limp and faltering defences. He could not sell <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> because the market was illiquid. It was not illiquid at $2.40 at least twice over recent months and it certainly was not illiquid at $1.85. That is no excuse whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then had the defence that he was not controlling these shares in question. So what? Neither ANZ nor Boral were controlled by Senators Short and Gibson. That question was deemed previously to be absolutely irrelevant. It is said by the Prime Minister that the company is not operating in the area of his ministerial responsibility. What palpable and absolute nonsense for reasons I have already spelt out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are told that there was an entity interposed between the minister and the companies which were benefiting by his decisions. That was exactly true for Senators Short and Gibson as well. They were shareholders in the parent whose subsidiaries were the ones that benefited. Moreover, in the case of Senator Short, he held his ANZ shares through an intermediary, through a family trust&mdash;Parkwick Pty Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we had the extraordinary additional defence, which I have already referred to today, that the actual question that has to be satisfied is actual proven dishonesty&mdash;established impropriety, not the appearance thereof. It was the appearance which was amply sufficient&mdash;and under Westminster tradition has always been amply sufficient&mdash;to hang Senators Short and Gibson so why not Fischer and why not the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why were the two little puppies thrown off the sled leaving the big grown-up dogs&mdash;the lolloping Tim and the sleek Mr Moore&mdash;still barking, still preening themselves? The answer had everything to do with politics and nothing whatsoever to do with principle. When standards are nothing more than what you say to meet the political needs of the moment, you have not just got hypocrisy; you have got breathtaking hypocrisy&mdash;hypocrisy on stilts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are questions outstanding about Ministers Moore and Fischer&mdash;why they survived when others have not. But they are not the only questions left outstanding this week. There are questions about the Minister <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5789"> for Finance (Mr Fahey), who is now at the table. When did he resign his directorship? Was it as recently as yesterday or even today? How did he come to make and sign clerical oversights for nine successive years? Could he have, in fact, resigned his directorship, as he says he did, nine years ago? Was it technically possible under the Companies Act? We do not know. He should tell us. Did he deliberately mislead the Prime Minister in this place? Was it inadvertent, was it negligent or was it simply because he is just plain dumb? These are outstanding questions that have to be answered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a question about Senator Vanstone. Why didn't she correct herself at the first appropriate opportunity? Why hasn't she been disciplined for the breach of the code? There is a question about the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser). A question was put to him today by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and it was conspicuously unanswered. There are questions about other ministers sheltering behind family trusts. There are questions about the meaning of the guidelines about immediate families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The week has revealed not only an integrity problem for this government but a competence problem. It is an endemic one. It has been evident in their transition. It has been evident in their legion of ministerial stumbles. It has been evident in their inept parliamentary programming. It has been evident in the dozen major budget initiatives that have not been properly thought through. Now it has been unbelievably evident not only in the performance of the individual ministers lined up on the other ranks but in the performance of the Prime Minister himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It takes a certain skill to muck things up as comprehensively as the Prime Minister and his office have done in the administration of their code: doing nothing to require enforcement of the rules at the outset, waiting until all hell descends before he takes any action at all&mdash;and then belatedly and for the wrong reasons&mdash;with Senators Short and Gibson and, when he does pull the shutters down, doing it with the most feeble and lacklustre set of defences in my parliamentary memory.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect that what lies behind this debacle is not just a result of indolence or incompetence. There is something more than that. There is a re&hyphen;emergence of the born to rule habit of mind&mdash;the habit of mind that they are above the common herd, they are not subject to the standards that apply to us lesser mortals. There is a remoteness from the world of ordinary Australians. How else could Senator Short forget the fact that he owned $50,000 worth of ANZ shares? That is not the sort of asset that would be forgotten by the battlers of Lindsay or by any other Australian out there. How could you find yourself in a situation, as John Moore did a couple of days ago, when he said, `Presumably all of you own unit trusts, presumably all of you invest in corporations. All I can say is that you are public sector bludgers if you do not'? How remote is this? What kind of an attitude is this? We are accused by the Prime Minister of being out of touch, but we are not so out of touch that we do not know what a dollar means for ordinary working Australians, and particularly for those who are not working as a result of the coalition's economic policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Above all else, this week shows up that John Howard is a weak political leader. He is a leader of the wet finger school of political leadership, where you wet your finger and you hold it up to determine the breeze and act accordingly. Maybe he did show some leadership at the outset on the gun debate. He had the whole nation behind him then of course with the Port Arthur shock. He had the very strong support of the opposition and every other party in this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But he has lost that mantle of leadership successively over recent weeks and months. He has lost the mantle of leadership as the race debate, the Hanson debate, has evolved. What he offered this week&mdash;too little, too late as it was&mdash;was utterly sullied by his throw&hyphen;away political assaults at the same time as he was making the offer of bipartisanship. He has demeaned himself on this issue again by repeating the canard, the lie, about the so-called deal between ourselves and the contemptible party Against Further Immigration. He demeaned himself again yesterday by saying, quite extraordinarily, that, `You can <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5790"> argue racist positions without being racist.' You cannot utter propositions like this in the environment that is out there in the community on an issue as volatile and as sensitive and as hurtful as this without abandoning the mantle of political leadership&mdash;and he has abandoned it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen it in the conduct of his foreign policy in the region&mdash;limp and feeble and timorous. We have seen it in his failure to discipline the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) for his outrageous misleading of the parliament on the DIFF issue. We have seen it in his failure to act decisively and appropriately on Senator Vanstone and on a number of other ministers, about whom questions have been raised in this last week. But, above all, we have seen it in his lack of leadership now in the conduct of this whole unfolding debate over the meaning and application of the code of ministerial conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen and approached a leadership that seems to go something like this: `Want some integrity? How much can I afford? How much will John Moore let me put on offer? How much will Tim Fischer and the National Party let me put on offer?' It is an attitude and it is a habit of mind which says, `Well, if ministers cannot comply with my guidelines, I'll just have to change my guidelines to comply with my ministers.' It is an impossible situation. It is not leadership. It is the worst kind of limp and lacklustre and spineless followership. That is what we are seeing from this man opposite today. That is what lies behind this week's debacle. Tell the punters what you think they want to hear, but when the chips are down retreat and end up standing for absolutely nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been a watershed week for the government. As I said at the outset, it is a week that will be remembered. It is a week that will shape perceptions about this government and this leadership for a long time to come&mdash;certainly for the 2&half; remaining years that they spend in office. What has been woven this week is a tapestry of deceit and incompetence and arrogance and weakness all combined. We have seen from the government not a performance to be `regretted', as the Prime Minister was saying outside this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> House today, but a performance about which Australians have a continuing right to be disgusted. This is a censure of a Prime Minister and a government which is richly and comprehensively deserved. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

Right at the heart of this issue are accusations by members opposite on a scattergun approach&mdash;put it out there, smear and hope that something might stick. And yet they will go away from this parliament&mdash;as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) did yesterday&mdash;and make statements in public to indicate that there is no impropriety in terms of any of the ministers that have been the subject of the censure motions in this parliament this week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the series of questions which the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) continues to throw up in respect of each particular member and in respect of this whole issue, they are simply hoping to distract from their pitiful performance over the 13 years of their administration and the fact that a new government has come in, it has brought a new broom, and that new broom is about putting the finances of this country in order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time after time the member for Hotham fires the accusations out, but he blows it immediately. He sits down and laughs. Laugh again, Simon, because that's all you are good at doing. You don't take seriously what you are doing. You have made no serious accusations against any member on this side of the House or given any indication of impropriety at any time. It is in those circumstances that the amendment moved by the Prime Minister is entirely appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition comes in here and brings his troops with him, some of whom, of course, do not want to be troops but want to lead him into this chamber&mdash;a few in particular. He brings in these accusations and pursues groundless allegations against ministers, when he indicated publicly that there is no suggestion of any impropriety in respect of any of them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5791">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a very telling contrast between the conduct of ministers on this side of the House in the short term that the government has been in place since March and the conduct of ministers who for 13 years proceeded under a code of conduct that was not worth the paper that it was written on in the manner in which it was adhered to. It is very clear that, when there was a potential conflict in respect of the former Assistant Treasurer, when it was clear that he had made a decision on the advice of Treasury and other government officials, but the fact was that that particular decision had absolutely nothing to do with the shares that he held in the ANZ Bank, he offered his resignation. There is a million miles between the integrity of that man and some of the performances that we have seen in this place by former Labor ministers, who were simply dragged kicking and screaming to a point when the embarrassment was so great that they could no longer be tolerated within the party and they were told to get out on the basis that it was just too late. `We cannot have this process,' said the former Prime Minister, `debilitating the party any longer. You'll have to take a walk.' And then it happened. It happened on several occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issues in terms of public accountability and conflict come down to this. Firstly, a conflict means that you have a private interest and that your ministerial responsibilities may bring you against those private interests in the decisions that you make as a minister. The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) came in here today and made reference to a company that I held one $1 share in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This huge monolith! After weeks of poring over the papers and getting all his mates in the New South Wales parliament to burn the midnight oil and drag it all out&mdash;Laurie, you would appreciate that one, mate&mdash;he does not even know the name of the company. My one $1 share&mdash;I have had absolutely no involvement in that company&mdash;was worthless. It was worth zilch. No involvement whatsoever. Okay, the records of the ASC have not been changed. Wow! Where is the conflict with my ministerial responsibilities? What have I done that is a breach of integrity? Where is the dishonesty in my dealings as a minister in a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> company that I last had an involvement in 10 years ago?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make it perfectly clear, as I said in the House earlier&mdash;you do not want to hear because you want to simply smear by innuendo and everything else&mdash;that I signed many documents at the time of withdrawing from my partnership. Those documents related to leases; I suspect they related to cars; they related to word processors, photocopiers and maybe even a cafe bar&mdash;I do not know. That is all. The company was not worth that much. I also recall signing documents relating to the company. I cannot produce those, so I will not say here today that they were definitely signed.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What a top little effort today, Simon! You decided to go for the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser). It is easy: get the register and pick a company out, say, `He is still a director of that company. Does it involve itself in something or another?' and hope that, by saying a few words like that, there may be some impropriety. Your leader says there's none. And then you sit down and smile again. You keep smiling and, of course, that blows it. I say, `Jeez, he's serious this time. I wonder if he's really got something at this stage?' But every time he sits down and smiles. Well, he's an affable fellow. But you have to keep a straight face if you want to get some sort of credibility in this place. You have denigrated down to the depths of the ridiculous in this whole process. As the Prime Minister said, you have gone too far.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just say to you that there is one thing you learnt at law school: if you are in court, don't ask one too many questions, it could destroy your case. You have asked dozens too many questions this week. You <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5792"> continue to try to bring forward an argument without actually making any proper accusation on the basis of, `Gee, he's under a cloud; he's under suspicion.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say one thing about integrity, and it is something that I have learnt over a number of years in politics. It is a pretty important thing to the individuals on whatever side of the House you are on. It applies to the members on the opposition benches as much as to anybody else. You cannot prescribe honesty. You can put whatever documents you like together, but you cannot make honesty stand up if individuals haven't got it in them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am absolutely convinced that my colleagues on this side of the House in the matters that have been raised will act with honesty and integrity at all times. They have demonstrated that in two cases in the past week when the former Assistant Treasurer and the former Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer voluntarily walked forward quickly and said, `There is no real conflict, there may be an appearance of conflict, there is no gain that has come out of all this, but I am going, I want to go,' and the Prime Minister, who upholds a standard for all ministers and all members on this side of the House, accepted those resignations. What a contrast with what would have happened in your case. What a contrast with what did happen in your case. It simply did not exist and you attempted to bluster your way through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the interesting things about this debate today is that, after several days, the Leader of the Opposition ran out of things to say. He came in here and attempted for his 20 minutes to deal with everything in general and nothing in particular. Most of what he said was entirely irrelevant to the issue that has been the subject of debate in this chamber during this week&mdash;entirely irrelevant. He made a very paltry and weak defence of the tawdry deal that has been done in Lindsay with the AAFI.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He simply wanted to walk away from that as quickly as he could. He made an attempt to say, `I have been reading the editorials of various newspapers in Australia and in the region, and you're not terribly well liked, Mr Prime Minister, for your attitude to foreign <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> affairs.' He did not produce anything. He did not quote from anything. He did not do any of that. So he got into foreign affairs. He got into the case of trying to defend himself in Lindsay. He then proceeded to give the Prime Minister a lecture on standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all of my time in politics and in the time that I made a particular study of it even before going into politics, there is no-one in this nation in that entire time who has a higher standard of integrity and is respected more than the current Prime Minister of Australia. That is a fact. And to get a lecture from the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) on the question on standards&mdash;</PARA>

I shall watch with interest to see how many you are prepared to lose in the course of the days ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate before this chamber clearly has been about the question of standards, on which there has been no case made out by the opposition at any point this week. The only cases that have been made out on this issue have been the voluntary resignations of the former Assistant Treasurer and the former Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, and that was based upon their integrity and their honesty, and I admire them for doing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Werriwa comes forward with section 232 of the Corporations Law and implies that there is some breach there. Well, I have had a look at it. `I will not tell you where the breach is,' he says, but let us just have a look at section 232. I have it here and I will have a look at it again. That says that you must act honestly in respect of the corporation of which you are a director. Show me where I failed. Show me, with my $1 share in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5793"> the company, where I failed to carry out my duties in any shape or form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not about what you have done; it is about simply trying to put a question out there and letting it hang. You can spit your vitriol out in this place as much as you like, but you have not got integrity. I assure you it means much to me, and at this point I do not have the slightest concern about my honesty and my dealings in that company or anything else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a sad state, in terms of the debate that is occurring in this chamber, when we see day after day a series of accusations that are simply implied and that lack substance. You must ask yourself why it is that the opposition is trying to capture the attention of the public on these accusations. There can be only one reason: anything to delay the budget that puts the affairs of this nation back in order; anything to distract the community from the fact that there is $70 billion worth of additional Commonwealth debt that has been run up by the opposition in the past five years alone; and anything to distract from the fact that the former Minister for Finance, the Leader of the Opposition, presided over the fastest growing area of government, which was debt servicing to a tune of $10 million a year&mdash;7.5 per cent of the entire budget is about debt servicing relating to the debt that has been run up by the former Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you can fire your distractions as much as you like. You are not going to hide the fact that we have a particular strategy, and that strategy is for the good of Australia. If you are interested in the good of Australia, you would support that strategy; you would support getting our budget back into balance. You would let it go through. You would let the workplace relations reform bill go through. You would ensure that those out there that are trying to make a quid in building companies in Western Australia and companies in Sydney, unionists included, would have an opportunity to get on with the job. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the House (Mr Reith) gave an advance copy of this proposal. Indeed, it is in similar form to that which we moved when President Bush visited.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what I would ask, on indulgence&mdash;hopefully, without restricting my right to speak in this&mdash;is whether he can enlighten us on other procedures associated with the President's visit. The reality is that, when President Bush visited on the previous occasion, there was a formal meeting at the front of the building; there was a meeting with the cabinet; there was a meeting with the Presiding Officers; there was a meeting, as I understand it, with the opposition leader; and then there was a dinner in the Great Hall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the intention is to have the President attend a function at Government House, which clearly will have a limited presence. Certainly from our side of this chamber and that of the Senate&mdash;from what I can gather, on the part of all members of the parliament&mdash;there is a very strong desire to have the opportunity to be presented to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5797"> President.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 to give effect to the main budget measures relating to Medicare benefits. Most of the bill relates to the eligibility requirements for medical practitioners whose services are covered by Medicare. Other clauses in schedule 2 of the bill modify the level of benefit payable for some services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes to provider eligibility build on the vocational registration requirements in section 3F of the act which were introduced by the former government in 1989. Vocational registration introduced the concept of general practice as a separate discipline which required specific postgraduate training for unsupervised practice and provided higher fees for patients of vocationally registered general practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this bill, new doctors will be required to have or be in the process of obtaining a recognised postgraduate medical qualification before their patients are able to attract Medicare benefits. This measure is vitally important for several reasons. Firstly, it will increase the quality of health care available to the Australian community by making sure that, in future, all general practitioners have been properly trained. It recognises the current reality that a basic medical degree is no longer adequate for a doctor to practise unsupervised in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, it will help correct some of the distribution problems with the medical work force, where we have the absurd situation of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> having to import more than 500 overseas trained doctors on temporary visas each year to work in our public hospital system, even though we have something like 4,000 more doctors than our population would require.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, it will reduce one of the major growth pressures on Medicare, making it more sustainable in the longer term. There is widespread agreement that the increasing number of medical practitioners is one of the main growth pressures on the health costs in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new requirements will apply to new doctors who register with state and territory medical boards on or after 1 November 1996. This includes those new medical practitioners who are currently undertaking their internship year. The new requirements also apply to a group of doctors who, although medically registered in Australia, are neither Australian citizens nor residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other than these two groups, no existing medical practitioners will be affected by these changes. Even those registered medical practitioners who do not currently have a Medicare provider number will still be able to obtain full access to Medicare at any time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the new measures, all overseas trained doctors who wish to work in Australia, with access to Medicare, will also have to meet the new requirements. However, because the distortions of the medical work force mean that our health system has a reliance on temporary visa doctors, the new postgraduate requirements will not be mandatory for doctors coming into Australia on a temporary residence basis until 1 November 1997. This will give public hospitals and others who rely on temporary resident doctors a chance to make other arrangements. Nevertheless, it is my intention to look very carefully at the circumstances in which temporary residence doctors are allowed to come into Australia in the longer term. I will be making sure that overseas doctors are not taking jobs which could be filled by Australian citizens or permanent residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, the Medicare access provided to new trainees will, in future, be limited to their actual training posts. This move will make sure that doctors in training are not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5800"> moonlighting in jobs for which they are not trained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian medical schools produce undifferentiated medical graduates&mdash;graduates who have completed basic training but who have not yet acquired the specific knowledge or skills necessary to work effectively in an unsupervised capacity in any specific area of medical practice. Most medical practitioners currently go on to complete some form of postgraduate training in a chosen specialty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, up until now, a minority of graduates fresh from medical school, and with only one year's practical experience as an intern, have been able to set up their own private practice, treating patients for conditions which may rarely be seen in a hospital context. Graduates proceeding in this way bypass the vocational training expected for general practice. This kind of career path can have adverse results in terms of both the cost and the quality of services provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under vocational registration, introduced by the previous government, fees for these doctors are significantly lower than those for recognised general practitioners, but this has not stopped these doctors from entering this type of practice. In fact, there are concerns that some of these doctors might even be increasing their throughput to make up for the lower fees. This government is doing the responsible thing by making sure that these doctors stay in the supervised hospital system until they are properly trained to work unsupervised in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, these doctors are needed in our hospitals, where there are constant shortages. We hear stories of doctors in hospitals working 160&hyphen;hour fortnights and doing 24&hyphen;hour shifts. Clearly, there are issues of quality that need to be addressed here. When you ask the states and territories why they don't employ more doctors, they say they are unable to attract doctors into the hospitals because graduates can make more money through Medicare. In turn, states recruit doctors from overseas who, equally, may lack appropriate training and certainly do not have the particular experience required to work in some of our rural hospitals and outback communities.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst we acknowledge the valuable work that these doctors are doing in our hospitals and rural communities, it has to be recognised that bringing in doctors from overseas when there are plenty of Australian graduates who, with training, could find meaningful work in these areas, does not make sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will not only ensure that in future new doctors are undertaking vocational training before being allowed full access to Medicare, but at the same time will deal with one of the main distortions in the medical work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other amendments to the act will allow for the implementation of the multiple services rules for diagnostic imaging services and general medical services, a change to the greatest permissible gap to $50 and a change to the arrangements for services of unusual length or complexity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The addition of multiple services rules provide a power to make regulations to implement the rules. Such rules recognise that, when a diagnostic imaging service is rendered with another service to a patient, there is an overremuneration in fees for part of the costs of rendering the services. Existing sections of the act and regulations provide for multiple operations, anaesthetics and pathology rules. These rules have been in operation for many years. While it is not intended to introduce specific multiple services rules for general medical services at this time, the concept is being introduced to ensure uniformity across all service types.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The change to the greatest permissible gap, that is, the maximum gap between the Medicare schedule fee listed for any out of hospital service and the Medicare benefit payable for that service, is being increased to $50. While the act gives the gap as $26.80, the amount is indexed annually and without this amendment would have been $30.20.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final amendments remove the ability for changes to be sought to increase fees for services of unusual length or complexity. This is being done for two reasons. Firstly, Medicare schedule fees&mdash;and consequently Medicare benefits paid&mdash;should be based on the swings and roundabouts principle, with the fee regarded as being reasonable on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5801"> average for the service having regard to usual and reasonable variations in the performance time on different occasions and to reasonable ranges of complexity and technical difficulty encountered. Secondly, such a change will prevent the creation of items attracting a higher fee without ministerial approval or parliamentary scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures we are introducing in this bill amount to fundamental restructuring of the health care system to target Medicare subsidies more effectively. They will assist in ensuring that Medicare is sustainable as a world&hyphen;class system of health care. I  commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the bill is to prevent the Commonwealth Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 from further impeding the building of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge. The bill achieves this by providing that the provisions of the act do not authorise the minister to make a declaration over the area which will be used to build the bridge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will not affect the operations of the act in relation to any applications for protection made by members of the local indigenous community in respect of sites of significance elsewhere on Hindmarsh Island, or by the indigenous people elsewhere in Australia. The bill is designed to remove the hiatus caused by the circumstances following the making of the previous and current applications by Ngarrindjeri women for protection of sites on Hindmarsh Island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members will be aware of the protracted nature of this matter which arose from a number of applications for protection made in December 1993, April and May 1994, culminating in the former minister in the Labor government making an emergency declaration under section 9 of the act in July 1994. While in force for 30 days, which is the period allowable under section 9 of the act, the minister used his authority to extend the emergency declaration by a further 30 days, enabling the preparation of a report to the minister by Professor Cheryl Saunders.</PARA>

<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MILES" NAMEID="BI4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BI4">Mr MILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The consideration of the report and its attachments by the former minister and his decision to make a declaration for protection for a period of 25 years, as members will know, became the subject of legal action in the Federal Court in July 1994. The court's decision is well known to all members. The former minister's appeal against the court's order to quash his decision of 9 July failed&mdash;the Full Court of the High <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5802"> Court rightly found on 7 December 1995 that he had failed to follow the due process of the act for which he was responsible by not personally considering a representation attached to the Saunders report and known generally as the `secret women's business'. The declaration to prevent the building of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge was consequently ruled to be ineffective and had no force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the meantime, a South Australian royal commission found that the so called `secret women's business' was a total fabrication. This finding was supported by the view of some of the Ngarrindjeri women&mdash;the so&hyphen;called `dissident women'&mdash;who maintained that there was no secret women's business associated with Hindmarsh Island. It is unfortunate that the government of the day did not then decide to cut its losses and allow the bridge to be built.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government appointed then Minister Crowley to deal with a further application by the Ngarrindjeri women received in December 1995, on the basis that Senator Crowley would be in a position to consider any `secret women's business' tendered in the reporting process. Senator Crowley ruled that the December 1995 application was a valid application under the act. Once a valid application is received, under current law, a report must be prepared. Justice Mathews was commissioned by Senator Crowley to prepare a section 10 report which was completed at a cost of over $1 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As members will know, Justice Mathews' appointment has since been deemed invalid by the High Court. Although Justice Mathews' report&mdash;which was tabled in the Senate on 17 September 1996&mdash;found that `there is insufficient material from which the minister could be satisfied that the building of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge would desecrate this area according to these traditions', it cannot be used for the purposes of deciding the application for protection. Ultimately the former government's decision to appoint Justice Mathews to prepare a report has not resulted in any advance to the matters which were raised in the original application of December 1993. Three years and several million dollars later, neither the proponents of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Hindmarsh Island Bridge nor the original applicants have come away with a final decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has not lightly made the decision to prepare special legislation to enable the Hindmarsh Island Bridge to be built. It has sought advice and considered the options open to it. The advice of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department is that yet another report must be prepared on the Hindmarsh Island Bridge application, or the current law must be changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has considered appointing another reporter&mdash;under the provisions of the act. While this appears to be the process least likely to cause concern, the recent history of the administration of the act, highlighted by litigation in respect of applications for protection in Broome and Perth, reveals that, even if all the `i's' were dotted, and `t's' crossed, there would be no guarantee of a satisfactory outcome, and potentially further substantive costs to the taxpayer. Moreover, it is unlikely that a newly appointed reporter would receive any information that was not available to Justice Mathews in the preparation of her report. The government therefore believes that the act as it stands has proved to be unworkable in this instance, and there is no guarantee that a further reporting process would finally settle the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision to prepare separate special legislation to overcome the current situation is seen by the government as being the most practical course to resolve the issue once and for all. It may be argued that the government has decided that cost outweighs concern for Aboriginal heritage. This is not the case. The costs associated with the heritage protection process in this case have been extremely high, higher than for all other applications which have been determined through the processes of section 10 reports. Given the uncertainty of the outcome of another report, and the potential further drain on funds which could be applied to more beneficial programs, the government has judged that enough is enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before concluding, I remind members of the former Labor government's decision to review the act. That decision is one which this government has endorsed. Ms Elizabeth Evatt <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5803"> AC, who was appointed to review the operations of the act has now provided the minister with a report which was tabled in parliament on 26 September 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the general recommendations in the report which suggest that an overhaul of the legislation is overdue, the government has placed a high priority on addressing the findings of the report. It is pertinent to comment that, in her report, Ms Evatt has suggested that `The recommendations would help to overcome many of the current frustrations and could contribute in a positive way to the goals of Aboriginal reconciliation'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During an adjournment debate during the week when I was attacking the Australian Securities Commission I mentioned the stockbroking firm of Hartley Pointon and I was critical of them. I now realise that Hartley Pointon were acting only as an agent. I, therefore, apologise for mentioning them in that context. The interesting thing would be from whom they received their instructions&mdash;a point I will be pursuing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk tonight about what I see as the blatant hypocrisy that we have put up with in this House in this last week in relation to the Lindsay by-election. It was I&mdash;not the Labor Party&mdash;who negotiated the deal with AAFI. It took me some effort to do it because the council of AAFI has several Liberal members on it who wanted it to maintain its previous position of giving its preferences to the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I argued that, regardless of the value of the parties, it was pointless to return a government with a 40-seat majority, it was pointless to return a government which showed every sign of being as arrogant as the Keating government and it was pointless to return a government where the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) got enormous credit for reducing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5828"> immigration to above the average of the previous four years of the Labor government. Immigration had gone up dramatically under Labor because of the appalling performance of Keating and Senator Bolkus&mdash;a man for whom epithets allude me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been sickening this House to hear members of the Liberal Party one after another&mdash;knowing that they are perpetrating lies&mdash;get up say that there is a deal between the Labor Party and AAFI. The Prime Minister has been attacking AAFI as having racist policies when he knows that its immigration policy is identical to the policies of the Democrats and the Greens. After the last election, the Greens and the Democrats adopted the policy of AAFI in this regard. How can the Prime Minister attack AAFI for being racist when he does not attack the Greens and the Democrats?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The performance of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in this last week has done enormous damage to the chances of the Labor Party, but that is not my concern. My concern is that the people of Lindsay cannot benefit themselves by returning a member for the government with a 40-seat majority. If they do that, they will endorse all the policies of the government when in reality the government was elected on an anti-Keating vote&mdash;and there is overwhelming evidence for that. The electors of Lindsay must remember that, if they do that, they will endorse all the views and all the policies of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is not a lot of point in them returning a Labor member either. How they can show their disapproval of the direction Australia is going is to give their first preference votes to the candidate for AAFI, Australians Against Further Immigration. In my view, Vince Townsend is a very good candidate. He is a man of the people, and I believe he would make an excellent representative in this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that&mdash;and I repeat this&mdash;the Liberal Party knows it was not a negotiation with the Labor Party. Vince Townsend did say he had been approached by the Labor Party. That approach was simply to ask where he was giving his preferences.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party said they were not going to put AAFI last&mdash;no, they put them second last. The point is that no-one expects Labor Party preferences to be counted. It is absolutely irrelevant what the Labor Party do with their preferences. People should realise that Labor preferences in the normal course of events&mdash;they are going to win or come second&mdash;will simply not be counted, so they are not of any concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What AAFI did, on my pleading, was to put the Labor Party as No. 11 and the Liberal Party as No. 12. So they put them right at the end of the preference list. I also did say to them that Ross Free had complained to me on several occasions about Keating's performance. As a minister in the government, Ross Free felt unable to do anything about it, but he has a large number of English migrants who had been very alienated by Keating's appalling performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ross Free, I know, had a very high regard for these and was very unhappy at the Keating performance. I endorse his views on Keating. Keating has done enormous damage to the Labor Party. It has cast them into the wilderness for years. The fact is that Mr Howard, the Prime Minister, is not telling the truth when he attacks AAFI, because their policies on immigration are exactly the same as those of the Greens and the Democrats. I will make this last point: it is quite clear the deal was done between AAFI and me. The Labor Party were irrelevant in the deal. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure the majority of honourable members would agree it is a great honour to represent in this place people from many diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds, including Australians of Asian decent. Sadly, in recent months, public debate about immigration has taken a nasty turn in my electorate. I am not for one moment suggesting there is a wide division&mdash;and I am certainly working to ensure there never will be&mdash;but there has been a small number of incidents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past few weeks, many of my constituents have expressed their great hurt <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5829"> caused by irresponsible comments and behaviour in our community. Some people in the electorate of Moreton&mdash;who have lived in the area for 25 years or more and who happen to look like they have an Asian heritage&mdash;are now, for the first time ever, being openly shunned. A few have been abused and some have been spat on and told to `go home'. But they are home. These people made a conscious decision to come here to live, to raise their families and invest their time, effort and money in Australia. No-one should force them to leave or to live in fear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That parts of my electorate should now show visible signs of an Asian&hyphen;born population makes sense. The shopping centres in Sunnybank are commercial centres&mdash;rich and vibrant, soaking up the spending dollars and providing recreational pursuits for all people on the south side of Brisbane. The development has occurred because Asian&hyphen;born business people, people like Gordon Fu, have taken a chance and spent big money to develop these shopping centres into the hives of activity which they are today. Along with this development came hundreds, probably thousands, of new jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I invite those who generalise and condemn other Australians because of their appearance to come and meet some of my constituents with Asian backgrounds. They will be impressed because members of the Asian communities in my electorate have extended their hand of friendship, issuing invitations to some critics which have so far been ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It saddens me some people prefer to see only the differences and ignore the inherent similarities of all races and cultures. This is ignorance at its worst, and it is quite dangerous. Instead of dealing with generalisations, we should all be dealing with each individual person on their merits. Put simply: when it comes to people, one size does not fit all. This is tolerance, and this is what multiculturalism should be all about. You should emphasise the similarities and tolerate and celebrate the differences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Polls may show some Australians do not like so much immigration but, until recent months, Australians have always generally been polite enough to treat each individual <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Asian migrant well. While this government supports the right of free speech&mdash;which was denied to so many under the politically correct regime of the recent past&mdash;this should not be seen as a green light to call for civil riots and anarchy, as some are doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has clearly said, the right of free speech carries with it an obligation of responsibility to conduct oneself with tolerance for other viewpoints and with a regard for the effect which your comments may have on others. In other words, it is all about giving a fair go to everyone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government's non-discriminatory immigration policy is about choosing the best from the world. Asian migrants have contributed a great deal. This is what the Prime Minister said recently:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">They&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Asian migrants&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">have brought to this country many skills, they have made a contribution to our society and they have brought their commitment to individual freedom, their commitment to small business and their commitment to the strength of the extended family. They have brought those values with them and they have made a valuable contribution.</PARA>
<PARA>I support these views of the Prime Minister. I recognise they are well exemplified in my electorate. Members of my local Asian community have impressed me with their obvious devotion to their families, their hard work on behalf of their children, their respect for their elders, their willingness to work long hours, their growing involvement in our local community as well as our nation but, most of all, their love and commitment to Australia. Australia certainly needs Australians of this calibre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it is part of my job as the local federal member&mdash;in fact, it is part of the job for all members in this place&mdash;to represent all people with the necessary tolerance and understanding which should underpin good conduct with individuals and to listen to the range of views. I treat each person as I find them, and I find most people to be decent and hardworking. Part of my job is to contribute to the community leadership which can build a strong bridge between our Asian community <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5830"> and the broader community until, over time, there will be no need for a bridge. The two groups will work and live without any great distinction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This process is already well under way, especially when one looks at the young Australians of all backgrounds who learn to play together in schools in my electorate like MacGregor Primary, MacGregor High, Robertson State School, Warrigal Road State, Sunnybank High and Runcorn High.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young Australians of all backgrounds are showing the way to go. We in this place should provide the community leadership to keep them working together and not lead them down the lonely path of intolerance and bigotry, as some are trying to do. I urge all Australians to speak up on issues which concern them, and defend their right to speak, but we owe it to all Australians to have the debate without the hate.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(5.52 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the ingredients of the coalition victory was concern in the Australian electorate about employment and a sense of insecurity. The latest figures, as they apply to my electorate, are indicative of an increasing doubt in the electorate and an increasing lack of confidence in the business sector. Given the trend of recent months, we see that a 9.1 per cent unemployment rate in the central western district of Sydney in July has been exacerbated&mdash;it has risen to 11.4 per cent in the latest figures for September, a 2.3 per cent increase in unemployment. Within that central western region there are very serious differences between the municipalities involved. In March 1996 the comparative figures showed that Auburn was on 21.2 per cent, Parramatta on 11.4 per cent and Merrylands on 12.4 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is happening in this country is an increase in unemployment. The government is determined to sack tens of thousands of Telecom workers and other public servants. The government has decided that, in future, a person will have to be unemployed for 12 months before they get any assistance of any measure. It has also decided to close 26 CES <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> offices, including the historic CES employment agency at Granville. Next year it would have been in existence for 50 years&mdash;in the same spot. It was owned by the federal government and, given the history of that agency, was of some local importance. As well as that, at the recent Senate Estimates hearings DEETYA officials admitted that up to 2,000 employees who have left the department since the federal election were involved in CES casework. There is a 15 per cent efficiency dividend due to the agency over the next four years. This is not included in the budget forward estimates. Again, this means the disappearance of 4,000 people with experience, with skills and with the necessary assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to the decision to drive down employment in this country and to basically make it a buyer's market in the labour sector, there is a trend towards the privatisation of CES and employment services. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 28 August, Ross Gittins stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These will be businesses. They won't be obligated to help anyone they don't think will make a profit.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Incentive payments for placing people may mean less help for those not easily placed and less access to training if it is not profitable for the EPE. Knowledge about job vacancies will become a commodity not to be shared between EPEs or job seekers.</PARA>
<PARA>We have had earlier demonstrations of the impact of turning over labour market programs to the private sector. John D. Donahue, in his book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Privatisation Decision</EMPHASIS> , looks at the situation under the Reagan administration in America. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Late in 1982, Ronald Reagan signed the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) into law. "We are eliminating the bureaucratic and administrative waste that has characterized so many so called jobs bills in the past," he declared.</PARA>
<PARA>It is reminiscent of the kind of rhetoric that has accompanied this government's determination to cut back labour market services under the guise of ending bureaucracy. Mr Donahue continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation signalled a vigorous repudiation of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA), which had governed American training <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5831"> policy for a decade. Unlike CETA, JTPA called for the private sector to become heavily involved in designing and carrying out job training programs.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The U.S. General Accounting Office examined <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">changes</EMPHASIS>  in participation between 1980 (under CETA) and 1984 (under JTPA)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the Reagan creation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and found that the same groups that are underrepresented in JTPA generally suffered a drop in participation in the shift. . . . The proportion of high school dropouts fell 23 percent, while graduates rose 17 percent. The unemployed, women, and minorities all fell slightly as a fraction of total trainees, while the fractions of whites, of the employed or recently employed, and of males increased. In other words, the pattern of participation hints at a shift toward the less disadvantaged, more employable fraction of the large and diverse pool of citizens eligible for JTPA training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Anecdotes and commentary from manpower policy specialists have emphasised a pattern of "screening" or "cream&hyphen;skimming" in which local JTPA programs and contractors systematically select the most promising candidates for training while weeding out the troubled and troublesome, the untalented, and the disaffected.</PARA>
<PARA>The pattern that this government is following is increased unemployment, increased insecurity in the labour market, smashing of trade union movements as a form of protection against these changes, and privatisation of labour market programs and their basic drift towards those who are the most available and those who are more easily employable.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1 July 1997, hostel care level subsidies will no longer be payable for residents with very low dependency.

A hostel which catered for only hostel care level residents would lose all Government subsidies, but this would comprise only about 10% of their total income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although care subsidies will no longer be payable, providers will still receive a payment in respect of pensioners and  part pensioners, as a result of the payment of rent assistance through the subsidy arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hostel care residents will continue to pay resident contributions. The basic resident contribution for all hostel residents, including hostel care residents, will be increased by $5.40 a week to bring it into line with the nursing home resident contribution, with a gain to the hostel sector of $15 million a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The funding structure will give hostel providers considerable management flexibility to maintain their overall income through both daily fees and entry contributions. This means that hostels will not have any significant financial incentive to discharge residents.
