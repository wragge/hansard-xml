<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 (1996).</PARA>
<PARA>Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 (1996), which I have just tabled, contains alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. Concerns have been expressed for some time regarding the overall balance of benefits under the Canada&hyphen;Australia trade agreement, CANATA. CANATA provides for the exchange of tariff preferences on a range of products traded between the two countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most significantly, in 1995 Canada proposed the extension to several of its developing country trading partners preferential tariff treatment for raw sugar which would have been equivalent to that enjoyed by Australia under CANATA. Because of the significance of sugar in our overall exports to Canada&mdash;accounting for 20 per cent in 1995&mdash;such a decision would have had the impact of substantially eroding the overall value of CANATA preferences to Australia and shifting the balance of benefits under the agreement decisively in favour of Canada. In addition, elements of the Australian manufacturing industry community have also registered some concern at the benefits accruing to Canadian exporters under CANATA.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following consideration of these and other related issues, the then trade minister advised the Canadian Minister for International Trade in 1995 of Australia's intention to remove CANATA preferential rates of duty on certain Canadian imports of petrochemicals products, specifically polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride and polyvinyl esters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following a review of the situation by the incoming government and action by Canada to extend preferences on raw sugar, the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) have decided to implement the withdrawal of the preferences on these petrochemical products with effect from 1 January 1997. Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 (1996) implements that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Trade in these products is currently at relatively low levels&mdash;amounting to only $1.6 million in 1995&hyphen;96. Moreover, the reduction in the general rate of duty on 1 July 1996 will mean that the possible impact on downstream users will be minimised. A summary of the alterations contained in this proposal has been prepared and is being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposal to the House.</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(12.35 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to be able to make a contribution to the debate on the Proceeds of Crime Amendment Bill 1996. I notice that the opposition is supporting some elements and planning to move amendments to other elements of the proposed legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are obvious benefits in a number of the initiatives that this bill seeks to bring into law. I am pleased that the shadow minister, the member for Banks (Mr Melham), in his contribution during the second reading debate indicated the opposition's unequivocal support <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for at least some of those measures, particularly those elements of the bill which enable the Commonwealth to distribute proceeds of crime to a foreign country which assisted its recovery and to receive proceeds of crime from a foreign country in similar circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, as the member for Banks and the opposition have recognised, that particular initiative is overdue. It makes a lot of sense and will contribute to the effectiveness and efficiency of Australian law enforcement authorities in carrying out their very important task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Banks pointed out in his speech in this place, authorities will be facing increasing difficulty in collecting the proceeds of crime. I noticed an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> last week headlined `Online future in cash laundering'. The article, by Trudi McIntosh, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian organised crime cartels will soon be able to move digital money into safe offshore havens, such as the Bahamas, a leading international crime fighter said yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Glenn Wahlert painted a future scenario of how a medium&hyphen;sized heroin group could operate in Sydney and offshore using the new digital cash methods known as e&hyphen;cash.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">He told a high&hyphen;level Information Warfare conference in Sydney that a local drugs wholesaler who had just sold 10kg of heroin would in the next few years be able to transmit electronically from an electronic wallet via the Internet and other networks the $2 million profits on such a haul into offshore banks or companies totally eluding authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">His concern is that future smart cards (cards with electronic chips) will not necessarily have any cash limits.</PARA>
<PARA>This particular article reporting Mr Wahlert's comments focuses on the matter before us today and makes the point of how increasingly difficult it will be not only to catch these criminals by virtue of following trails of money that they leave behind them but also to recover the proceeds of those crimes&mdash;the millions and millions of dollars involved&mdash;for the benefit of the victims of those crimes. This legislation focuses on the aspect of facilitating and improving upon the existing elements of those particular activities, and I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7968"> am pleased that the opposition will support those particular provisions of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a need for cooperation between countries, and between police and other authorities in those countries, if the fight against organised crime, and against drug trafficking in particular, is to be carried on expeditiously and effectively. The visit last week by Ray Kendall, the Secretary General of Interpol, underlined, as he did in his remarks to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority, the importance of cooperation and contact between police forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In talking about his own organisation, Interpol&mdash;the rationale for which is cooperation, the sharing of information and joint efforts to locate and catch international criminals who, increasingly, are able to move around the world with some ease&mdash;Mr Kendall, in his remarks at a public meeting with the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, emphasised the importance of breaking down the barriers between countries if we are to be successful in this fight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many barriers&mdash;foreign policy, ideology, different levels of economic development&mdash;which in some respects make cooperation difficult. But there is no doubt that, if as a nation we are to be successful in the fight against organised crime, we need to break down those barriers and ensure that we receive and give the maximum amount of cooperation to authorities which have the same priorities for fighting organised crime and drug trafficking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Banks also pointed out in the debate on the second reading that it was significant that when the President of the United States stood in this place a couple of weeks ago he actually touched on the issue of drug trafficking. In the context of his overall remarks, I was pleased that he mentioned it and took it up as an issue. He said, in part, that the fight against international drug trafficking and organised crime would be one of the next great challenges facing all nations. That, coming from the President of the United States speaking here in this place, gave <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> considerable impetus to the fight against organised crime in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fight against organised crime and drug trafficking has been a priority in the United States for many years. In the United States they have what they call a `Drug Tsar' appointed at cabinet level to oversee that fight, and there are a number of agencies&mdash;the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Agency, and others&mdash;involved in the fight against organised crime and drug trafficking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia, perhaps, we have been a little slower to realise the importance of carrying on this fight expeditiously. But in recent years we have started to take very seriously the fact that drug trafficking presents a very dangerous enemy to our society. In many respects, drug traffickers should be regarded as public enemy No. 1 and, therefore, governments at all levels in our country should be very concerned to make sure that we are effective in fighting organised crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the Australian government's response back in 1984 was the establishment of the National Crime Authority. The National Crime Authority Act 1984 established that organisation, and it is underpinned by complementary legislation in each state and territory. It is the only law enforcement agency in Australia the investigations of which are not limited by jurisdictional boundaries. The NCA is a national, multidisciplinary investigative and intelligence producing agency. Its prime mission is to counteract organised criminal activity and reduce its impact on the Australian community, working in cooperation and partnership with other agencies. It is a partner with all Australian law enforcement agencies and takes investigators on secondment from all Australian police forces. The NCA is accountable to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority and also to the intergovernmental committee on the NCA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite criticism, the NCA has been remarkably successful over the years in the conduct of its mission. Criticism in recent times of the NCA has been in something of a crescendo after the recent decision by Justice Vincent in the Elliott case. Mr Elliott, understandably, was upset&mdash;I suppose that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7969"> would be something of an understatement&mdash;and discomfited by the investigation carried on into some of his activities by the NCA. When the case was thrown out by Justice Vincent, Mr Elliott was rather outspoken in his criticism of the NCA. To some extent, that criticism was echoed, without putting too fine a point on it, by another prominent Victorian, the Premier, Mr Kennett.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On balance, however, any objective observer would recognise that&mdash;despite that particular case and some difficulties the NCA had with a previous case where it was criticised by Justice Merkel&mdash;it has performed very successfully. In recent times some of its activities have come to light as being remarkably successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Initially in a question and subsequently in a speech in this place, my colleague the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou) criticised the accuracy of the NCA's 1994&hyphen;95 report to parliament. The NCA has admitted that in that particular report there was an incorrect statement about the projected recovery of money through the tax system. The Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority has investigated that particular annual report of the authority and has made some comments about that occurrence. We tabled that report in the parliament last week, so I will not go into any further detail about it. The NCA has conceded that there was, I think as it was put, a terminological inexactitude, not a false representation in the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any case, the joint parliamentary committee has been somewhat critical of the NCA's handling of that matter and the way that it was brought to the committee's attention. It is important that the NCA is seen to be properly accountable. The joint parliamentary committee has a particular role in making sure that the NCA is accountable to the public. Whilst a lot of its activities are of necessity not necessarily secret but certainly cloaked in some secrecy if it is to be effective, nevertheless there needs to be public confidence in the NCA and its activities. Part of that public confidence is underpinned by the capacity and, to some extent, the enthusiasm of the joint parliamentary committee in undertaking its statutory role in the oversight of the NCA.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not here casting aspersions on the motivations of the member for Kooyong in the contribution that he made in this place in criticising the report because he has every right to be critical of the accuracy of a report that is tabled in this parliament. But, in the broader context&mdash;in addressing my remarks not only to Mr Elliott and to Mr Kennett but also to others who have the opportunity from their high profile positions to be critical of the NCA&mdash;they need to be circumspect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must be careful, I believe, not to undermine or be seen to be undermining for whatever reason public confidence in the NCA. Again, in a broad sense, if there are those who have some agenda of undermining confidence in the NCA for whatever reason, they ought to bear in mind that a by&hyphen;product of that could be the damage to the fight against organised crime and drug trafficking, which as I have also said&mdash;and as the member for Banks said in his contribution&mdash;is enormously important in Australia at this point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In dealing with these issues, there needs to be a balance between the protection of civil liberties&mdash;and that is an issue that Justice Vincent and others have raised in the past in expressing their concerns about the NCA as an authority&mdash;and the need for the NCA's powers to be used for the sake of the end, which is certainly justifiable: catching drug traffickers and organised criminals and making sure that they are locked away for very long periods, thus preventing the havoc they are liable to wreak for their own personal gain, with no conscience of the consequences to society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Mr Broome, the Chairman of the National Crime Authority, has said, any criticism of the NCA has by and large been from uninformed sources rather than from informed sources like the Attorneys-General of the Commonwealth and states or police commissioners. As far as I am aware, they have never done anything other than strongly support the NCA as an authority&mdash;the effect that it has had in carrying out the mission for which it was established in 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the member for Kooyong's criticisms of the NCA has been its performance. In the speech that he made in parliament, the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7970"> member for Kooyong produced some statistics that indicated that the NCA may not have been as effective as perhaps it should have been. There are lies, damned lies and statistics, but it is difficult to measure the performance of an authority such as the NCA. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on the NCA has taken that up as a particular challenge. In the broad context of a detailed evaluation of the NCA, which the committee will be conducting next year, this element of performance measurement will be something the committee will be looking into.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Mr Broome has pointed out in his response to the comments made by the member for Kooyong, there may be some element of the figures that he produced that perhaps could have been updated and could have put a rather different complexion on the sort of performance the member for Kooyong was actually being critical of. The bottom line is that it costs a lot of money to catch these major criminals. This is not like handing out parking tickets. This is catching people who stand to gain enormous amounts of money from their activities, and it takes many hours of painstaking police work to do so. As the committee has spent time with the NCA, we have been very impressed.</PARA>

That brings me to the point that the member for Moore (Mr Filing) has brought to my attention&mdash;that is, the NCA's budget.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was. He is famous for that. This legislation proposes to treat the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proceeds of crime differently from the status quo. I am not unsympathetic to some elements of the proposed opposition amendment but, when it comes to voting on it, I am not sure that I would see it as something I would die in the ditches for, if I can put it in those terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The funding of the NCA is important, and I am sure that most people would be concerned to see that it is adequately funded. The government proposes in this legislation a fairly significant change to one aspect of funding the fight against organised crime. The Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) gave us assurances that the fight would be adequately funded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In deference to the earlier interjection from the member for Moore, NCA funding has been reduced in the last couple of years, and the forward estimates show that it will reduce slightly on an annual basis through to the year 2000. What I need to say is that those cuts were made in the broad context of the financial situation which the government was placed in, and members opposite know that. We have had to cut into lots of desirable programs, and this is certainly in that category.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to put on record here my commitment to this fight against drug trafficking and organised crime. As a member of this government, I will be watching very closely to make sure that the NCA is adequately funded to carry out the task which it has been given. If, at any point in time, I become concerned that it is not being so funded, I will be the first one to stand up in this place and say so, and I will be the first one to stand up in the government party room and say so to ensure that the NCA is adequately funded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation comes before us today in the context of an increasing concern in the community about the activities of organised crime and drug trafficking. It comes at a time when we are hearing more and more about heroin trafficking. In that context, it is very important legislation. It will lead to a worthwhile debate. I am sure that members on both sides of the House are absolutely committed to the fight against organised crime and are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7971"> supportive of the activities of the National Crime Authority.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to commend the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) on some aspects of his speech. He perhaps diverted slightly from the content of the Proceeds of Crime Amendment Bill, but he has had the courage, in his capacity as Chair of the Joint Committee on the NCA, to take it up to some of the thugs in the Liberal Party who have been seeking in recent times to belittle the NCA and its activities in relation to organised crime.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the member for McPherson, more by omission than anything else, avoided the very unsatisfactory aspect of this bill&mdash;that is, the quite significant cuts to the capacity of law organisations in Australia to deal with drug related problems, both at the law enforcement end and at the rehabilitation end. This bill includes quite unacceptable provisions for the diversion of quite substantial amounts of money that are acquired by the Commonwealth under proceeds of crime legislation back into consolidated revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of this is occurring at a time when, as the honourable member for McPherson indicated, the NCA budget&mdash;along with the budget of the Federal Police and other law enforcement bodies&mdash;is under very significant pressure with very significant cuts. There have been large scale cuts, particularly in places like Perth and Adelaide, in staffing numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of this is happening and, as the member for McPherson clearly indicated, it is a major international priority. The President of the United States, no less, referred to that in this chamber and, as the member for McPherson also indicated, the Secretary General of Interpol referred to it when he was here last week. The committee that the member for McPherson chairs had the pleasure of having a detailed briefing from that gentleman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is a curate's egg. As the member for McPherson indicated, there is one positive aspect to the bill. The aspect that is positive is the amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act which will enable the Australian government to enter into relationships with overseas <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> countries to share the proceeds of crime that are seized. There is no doubt that criminal activity is increasingly global and increasingly internationalised. It is therefore very sensible for an Australian government to give itself the legislative authority to enter into those sorts of arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Crime is very much a product of the sort of society we live in and the sort of technology we use. These days, perhaps, we look back on the bushranging days of Australia as being fairly quaint. I guess, apart from the National Party, there is not much bushranging going on in Australia these days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These days, it is much more likely that there will be large scale fraud associated with transactions by electronic means&mdash;that is, by on-line commerce. The level of criminal activity that is involved, given the globalisation of commerce, is quite stunning. For example, in the United States, telephone fraud is estimated to amount to $A5.3 billion annually, telemarketing fraud in the United States is estimated to amount to up to $40 billion per year, and copyright fraud in the United States is estimated to amount to $US5 billion per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia, in terms of its high incidences of software piracy and related activities, is very much at the forefront of the Western world. The use of the Internet for global commerce&mdash;which, it is estimated, will have a value of up to $A600 billion by the year 2001&mdash;just demonstrates the complexity of the commercial environment which our law enforcement organisations need to deal with in activities such as money laundering and large scale fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand a report has been prepared by the electronic commerce task force presided over by the head of Austrac, Ms Montano. I think members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the NCA and other members will be waiting with interest for a government response in the area of the increasingly complex environment our law enforcement agencies need to deal with on a global basis. This legislation is one small step towards improving the legislative array of measures that the government has to deal with in the area of international criminal activity.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7972">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think all members would agree that one of the more obnoxious forms of criminal activity is the heroin trade. By its very nature the heroin trade is international, so it is vital that Australian law enforcement organisations have the wherewithal to be able to cooperate and provide incentives for overseas law enforcement agencies to address the problems. Seventy&hyphen;five per cent of the world's opium is estimated to come from the Golden Triangle area of South&hyphen;East Asia. Large sources come from the Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan area, and some comes from the Americas. So, as I said, by definition it is an international industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is estimated by the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research that between 36,000 and 150,000 residents of Australia are regarded as regular heroin users. It is an industry of such a scale that a couple of years ago, when 123 kilograms of heroin was seized in Darwin Harbour, it did not significantly affect the price of the commodity on the Australian streets. Those sorts of figures give an indication of the scale of the problem that our law enforcement organisations such as the Australian Federal Police, Customs and the NCA need to deal with. By its very nature it is an international business and these organisations deserve the full support of members of this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The unsatisfactory aspects of the legislation are those that go to the question of the confiscated assets trust fund that was established in December 1991 by the former government, whereby all assets recovered under the Proceeds of Crime Act and under narcotics related provisions of the Customs Act are paid into that fund. This legislation is seeking to abolish that trust fund and to pay those proceeds into consolidated revenue. What the House needs to understand is that already organisations such as the National Crime Authority are feeling dramatic impacts on their budget. The Chairman of the NCA, Mr Broome, indicated to a public hearing of the parliamentary Joint Committee on the NCA on 22 October:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the committee is aware . . . we have had to lose about 15 per cent of our staff since June&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is June this year&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and that does have a significant impact on our operational capacity.</PARA>
<PARA>Staff numbers at the NCA in Adelaide will be reduced from 32 to 12. Staff numbers at the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> NCA in Perth will be reduced from 26 to 15. Staff numbers in Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney will be reduced. The overall reduction will be in the order of 66 people out of a present staff of approximately 400. That is a huge imposition on an organisation of that type, and a huge imposition on an organisation which no less a person than the President of the United States has indicated in this chamber is at the forefront of one of the issues that ought to be very much on the agenda of all governments and which all governments ought to be tackling with considerable vigour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the sorts of programs for which there are simply not going to be funds available as a result of this legislation transferring funds into consolidated revenue? In 1995, $5.4 million was paid out of the trust fund. It went towards enhancing the Insurance and Superannuation Commission's fraud detection system. It went to the department of immigration's movement alert system. It went to the National Crime Authority's telecommunications interception capabilities. It went to a whole range of projects that, frankly, would not have been funded, because they are innovative projects, projects at the leading edge, at the cutting edge, of improving Australia's law enforcement capacity. They are not the sorts of things that would be picked up, in reducing budgets, by organisations that are under pressure to maintain absolutely core functions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have a situation where it is just not credible for government members to come into this place and say that they are seriously committed to meeting the sorts of challenges that the President of the United States has put to us in relation to tackling the complexities of international and globalised crime. Against the backdrop of dramatically declining budgets in organisations like the NCA, the government is taking money out of trust funds dedicated to providing funding for innovative projects, projects at the cutting edge of Australia's capacity to deal with these things, and it is putting those funds into consolidated revenue. It is just not credible for government members to be claiming to be fair dinkum on these sorts of matters.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7973">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to providing resources for the law enforcement projects that I have already referred to, the confiscated assets trust fund that has been in operation since 1991 has made funds available for drug education and rehabilitation projects. Since 1992&hyphen;93 a total of $7.6 million has been made available to support additional projects under the national drug strategy. These projects include the `Speed Catches Up With You' (amphetamines) public education and awareness program; production of a resource document on the health effects of cannabis; a time series analysis of the patterns and uses of, and community attitudes towards, cannabis; a technical study of the toxic effects of Ecstasy; and the national initiatives in drug education program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, with merit or otherwise, is pushing very consistently a fiscal consolidation position. It defies credibility to expect that those sorts of programs will be picked up if the funding that is at present dedicated to them is diverted to consolidated revenue. It simply defies credibility for government members to argue that those sorts of activities, in any real sense, are going to continue at the sorts of levels at which they have to continue if the requirements of the Australian community, not just for effective law enforcement but for effective drug rehabilitation activities, are to be met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the drug rehabilitation issue, recently, the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia produced a report that very cogently called for increased funding for prevention, research, education, intervention and treatment of drug related problems. The report estimates that, conservatively, drug abuse costs the Australian community more than $18 billion a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is ironic that that sort of cost is imposed on the Australian community at a time when governments, both at Commonwealth and at state levels, collect vast revenues from alcohol and tobacco taxes. That revenue varies considerably across states, with New South Wales very much in the lead, on the figures I have got. But the Commonwealth government, on the figures given in this report, receives over $3.6 billion a year from alcohol and tobacco <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> excises and taxes. Absolutely trifling amounts are returned in terms of addressing the problems that very much torture our community in relation to chemical and substance abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill really is a curate's egg. It lumps together quite important and, from the opposition's point of view, very satisfactory proposals in relation to improving and updating Australia's capacity to deal with increasingly sophisticated and globalised criminal activity. The Proceeds of Crime Act, which is being updated here, is part of the armoury that arose out of the late 1980s, including the financial transactions reporting legislation. That aspect is to be commended and supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat: if government members are to be able to hold their heads up in this place and claim they are serious about tackling the corrosive effects of criminal activity, particularly the horrific implications of criminal drug activity in our community&mdash;which, as I have indicated several times, people including the President of the United States are indicating is a primary and overwhelming priority&mdash;they need to take action. Yet the government is not only screwing dramatically the budget of law enforcement organisations such as the NCA and the Federal Police but also chopping off dedicated trust funds. That is an absolute disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Important programs that the NCA, for example, is involved in, such as the development of its telecommunications interception capacities, cannot be advanced at the rate which is required to deal with the technological revolution our society is undergoing in those areas without some certainty as to sources of funds. Those projects are not going to attract the sort of priority they deserve when their staff and core functions are being hacked to bits and reduced by something like 66 out of a total of about 400.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call on the government, in the spirit of courage that was shown in this place by the member for McPherson, to review this matter, revisit it before it is too late and back away from this set of amendments which will set back this country's capacity to deal with the drug trade in particular. It will set back very significantly the process of assisting the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7974"> victims of that trade in terms of rehabilitation activity.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak during the second reading debate on the Proceeds of Crime Amendment Bill 1996. We would all be aware that crime has risen at an alarming rate. This has not happened in a short time frame. Crime, since day one, since the very first loaf of bread was stolen, has been on the increase. That is not to say that at any stage crime should be an acceptable alternative to any form of lifestyle in society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Thursday, during question time, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser), who has responsibility for customs, informed the House of the discovery of a haul of $50 million worth of cannabis which had been imported into this country in a container with a false front, with jute at the front of it. It was roughly 5,000 kilograms of cannabis&mdash;drugs that destroy the very fabric of our society; as some people call it, an entry level drug. Of all the drugs that are seized in Australia, this is no more than the pimple at the top of this monstrous boil, this septic sore, on the face of Australia. The minister also advised that this haul was obtained with the assistance of information from other countries, which is of benefit. I will come to that in a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, I heard the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) and the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford)&mdash;and last week the member for Banks (Mr Melham)&mdash;talk and talk about drugs. Drugs are not the only crime that this bill addresses. We must also remember that to the north of us there is conflict in the country of Papua New Guinea. It has been reported that extensive gun trading is going on to the north of Australia, not just in exchange for dollars at times, but in exchange for drugs&mdash;another industry that needs to be stamped out with just as big a boot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let us not forget the fraud or, as we like to sometimes call it, the white&hyphen;collar crime&mdash;things like excessive Medicare fraud: billing, billing and billing at the Australian taxpayer's expense and, more importantly, at the expense of those who deservedly need medical help. That money has been stripped away from <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them. And do not forget nursing home fraud. They are all Commonwealth crimes from which, when proven, the proceeds will go into the fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I was glad to hear that the member for Banks and the member for Maribyrnong, in essence, support this bill&mdash;apart from a couple of amendments that have been foreshadowed, but I will address those very shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to talk about the three parts by which the major amendments will best benefit Australia. The first is the cooperation with overseas countries. Now we will be able to provide financial incentive and reward for information towards proving the crime. Australian consolidated revenue will benefit from selling the assets of the person perpetrating the crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, it will not have to be just those countries that we have a treaty with but any country that works with Australia to arrest these sorts of crimes. Thirdly, not only will the money go out to where overseas countries have assisted us in getting the crime stopped here in Australia but, moreover, we will receive a benefit from the proceeds of the crimes and goods from overseas countries. Given the amount of crime overseas that Australians are involved in at a much higher level, the net inflow of dollars to Australia should be substantially more than the outflow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We talk about money laundering. Australia is not really into money laundering. We are not exactly known as the washing machine of the foreign money laundering system. Whilst a lot of money goes out of Australia, it is not exactly turned over in this country and cleansed to be used by those who perpetrate the crimes for their own enjoyment. Indeed, they must track it offshore and follow through a vigorous process of making sure that it is squeaky clean before they bring it back in here and at times they are caught out even doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7975"> The bill removes the trust fund for the direct funding of drug education and rehabilitation projects. Talking of the two major areas of drug rehabilitation and drug offensives, it is rather ludicrous and hypocritical of both the member for Banks and the member for Mari byrnong to describe these moves as cutbacks. If they bothered to read through the explanatory notes, they would realise that the money goes into consolidated revenue and that the fight against all crime and drug rehabilitation should be funded out of consolidated revenue so that it does not become a feast or famine but is based on logical argument with clearly set down plans and guidelines to achieve the objective. Simply going through with a small amount of base funding and then waiting for the returns to come in is not exactly the way that anyone should plan anything at all, whether it be a business or an offensive plan to arrest the rate of drug usage in Australia or, indeed, the very sadly spent money on drug rehabilitation for those that get caught up through cannabis from the schoolyard on through to the hardline trafficking of heroin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, I read with great sadness yesterday in one of the Sydney papers of a father who wishes to die in gaol in the north because he will be too embarrassed to come home to see his family when his term finally expires when he will be aged over 60. It could be argued that it was either his own fault that he got into a drug habit or it was the fault of somebody else. But drugs are drugs and there is a lot of peer group pressure to be involved in the drug industry, whether as a taker, as a pusher or even as a cultivator of drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Talking about the law aspect of it, I heard both today and last Thursday about all the cutbacks to the crime agencies, whether it be the Australian Federal Police or the National Crime Authority, as though the total budget for these agencies came out of the Proceeds of Crime Amendment Bill. Indeed, only a relatively small part comes through that. But how absolutely hypocritical it is for those opposite to talk about cutbacks. I remind members of this House that those cutbacks are a direct result of 13 years of irresponsible overspending in general and Beazley's black hole which is so wide and deep that you could not even drive through it. They talk about these cutbacks being the fault of the Liberals and Nationals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, if we did not face such a deficit perhaps we would not have to apply cutbacks&mdash;and these have not been singled out&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> but perhaps we could have increased the funding for them. If they described cutbacks as acceptable efficiency dividends when they were in government, we must then term these cutbacks as efficiency dividends based on the previous performance of the Labor government in overspending. You only have cutbacks when you exceed your budgetary income. It is based on mathematics: if you do not get the money in, you cannot spend it. On 2 March, the people told you quite clearly they had had enough of your overspending&mdash;overspending for which you never accepted responsibility, and you still do not. But we have accepted that the problem exists and we have accepted responsibility for taking over the issue and addressing the problems.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "prevent" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"the Right Honourable Member for New England moving the following motion forthwith: `the House is of the opinion that, because of the discriminatory nature of the provisions of the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996, it should not proceed to consider the measure further and calls on the Attorney&hyphen;General and Minister for Justice to have an alternative bill prepared and presented to the House in a form which does not discriminate against the people of any part of Australia and which would enable Members to vote according to their views on the issue of euthanasia on the basis of a possible uniform, national approach to the issue'". <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7976"> </PARA>
<PARA>I move this amendment because I believe the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996 as now presented to the House is a misnomer. This bill is not a euthanasia laws bill; this is a bill to amend the constitution of three territories of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you read the bill itself, it says that the act commences&mdash;and the schedules are specified. The only substance in the legislation is in the schedules. When you turn to the schedules of the bill, you will see that they begin:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to this section the power of the Legislative Assembly conferred by section 6 in relation to the making of laws does not extend to the making of laws . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The same applies to the Australian Capital Territory (Self&hyphen;Government) Act:</PARA>

<PARA>Subsection (2A) of schedule 3 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Legislative Assembly does have power to make laws with respect to . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In each instance this legislation is not dealing with the subject matter about which all of us have very strong views. Indeed, my concern is that we are really not talking about euthanasia at all; we are talking about self&hyphen;government provisions as they apply to three Australian territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who would oppose my amendment will say, `But what is the head of power under which you will deal with this subject on a uniform national basis?' To that I would say there are two ways you can deal with it. The first is that you refer it, if there is no presently available head of power&mdash;and that is presuming there is not, and I have suggested in my amendment we ask the Attorney&hyphen;General and Minister for Justice (Mr Williams) to identify whether or not there is a power&mdash;to COAG, the Council of Australian Governments. Secondly, if people feel, as many do, very strongly on this issue&mdash;and indeed on other social issues&mdash;we could so easily have a referendum to determine whether or not the Commonwealth should not be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the enacting authority to deal with matters of this character.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this debate today, realistically we are saying to three categories of people, uniquely amongst all Australians, `You are not going to have power under your constitution to deal with this issue.' I would put it to everyone that we are well past the day and age when we want to be discriminatory. Let's face it: it is because there is discrimination that many of us are concerned about the remarks of the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). It is because there is discrimination in various areas that we passed the human rights and equal opportunities legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And what are we doing here today? We are discriminating against three categories of Australians. We are not saying to every Australian, `Oh no, your government can't pass this bill. If you come from New South Wales, Queensland or Victoria, or any of the originating states, you can go ahead and your government can pass legislation with respect to euthanasia, but if you come from the Northern Territory, the ACT or Norfolk Island you are not allowed to pass that law.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is very important that we see ourselves as Australians and that we do not see ourselves as members of this Australian parliament laying down the law which says that some people cannot have a power to apply an act in this narrow way. I think it is very important that people do not think, when they are standing up to speak on this bill, `Yes, I have a conscience vote on this important social issue,' or that they see this issue as the substance of this bill because it is not&mdash;it is almost a sideline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill beguiles people into believing that the constitution affecting three sectors alone of the Australian community is going to be changed and, for all the rest of Australia, it is going to be the same. I think many of us have strong views on the question&mdash;I certainly do&mdash;but my trouble is that I am not voting on the question; I am voting on the constitution of a government which, some time ago, this parliament decided&mdash;as I recall, with total unanimity&mdash;could exercise self&hyphen;government. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7977"> That was not just one territory; it was the territories of the ACT and the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What concerns me is that the community at large out there is very rightly expressing concerns about the issue. I feel strongly on the issue, but I do not think we are voting on the issue. I think we are voting only on a device to try to inhibit some sectors of the Australian community from being subject to a law to which any other section of the Australian community can be subject.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regrettably, because of the time at which the debate has been taking place and because most of the debate was in the Main Committee, many people perhaps may not be aware of this issue. But, when we exercise our vote, I think it is terribly important for people to know that the bill before us today is misleading in its terms. It is not a euthanasia laws bill; it is a law to affect the constitutional powers of the Northern Territory, the Australian Capital Territory and Norfolk Island. It is not a law that affects this very important subject matter for any other Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Social issues are always difficult. We have had many protracted debates in this place, and many of us feel quite passionately about issues such as this, and I respect each of those who do&mdash;the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), for example, who first raised the bill. I understand his concerns, and I understand full well the reason he is in a position where he feels that it is essential that this particular piece of legislation, having been passed in a territory, should be rebutted. I have some sympathy for that point of view, but my worry is that I do not see why, as a member of the federal parliament, I should discriminate against one sector of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is particularly important that we find a way by which we can enact this piece of legislation across all Australia. As I have put to you, there are ways in which it can done. It is no use just peremptorily saying, `There is no head of power.' I am sure that the legislation can be devised in such a way that this debate can be on the subject matter that we all believe we are debating. We are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not debating euthanasia; we are debating the constitutional powers of three areas of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What makes it even worse, as far as I am concerned, is that in population terms those three areas are minimal. The population of the Northern Territory at the moment would be no more than 300,000&mdash;it would be less than that. The population of the ACT would be less than 400,000&mdash;I might be exaggerating. In any event, among Norfolk Island, the ACT and the Northern Territory, you can say that there would be fewer than 600,000 people. So we are saying, at the very maximum for 600,000 Australians, `You can't have a law that is going to apply to all those other 17&half; million Australians.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as I am concerned, this federal parliament ought to be dealing with laws pertaining to 18 million Australians, not 600,000. We ought to be introducing legislation on important issues that we believe is relevant and that says to all Australians, `There should be no law applicable in this area,' or, if we believe that euthanasia is desirable, `There should be a law permissible.' You do not do it to a few Australians and say that in that way you have cleared your conscience. Frankly, what concerns me is that we will not be clearing our conscience; we will be perjuring our conscience if we proceed along a way which denies to 17&half; million Australians the denial or the assistance&mdash;depending on the way you look at this piece of legislation&mdash;that this bill provides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the bill is not what it states. I believe the manner in which the debate is being presented to the Australian electorate to be improper, inconsiderate and also deceptive. At an individual level, I happen to be against euthanasia. But that is not the point. I do not think I am voting on euthanasia and I am concerned that we are being given a conscience vote on something that is going to prejudice the rights and opportunities of 17&half; million Australians. Therefore, I think it is fairly important that we register what we do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have suggested&mdash;and this amendment allows it to be done&mdash;that the Attorney&hyphen;General and Minister for Justice have an alternative bill prepared and presented to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7978"> House in a form which does not discriminate against the people of any part of Australia and which would genuinely enable all of the members in this place to vote on the legislation as all of us believe it should be: a piece of legislation emanating from the federal parliament pertaining to euthanasia and affecting the whole of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I very strongly put to members that I believe this is an appropriate way that we should proceed. For those who are&mdash;as I have suggested I am&mdash;against euthanasia, we can express our point of view, and those like my seconder, whom I believe to be sympathetic to the alternative form, can express their point of view. I believe that we are being discriminatory in the extreme and I strongly submit to the members of this place that, there being a conscience vote, they support my amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

While he is opposed to euthanasia, I am supporting euthanasia but I support the honourable member's amendment because it points out that the nature of this legislation before the House today is entirely discriminatory. It takes the people of the Northern Territory, of the ACT and of Norfolk Island and says, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> `You are different. We are making a law just for you and we are overriding your right to make laws in your territories.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us be clear about this. This has never been done in this place before. We have acknowledged the right of the Northern Territory, the ACT and the Island to look after their own affairs and yet, on this one matter, this parliament is saying to those parliamentarians, `We know better than you. Our consciences are better than yours.' We are not saying it to the legislature in Victoria, in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia or Western Australia; we are saying only to the people in the territories, to their  legislators, that somehow they are inferior in their consciences to what we are in ours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask members in this place how you can vote on such an issue. You are not voting on euthanasia; you are voting on your consciences compared with the consciences of those legislators, those parliamentarians, in the Northern Territory. I ask you to look at your conscience when you do this and say, `Is there something inherently better about me, about the way I am elected, that I can choose to overturn the laws of the Northern Territory in this regard?' I think that, if you do that honestly, you will find that you cannot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard one honourable member mention the constitution. The constitution gives us the right to act. That is why we have this bill before the House today. It gives us the legal right, but it does not give us the moral right. Convention has been that we allow the Northern Territory to make laws for its own affairs. If we pass this bill today, we will have an unconscionable situation where the people in Victoria could pass a bill tomorrow or next week legalising euthanasia in that state. The people in New South Wales, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania could do the same. We could have totally different situations between the states and the territories on the basis of what this parliament decides today. On this matter, that is not an acceptable difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the member who referred to the constitution whether he really believes that that gives us a right here today. As I said at the beginning, I support euthanasia. I support <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7979"> the Northern Territory's euthanasia legislation, but this debate today has not addressed it in sufficient context. It is an issue not just for the Northern Territory but for Australia or the states as a whole. We should not discriminate against one if we are not going to discriminate against them all.</PARA>

A number of suggestions were made earlier about sending this bill to a committee as a method of putting it off. Everybody understands that we are here today to consider the bill. Asking the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) to come in with another bill is not going to get us anywhere. Asking the government to bring in a bill will also not get us anywhere, because the government has said that they consider this a conscience matter. How can the Attorney come in here with a bill?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that the only place in Australia where there are laws that allow euthanasia is the Northern Territory. None of the states have laws allowing euthanasia. None of the states are anticipating at present having laws about euthanasia. There has been a suggestion that a member of the ACT Legislative Assembly may bring a bill into that assembly to allow for euthanasia in the Australian Capital Territory. However, none of the states has considered it. If the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) does not believe that there should be euthanasia in any of the states or territories in this country, the simple thing for him and anyone who takes that view to do is to vote for the Andrews bill today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nowhere else in the country is there euthanasia. Indeed, if the right honourable member for New England and the seconder of his amendment, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), are so much in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> favour of uniform laws, I would be most happy when we come back here in February to support any bill they wish to bring in banning euthanasia in the states. I do not think I will hold my breath until I see the honourable member for Hindmarsh come in here with a bill banning euthanasia in the states. The reality is that, by the honourable member for Hindmarsh seconding this amendment, the amendment is shown to be a blind.</PARA>

Let us forget about all these silly devices of sending it off to a committee, the Attorney-General or Mars.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hypocrisy of this legislation is that, for purely political reasons, its authors ignored abortion. While we seek to deny people who have their thought processes and who are of an age of consent the right to make a decision about life or death, we refuse to grant a similar privilege to a foetus who, of course, is never consulted in an abortion. That I find is arrant hypocrisy. You either go the whole way or you go nowhere at all. That is one of the grounds for my not being prepared to support this legislation against euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major reason I abstained from the second reading debate on the Euthanasia Laws Bill and why I am taking this opportunity now is that I am deeply committed to the people of a state or a territory who have a right granted by a constitutionally constructed parliament being able to make up their own mind on these issues. But where does this end? We are told that this is a one-off simply because it is so important&mdash;but it is not so important to include abortion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is what is important to other people. What happens when we are all confronted with massive letter writing, as we have been on this issue, on issues such as X-rated videos in the Australian Capital Territory or on the attempts to try to improve&mdash;as they believed&mdash;the management of heroin and other drugs through these proposed programs in the Australian Capital Territory? When are we going to say that they do not work?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why don't we include the issue of traffic control? They have had a doubling of the death rates from transport in the Australian Capital Territory with 22 people being killed in motor cars this year and so far one by the Northern Territory euthanasia law. Is it now our responsibility to re-employ all the traffic inspectors in the Australian Capital Territory so that we can save lives? Why not? After all, it is the members of this House who now say that they are smarter and have superior rights <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the people of the Australian Capital Territory, to the people of the Northern Territory and to the people of Norfolk Island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I am alone in this position, then I do not give myself that right. I have always stood for the people's rights in an electorate. I have always become angry about this reference to states rights, because it is not the right of a state. A state is a geographic region. Legislatures are parliaments that are elected by people. We know from the attitude of Mr Stone, a person who is opposed to euthanasia, that he has his priorities right. He has said, `My first responsibility is to the people of the Northern Territory,' and I assume by his political judgment that he has carefully assessed the views of the people of the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After all, as I recollect, the Northern Territory has had an election since these decisions were made. I will stand corrected if I am wrong but I think I am right. The reality is that it is the right of the people of the Northern Territory. They have the right to dispose of those politicians up there. They have the right to make sure that they do not come back with that sort of legislation if they disagree with it. But, quite clearly, the people do agree with it. Therefore, it is their right, and they should be entitled to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The solution is for the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) to say, `We have one conscience vote, you can't have another.' Why not? This is about the precedent of imposing Commonwealth control&mdash;in other words, taking away the rights that this parliament granted&mdash;over the territories. The right honourable member for New England was at pains to point out that that was a unanimous decision of this parliament. They are like naughty children up in the Northern Territory, aren't they? We gave them our confidence. Now they have upset us.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7981">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can argue whether euthanasia is right or wrong. I would have a different view to that proposal if it had addressed that sort of death at beginning and end. But, no, those supporting the legislation knew they could not win the second one, so they took a political solution about life and death. That is outrageous. I will not have a bar of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I made my decision eventually. As I said, I did not want to get up in the Main Committee during the debate on this bill and moralise about euthanasia and I abstained from the debate. But I have got up now per favour of the amendment moved by the right honourable member for New England&mdash;I congratulate him for his initiative&mdash;on what is the fundamental issue contained in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fundamental issue is: is it the right of this parliament at whim and will to come in here and say, `We don't approve of something that has been done in a territory and because we have residual powers over those in the territory'&mdash;not in a state, only in a territory&mdash;`we will discriminate against those people's rights'? It concerns their rights because they elected the parliament that carried this matter. No issue has ever had more exposure contact with politicians as that Northern Territory bill. It was even given a recycling in that it was debated, it stood in the parliament for three months, then it was debated again and it was carried. That legislation was an expression of the views and the rights of the people of the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to those members who want to stand up here and have their names recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and who then go out and excuse themselves on the fundamental issue because it was all too important: wait until the next flood of letters come in on X-rated videos, when letters come in on all of the other issues where a territory chooses to stand and take a different stance from the rest of Australia. I look across to the other side of the House and see the representatives from Tasmania. I wish them well in gaining some additional funding for their economically impoverished state. If this legislation were responding to something that had happened in Tasmania, I wonder how <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the member for Franklin (Mr Quick) might want to take the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot act as Western Australians on this matter. We cannot act as Tasmanians. We have to stand on the principle that the rights of people granted under our constitutional and legislative arrangements to make their own decisions on these issues is paramount. Otherwise, we are a centralist government, we are a centralist parliament, and, what is more, we believe that we know better. Anybody who suggests that somehow or other we know better would be as big a fool as us to believe it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the issues. You can have all the eloquence you like about life and death, but if you are not prepared to take account of these things then go back and say, `We believe that Canberra should run everything. We believe that Canberra should be running education.' Why? Why should we be letting the ACT run education? I will ask one of the other proponents: why should we be letting Canberra run its own hospitals? We shouldn't be doing that. We don't trust them. Where does euthanasia occur? More than likely in a hospital. We shouldn't be trusting them with that&mdash;not if we allow this legislation to pass and we trample all over their rights as people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have not done it in the ACT. That is probably to their credit. It does not alter the fact that they have a right to do it. Anybody who opposes this amendment is saying outright, `Don't you try.' Because we have been obliged to, we are already telling them they are not allowed to do it. We are saying, irrespective of the views, irrespective of a referendum held in the ACT and irrespective of a referendum held on Norfolk Island, `You are not allowed to.' Let's take another bill. I might think of two or three we have put up and just test the hypocrisy of this place by telling them that we should be running hospitals, that we should be running the buses, that we should be running schools, that we should be doing all these things. There is no difference.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I make this observation about the amendment of the right honourable member for New England. I am sure the right honourable member for New England has done this in good faith. However, he is essentially making an observation about the Euthanasia Laws Bill of the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) that is not right. The constitution provides this House with the powers to move and to carry the bill moved by the member for Menzies. I quote section 122 of the constitution:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliament may make laws for the government of any territory surrendered by any State to and accepted by the Commonwealth, or of any territory placed by the Queen under the authority of and accepted by the Commonwealth, or otherwise acquired by the Commonwealth, and may allow the representation of such territory in either House of the Parliament to the extent and on the terms which it thinks fit.</PARA>
<PARA>The provisions in the constitution are quite clear. I personally am a supporter of making the Northern Territory a state. I would like to see the Northern Territory become a state of the Commonwealth. Some of the premiers <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7983"> who have attacked the member for Menzies and who have attacked this bill would do well to reflect on the fact that if they were genuine in their support for the Northern Territory and its rights then they would support the Northern Territory becoming a state of the Commonwealth of Australia. As a consequence, it would enjoy the same representative rights in the Senate as all the other states&mdash;and that would mean, of course, having 12 senators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The right honourable member for New England is attempting by this amendment to prevent the House from exercising its will in relation to the member for Menzies' bill. It is my view that the House ought to reject the amendment moved by the right honourable member for New England on the basis that we have had this lengthy debate, we have had a number of opportunities for amendments, for alternative motions, to be moved and they have not come to pass. We are now poised at the point of the third reading debate. We are now at the point where we should exercise the will of this House. We should go to the vote and vote on the private member's bill of the member for Menzies. We should not be diverted or thwarted by the amendment proposed by the right honourable member for New England.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Lowe for his question. I recognise he has a very great interest in international trade issues. There has been a report on ABC radio this morning about Australia's stand on the issue of trade and labour standards. I first want to make it clear to the House that Australia supports the pursuit of an adherence to core labour standards consistent with universal civil, political, economic, social, cultural and human rights standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is not convinced that the World Trade Organisation is the place to deal with this issue. The WTO's primary function is to advance multilateral trade issues. There is the potential that a so-called social clause <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7984"> could be an excuse for protectionism and there is a risk that the issue would distract from other WTO priorities as well as seriously divide the organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An authoritative study released by the OECD this year found no empirical evidence linking low labour standards to unfair trade advantages. The Australian tripartite working party on trade and labour standards commissioned by the previous government agreed that there was currently no international consensus for the inclusion of a social clause in the WTO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia looks to the International Labour Organisation, which regards labour standards as being its core business, as having the central role in strengthening adherence to internationally recognised labour standards. The ILO has established a working party to examine the social dimensions of international trade liberalisation, and the Australian government will deal with this matter through that forum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was the position of the previous government. It may interest those who are interjecting. The fact is that there is a great deal of material available&mdash;public statements made by the member for Canberra, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Holt, and others.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for O'Connor for his question. A report was released in the last little while, the Seafarers Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority's annual report 1995&hyphen;96, and it is a very interesting report because it highlights the number of compensation claims made by seafarers, members of the Maritime Union of Australia. This is of interest to us because the previous Labor government had indicated that they were prepared to pay the PAYE tax bills for international seafarers <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7985"> based on promises made by the Maritime Union of Australia that crew to berth ratios would be reduced under this reform program that the previous government was prepared to embark on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of achieving that reduction in crew to berth ratios, the amount of compensation claims was to come down. Indeed, the rorting of compensation claims would be either reduced or wiped out completely because it was evident some time ago that there is an extraordinarily high level of compensation claims made by members of the Maritime Union of Australia in their seafaring role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Labor government allocated some $20 million of taxpayers' funds in order to pay the taxes of our international seafarers on the basis that the MUA would deliver on this promise of reducing compensation payments. Having done that, the previous government putting their money up front and waiting for the MUA to deliver on their promise, this report released just the other day indicates to us what the result was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of compensation claims going down, they went up. They did not go up by just a little bit; they went up by 15 per cent. And they went up at a time when the number of people in the industry had dropped by six per cent. It highlights to us that the previous government had allocated some $20 million worth of funds to pay the taxes of international seafarers on the basis of a false hope and a broken promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, one in every five seafarers makes a compensation claim. This is the highest industry claim across the board of industries. It makes up 10 per cent of the total wages bill. It amounts to something like $25 million a year in the high cost of compensation within the seafaring industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned earlier, it amounts to 10 per cent of the total wages bill. Compare that with other industries across the board. The general industry rate in Victoria is 1.8 per cent; in New South Wales, it is 2.8 per cent; in South Australia it is 2.86 per cent; in Western Australia it is 2.67 per cent; and in Queensland it is 2.1 per cent. In the seafaring sector, it is 10 per cent. That is cause for considerable concern.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people would say that this is because the seafaring industry is a dangerous industry. It would be interesting to compare seafaring with other dangerous industries in Australia. Let's take, for example, the coal industry, which I think we would all recognise is a very dangerous industry. The average for that industry is 6.4 per cent compared with the seafaring industry's 10 per cent. It says to us that there is an ongoing rort within the seafaring industry to make these claims, and these claims are leading to our Australian seafaring industry, our ship industry, being highly uncompetitive and costing us jobs in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is prepared to axe the PAYE tax scheme, which was introduced by the previous government, because the MUA did not deliver on their promise of reducing the compensation claims. We are also prepared to increase the opportunities for jobs in Australia by reforming our industrial relations system. These industrial relations reforms will lead to a reduction in these types of claims, to an increase in Australia's ability to compete against our trading partners, and will ultimately increase job opportunities for Australians. This government is not about extending further rorts to members of the Maritime Union of Australia, as the previous government did, by allowing international seafarers to have their taxes paid by the taxpayers.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA>I repeat, they were lower in 1993 than they had been 11 years earlier, which goes to show why middle income Australians rose up against the Labor Party on 2 March this year. The Labor Party was very good at looking after its rich mates, the Laurie Connells of this world, and very good at deficit expenditures, but the Labor Party had completely forgotten about middle income Australians. One of the proudest boasts of a coalition government is that we have remembered middle income Australians.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hunter region has suffered for quite some time from very high youth unemployment as a result of the mismanagement by the former government. The major difference between this government and the Labor Party's government has been our emphasis on providing young people with quality training which leads to real jobs&mdash;not the short-term training programs which demoralised so many young people throughout Australia. Indeed, the member for Hotham was responsible for spending some $500 million on a scheme, many of the providers of which could report no reduction in the dependence on benefits amongst those taking part in it at its end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This morning I announced a package of Commonwealth funded measures that will create more than 800 apprenticeships, traineeships and jobs for young people and long-term unemployed people in the Hunter <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7989"> region. This shows that the government's policies are working for regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The package includes the first one&hyphen;stop apprenticeship shop in New South Wales, an expanded program to link 37 secondary schools with local businesses to support vocational education in schools and a new cooperative venture&mdash;a new group training company called Hunternet&mdash;between 30 mechanical engineering and electrical manufacturing firms to offer 106 new apprenticeships and traineeships. I also announced a new traineeship in the coal service industry and a job brokerage program which aims to place 470 school leavers in apprenticeships, traineeships or jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are all high quality training opportunities. I am delighted to say that they have attracted a very high level of business support within the Hunter region, and I have no doubt at all that this is in part due to the very active representation of our policies to business by the member for Paterson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Taxpayers want to see their money being used to create real opportunities. It is to the lasting discredit of those on the other side of the House that, here and in the Senate, the opposition have fought these initiatives week in, week out, to preserve their own complex bureaucratic training system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition tried to amend our new apprenticeship provisions in the Senate, and they failed. They tried to amend the schools legislation, and they failed. They tried to amend the training legislation, and they failed. In fact, they are suffering from a very bad case of ADD&mdash;amendments defeated disorder. Our programs are building a secure pathway for young Australians into jobs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The latest figures show that nearly three million visitors came to Australia in the first nine months of this year&mdash;an increase of nearly 13 per cent over the same period in 1995. We have seen strong tourism growth from major markets in Asia, such as Korea and Malaysia, with increases of some 36 per cent and 26 per cent respectively in the first nine months of the year. Japan and the rest of Asia are expecting to supply nearly half the visitors to Australia. Over the last nine months, we have seen the following arrival increases over the previous year: six per cent <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from Japan, 19 per cent from other Asian destinations, three per cent from Europe, 29 per cent from New Zealand, and five per cent from the Americas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is estimated that, for every 18 additional international visitors to Australia, an extra job is created within this nation. The economic benefits to Australia from tourism are quite enormous. It is the fastest growing area of employment, currently employing 550,000 people. It is estimated that by the year 2000 this will increase by an additional 150,000 people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today tourism is big business, with tourism expenditure accounting for nearly seven per cent of GDP. Income derived from tourism was nearly $47 billion, with export earnings increasing in the 1995&hyphen;96 period by 16 per cent to a record $14 billion. As a result tourism accounts for nearly 13 per cent of Australia's total export earnings and 63 per cent of service exports.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our embassy in Rangoon has already made preliminary representations to the authorities on the detentions that took place on about 2 or 3 December of five NLD&mdash;National League for Democracy&mdash;youth members. I have also instructed the Australian Embassy in Rangoon to make known the Australian government's strong concerns about the SLORC's suppression of the people's legitimate right to demonstrate peacefully, as occurred over the weekend. The authorities in Burma claim that over 200 students were detained on 7 December to break up a peaceful demonstration, but I understand that those 200 students have since been released.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian government has taken a strong stand against breaches of human rights in Burma.

I regret that Mr Hunt chose to make the remarks he did make to a journalist which subsequently led to a Federal Court action and to him ultimately having to step down from the position. But the point I would make is that the Public Service Commissioner immediately appointed a replacement, and that is simply an illustration of his determination&mdash;and, of course, that reflects the government's determination&mdash;to make sure that all allegations are properly investigated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Behind the question is presumably some implication that the government does not want to have these matters thoroughly, properly and effectively investigated. We do. Of course we do. We very much want that, Mr Speaker, and that is why the Public Service Commissioner himself appointed Ms Pam O'Neil to carry on the inquiry. Obviously he has had to extend the life of the inquiry, but that is in order to ensure that the inquiry is a proper, full and effective inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, the Labor Party seems to think at the moment this is such an amusing matter and one for cheap party politicking, apparently driven by the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith. I think it is quite extraordinary. On 25 April, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that allegations `have been rigorously pursued with no ifs, buts or maybes by an independent Federal Police investigation'. He went on to say that `there was an absolute full&hyphen;on effort' by the then department secretary, Mr Costello, to unearth all available <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> evidence. That is fair enough. This was adequate, according to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, but the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith says, `No, actually, during the life of the Labor government'&mdash;because these allegations are about things that happened during the life of the Labor government&mdash;`I am afraid that that type of investigation was inadequate'; that the former Minister for Foreign Affairs did not in fact investigate these matters fully, despite the fact that he claimed he did, and that apparently an independent Public Service inquiry is not adequate either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frankly, Mr Speaker, I find the attitude of the opposition most surprising, quite bizarre and, let me say, counterproductive.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since coming to power, the government have taken a very keen interest in the small and medium size business sector of Australian commerce. In particular, they have moved already to lift the provisional tax uplift factor, to generally bring in a capital gains rollover relief&mdash;which is very beneficial to small business&mdash;and to bring about the Charlie Bell inquiry into removing as much regulation as we possibly we can.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth leg and next most important point is undoubtedly the gap between raising capital and the ability to run a business. As a consequence of that, we are looking at ways in which the gap between half a million dollars and $2 million can be raised around the community to help small to medium size business&mdash;because the most important thing really in Australia is to grow business. Home&hyphen;grown success stories in commerce are very <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7996"> few. They get to a certain size and they tend to sell out to foreign companies or to sell themselves out to the management of the company, and nothing much really happens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Mr Murdoch once commented, there is nothing much new in the top 10 or so companies in the Australian Stock Exchange, which compares very markedly with the American companies. Because of that, I have been making inquiries as to the best way to progress this capital raising effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the Australian Stock Exchange are looking at the question of establishing a second board. The provisions for that would have to be negotiated with the Australian Securities Commission and there would be some easing of restrictions or compliance in relation to that. Secondly, they are looking at the possibility of other ways to raise capital by matching buyers with the potential capital suppliers. The third way is that there are a number of people looking at an alternative market altogether&mdash;totally away from the stock market. Those three alternatives are very much on my mind at the moment and I think they will provide the answer to small to medium size business capital raising.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Customs initially made a preliminary finding that the product had been dumped and there was material injury. That matter was reviewed by the Anti&hyphen;Dumping Authority. The first question is the two tests as to whether the product coming in is dumped and has caused material injury to an Australian manufacturer; then it is a question <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of whether the Australian manufacturer meets the Australian manufactured test; and, finally, how the normal value is determined.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V5">Mr WILLIAMS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Fisher for his question. This government has a major priority in helping prevent marriage and relationship breakdown. It is a coalition election commitment which we take very seriously. One step has been to give a reference to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to examine marriage breakdown and the remedies for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a further demonstration of support for families in line with our election promises: the coalition has committed a further $6.1 million over the next three years to expanding the availability of marriage and relationship education services. This new money brings the total commitment over the next three years to $11.8 million, which more than doubles the funding provided by the previous government. It goes well beyond Labor's idea of what is needed in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be 34 new services established in areas of high need from January 1997. Advertisements were placed in national and local newspapers in October, and 171 applications were received. That is approximately five applications for each proposed new service. In addition to these 34 new services, more will be established from mid&hyphen;1997 when we have the results of an evaluation of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7997"> marriage and relationship education subprogram and, in particular, an assessment of options for servicing people in rural and regional communities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the second week in a row, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age </EMPHASIS> has published false statements about me in an attempt to smear me with respect to the so&hyphen;called Chinese students issue three years ago. The key contents of the article on page 2 in yesterday's edition are false. The whole article was built around the claim that a statutory declaration issued by a former staff member of mine contained a false statement and that the person had been pressured into making that statement. The key claim in the paper is this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Theophanous' staffer had signed the declaration stating that she had been in Melbourne when she was in fact in Canberra.  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7998"> </PARA>
<PARA>This claim is completely wrong. The statutory declaration was signed on 1 December and has been given to the Federal Police. Nowhere in the declaration does the staff member refer to having been in Melbourne as distinct from Canberra with respect to the events referred to in the declaration. The key claim on which the story is based is therefore totally false.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, the circumstances of these erroneous comments are extremely disturbing. A state Liberal MP Mr Bernie Finn was misled into making this and other erroneous statements in the Victorian parliament. I have spoken to that MP. He confirmed that the journalist writing the article, Paul Robinson, provided him with information for his statement. I have also been able to confirm that Mr Robinson was in the gallery of the state legislature late on Friday night to listen to Mr Finn's comments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here is an attempt by a journalist to mislead a member of parliament into making false allegations. Because these comments are protected by parliamentary privilege, the paper has printed those allegations. All this shows is that Mr Robinson and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS> have resorted to outrageous tactics in their attempts to maliciously defame me on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I now have proof that the first front-page article on 1 December also contained false statements.

<TIME.STAMP>(3.19 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in favour of the amendment as moved by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). I would also indicate to the House that I have moved an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Andrews bill. In 1978 this parliament&mdash;this House and the Senate&mdash;agreed to confer upon the Northern Territory the right to self-government. For some 18 years, that right has never been questioned. The constitutional involvement gave the Northern Territory legal, judicial, administrative and executive responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have an Administrator of the Northern Territory, who is the equivalent of a state Governor, who presides over Executive <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8000"> Council and who accepts the recommendation of the Executive Council to pass bills into law. We have ministerial responsibility for the Northern Territory, which gives those ministers of the Crown the exact responsibilities of a minister in any other state government. We have the legal responsibilities of the Northern Territory by way of our courts and, obviously, legislation is passed by the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the debate in the last couple of months, some members of this House have virtually said that, because of section 122 of the constitution, the Northern Territory is only a territory and does not have rights. I cannot accept that. Whilst I do accept that section 122 does give the Commonwealth the capacity to override or to defer Northern Territory legislation, it must do so within six months. This particular course of action under section 122 was never taken. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The former Prime Minister, Mr Paul Keating, was asked to intervene in the legislation as presented by the Northern Territory and to dismiss it. He&mdash;quite rightly so&mdash;said, `No, this is a matter for the states or territories to make up their own minds in terms of what they are going to do.' Recently, the Northern Territory parliament presented a remonstrance to both houses of parliament saying how poor it was for the Commonwealth to try to amend the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act in this subversive way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the debate I heard in the Main Committee, one of the most prominent points that came out very late in the debate was made by the Leader of the House, Mr Reith. It was also brought out first thing today by the right honourable member for New England. Mr Reith said on that day: `You can have a border. On one side of the border is Queensland, and the laws that are passed in the Queensland parliament will be recognised and accepted and cannot be interfered with by the Commonwealth. Yet on the other side of the border is the Northern Territory, with some 185,000 people who have a fully constituted parliament, whose members voted on the Northern Territory (Rights of the Terminally Ill) Bill and passed it. But the members of that parliament and the citizens of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Northern Territory do not have rights under section 122 of the constitution because it is not a state, only a territory.' People keep on saying, `You're only a territory and because we are the Commonwealth we have a right to pass this legislation.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I remind those members new to parliament that the constitutional involvement of the Northern Territory has been proceeding since 1978. There have been numerous reports on the constitutional development of the Northern Territory. It is a fact that statehood is only a very short measure away. Since 1988, we have been treated in a fiscal sense as a state. We are part of the Loan Council. We receive the equivalent amounts per capita in the tax sharing arrangement. It is not only the Northern Territory's rights we are talking about; we are talking about the rights of another 350,000 to 400,000 people in both the ACT and Norfolk Island. When the Leader of the House spoke about discrimination, he was speaking about discrimination for 500,000 people, which obviously included the Northern Territory, the ACT and Norfolk Island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The member for new England has moved an amendment to the motion to suspend standing orders. If he is successful, then a bill will be presented as an alternative to the Andrews bill. When you read the terminology of his proposed amendment, it certainly does justice to this debate. Over the past two or three months, there has been conflict about whether we are talking about euthanasia&mdash;the rights of the terminally ill&mdash;or states rights. The honourable member for New England's amendment will propose, if successful, that this parliament does have the capacity to vote on whether we should proceed with uniform legislation for the whole country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I would support such a move about whether or not we have uniform legislation for euthanasia. I support proceeding to give the parliament the capacity to vote on this issue without really conflicting with the process of self-government or statehood for the Northern Territory, which I think is very important. The amendment of the honourable member for New England certainly would place on the table before members of this parliament a bill which we will be able to debate, about taking <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8001"> uniform legislation into consideration. I hope that members on both sides of the House and on the cross&hyphen;benches support that amendment by virtue of the fact that it will certainly give everybody the opportunity to bring this issue before the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Northern Territory really has performed admirably in the last 18 years. In October 1995, the unemployment rate in the Northern Territory was almost seven per cent. In October 1996, the unemployment rate was less than five per cent. In term of the economy, tourism and mining, in spite of Northern Territory land rights and the fear of native title claims, the Northern Territory has been able to progress in accordance with its own direction, decisions being made by local members of parliament&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5M6">Mr DONDAS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am speaking to the amendment. The amendment proposes to do exactly what we are talking about: to bring the debate back to whether this parliament should be discussing legislation on behalf of the states and not excluding, by discrimination, the ACT, the Northern Territory or Norfolk Island.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation that we have before us, as presented by Mr Andrews, certainly does do that, but the debate has also canvassed why 185,000 people in the Northern Territory should have the right to make legislation which will affect the nation. That has been asked by many speakers in the Main Committee and in this chamber. They have asked: why should 185,000 people say what happens for the other 18 million people in this country? I believe that the amendment proposed by the member for New England gets the debate back to the real issue of whether or not the country wants to have the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, or euthanasia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that, in most cases, the debate has been very tempered. I believe that members on both sides of the chamber have complemented each other in the temper in which this debate has taken place. But I would say that the debate about amending the self-government act has really been driven by the Catholic community of this country. This is what is happening. I have not said it before. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I know that members who are looking at me as I speak have polled their electorates on this issue and, in some cases, 75 per cent to 80 per cent of their electorates have come back and said, `Leave the Territory alone. We support euthanasia.' Yet those members will not be voting against the Andrews bill. Tell me what is driving those people. You poll electorates, you get the information from the electorates and then you disregard that information. Why? There have to be other reasons, such as that which I mentioned a moment ago. I will not elaborate on it because I know it is in very poor taste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are going to be fair dinkum about representing your electorates, you should stand up and represent your electorates&mdash;not represent what you may think is a conscience vote being driven by another organisation. You may accept that or you may not; I do not know. The important thing is that, after 18 years, the Northern Territory has passed legislation in those areas which it has responsibility for. When the self-government act was handed down, not all functions were transferred to the Northern Territory; some functions were retained by the Commonwealth. I say to honourable members who were here in the last term of the parliament: why did you not use section 122 of the constitution when the Northern Territory passed that legislation which, today, you do not like? You have had 18 months&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I apologise. As a former Speaker, I should know better. I am asking those honourable members who were here why, when section 122 of the constitution was available to them to put pressure on the government or, by way of a private member's bill, to introduce a motion to not allow the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Bill 1995, they waited 18 months to do it? Nobody has answered that question yet. Not one person who has supported the Andrews bill or who has supported amending the Northern Territory (Self&hyphen;Government) Act has risen to their feet and told me why they did not make an <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8002"> attempt within that six-month period which the constitution allows to amend the Northern Territory (Self&hyphen;Government) Act at that time. They did not do it. I do not believe that they have the right to do it 18 months later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is what I have been trying to put to my colleagues. They are saying that it is only a territory. I have heard that on more than one occasion. But what they do not understand is that, whilst we may be a territory in name only, it certainly has been the will of both houses of parliament in Canberra that, eventually, the Northern Territory will become the seventh state of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the main reasons why the Northern Territory is not a state is that there has not been constitutional debate on whether it should be done under section 121 or whether it should be done by a referendum. The other question obviously arises of how many senators the Northern Territory will get and what its federal representation will be. Those matters, hopefully, will be resolved at the people's convention in 1997. That is the only reason why the Northern Territory is not a state today.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate at the outset my support for the amendment which has been moved by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and say, without dwelling too much on it, that I would have preferred it had the House adopted the earlier amendment by <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the member for Longman (Mr Brough) which would have had the effect of referring the Andrews bill to a select committee of this chamber so that additional consideration could have been given to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no question that this is a matter of great moment to not only members of this chamber but all people in Australia, whatever may have been the motivation for the position they have adopted. I emphasised before the need for members to be thoroughly aware of the definitions of some of the issues involved. I asked, for example, how many members of this chamber, or, for that matter, of the Senate, would be able, off the cuff, to identify the difference between active and passive euthanasia, between voluntary and involuntary euthanasia and to distinguish them in turn from suicide and assisted suicide. I emphasise, and I repeat: there is a great need for people to be able to do precisely that before they cast a considered decision in relation to the Andrews bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reason I thought it was going to be of importance that that procedure be adopted was that I wondered how many members of this chamber or of the Senate would have been able to thoroughly explain whether or not the Andrews bill would impact unfavourably on other legislation of the Northern Territory&mdash;legislation of the Northern Territory which quite correctly was considered and passed and legislation of the Northern Territory which has not in any way been challenged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some legal opinions which have indicated that the carriage of this bill in this parliament would impact against other legislation in the Northern Territory. There is equally competent legal opinion which asserts to the contrary. Those questions have not been resolved. I believe that they need to be resolved before anyone can cast a genuine, informed, intelligent, considered response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion of the right honourable member for New England calls on the Attorney&hyphen;General and Minister for Justice (Mr Williams) to have an alternative bill prepared and presented to the House in a form which does not discriminate against the people of any part of Australia. I hope that the motion will be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8003"> carried, and I also hope that the Attorney&hyphen;General and Minister for Justice will come forward with proposed legislation which would have the effect of establishing an appropriate procedure and appropriate structure for these issues to be more thoroughly canvassed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have listened with a great deal of interest and concern to as much of the debate as I could possibly follow. I know that it has been followed just as assiduously by other members of the parliament and other people in the wider community. I am absolutely convinced that, quite apart from any deficiencies that there might have been in my analysis, there are many members who simply do not understand many of the implications. I say that while at the same time acknowledging and endorsing the comments that have been made by others, including the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) when he said that there has been a great deal of goodwill brought to this debate by members of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to make reference to one particular speech which should be compulsory reading for every member of this parliament before they vote on the motion before us or on the bill itself. I refer to the contribution made by the member for Eden&hyphen;Monaro (Mr Nairn). I said to him that it was an outstanding contribution. It was considered, it was knowledgeable, it was compelling. To my mind, and I include my own speech in this, his was the best.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point has been made that this legislation would override the legislation of the Northern Territory. That causes me no concern&mdash;no concern at all. As has been observed by others, there have been occasions in this parliament when I and others have voted to overrule well&hyphen;intentioned decisions made by states and territories, and on some occasions we have used our external affairs power to do <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> so. I have no reservations about that. But on all of those occasions, when I have supported and endorsed the overruling of legislation by territories or states, I voted for something that would extend the rights of the citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not the case with the Andrews bill. Its purpose, as far as the Northern Territory is concerned&mdash;and, at the present time, it relates to all citizens in Australia&mdash;is to reduce or contain the rights which that legislation has extended to all citizens in Australia to determine the timing and the nature of their death, and to give them the right, if it is necessary for them to avail themselves of it, to call on others to assist them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the weekend I saw in the paper a photograph of a gentleman who had just been convicted of manslaughter. No severe penalty was imposed because, at his father's request, he had shot his father due to the pain his father was suffering. That was an appalling situation for any person to find themselves in. As I said before, that action was necessary on that fellow's part, and on the part of all those others who, out of their love and concern for close friends, spouses, children or parents, seek to assist those people to end their lives as they choose to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not talking, in connection with the question before us, about involuntary euthanasia. We are not talking about any form of compulsory euthanasia in certain circumstances. We are simply talking about the right of individual people to have control over their own lives and the timing and the nature of their passing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know if Mother Teresa was misquoted but I saw headlines in one newspaper to the effect that Mother Teresa&mdash;an 86&hyphen;year&hyphen;old lady of enormous achievement, of great dignity, of world acclaim&mdash;rather than have tubes stuck in her and tests of various kinds carried out on that unfortunate, dignified woman, has said, `Let me die.' Apparently, there are some people who would say, `No, Mother Teresa, we won't.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the primary process, which is provided for in the constitution, had been followed in connection with this issue, there was a period during which this parliament could have acted to overrule the legislation passed by the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8004"> Northern Territory. That time has elapsed. That is why it became necessary for this parliament to take this particular action, introducing special legislation, as Mr Andrews, the initiator of this bill, has sought to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said as well that, in cases like the one in which a relatively young man shot his father and then was tried on that basis, I believe the people who made themselves familiar with the circumstances of that case and of so many other cases of a similar kind would probably all say that the court acted correctly. I would hope that that would be a reflection of the sort of compassion that people may bring to questions of this kind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we believe that the court acted correctly, but in the process perhaps either ignored our legislation or the legislation of the states and territories or modified its interpretation of that legislation to ensure that it would act from a moral position with sympathy and compassion for people who find themselves in those terribly distressing circumstances, our failure as legislators to codify the arrangements which would make it possible for the courts to do that and for the courts to do it following the law would obviously represent on our part personal and political cowardice. Let us not seek to absolve ourselves of our responsibility in relation to this because we are the legislators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is compassion to be shown in cases like this, let us codify it. Do not let us wash our hands of this question. So, in order to satisfy our own conscience, perhaps we will retain the existing legislation and leave it to the courts.</PARA>

It is estimated that 7,000 doctors would have assisted others to die. There were some quite courageous, quite heroic doctors in Victoria who went on the public record and said that they had done that. Again, they laid themselves open to incarceration for something like 15 years, but no action was taken against them, nor should it have been.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say, from listening to the debate, that we did seem to be revisiting the debate that was held in the Main Committee rather than addressing the amendment of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) that is here. Having listened to the last speaker, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), I cannot help but say that I disagree with the argument that because 7,000 people broke the law you ought to change the law so they are no longer in breach of it. If we made laws in accordance <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8005"> with that dictum, we would have a rather lawless society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I address the subject of the amendment moved by the right honourable member for New England and say that this issue too was canvassed by many who spoke in the debate in the other chamber. Many people felt that their contributions should have been made in this chamber, and I would not like this debate to be used as a fulfilment of that wish&mdash;that is, those who could not get their way on that using this opportunity to revisit the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our constitution and under our constitution provision is made for this parliament to address and to overturn, if necessary, laws made by a territory. I have long been on the record as saying that I was a supporter of statehood for the territory, which means that there must be a change in its position for me to support that shift. By simply trying to argue that the territory is de facto a state is an argument I cannot accept either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that the Northern Territory is at this present point in time a territory. We do have powers under the constitution to pass legislation, such as the bill which is currently before the House, and in so doing overturn the intent of that bill of the Northern Territory which, let me spell out, is not about suicide, is not about prolonging life unnecessarily, but is about authorising one human being to put another human being to death. I am opposed to that concept. I am also opposed to capital punishment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea is that somehow we ought to put off discussing and voting on the bill which has been thoroughly debated because of an amendment which basically, in my view, has no substance at all. The constitution makes provision for us to do what we are doing and to vote on it according to our conscience. My conscience tells me that I will vote in favour of the Kevin Andrews bill, as it is known. Other people's consciences may tell them differently.

I am surprised that this amendment cannot receive the support of everyone in this chamber, because it does a number of things. It says that the issue here should be about whether you support or oppose voluntary euthanasia; it is not an issue of states rights.

I would have thought that was a position which everyone in this House could support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can the Andrews bill that is currently before the House be supported when it clearly is discriminatory?

That is something which does not apply in other states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To me, as someone who is not a states righter, this amendment moved by the right honourable member for New England is also very attractive for other reasons. It makes the point very clear to those who argue that the national parliament does have a responsibility on this issue, and I think, frankly, there is an argument to be had that the national parliament does have a responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not oppose the Andrews bill because of the issue of states rights. I oppose it because I support voluntary euthanasia and I have got the guts to say it.

<PARA>There are probably very few people in this House with whom I would have a greater political affinity than the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), who is sitting at the table. I disagree with him on this issue, but I respect his right to be wrong on this occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment moved by the right honourable member for New England is also attractive because it would enable a national debate to take up some of the issues which have been raised up to this point in this debate. One of those issues that I would like to see debated is a national perspective on palliative care. The Andrews bill before this House at the moment, which discriminates against the Northern Territory, discriminates against the only government which is doing the right thing on palliative care, the only government in this country which has increased funding for palliative care to the extent that it has. Look at the figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act has been in operation in the Northern Territory, the number of people in palliative care there has increased by over 250 per cent. Funding has increased from $500,000 last year to over a million dollars this year. That is something which should be supported by everyone in this chamber, certainly by those people who say, `If you support voluntary euthanasia, it is really because you want to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> knock people off and not look after them in health care.' That is the crude argument put forward by some people on the other side of this debate. But then they vote, including the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), on the budget brought in by this government, to reduce palliative care funding by 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be quite happy to have a debate, as this amendment moved by the right honourable member for New England suggests, on a national focus. But let's make it a national focus on palliative care as well. Let's not have the sort of hypocrisy where people isolate the debate upstairs, in sideshow alley, and say, `We're opposed to voluntary euthanasia because we think people should get proper care,' and at the same time put their hands up and vote in the parliament to cut palliative care funding. It is that sort of hypocrisy which I would like to see exposed by a longer, real, more fair dinkum national debate about national policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not often agree with the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), but today I had to, because he raised the obvious connection between the arguments put by the opponents of voluntary euthanasia and the arguments put by the opponents of abortion. It has not been spoken about. I am sure it might be once the Andrews bill is carried by this House. I am sure the Lyons Forum will have it on their agenda. There is a connection there. These debates do need to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a signal of the maturity of our nation, the fact that this debate is occurring is a very positive step. It may well be that voluntary euthanasia falls at the first hurdle. Most progressive social initiatives do fall at the first hurdle. The environment used to be a radical left wing issue as well, but now we have it being trumpeted by those opposite, like they trumpet feminism and a whole lot of other progressive social initiatives which advance our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It really is put upon those who would oppose this amendment moved by the right honourable member for New England to say why they oppose it. Is it because of states rights? The amendment accommodates that. Is it because of opposition to states rights? It accommodates that as well, because it calls <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8008"> for a national plan in that regard. Do those who oppose it do so because they are anti voluntary euthanasia? If they think they have got a majority in this House in support of the Andrews bill, then there is nothing to fear from a more rational debate. If those who oppose it do so because they are in my position of being pro voluntary euthanasia, once again I think they can support this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly congratulate the right honourable member for New England for coming up with this. It does advance the debate substantially. I say to all members of the House: if you are fair dinkum, this will really be a vote on whether you are prepared to debate your views in a real way. That is what this vote is about. I call upon members to vote for and support this amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listen to the member for Melbourne interjecting. I begin my remarks by referring to his speech, which I thought was one of the most balanced and persuasive offered to the parliament on this subject. The member for Melbourne may be surprised to know he was animated by a Catholic conspiracy. Having said that, I recall in his remarks he said that, of all the arguments advanced in opposition to the Euthanasia Laws Bill, the weakest of those is the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> states rights argument. That is a view to which I entirely subscribe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having listened to the right honourable and venerable member for New England, his principal argument was that the bill discriminates against the Northern Territory. That argument was taken up by the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas), who advanced a number of propositions. But I have to say that the credibility of the member for the Northern Territory on this issue has been dramatically weakened by the actions of his constituents and of his party in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) spoke derisively about the tactics, if you like, of some of those who have participated in the debate with threats against members. I note for the record that every member in this place from the Northern Territory who represents the Country&hyphen;Liberal Party has been put on notice that if they support the Andrews bill, they will be expelled from the party.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is absolutely serious. So they have a gun put to their heads and they are marched into the parliament, but they are told, `Naturally, feel free to exercise your conscience.' I have to tell you that the credibility of the contribution of every member from the Northern Territory has been pretty dramatically undermined, in my eyes at least, in the knowledge that all of them are speaking under complete duress.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now in a dispassionate way to the amendment that is before us. I want to reflect on the basic arguments that are being advanced in opposition to and in support of the amendment. The member for O'Connor suggested that those of us who support the Andrews bill do so on the basis that it somehow `transcends the constitution'. I suggest that nothing could be further from the truth, that this bill represents one of the most orthodox, pedestrian exercises of Commonwealth power that you could ever imagine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I advance that proposition having carefully studied the speech by the member for Eden&hyphen;Monaro (Mr Nairn), which was a good speech but which nonetheless obscured the fact that this is an entirely orthodox exercise of a clear <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8009"> head of power under the constitution. So I approach this matter as a very humble solicitor, having dusted off my first year constitutional law notes which explain fairly clearly that the Commonwealth is a government of enumerated specific powers. If we want to do anything in this place, we have to go to the constitution, look through the heads of power and find one which covers the subject matter under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that nothing could be clearer than section 122 of the constitution. It provides a power for the Commonwealth to govern over the territories. This is not a case of the Commonwealth desperately wanting to legislate in an area over which it has no power. This is not a matter of our looking desperately under section 51(xxix) for the most bizarre construction of the external affairs power in order to justify a domestic act. This is not drawing some long constitutional bow in order to satisfy the whim of a centralist Commonwealth executive. This is an entirely orthodox, simple exercise of a Commonwealth constitutional power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we just want to look at the logic of the amendment, the member advances it on the basis that the bill is discriminatory, that we as a parliament should be looking at matters which affect the whole of Australia and not simply one territory. I ask: is it possible as a matter of logic for the parliament to exercise section 122 without doing so in a discriminatory way? I suggest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, as a matter of simple logic, it is impossible for the Commonwealth to exercise section 122 without doing so in a discriminatory way. How can you do it otherwise? So the implication of the member's amendment is that we should expunge it from the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take up the point made earlier by the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop), who quite rightly said this is a simple exercise of Commonwealth power. She is an advocate of states rights for the Northern Territory, but we have not yet arrived at that point of conferring statehood on the Northern Territory. We cannot somehow project ourselves forward and second&hyphen;guess the will of this parliament <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or the Australian people as to whether we will or will not confer statehood on the Northern Territory. But the minister, a passionate advocate for statehood for the Northern Territory during her time as shadow minister for Commonwealth&hyphen;state relations, nonetheless supports the Andrews bill, because she rightly acknowledges the most commonsense proposition that the Northern Territory is a territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why I come back to the point of the honourable member for Melbourne: the weakest argument of all advanced by those who oppose the Andrews bill is so&hyphen;called states rights. Nothing could be more inherently contradictory in arguing for states rights than when dealing with a territory. Again, the simple solicitor's logic says to me the constitution confers a power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hindmarsh (Ms Gallus) says there may be a legal right to legislate but there is no moral right. That is an extraordinary argument to try to come to grips with. The member is saying she does not want the Commonwealth to exercise the power. She is entitled to that view. But the power is there as clear as day. We have not yet arrived at the point where the Northern Territory has been granted statehood. So we not only have the power but, having the power, we have the duty to exercise it as legislators in a national parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I read with interest and listened to the opening speech by the member for Grayndler at the beginning of this debate when he said that those of us who opposed euthanasia ought not to have any concerns with this bill because it does not apply to us; it only applies to those who support euthanasia. That is an entirely flawed understanding of the role of the Commonwealth parliament and the way legislation works.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The test that I would apply to this debate, and specifically dealing with this amendment, is the CNN test. That is, when covering the issue, what will be the headline on CNN? Will they broadcast to the world that in a dramatic move the Commonwealth has reopened an argument about the extent to which the Commonwealth parliament ought to intervene in the affairs of a territory before conferring statehood under the constitutional <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8010"> process? Will it read that the Commonwealth parliament of Australia has taken a very dramatic and decisive decision to move the euthanasia debate from one chamber to another? No. When CNN reports this debate it will say, `A province of Australia has passed the most far&hyphen;reaching and daring patient killing act known to the world.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So let us retain a degree of proportionality about this discussion. As we have had to face up to the difficulty of this issue, there have been various attempts to sideline it. If we want to talk about side&hyphen;show alley, it is those who oppose the Andrews bill who are grasping at straws, taking every step, contrivance, ruse and blind to try to get this debate off the national agenda and out of this parliament altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those of us who support the bill simply say: bring it on. To those who maybe are out there listening to this debate now, wondering why we are voting on the amendment, it is yet another attempt to take the mind of this parliament off the key matter of substance to which we are all directing our minds. The question is: when is enough enough? When will we simply take a deep breath and each one of us nail our flag to the mast? When will we simply take the vote which all Australians are groaning about and waiting for after weeks of deliberation in what has been an excellent debate with fine contributions from all sides? Now is the time to simply come to a conclusion, make a judgment and vote on the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that basis I support the Andrews bill and specifically oppose the amendment. There is no substance to it. There is no legal obstacle to the Andrews bill. In the way the debate is understood by the people of Australia and of the world, this is a bill of substance and the entire debate has been focused on that substance. It is about life and death, it is about euthanasia, and it is about time we voted on it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As much as I admire the sincerity and rhetorical skills of the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron), I am afraid on this matter he has not persuaded me. I was more persuaded by the member for New England (Mr Sinclair) in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> his motion and the presentation he made to the House earlier. He cleverly and precisely highlighted the central flaw of the private member's bill&mdash;that is, while it seeks to deal with a national issue, it does not make laws for the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even though the private member's bill introduced by the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) seeks to deal with a national issue, it does not make laws for the nation. Even though the member for Menzies said in his second reading speech that the bill is only here because it is a national issue, it of course seeks to make laws only for part of the nation. It is that question of inconsistency that really should lead this House to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for New England.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This House should be very careful indeed when it takes rights away from people. I have been asked about the hierarchy of principles that have guided my own thinking and voting intention on this matter. I assess that hierarchy as follows: I believe passionately that human rights are more important than states rights. But among the grouping of human rights, democratic rights are supreme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I judge this issue as not really concerning territorian rights but rather democratic rights&mdash;because this parliament some years ago conferred upon the people of the Northern Territory their democratic right to make laws concerning euthanasia. In my electorate of Werriwa in the state of New South Wales, each of my 130,000 constituents have a democratic right conferred upon them by the Australian constitution to elect state parliamentarians to make laws on euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that the people in my electorate should have a different set of democratic rights to the 500,000 people who live in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. Each Australian should have the same set of democratic rights for the manner in which laws concerning voluntary euthanasia are made. If people in my electorate vote and elect state parliamentarians for that purpose, people in the ACT and the Northern Territory should have exactly the same set of democratic rights. That is why in my hierarchy of principles and thinking the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8011"> democratic right we are talking about here is very much part of the human rights principle which, in turn, is supreme over any concern for state or territorian rights. That is the way I address this issue. I urge honourable members to think long and hard before we take away any of the democratic rights of any Australian citizen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember Gough Whitlam telling me a story, which I should relate to the House, that concerned his father, who was one of the early citizens to move to Canberra as the national capital. Whitlam Sr addressed a rally of residents in the ACT on the issue of taxation without representation. Gough remembers well how his father commenced the address to those assembled by talking of `fellow subjects', not `fellow citizens'. What he was saying there very clearly was that the people in the ACT at that time who had to pay taxation without representation were being treated by central government as subjects, not as citizens with the same rights of democracy and decision making as any other Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the Andrews proposition is trying to treat people in the Northern Territory and the ACT as subjects, not as citizens. It is saying to those 500,000 Australians that they will have an entirely different set of democratic rights on the issue of euthanasia from all other Australians. I believe that is wrong. I believe in a free and open democracy that should promote the principles of national consistency for all Australians. That is very, very wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I welcome from the right honourable member for New England is the way in which his amendment has separated the propositions of consistency on the constitution and democratic rights and the questions of conscience that have been weighing heavily on the minds of so many members of the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was disappointed to hear the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron) talking about power as if power is right and that having power confers righteousness in all circumstances. I believe very strongly that merely having power does not mean that you are right. It is the astute exercise of power that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> divides right from wrong. I am always very suspicious in public life when I hear people equating power with righteousness. It reminds me of the language of authority, the language of strongarm government that always says, `If I have the power to do these things, I am right to do them.' I do not believe that is the way in which a fair and open society should deal with issues like this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned in the Main Committee my interest in the dictum of Gandhi that real power comes from giving power away. There is an argument to say in this age of internationalisation that so much of economic and political power is pushing upwards. Part of the role of this parliament on certain issues is to push power and authority downwards, to bring certain issues and control much closer to the lives and influence of ordinary Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should not assume for a single moment, because we are a national parliament with some esteem and prestige remaining in the community, that we are right because we have power. The real exercise of power in this matter comes from pushing it down, pushing it closer to those people who want to exercise those powers in their democratic rights&mdash;the people of the ACT and the Northern Territory&mdash;and, on the issue of substance, the question of voluntary euthanasia itself, to empower those who are directly involved, not to make judgments for terminally ill people that they are able to make for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the substantive issue, there has been a very good debate. I repeat my concern that the debate almost exclusively took place in the Main Committee. These are issues that the House of Representatives chamber could have usefully dealt with in totality. But I would urge members to go back and read some of the speeches made in the Main Committee. One speech in particular stood out. It came from someone who is in a very different party from my own. The member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) gave what I found to be one of the most moving statements on the issue of euthanasia that any member could possibly present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He spoke with the real passion of circumstances within in his own family concerning <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8012"> what must have been a terrible case of cancer and how, despite personal views and religious convictions, he concludes, on the basis of that experience, that the rights of that person, his mother, should have been supreme and that in any similar cases in the future it is the right of the individual to make a judgment, in cases of terminal illness, that should be regarded as absolutely supreme. It is not the right of the parliament to tell terminally ill people how they should spend the last days of their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about two basic principles of liberty: the liberty of people in the ACT and the Northern Territory to exercise the same set of democratic rights that are available to all Australians&mdash;that is, the way in which their parliaments go about the task of framing laws for or against voluntary euthanasia&mdash;and the basic liberty in a free society of individuals with terminal illnesses to make their own choice, to find their own control in how they might wish to spend the last moments of their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes), whom I am pleased to see in the chamber, spoke of how, on the philosophy of John Stuart Mill, the quintessential libertarian, there is a big difference between other regarding acts and self-regarding acts. What we are talking about with regard to euthanasia is very much a self-regarding act&mdash;the right of an individual to have control over their own destiny. I have always believed that if people do not have basic elements of control, choice and liberty in their life then the life itself is not worth living. Let alone the question of euthanasia, if people do not have basic control, choice and liberty of their own personal destiny in self-regarding instances, life itself is fundamentally diminished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe, on these questions, that the House of Representatives should not impose a different set of democratic rights on people from the ACT and the Northern Territory. This is not a straight instance where we are exercising part of the constitution; it is an instance where we are taking rights away from people, not conferring them on a certain group of Australians. We are taking away the rights that people in the electorates of Parramatta, Werriwa, Menzies, Fisher, Bradfield <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and every other federal division outside the territories take absolutely for granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, for those who say that euthanasia is a national issue, do not fear the proposition that has been advanced by the right honourable member for New England. He has moved an amendment that declares euthanasia to be a national issue to be dealt with in a nationally consistent fashion. It is the nationally consistent principle that is absolutely supreme. He has separated the constitutional question and the questions of democratic rights from those of conscience. For that the House should be most grateful. The House should demonstrate its support for democratic rights, for the rights of people in the Northern Territory and the ACT, by supporting the amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I wish to repeat my absolute protest and concern that this is the sort of debate which we should have been having all along in the main chamber of the House of Representatives. What a waste to send it through the Main Committee process where each speaker had only 10 minutes to speak when here on the motion now moved we have 15 minutes at our disposal to put forward our views. These are views, whether for or against, that do this parliament great credit, that do this parliament more credit, in its esteem and regard in the Australian population than any thousand hours of party political debate. It is a debate and a consideration we should have always had right here in the people's chamber.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose the amendment moved by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). He is usually right about most things but I will have to disagree with him today. The main reason I have for that disagreement is that I was in the position, like some others, of having heard many of the speeches in the Main Committee&mdash;confined to 10 minutes, as has already been said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were some of the best speeches I have heard since entering the parliament, and I do not think for one moment that the speakers there misunderstood what they were talking about. They did not misunderstand that it was a constitutional matter. It was not just that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8013"> they were debating their conscience and what they thought about euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The speeches were thoughtful and considerate. It was an extraordinarily good experience to hear members stating which way they would vote and why. They did not skirt around the issue of the constitution. I say that the territories go through a maturing process and that the constitution is such that citizens of the territories&mdash;and, in this instance, a good number of the Aboriginal community and also others who feel vulnerable&mdash;are protected by Commonwealth law through this maturing process. This is not a question of discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own speech in the Main Committee, I referred to the Commonwealth's rights in this matter and recalled the relatively recent example of the Commonwealth overriding Tasmanian law. I also recall commenting on the fact that the electoral roll of the Northern Territory has 115,000 on it and my own electorate of Adelaide has 83,500. I put forward the argument there that my constituents would not deem it proper or appropriate, I am sure, to be arguing what was right for the rest of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am comparatively new in this place, compared with others like the right honourable member for New England who have been around for quite a long time. So I thought it might be appropriate to quote a member who usually sits on the other side of the chamber, who is absent today, who made a good speech in the Main Committee. I refer to the member for Lalor, Mr Barry Jones. When he referred to these matters, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Oddly, the Northern Territory's remonstrance does not refer to section 122 of the Commonwealth's constitution which gives this parliament a specific head of power over legislation passed in territorial legislatures. Until the Northern Territory becomes a state, or until the constitution is revised, there can be no moral, legal or political objection to the Commonwealth parliament exercising its functions.</PARA>
<PARA>Reference was made earlier by other speakers to what sort of pressure was being put on people who speak on this issue and to what the opinion polls have to say. I return to the member for Lalor's speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am singularly unimpressed by the argument that, because public opinion polls support euthanasia, the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Northern Territory's law should be allowed to stand. If the Northern Territory decided to restore the death penalty, that too might generate rousing support as indicated in public opinion polls, but I would not hesitate to vote to overturn it if it was brought before this parliament under section 122.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not intend to take up a lot more time because, as I have already said, an extraordinarily good, high quality, top&hyphen;class debate has already taken place on this subject in the Main Committee. I think that comments made in this place now should be strictly to the amendment which has been moved. I congratulate those who have taken part in the debate and urge them to reject the amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the amendment moved by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) because it does do us the honour of giving us an opportunity to really reflect whether we are taking a position which is of principle that applies to the whole of Australia or whether we are being simply asked to be opportunistic, to strike down laws that apply in one territory of this Commonwealth in a way which will have no impact on the electoral fortunes of any of us as members of this House who represent other states or territories.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the general matters of this debate and the issues that go to the question of euthanasia at large, that has been the subject of what I think has been a very thoughtful and deeply emotional debate which ought to have occurred in this chamber. It would have done this House great honour, were it to have occurred in this chamber. I regret very much that we come back to this chamber for a debate about a procedural aspect when the substantial debate has not been given to this chamber by the government. I think that dishonours the process that has been adopted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The right honourable member's amendment does give us some opportunity to look at this in a broader context. Reference was made to this parliament's overriding of the Tasmanian law, but members who are aware of the nature of that debate and of the legislation proposed by the government know that it applied universally. It was law that applied, consistent with the Commonwealth's constitutional <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8014"> reach, to all states and territories. It did not apply to Tasmania specifically. Its reach was to all jurisdictions. So it is now unlawful for a state law to intrude upon the consenting sexual practices of adults conducted in private. That was a decision this House made, knowing that those consequences applied to all citizens of this country wherever they might reside&mdash;state or territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This proposed measure is selective. It applies only to one jurisdiction and purports to leave all other jurisdictions free to proceed as they will. I cannot see how we can genuinely address this issue as a matter of conscience, saying that we apply it to all of those that we represent, if we are being asked to supply such a selective application to the work we do. Is it such that this parliament would have no objection in principle to the state parliaments in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia or my own home state of Tasmania, were those democratically elected parliaments to take courses&mdash;which have been urged from time to time by some of their members&mdash;to legislate in a like manner to the Northern Territory?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For my own part, I made my views clear in the debate. I propose to vote against the Andrews bill on the substantive matter when it comes before this House. But, irrespective of whatever view I have of the matter, I believe this House could address it more properly. It needs the courage to say that it is prepared to back its judgments and apply the laws across all Australian states and territories. I do not believe that our consciences, such as they are and as they have been aroused in this debate, are limited to those places, such as territory legislatures, over which this parliament has in the past exercised jurisdiction as the superior parliament. We have moved past that stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The jurisdictions in the Northern Territory and the ACT are fully self-administering. They have democratic processes and they elect democratic chambers to represent them. What we are going through today is a complicated debate. All of us will ultimately take positions in relation to a matter of grave principle, which is the morality or otherwise of permitting Australians to choose to have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> available to them a dignified death. But, whatever one's view in the final outcome of that debate, this process is a fundamentally flawed one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A reference was made to my colleague Barry Jones, the member for Lalor. I believe that he made one of the most significant contributions to the debate on the side of those who have ultimately concluded that this parliament should resolve against the principle of allowing Australians, through their freely elected representatives, to shape their response to euthanasia on a state by state or territory basis. I do not share that view and I did not share it in the Main Committee. I made it plain in that debate that the reason I took this view was that in practice there is already an unregulated system where many elderly Australians, those facing pain and suffering and those subjected to trauma or long-lasting disease, are having dealings with a substantial proportion of the medical profession which has indicated that it is ready to assist actively in the provision of euthanasia. That being the case, we would be better served by setting down clear guidelines that govern acts which are plainly not an offence, as we see things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) sitting in the chamber today. I will repeat what I said in the Main Committee. I find it extraordinary that a medical practitioner who has publicly indicated on a number of occasions that he has participated in active euthanasia on at least two occasions can say that euthanasia should be available to him to choose but then preclude the legislatures of Australia from setting limits to its exercise by the God medical practitioner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is plain that no-one went out to arrest the member for Bradfield, seek a confession from him or treat him as a murderer as they would had he confessed to some other directly criminal matter. People have a deeply compassionate and human understanding of the circumstances faced by individual patients and doctors in those circumstances. That is the reason why a large majority of the Australian public wishes that the legislation proposed before the House be defeated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, be it the will of this House or otherwise, it is far better that this House looks to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8015"> a process that applies across the whole of Australia. We could speak of the death penalty. Were the death penalty introduced by any jurisdiction in Australia&mdash;I agree with the member who said that it should be repelled&mdash;the national parliament would have ample powers to repel it across Australia. That ample power would allow this parliament to legislate, were it so minded. It would be the occasion for a substantial debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Were it so minded, there would be ample power in this parliament for us to pass a law, as we did in the Tasmanian instance. It would apply across the whole of Australia in order to preserve basic rights and fundamental freedoms. This would include the right to life if it were violated in the case of a state intending to introduce capital punishment, which is the intentional deprivation of a life in an unwilled way, not as a matter of choice by an individual who wishes to end their pain and suffering. This would be the case were the matter to come before this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support, not with any great passion but as a matter of correct principle, the amendment moved by the right honourable member for New England. I propose, before ultimately voting on the motion moved by the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), to see whether we can as a House have this matter addressed in a way that would put people to the test. This would involve passing a law that would apply in their electorates when, plainly, the vast majority of their electorates do not share the views they are expressing in this House. They are able to get away with these views in a fairly convenient way by addressing all the arguments towards the citizens of one territory but avoiding any responsibility for the application of their conduct to their own electorates and the wider Australian community.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amended motion moved by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) is, whether by design or otherwise, an attempt to shelve Mr Andrews' Euthanasia Laws Bill forever. It is a motion to do nothing. It attempts to abrogate the clear responsibility and the duty of this parliament to nearly 18 million Australians. So, far from discriminating against a large number of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australians, as has been put, it is discriminating in favour of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let there be no doubt about the Northern Territory parliament: in effect, it is not a parliament at all; it is an assembly. It is interesting to examine some of the cases that have looked at section 122 of the constitution because, as the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron) said, that section provides a specific, clear and unambiguous power. In the Capital Duplicators case, the High Court considered that section 122 was a general source of Commonwealth power over the Australian Capital Territory&mdash;and by implication over the Northern Territory&mdash;which was not limited by any other section of the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The full court of the Federal Court considered in Attorney-General (Northern Territory) v. Hand that, if a conflict exists between Commonwealth and territory laws, the Commonwealth law prevails. That is interesting because section 109 of the constitution deals only with an inconsistency between state and Commonwealth laws. But Mr Justice Lockhart indicated that, if that conflict existed between a territory and a Commonwealth law, the Commonwealth law prevailed. That is important in considering the position of the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing novel about a power that exists in the constitution or at a state level in relation to subordinate assemblies. There is a classic example in the local government jurisdiction, where several years ago the Gold Coast City Council was dismissed as a result of the exercise of a state power because of the performance of that particular council in certain matters. That power has existed for a long time, and no-one has ever complained about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear, I stress again, that the Northern Territory parliament is subject to section 122 of the constitution. As was said by the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner)&mdash;I agree wholeheartedly with him&mdash;that is the weakest argument. It is the weakest argument that is being dressed up as a means of totally killing this particular bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory has decided to deal with a major national issue&mdash;one of the most <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8016"> important issues of principle this country has had to face in many years&mdash;and that is the deliberate killing of human beings. Let us examine what the House of Lords committee which has looked at this particular matter has said. It is probably fair to say that the Northern Territory&mdash;albeit by a bare majority of one&mdash;chose to ignore parliaments with the authority and, shall I say, learning and experience of the British parliament. The House of Lords committee made this observation in relation to euthanasia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we do not think it possible to set secure limits on voluntary euthanasia. Some witnesses told us that to legalise voluntary euthanasia was a discrete step which need have no other consequences. But as we said in our introduction issues of life and death do not lend themselves to clear definition . . . </PARA>
<PARA>But the Northern Territory, in its intoxicating burst of erudition, has seen fit to attempt to legislate on just that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Northern Territory legislation, the doctor who performs the euthanasia and one other advising doctor are responsible for certifying that all the conditions under the legislation are met. The patient has only, if he or she is able, to sign a standard request form. All the other documentation that is sent to the coroner, with one exemption, is created and signed by the doctors who are involved in the case. Yet once the paperwork is in order, the same doctors who prepare the paperwork are protected from investigation. The coroner is not given any power to investigate the circumstances of the death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only other paperwork involved is from a psychiatrist, who must certify that the patient is not suffering from `treatable clinical depression in respect of the illness'. Whether the patient is suffering from depression which is unrelated to the illness, because of the death of a spouse, or whether there is depression which is not considered treatable is not relevant. Nor is the psychiatrist required by the legislation to investigate whether the patient is suffering from any other psychiatric illness or disorder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The breadth of certain definitions in the legislation means that many persons who would not ordinarily be considered terminally ill qualify for euthanasia. That is the incred ible boldness of the Northern Territory assembly. They have overlooked those particular matters, steamed on and presented a bill which will affect all parts of the Australian community and which undermines the social fabric of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is interesting when we hear members talking about the weight of public opinion. The member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) mentioned one letter. I will mention two letters that I received. At a public meeting that I convened in my electorate there was a woman in her early 30s who was suffering from a very serious illness. She spoke passionately about her right to have her life end when she felt it was appropriate. There was a lengthy debate that afternoon and  speakers on both sides were heard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, a couple of weeks later I received a letter from her saying, almost in an apologetic way, that she was the person who had spoken so passionately at that meeting but that she had changed her mind. She now believed the legislation was the thin end of the wedge. The reason she changed her mind was that one speaker at that particular venue had mentioned the Sunday sport argument. You will remember that 40 years ago Sunday sport was absolutely the end of the world and damnation was upon us if Sunday sport was introduced. Look at it now!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other person who wrote to me was a young doctor&mdash;I don't think he had quite qualified&mdash;in his internship. That doctor had been treating a patient who was dying of AIDS and who was very ill. The patient and his partner had begged and begged for the doctor to end the life of the person who had been suffering over a period of weeks. Towards the end of that person's life, he rallied. In that time, he and his partner were able to share in a lucid way much of their past life together and he slipped quietly away. A few weeks later his partner wrote to the doctor and said, `Thank you so much for not taking the life of my partner in that situation.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that highlights yet again the foolishness of the Northern Territory legislature in ignoring the reports, in ignoring the carefully constructed paragraphs of the report of the House of Lords, in ignoring the views of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8017"> Australian people and in discriminating against those who are old, infirm, ill or otherwise in a position of vulnerability vis-a-vis the rest of the community in relation to this issue. Do we want to see, as this amendment proposes, a situation where the killing will continue, where people who may not be really consenting at all are put to death?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I challenge anyone in this debate to convince this House beyond reasonable doubt that there is no possibility of any person being put to death involuntarily, that there is no possibility of an involuntary euthanasia. Can any person do that? I would suggest, with the greatest respect to all of those who hold different views, that that is not possible. The reason why it is not possible is the experience of life and the experience of those who looked at this issue in the House of Lords in extensive hearings. I might add that members of that committee had views in favour of euthanasia until they heard the evidence, until they looked at the situation in Holland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That certainly was the experience at my public meeting and another meeting that I was involved in. The moment people looked at the issues and understood the ramifications, their views changed. It is certainly unfortunate to have mentioned here that these views are religious views. I can tell those who raised that point&mdash;in quite an inopportune way&mdash;that I have, over many years in the course my legal practice, acted for people charged with the most horrendous crimes involving children. At no stage did my Christian belief impinge on or otherwise affect my professional duty to those clients. For anyone to suggest that that was the case is to misunderstand how the system works, and that is even stronger in a situation like this. Suggestions to that effect were made unwisely and inappropriately by a member who had spoken previously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment that has been moved is a last ditch attempt. As I suppose a judge would say of an attempt at a weak and hopeless argument, `The opponents were driven to submit it.' That is where we are now. They have been driven to submit it. All else has failed, and we are having a last hoorah with an amendment&mdash;an amendment that will send <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> messages out to the community that death is cheap, that we are not concerned about the weak, the frail and those who need our support&mdash;those who are the most unrepresented in our societies, as any member who has visited their nursing homes and retirement villages well knows&mdash;and that will allow the mischievous and those who would perpetrate evil on their next of kin&mdash;there are those about, mark my words&mdash;to gain ultimately by a person's passing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, the right honourable member for New England, with all due respect, has got it wrong. It is the Northern Territory that has foisted this on the rest of Australia, not the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) putting it on the Northern Territory. It is the other way around.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not intend to speak for 15 minutes, I assure you. The amendment that has been proposed by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), in my opinion, is one which should not be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8018"> supported. As was so eloquently and clearly demonstrated in the address by the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese), this issue is about euthanasia. We have had a lengthy and detailed debate, albeit in the Main Committee, and much of the contribution has been of a very high quality. There are very few people&mdash;except those who are opposed to Mr Andrews' Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996&mdash;who feel that it is about something other than euthanasia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The right honourable member for New England and many of those who have spoken in support of his position have argued that we need national uniformity. I could not agree more. The simplest way to achieve national uniformity in the short to medium term is to support the bill proposed by Mr Andrews, and that will return us to a situation in Australia where the same law and the same values which underwrite it will exist right across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would encourage us in this place to support Mr Andrews' bill under section 122 of the constitution to see the intentional ending of human life in the Northern Territory does not continue and, at the same time, having passed and supported that proposition in legislation, to then support the idea that is proposed by the right honourable member for New England that there be, should it be considered appropriate by this parliament, a piece of legislation which would apply to all parts of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not accept the argument that, because this applies to a relatively small proportion of the Australian population, in some way we absolve ourselves of our responsibilities. If, for example, the Northern Territory government or the ACT government were to pass a law which allowed for the distribution and sale of fully automatic machine&hyphen;guns, I have very little doubt that in this parliament, under section 122 of the constitution, we would be saying it is not in the national interests for this to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, in this case, we have a piece of legislation passed in the Northern Territory by one of the least mature parliaments in this country that says it is all right for one person to assist another to die. What that does is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> change one of the inherent values upon which society is currently based&mdash;that is, we do not live in a country where we believe it is all right, no matter how reasonable the circumstances may be, for one human being under law to assist another person to die. That is what this debate and this issue have been all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) digressed from the amendment proposed by the right honourable member for New England by suggesting that the Commonwealth may pass laws in relation to buses, hospitals and sundry topics. To suggest that the management of the death of a human being should equate in some way to decisions about bus routes and the management of hospitals trivialises the substance of what this is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My position on this bill in supporting Kevin Andrews on the rights and views of people in the Northern Territory is well known. I rang a person who was suggested to me by Senator Bob Collins&mdash;I forget his name, but he is the proprietor or the director of an organisation called Green Ant Research, Arts and Publishing&mdash;and spoke to him. I understand that he was engaged by the Northern Territory government to go and speak to Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory to explain to them what the Northern Territory's euthanasia legislation was all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He said to me, `I am in favour of euthanasia. I believe, as some others would say, that I have a right. If I want to have my life ended, it is my life.' He said that nothing prepared him for what he found when he went out to Aboriginal Australia. The depth of concern and fear that Aboriginal people expressed to him about the notion of intentionally assisting a person to die was such that he encouraged me, despite his support for euthanasia, to support the Kevin Andrews bill. He said, with some maturity, that it is not proper for any parliament&mdash;in this case the Northern Territory parliament&mdash;to support such a controversial piece of legislation when such a significant proportion of the electorate over which it governs are clearly so opposed to it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8019">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another issue that I should address. The member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) and the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) have said&mdash;many others have also said this&mdash;that on two occasions I have engaged in euthanasia; therefore, it would be odd and hypocritical for me to support Kevin Andrews' bill. What I have done and what I have said is that in the 13 years I have practised medicine I cared for many people who died and their families. I believe there were two occasions when I gave treatments to people, the intention of which was to alleviate their pain and ensure a dignified death, where I believed the treatments contributed substantially to their deaths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I make is that, if someone believed that I or any other doctor going about his or her business had done the wrong thing, then potentially he or she may need to account for his or her actions before a court of law and then, on a case by case basis, the court makes a judgment about whether this was an act of compassion or whether it was one of evil intent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point that is made repeatedly by those who would support the right honourable member's amendment and are opposed to the Andrews bill is that it is popular. If only our job were so easy. If our job were simply to come here, having taken a poll of our respective electorates, and say, `Seventy&hyphen;five per cent or 80 per cent of the people in my electorate support euthanasia'&mdash;at least what they believe it to be&mdash;`therefore I will vote for it,' I would not have bothered to go into public life. In the end, it is a question of doing what you believe to be right&mdash;to be a person who is capable of thinking and of considering reasonable argument that is put by those who may have a view different from your own and that of your constituents. In the end, you do what you believe to be right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One point that also needs to be made is that when politicians&mdash;that is us&mdash;are out of touch with our citizens, when we fail to listen to the arguments of others, when we have closed our minds and we allow facts to bow to bias, then the whole nation is vulnerable. In particular, when we are people who follow public opinion rather than actually lead it from time to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> time, then we abrogate our duty to the people that we represent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) spoke well, although I disagreed with him. For example, he spoke about the idea of taking rights away from people. I find it extraordinary that people argue that they have this right to end their lives at the time and in the manner of their choosing. As Liberals, in particular, this is a particularly attractive proposition for us. But what we have to realise&mdash;and the reason I support the Andrews bill&mdash;is that when one person exercising his or her rights diminishes those of others, we have a duty to say, `No, this is not something we support.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the member for Werriwa that we do not allow people to drink excessive amounts of alcohol and drive a car. We force them to wear seat belts. We force them to restrain children in the backs of cars. We have recently supported legislation that prohibits the ownership and use of some kinds of weapons. We do so because we believe it serves the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the tragedy occurred at Port Arthur, yes, in the short term it affected very directly and tragically a very small number of people. But, on behalf of 18 million Australians, the Labor Party, the Australian Democrats, the National Party and the Liberal Party together said that there was a set of values they would support and lead on from the national parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of those who have spoken on the amendment proposed by the right honourable member for New England have said that we are here to pass laws only in relation to taxes, in relation to governance of the country. Yes, we are, but there are two things in life which, as they say, are certain&mdash;death and taxes. I have spent a lot of time here debating taxes; I would now like to spend some time discussing other issues about which people are concerned. If we want to render this parliament in a position of secondary importance in the minds of many people, we will be dismissing or trivialising issues such as the one before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I consider that I am consistent. Had I been here at the time, I would have supported the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8020"> federal parliament overturning the Tasmanian legislation. Similarly, I supported the federal parliament, legitimately under section 122 of the constitution, advising the Northern Territory that it will not pass laws to allow one person to assist another to die. Having done that, I would be equally happy to support a motion, should it be proposed, along the lines of the amendment proposed by the right honourable member for New England because it would subsequently ensure uniformity across the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People also need to remember that in the end the destiny of this country will be determined by what we believe&mdash;our sets of values, our principles&mdash;the way we see ourselves and the way we relate to one another. If only I were able to disengage myself from the reality, if not some of the passion, of the issue of euthanasia and say, `I am opposed to euthanasia but I am very much an advocate of states rights'&mdash;the territory, of course, not being a state. If only it were that easy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, some members seem to have adopted a position where they say, `On the one hand, I am opposed to euthanasia, so those of you who have that view, settle down; on the other hand, I think we should send this issue to a committee or wait 12 months for somebody else to come back on it.' It is all about euthanasia, and that is why, at this point, I will not support the honourable member's amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is about euthanasia because one man has already been assisted to die. We have been told by one of the chief medical protagonists in this issue, Dr Philip Nitschke, that another 10 are awaiting assistance to die. The honourable member for McKellar (Mrs Bishop) in her contribution in the Main Committee made a very telling point when she said that Mr Rod Dent is free to change his mind but his father is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As long as we allow the Northern Territory legislation to continue as it is, this country will be one of divided not common values. It will be one in which some people may, in quite ambivalent and controversial circumstances, have their lives taken. Those who think&mdash;I heard one contributor say this&mdash;that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> having two doctors making a diagnosis and confirming that you have a disease from which you will not recover, and then having a psychiatrist check that you are in a fit state of mind to have your life ended, are adequate safeguards are, I can assure you, sadly misguided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have asked myself, as every member should ask themselves, have you ever met someone who was told three years ago by three doctors, all experts in their field, that they had three months to live? How many psychiatrists were protecting the interests of the people at Chelmsford? I simply throw that into the debate so that people will start to put these things in proper perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are here to make decisions and some of them are difficult. It is time to make a decision on the issue of euthanasia. It is time for people to have the courage of their convictions, not just support what is popular in a community, and make a decision on this issue. I certainly would support anyone in the chamber proposing that the right honourable member's amendment be put shortly so that we can get on with the business of considering it.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The right honourable member for New England said that the Andrews bill is not about euthanasia at all. I say to him that I wish he had announced that at the beginning of the debate, when 70 people, who have spoken very well on the subject, could have been better informed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8021">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The right honourable member for New England says that the Andrews bill discriminates against the territories. It does not; it discriminates against euthanasia. It very properly discriminates against euthanasia by making it impossible in the Northern Territory. If any state attempted to do what the Northern Territory has done, I would be here arguing that we override that state to the best of our constitutional power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of the amendment moved by the right honourable member must be very clearly understood. If passed, this amendment would mean that euthanasia is still alive. If passed, this amendment would mean that the Northern Territory law permitting people to be medically executed would remain in place. Someone who is against euthanasia must vote against the right honourable member's amendment. If you are against euthanasia, you must vote against the right honourable member's amendment and for the bill moved by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been some conversation in the chamber this afternoon about the need for a uniform, national anti-euthanasia approach. I think that is a marvellous idea. If this problem went national I would certainly want to extend the Commonwealth's laws nationally, but it is a bit rich to think that supporters of euthanasia, opponents of the anti-euthanasia approach of the member for Menzies, are really going to come into this parliament supporting a national anti-euthanasia bill. So I think there is an element of double speak on the part of the supporters of this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) blamed the Andrews bill on what he called the Catholic lobby. I have great respect for my friend and colleague the member for the Northern Territory, who is a distinguished politician and a fine parliamentarian, but I think those comments were beneath him. Someone could just as easily say that it was the Northern Territory lobby that was opposing the Andrews bill. No-one says that. I do not say that. I respect the conscience of the member for the Northern Territory. I believe that he is acting on his conscience and I think he should respect the consciences of those who are promoting the Andrews bill.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for the Northern Territory said, `Why wasn't this attempt to overturn the territory legislation brought in earlier?' The reason why it was not done under the provisions of the Northern Territory (Self&hyphen;Government) Act is that all of us expected the territory parliament would reverse its own law. That was how things seemed late last year when the parliament first considered this matter. That was how things appeared to be when Shane Stone became the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, and it is a pity that Mr Stone has not allowed his own conscience to rule in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) asked a rhetorical question: do we in this parliament think that we are inherently better than the parliamentarians in the Northern Territory? No, we are not inherently better in ourselves, but we are inherently better qualified to make national decisions. This is the national parliament and of course it should decide something as important as a question of life and death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Andrews bill, quite contrary to statements opposite, quite contrary to statements made by many speakers in this debate, is a very effective remedy to the problem of the Northern Territory. It is an important issue. It is one that justifies this step. The Andrews bill will be entirely effective in eliminating the problem and restoring a national approach to euthanasia&mdash;that is, it is illegal everywhere in the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course the Commonwealth should intervene on an issue like this. This idea that the Commonwealth should stay away from something just because a territory or a state has touched on it is absolutely ludicrous. The Commonwealth parliament intervenes every day. Every piece of legislation that the Commonwealth deals with has important effects on the states and territories. I did not hear anyone saying in this parliament that we should not pass industrial relations legislation because industrial relations is at least on some conception the province of the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I finally turn to my friend the right honourable member for New England. If I may say with very great respect, the right honourable member's normal sagacity and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8022"> wisdom has somewhat deserted him on this matter. I never expected to hear the right honourable member for New England say, `This is too hard for the parliament. We are not big enough to deal with this. We need the Attorney-General to come in with a bill.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frankly, I think the Kevin Andrews bill is every bit as good as any bill that the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) could draft. I think that what Kevin has put together with the help of the clerks is every bit as good as anything that could be put together in the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department. It just will not wash. In any event, it just would not work because sooner or later this parliament would have to decide the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, as I suspect, this amendment will be defeated. I very much respect what the right honourable member for New England said about his position on the principle of euthanasia and I do trust that he will join the supporters of the Andrews bill in asserting the principle that killing can never be sanctioned by law.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to reinforce the remarks made a moment ago by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) with respect to allegations that the Andrews bill was inspired by a particular Christian denomination. Certainly, the Catholic Church has played a leading role, but so has the Anglican Church, through Archbishop Hollingworth. My understanding is that the Jewish community, the Muslim community and the Buddhist community all oppose euthanasia and all, generally speaking, support the thrust of the Andrews bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also would like to correct a misleading remark made by our colleague the honourable <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who referred to that wonderful lady, Mother Teresa of Calcutta. He mentioned that Mother Teresa said to her doctors recently words to the effect of, `Let me die.' The conduct of those doctors, had they in fact turned off the life support system, would not have been inconsistent with the provisions of the Andrews bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Andrews bill is not designed to prevent the withdrawal of medical treatment and thereby allow nature to take its course. It is not designed to outlaw the practices mentioned by the honourable member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) where doctors prescribe pain relieving drugs which may also advance death, provided the purpose of giving those drugs is to alleviate pain and not to advance death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one looks at the strategy adopted by the father of the House, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), it is pretty clear that this is a last desperate attempt to prevent the passage of the Andrews bill. There has been an earlier attempt to send the bill off to a committee. There is also an amendment on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> moved by the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas). Month after month debate has raged in this country over this important subject.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I would have to say that rarely do I agree with the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), I believe that he hit the nail on the head when he pointed out that there is an expectation in the Australian community that this matter will be brought to a vote. The Commonwealth parliament has been debating this legislation for some time, and the community believes that we will make a decision one way or the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever the motives are of the right honourable member for New England, if his amendment to the motion moved by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) is carried, clearly that would be interpreted as a vote by this parliament in support of euthanasia. So when we vote on the amendment moved by the right honourable member for New England, we ought to be aware that, effectively, we will be voting on the subject <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8023"> of euthanasia. As Shane Stone said when opposing euthanasia in the Northern Territory parliament:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Euthanasia legislation can have all the safeguards imaginable but, at the end of the day, the principle remains&mdash;one person kills another person. . . You either support euthanasia or you don't.</PARA>
<PARA>In different circumstances today, the question is the same&mdash;you either support euthanasia or you don't.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like honourable members to consider how their vote today will be interpreted. If this amendment is carried, it will mean that euthanasia will remain legal. It is important to recognise that the legislation passed by the Northern Territory parliament&mdash;a parliament representing only about 185,000 Australians&mdash;applies to people throughout the country. About one per cent of the Australian population lives in the Northern Territory but all of the 18 million people in Australia are able to access this law by travelling to the Northern Territory and taking advantage of the provisions of the Northern Territory law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The right honourable member for New England referred to discrimination against territorial parliaments. He did not refer to the morality of a parliament representing about one per cent of Australians making laws which legalise access to euthanasia for the whole country. I might add that this would be the first euthanasia legislation anywhere in the world that is allowed to remain on the statute books.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other argument which has been taken by some speakers has been that it is inappropriate for this parliament to pass a law relating to euthanasia which will override the Northern Territory legislation, because somehow we have to take notice of the so-called states or territory rights. Under our constitution, there is a great difference between being a state and being a territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The states of course have achieved a certain level of constitutional development. We all agree that the Northern Territory is well on the road to statehood and I would like to see the Northern Territory ultimately achieve statehood, but we cannot fudge the difference. The Northern Territory is either a territory or a state, and it clearly is a territory. As a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> territory, it is subject to the provisions of section 122 of the Australian constitution, which states in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliament may make laws for the government of any territory surrendered by any State to and accepted by the Commonwealth, or of any territory placed by the Queen under the authority of and accepted by the Commonwealth . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, we have the right as a parliament to legislate with respect to the Northern Territory. I believe that, given the national impact of this Northern Territory law, not only do we have the right to do so but that right is accompanied by a responsibility to do so. It is a little like allowing a probationary driver who has a learner's permit to drive as a fully qualified driver on the roadways of this country. I do not think any reasonable person would accept that that is something which should be allowed to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would urge this parliament to reject the amendment to the motion moved by the right honourable member for New England, a person whom I greatly respect and a person of whose wisdom we normally take a great deal of notice. But, as one of our colleagues suggested, his wisdom appears to have deserted him on this occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would urge honourable members to pass the Andrews bill as soon as possible so that we ensure that people in the Northern Territory will not be able to continue to die unnecessarily pursuant to its legislation. I would agree that uniform national laws are desirable, but I believe the way to reinstate uniform national laws concerning euthanasia is to pass the Andrews bill. That will bring the law in the Northern Territory back into line with the laws currently existing in the states and other territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the amendment moved by the right honourable member for New England, he suggests that we should have a national approach to this. Like other members supporting the Andrews bill, I would be the first to agree that we should have uniform laws. The way to reinstate uniform laws is to carry the Andrews bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the right honourable member for New England can think of some constitutional head of power which will enable this parliament to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8024"> legislate for uniform laws in another way and which will prevent the states and other territories from introducing legislation to support euthanasia in the future, I would certainly vote for that. But I do not believe there is any constitutional head of power which will enable this parliament to do that. In that situation, I believe it is important to pass this law now. If we pass this law now, it is obvious that euthanasia will be outlawed in the Northern Territory&mdash;the way it is in other parts of the country. This amendment which we are debating is a red herring. It is a last ditch effort to prevent the legislation passing through this parliament and going off to the Senate. It is, I believe, an attempt to sweep the whole issue once again under the carpet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an expectation in the Australian community that, as a parliament, we will have the intestinal fortitude to confront this issue. The people of Australia are waiting for us to make a decision, and I hope that the parliament will reject any further delaying tactics. I would urge all of my colleagues, both in government and in opposition, to support the Andrews bill because I believe that the passage of this legislation as soon as possible is essential.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to rise to support the amendment put forward by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). In doing so, I would like to recognise the point made by the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) when she said that this should not be an opportunity to redebate the issue of euthanasia as we have already done so in the Main Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to take the opportunity to apologise to the people of the Northern Territory for the treatment they must feel they have been getting throughout this debate from the federal parliament. They must hardly consider it to be treatment equal to that offered to other Australian citizens who have the benefit of finding themselves born in, or being fortunate enough to find employment in, that first&hyphen;class creation of the federal system&mdash;a state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) said in this House earlier in this debate that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> states do not have rights; they are geographical constructs. The member for O'Connor was absolutely correct. It is citizens who live in states and territories who have rights. Those Australians who live in the Northern Territory or, indeed, the Australian Capital Territory must be feeling that their federal parliament somehow sees their right to elect a parliament and to have that parliament act on their behalf as being worth less than the same right of someone fortunate enough to live in a state. It has left me wondering if that is not what some of the members in this House actually feel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can we reject the member for New England's amendment, to have this House consider a bill on such a significant issue, from the appropriate source&mdash;from the Attorney-General, not a private member&mdash;which does not discriminate against the people of any part of Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support this amendment knowing that it will prolong the debate, a debate that I do not believe the federal parliament should be involving itself in anyway. I support this amendment knowing that it will give groups opposed to euthanasia&mdash;many of these groups are associated with church groups&mdash;more time to send their often uncharitable and unchristian letters to my office, because I believe that is the right thing to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was brought up in the Anglican Church and have therefore grown up with the values that I learned from the church. One thing that I thought the church supported strongly was the alleviation of suffering throughout the community. Why then are we telling the members of the Northern Territory, ACT and Norfolk Island communities that their suffering should not be alleviated and that we are not prepared to stop future efforts to prevent the suffering of those in the states should their governments introduce and pass such a compassionate bill as that passed by the Northern Territory parliament? I therefore commend to the House the right honourable member for New England's amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief, but I want to pick up the rhetorical question the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) raised and the response of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8025"> the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), as well as a couple of other brief matters. The member for Hindmarsh quite properly asked the questions: do we here in this place regard ourselves as having some superior qualities to those of the members of the Northern Territory legislative assembly? Do we regard ourselves as having a conscience that is better able to determine these matters than the conscience of the people of the Northern Territory? The answer all of us would have to come to, if we were going to be honest about it, is clearly no.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Warringah's response to that was to say that we are more competent in relation to our capacity to make national decisions. We are certainly technically given the legal authority to do that, but the member for Warringah in his comment misses the point, and I suspect he knows he misses the point when he makes that statement. If we took the member for Warringah's view of the world&mdash;that the reason we should be taking this decision is that we are competent to make national laws&mdash;any sense of logic would dictate that he would then support the amendment moved by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). It is only the amendment from the right honourable member that places before the parliament a requirement to deal with this as a national issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also false for people to claim that this matter arises particularly in relation to the Northern Territory. I have heard a number of speakers say that. Have a look at the bill. The bill quite clearly applies the same restrictions to the ACT and to Norfolk Island. It does create a second class of Australian citizen. It does discriminate against certain Australians. It is not simply a question of overturning a piece of legislation in the Northern Territory. The Andrews bill seeks to set aside some Australians and their rights as opposed to other Australians. That is wrong. If the member for Warringah wishes to follow through on his desire to see the national parliament establish that national policy, he should in good conscience support the member for New England's amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The final point I wish to make addresses some comments that a couple of other mem bers have raised. Many people have referred to concerns about life being terminated without consent. I know that has weighed heavily on everybody's minds in their considerations. It does strike me as passing strange that the same people who will argue that the Andrews bill should be supported, or that this amendment should be opposed on the basis that people will have their life taken without consent, also argue that the Northern Territory legislation affects all Australians. We just heard the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) run that line, that it affects all Australians. Why does it affect all Australians? It is not because the law applies anywhere outside the Northern Territory but, he said, because people from all over the country could move there to avail themselves of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let's think about this for a minute. This is a law which is so repugnant because people's lives will be taken without consent but, at the same time, it is so popular that people from all corners of the country are going to converge on the Northern Territory to avail themselves of the law. The internal consistency of that argument, and the fact that the same people can advance both arguments in the same speech is just defying logic. I find it amazing that a number of speakers, without making the connection, have hopped up and made that comment. I have heard it again here today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not propose to use the time available to me; I know there are other speakers. But I did wish to place on the record those matters.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendment of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). I support it because the Andrews bill does not address euthanasia on a national level, as he quite rightly says. I thank the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) for the kind comments that he made about my speech in the main chamber. I felt that I did debate the legislation before us and not the issue of euthanasia nationally. As I said at that time, the passage of this bill would mean nothing if one of the states were to introduce and pass similar legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other reason that I support the amendment of the right honourable member for New <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8026"> England is that I am not convinced that the members of this House really do understand the implications of the Andrews bill. Listening to the debate on the amendment here this afternoon, I am further not convinced that that is the case. It is all very well for a number of people who proudly call themselves lawyers to stand up and talk about the strict letter of the law and the constitution, but I think we have to look a little bit further than that. When we get down to making every decision based on that, we are forgetting a lot about democracy and other people's rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 122 of the constitution is continually thrown up as the reason why this parliament can do what it is going to do. But it ignores the fact that a self&hyphen;government act was introduced by this parliament a long time after section 122 of the constitution. I do not argue that this parliament has the right to make a law that affects the Northern Territory, but when the self&hyphen;government act was passed by this parliament, this parliament quite specifically said, `You can have self&hyphen;government over all matters except four areas.' Those four areas were uranium mining, Aboriginal land rights, industrial relations and national parks&mdash;Kakadu and Uluru. At that time this parliament said to the Northern Territory, `We think you are competent now to have the right over all other matters.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would say that the majority of members of this House did not understand that when they started this debate, because I talked to a lot of them and asked them the question and they really did not understand that aspect at all. That concerns me and that is why I think the right honourable member's amendment should be passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Andrews bill actually does is retrospectively amend the 1978 self&hyphen;government act. That part has not come out. People really have not concentrated on that. We are retrospectively saying, `Back in 1978 we made a mistake. We thought we were only going to say that you couldn't have power over four things, but we actually meant five.' I think that is an incredibly dangerous and very arrogant precedent for this parliament to now make. What will it be next week? If the Northern Territory passes something else, will <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you run in and say,`We shouldn't have given you that power in 1978, either'? I think it is the key point of this whole debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) and the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) all referred to a number of matters&mdash;if the Northern Territory introduced the death penalty or allowed the purchase of military style weapons, we would be jumping up and down and saying that we will have to override that legislation. Of course we can do that under the self&hyphen;government act because when the self&hyphen;government act was introduced in 1978 there was a clause that said the federal parliament could override any law that the Northern Territory makes within a six&hyphen;month period. Of course, you would use that aspect and that would be appropriate for this parliament, because it is in the self&hyphen;government act, which came after the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what we are doing here is saying that we forgot to use that last year, or maybe this parliament decided it did not want to use it, and now we have decided that we should, so we have to revert to section 122 of the constitution. I do not think it is good enough to do it in that form. I have not heard anybody in the whole debate who was in this parliament when the original Northern Territory law was passed explain why they were not on their feet moving motions and calling on the government to utilise that six&hyphen;month clause in the self&hyphen;government act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) belatedly said this afternoon, `That's because we thought they'd override it themselves.' What a load of rubbish! What was the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), a powerbroker in the former government, doing in regard to that? Everybody knows that the government at the time was very severely lobbied about using that six&hyphen;month clause within the Northern Territory legislation, the self&hyphen;government act. The government at the time decided not to proceed. But by the same token, many members who were not part of the government could have quite easily moved a motion calling on the government to utilise that six&hyphen;month clause, and they did not. I think it is very poor. It is treating people as <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8027"> second&hyphen;class citizens to now revert to section 122. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to make that point&mdash;that, in passing the Andrews bill, we must understand that we are retrospectively saying that in 1978 we made a blue and we should not have given that power to the Northern Territory.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not intend to canvass them all. In fact, like most people I suppose, I had not intended to speak on this matter. However, I was listening to the debate, initially in here and then in my office, and in the end became so appalled by the misstatements of fact being made by various speakers that I could not stand it any longer. I simply refuse to be labelled with the views, attitudes and consequences that people who have opposed this amendment have said are the views, attitudes and consequences of supporting it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I can explain, the thing I have found most frustrating in listening to this debate&mdash;quite apart from the fact that I have had to listen to a lot of speeches again that I have already listened to when they were given in the Main Committee&mdash;is the number of people who have said over and over again that the Andrews bill, the Euthanasia Laws Bill, is a first step to a national approach. It has been asserted over and over again, to which I can only say: how and by what process? If the Andrews bill is step A, then what is step B and what is step C?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the very beginning of this bill's being mooted and introduced into the parliament, in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> all the private discussions that were happening on it, I queried the possibility of a national application of the bill. I was told that it was not possible. I am not a legal expert. I do not know whether or not that is so. But I would certainly like it properly investigated, as the amendment of the right honourable member for New England would have us do. I remind the House that we are now to vote on a motion that states:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> `the House is of the opinion that, because of the discriminatory nature of the provisions of the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996, it should not proceed to consider the measure further and calls on the Attorney&hyphen;General and Minister for Justice to have an alternative bill prepared and presented to the House in a form which does not discriminate against the people of any part of Australia and which would enable Members to vote according to their views on the issue of euthanasia on the basis of a possible uniform, national approach to the issue' ".</PARA>
<PARA>I listened to the right honourable member for New England when he spoke in the Main Committee. He spoke with a great deal of passion and conviction on, firstly, how offended he was by the notion that we would legislate in such a discriminatory way and say certain things about certain Australians, and then walk away from what might apply to the rest of Australia. He was equally passionate in his opposition to euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been offended on his behalf at the number of people here today who have said this is a ploy. It is no sort of ploy. They could not have listened to his speech; they certainly have not read it and pondered on it. I read it again after the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> was printed and I found a classic contribution to this debate&mdash;because it is the classic dilemma that many members are in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I digress for one instant to take up, not euthanasia, but some of the things that have been said today. It has really puzzled me how impassioned some people have been in their opposition to this amendment. I referred to one line of argument which nobody has attempted to develop, but I regret to say&mdash;and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will not show this&mdash;that a couple of members seemed to think that the louder they said it, the more convincing they became. The louder people talk, the more I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8028"> doubt that they really have much substance. But that is by the way&mdash;you can read the speeches and decide that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A parallel has been given with the gun legislation. Let us just get a couple of facts on the record. There was a national meeting of the Commonwealth and state police ministers.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People have been saying, `What if a territory or state now broke that agreement?' There would be a national pressure not to do so.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over and over again we have heard about the so&hyphen;called Tasmanian bill. It was not a Tasmanian bill. It was a bill prompted because of certain things said and alleged in Tasmania, but it has a totally national application. When I saw that privacy bill, or whatever it was called, I actually queried it with a couple of legal experts because I thought it had a potential application significantly wider than the issue of homosexuality. The then Goss Labor government had not long before enacted some legislation on prostitution and I wondered whether this Commonwealth bill might not override the Queensland laws on prostitution. That is still a moot point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the bill passed through this parliament and became an act, the state government sought advice and the issue was left up in the air. The simple fact is that no&hyphen;one in Queensland has yet challenged the validity of the state act on prostitution, under that Commonwealth act. The Commonwealth act would, I assume, override because it came under a head of power that the Commonwealth has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Commonwealth has a head of power on euthanasia, it should use it&mdash;or somebody should bring in a private member's bill that uses it. If, for example, this amendment of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> right honourable member for New England was carried and the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) reported back that there really is not a head of power, that there is no way for the Commonwealth to legislate to include the states, then the obvious step for the Commonwealth to take&mdash;or a private member&mdash;would be a referendum bill. Make it a national issue. Put forward a referendum bill to give the Commonwealth exclusive right on laws on euthanasia, life and death&mdash;or whatever you wanted to call it. But, in the end, you would have to go to the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That brings me to what I thought was a bit of a sad contribution by the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith). I would never patronise a new member but a number of new members have got up here and told us what is black and what is white, that this or that has never happened, when in fact the subjects so mentioned have been the business of this national parliament&mdash;but prior to their membership of it and they either have forgotten or were unaware of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dickson used a parallel of the powers of the states over local government. He actually used the words, as I wrote them down, `No&hyphen;one has ever complained about it'. Of course local government has complained bitterly about it. In 1988, the then government introduced a referendum to get local government put into the federal constitution. The people voted and the referendum was defeated. So local government objected, it complained and the people decided. That is the process.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Mrs SULLIVAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was defeated, essentially, because the people did not like the proposal. I actually thought that the local government proposal was unexceptional and I abstained from voting on it when we voted in the House of Representatives, and I did not campaign against it. It was linked with three other proposals that, basically, people voted four `noes' to. I thought it was a bit of a pity. But the point is the people decided and that was the verdict&mdash;on whether there should be a national role, or some independence, for local government. And that is the way you must go. Whether you like that result or not, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8029"> in the end you have to trust the judgment of the people. Just as sometimes we members do not like losing elections, we nevertheless have to be prepared to trust the judgment of the people and go to election. As I said, that was a bit sad, and there were others like it so I probably should not be too hard on the member for Dickson.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I do have to take exception, on behalf of the right honourable member for New England, to the statement by the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) that the right honourable member for New England was actually saying that this is too hard for the national parliament. He is not saying that at all. He is saying, `Let's be fair to the Northern Territory. Let's do what everybody says we are doing and make it a national act, an overtly national act. Do it more honestly.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did my own analysis of that aspect in my speech in the Main Committee. I am not going to repeat everything I said there about this Sydney attitude that somehow or other the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly is inferior to the national parliament. I know that this comment will sink into a black hole, but members can look at my speech if they really want to see the analysis. Not every member would be aware that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> has been running editorials saying that the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly's view on anything is inferior because it has not existed for very long. I am just waiting for the editorial that says that the New South Wales parliament ought to have the power to override the Commonwealth parliament because New South Wales has had a parliament longer than we have had one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What nonsense! As if the people in the Northern Territory who vote and the people getting elected to parliament there are any less competent than we are. I think that is really offensive when it comes from new members of parliament, people who have been here barely the blink of an eyelid, talking about people who have been members of parliament in the Northern Territory for maybe 20&hyphen;odd years&mdash;as though their knowledge of what they are doing is inferior because of the age of the building they occupy to carry out their parliamentary duties.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge the sincerity with which the right honourable member for New England brought this in&mdash;without, so far as I am aware, any consultation with anyone. This has been a spontaneous debate. I was not going to participate, as I am sure a number of others who have participated were not going to. However, I have had the experience already, in the time of this bill being before the parliament, of having my actions and my views grotesquely misrepresented in my own electorate. I felt a need, in view of the sorts of things that were being said by the opponents to this amendment, to make sure that my views were on the record. I will defend my views within my own electorate on the basis of the facts.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion moved by the Leader of the House, the member for Flinders (Mr Reith), and I oppose the amendment moved by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). I propose to speak very briefly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Leader of the House indicated that, so far as he was concerned, we were now dealing with a procedural question as a matter of conscience, I was both pleased and bemused. What today's events have shown to all of us eagerly waiting to vote and determine the outcome of the substance of the Euthanasia Laws Bill is the absolute and complete folly of the Leader of the House and the government foisting upon members of this House a party vote on procedural matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has been significantly illuminated today because most speakers have taken the opportunity of re&hyphen;running in this place the speeches or the sentiments they expressed in the Main Committee. If we had had this debate in this House properly, leading the national debate as we ought to have, then this procedural debate today may not have been required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I oppose the amendment moved by the right honourable member for New England on the same basis&mdash;conscience and attitude&mdash;that I support the bill presented to the parliament by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), and for the same reasons of conscience, attitude and approach that I propose <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8030"> to support the amendments circulated by the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth). It is for the same reasons that I propose to oppose the foreshadowed amendment to be moved to the second reading by the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) that I oppose the amendment to the Leader of the House's motion by the right honourable member for New England.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two aspects to this bill and to this debate which the parliament is required to seize: first, the question of the capacity of this parliament to override a territory law; and, second, the correctness or otherwise of that. There is no question that we have the capacity to do it. My attitude in these matters is quite simple and straightforward. Where there is a Commonwealth head of power, if the parliament determines, use it. If you have the right and the capacity and you are entitled to exercise it, if the parliament determines that judgment ought to be exercised to override the law of a territory, then so be it, do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That goes to the second threshold question of the substance of this bill, which is the question of euthanasia itself. On that aspect, my attitude, the dictates of my conscience and why I propose to support the bill, is that I believe that in a compassionate society the state ought not to sanction death, that morally, ethically and socially a community is legally entitled and should be entitled to do whatever it can to alleviate the pain, distress and suffering of the dying. But that is qualitatively different from having the intention of seeking to put them to death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a qualitative difference between the intellectual approach, the ethical approach, the moral approach and the legal approach of the Northern Territory legislation and the approach which we find in the bill presented to the parliament by the member for Menzies. What makes it qualitatively different is the question of intention. As I have indicated, I believe that in a compassionate society we are obviously entitled&mdash;morally, ethically, socially and legally&mdash;to do that which we can to alleviate the suffering, the distress and the pain of the dying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is, I think, reflected by some good legislation that we see at the state level, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> particularly in South Australia and Victoria. The amendments proposed to be moved by the member for Adelaide will make it absolutely clear that such a regime would be entirely appropriate in the Northern Territory. For those reasons, I oppose the amendment moved by the right honourable member for New England and support the motion moved by the Leader of the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief because I understand that the House would like to deal with this before the dinner adjournment. I must say that this has not been a re&hyphen;run of the euthanasia debate which occurred in the Main Committee, which of course went for many hours, but a number of members who have spoken on this issue had alluded to some of the same matters that they raised in speeches they made in the Main Committee. I do not propose to do that at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that I find this motion that the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) has moved rather curious. Out of respect for him, I would have to assume that his motivation is entirely transparent and expressed in the motion. I do not have any doubts about that, but I am also equally sure that a number of people who have come into this House to support this amendment have a different motivation. I can only assume, having listened to them, that it is as the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) and others have said: some sort of a desperate last&hyphen;minute ploy to prevent the private member's bill from being voted on here at this time. I can only assume that. I take the point of the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) that the right honourable member for New England does not have the opportunity to respond to some of those criticisms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, the issues are quite clear. I think the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) spelt them out. There cannot be any doubt that we have the power to do what the Andrews bill proposes. Some people have attempted to obfuscate on that issue, but in my view there is no doubt that we have the power to do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question is whether we should do it now in respect of the Northern Territory or as <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8031"> the right honourable member suggests, which is, because of an element of discrimination against the people of the Northern Territory, not do it now. And yet somebody made the, I think, very telling point during the debate that discrimination is inherent in this. If we exercise the right that we have under the constitution to act in this way, then we are going to discriminate. But we have that right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it does boil down to quite a simple question in the end about whether we want to proceed to act to prevent the Northern Territory from legislating and doing what it proposes to do. My view on that has been consistent throughout: I believe not only that we have the right to do it but that we should do it. If the right honourable member wants to extend that to some sort of further uniform legislation, then that is not prevented. The question has been asked in this debate: why not put it off? The fact is that we have laws in the Northern Territory, the only such laws in the world, people have said&mdash;all those points have been made&mdash;and in a sense there is an element of urgency about this. If we think the issue is important, if we are opposed to euthanasia, then there is every reason why we ought to vote to prevent the Northern Territory from carrying out its intentions under that law now, sooner rather than later&mdash;in fact, urgently, as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, I am rather curious about what the effect of this amendment that has been moved by the right honourable member might be, but I would be very happy, having dealt with the Andrews bill tonight, if the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams), who happens to be at the table at the moment, does go away and come back to the parliament with legislation that might extend that to other states. It would be very interesting to see how the people who have spoken so much in favour of the amendment would then vote. That would be a very interesting issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be the same sort of issue as, I think, the member for Moore (Mr Filing) raised: that those who are so strongly in favour of states rights almost invariably voted in favour of the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill, which overturned the Tasmanian law which legalises sodomy. As I recall, I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> said in my contribution in the Main Committee that it does boil down to the issue, and that is the issue of euthanasia. And if you are in favour of it, then you are going to vote against the Andrews bill&mdash;or now you have some sort of an alternative here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect that, in a sense, those who are supporting the right honourable member's amendment take the view that there might be some people who are opposed to euthanasia and who would be in favour of the Andrews bill who might just be persuaded that, because of some of the elements that the right honourable member and others have raised, they ought to take this intermediate step.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I feel very strongly that this is a debate we had to have and we have had; and now we are called upon to make a decision about the Andrews bill. I believe that we will make the right decision if we choose here and now to support that bill. Let me be on the record again: Shane Stone, the Chief Minister, and others have asked me, `What if this was New South Wales that enacted these laws? Would you then be so keen to see them overturned?' My answer to that has always been an unequivocal yes, because I believe there should be a national response; there must be a national response. The immediate problem is the law in the Northern Territory. I would be delighted at some time in the new year if we have something of a uniform approach brought before us from the government's point of view on this issue.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry to have to oppose the amendment put forward by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) because I always respect his judgment, particularly on matters associated with procedure. But in this instance I believe he is wrong. I particularly reject the concept that the parliament is implementing some kind of discrimination against the Northern Territory through the legislation that is under consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The question of whether or not the Andrews bill is a reasonable use of Commonwealth power is, to me, a very important issue. I do not believe in the concept of states rights. It is the people who have rights; governments have responsibilities. But our <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8032"> constitutional system of democracy works effectively only because we share those responsibilities. If one sphere of government seeks to extend its responsibility at the expense of others, then the very basis of our federation is put at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am one of those who stood up on the issue of the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill. I opposed that bill because I believed it was a misuse of Commonwealth power. It was based on an international treaty which was misrepresented, in my view, in the legislation, supported by dubious High Court decisions and a hopelessly flawed United Nations Human Rights Committee ruling where there were no principles of natural justice used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I felt that that was a misuse of Commonwealth power. Frankly, I also believe a bill being drafted on the basis of the amendment put by the right honourable member for New England would also be a misuse of Commonwealth power. There is little doubt that the power to make laws in relation to euthanasia was intended by our founding fathers to rest with the states. I would oppose any attempt to use a United Nations convention, some other dubious power or a human rights committee ruling or the like as the basis for Commonwealth legislation in this area, no matter how worthy the intent of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, this matter is significantly different. There is no UN treaty or human rights committee or endorsement of flawed procedures in the proposal to override the Northern Territory law. The clear facts are that the Northern Territory is not a state. It may well have ambitions to become a state, which I support, but it is not yet a state. Section 122 of the constitution states quite clearly that this parliament has the capacity to make laws for the government of any territory. There is a clear reserve power for the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I do not believe that the founding fathers put that in accidentally. I do not believe that the people of Australia voted for that when they approved the constitution without having a full appreciation of what was intended. It was always clear and intended that adminis tering the territories would be different from administering the states. State parliaments have a clear and unfettered power to make laws in relation to a whole range of issues outlined in the constitution. That power does not extend to the territories. An overriding power has been granted to the Commonwealth to overview the laws of the territories. It is therefore quite reasonable that the Commonwealth exercises its powers in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect that the founding fathers included this clause in the constitution because the territories have small populations. In this instance, the Northern Territory, which has a population equivalent to about one federal electorate, has decided this issue for all the people of Australia. It has decided it with the smallest possible majority in its chamber. It is a parliament without a house of review. That effective majority disappeared at the next by-election. I know that there was a subsequent vote, but that was more on an issue of territory rights than the substance of the euthanasia question. The barest majority, in the equivalent of only one federal electorate, is effectively deciding this important issue for the whole of Australia, should the Commonwealth walk away from the responsibilities and powers granted to it under section 122.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us make no mistake that the Northern Territory is making a decision for the whole of Australia. There are no walls around the Northern Territory. Any Australian citizen could walk across its boundaries and seek to have the law applied in their circumstances. So it is reasonable for the Commonwealth to exercise its powers under section 122 of the constitution to override this Northern Territory law. It is a proper exercise of power. To pass the motion of the right honourable member for New England would, in my view, be a misuse of federal parliamentary powers. The amendment should be defeated.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It also grieves me to have to disagree with the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), whose contributions to this House I respect immensely. Like the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), I see a great distinction between this legislation and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8033"> the Tasmanian privacy legislation. In that instance, we had an international convention being imposed through the Commonwealth on the people of Tasmania. There could be no more virulent form of usurping states rights than that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this instance, we have a different circumstance. This is a matter of Australians speaking about an Australian issue. While I do not for a moment question the right of Northern Territorians to participate in that debate, I do not think they have an overriding position whereby they should force their will on the whole of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a defining moment. You cannot talk about something such as euthanasia and say that it will be confined. Quite frankly, it will not. The law in the Northern Territory calls for a doctor, a specialist for the complaint in which the patient seeking euthanasia is suffering and a psychiatrist to assess the person's mental capacity to ask for death. Even while this debate has been going on in this parliament, there are some in the Northern Territory saying that the use of a specialist is becoming too onerous a requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That makes the very point that I made in the other chamber when discussing this issue, which is this: once something as absolute as euthanasia is approved in any part of the Commonwealth, be it at Norfolk Island, our least populated legislature, or New South Wales, which is the largest, a tone is set for the whole of Australia. From that point onwards, the boundaries will be pushed out. There is no shadow of doubt in my mind that that will be the consequences of it. This recent circumstance in the Northern Territory, where a specialist's being called in is regarded as onerous, is a reflection of what would happen once this legislation were approved. We have heard of the experience in Holland, where between one-third and one&hyphen;half of those who have been subjected to euthanasia did not die of their own free will. To me, that is horrifying and the start of a new dark age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Kevin Andrews has proposed for the Commonwealth parliament, firstly, to give some collective leadership to this nation and, secondly, to operate quite properly on section 122 of our constitution where we believe that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a law in one of the territories does not meet the standards befitting this nation. Having said that, I in no way wish to resile from my support of statehood for the Northern Territory, but this issue before us today is far too important. I think that we should, in all conscience, oppose the amendment moved by the right honourable member for New England and give our full and unfettered support to the Andrews legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose the amendment which has been moved by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and seconded by the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) that the bill not proceed and another bill be prepared. In his remarks, the right honourable member for New England said that the Euthanasia Laws Bill was not about euthanasia. One only needs to read the bill. For example, the application clause of the bill, in part, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the avoidance of doubt, the enactment of the Legislative Assembly called the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 </EMPHASIS> has no force or effect as a law of the Territory . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That act of the Northern Territory is, of course, about euthanasia. We all know that one man is dead as a result of euthanasia in the Northern Territory and we are told that there are possibly others waiting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Secondly, it has been argued that somehow the Euthanasia Laws Bill is discriminatory. The reality is that the bill is based on the constitutional democracy that we have in this country as found in the constitution of Australia. It has been pointed out by other members that the constitution clearly sets out as an express power of this parliament the right to make laws for the territories. Far from being discriminatory, the bill actually applies to all territories. Had it, as the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory complained, only applied to the Northern Territory&mdash;which is what an initial draft did&mdash;then there might be some argument for saying it is discriminatory under section 122 of the constitution. But this bill uses the full power of section 122 of the constitution, an express enactment which is quite clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been no constitutional expert that I am aware of, in all the commentary on this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8034"> matter for the last few months, who has suggested that the bill is contrary, in any way, to the powers of the Commonwealth parliament pursuant to the constitution itself. On top of that, you have a law of the Northern Territory which is, quite clearly, open to all Australians. If anything, it is discriminatory in the reverse order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Can I remind honourable members of the timing in relation to this matter. The first draft of a bill to override the Northern Territory legislation was moved and circulated by me in early July this year. That bill was provided to honourable members. I wrote to all honourable members, including the right honourable member for New England, asking if they had any comments about it and inviting any proposals. A few comments were made about the bill, the consequence of which was that the bill was redrafted. A redrafted bill was introduced in this place in September.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many weeks have passed in which there has been the opportunity, first on the initial bill and then on the second bill, to raise the sorts of issues that we have heard today. There have been many weeks to seek advice about the effect of the bill. A long time has been available to redraft the bill, if that was desired. But what happened was that I found out about the amendment proposed by the right honourable member a few minutes before the debate was brought on earlier this afternoon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> My bill represents or reflects the laws throughout Australia. There is a uniform approach. In fact, there is an internal contradiction in the proposed amendment in talking about a `possible uniform national approach'. With the notable exception of the Northern Territory, there is a uniform approach to the law throughout Australia. I believe this was pointed out quite adequately in the opinion by the Hon. Tom Hughes, which was circulated to members and tabled in this place during the second reading debate, in which he reflected on the laws throughout Australia in relation to these matters and specifically on the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill re-establishes the status quo as exists for the rest of the country, with the notable exception of the Northern Territory. It is open&mdash;as it has been for the last few <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> months&mdash;for the right honourable member or for anybody else to introduce a bill along the lines being suggested by this amendment. A bill could have been placed on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> prior to now. The bill does not even have to exist before it is placed on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. That could well have occurred up until today, but no such action has been taken. Yet this matter has a history going back to early July at the earliest. It will not happen because there is one simple problem standing in the way of what is being proposed: there is no power for the Commonwealth to do what the right honourable member for New England is proposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This bill which I have introduced was not simply concocted by myself one night. It was the subject of quite detailed, long and considerable drafting, involving a number of legal and constitutional experts, including a number of QCs. The issue of the constitutional reach of this parliament was well and truly considered by those legal and constitutional advisers. My advice is there is no such power, which is something I think the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) pointed to in her speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The right honourable member for New England says that maybe there is a power but, if there is not a power, then maybe we could take it to COAG. If COAG does not agree about it, then maybe we could take it to a referendum. In other words, there is no substance to the amendment put before the House by the right honourable member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He does not come in here with a legal or constitutional opinion to say that there can be a bill drafted along the lines which he has proposed in this amendment. He does not point to an opinion; he does not bring forward a draft. As far as I know, there has been no discussion with others&mdash;I might stand to be corrected&mdash;including with the Attorney-General (Mr Williams), who is mentioned as one who may well bring forward a bill in this regard. As I am advised, there is no Commonwealth power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8035"> The myriad of issues that have been raised can also be dealt with by a Senate committee. I am advised that, as of last week, something like 6,000 Australians have made submis sions&mdash;and those submissions are still flooding in&mdash;to the Senate committee, which has the opportunity of addressing some of the issues that have been raised in this debate today. Therefore, there will be an opportunity for Australians and for the Senate to consider those issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Another thing about the motion is that there is no date proposed for when this report back should come from the Attorney-General. There is no time frame put in place. So let honourable members have no doubt about this matter: a vote for this amendment is a vote to leave the Northern Territory lethal injections in place. That is the central issue of this amendment and what we are debating here now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> If this amendment was not so transparently obvious, if it had not been seconded by the member for Hindmarsh and supported by other members who are clearly on record as opposing the euthanasia bill, if there had been some substance to what has been proposed by the right honourable member for New England, some basis for some alternative draft to be put to the parliament, if the right honourable member for New England had come forth with a draft or even had a legal opinion that what he referred to could be done, if there had been some discussions&mdash;which have not occurred until now&mdash;right up until the last minute, then we might consider the amendment as something more than a mirage. But it is simply a mirage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you follow through with what the right honourable member for New England proposes and follow him down that track, when you get there, nothing will exist. The right honourable member for New England, I suspect, knows as well as I do that there is simply no power to introduce the uniform legislation of the nature he has proposed here. This is a shimmering temptation expressed with the considerable eloquence of my right honourable friend, but the reality is that there is no power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a simple test as to whether this amendment should be accepted, and that is: has anybody in this debate, which has lasted a considerable number of hours this afternoon, pointed in any real way to a power of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Commonwealth to enact legislation of the nature which has been proposed in the amendment? It has not been pointed to. Nobody has pointed to a power. The closest we have come was when the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) said in relation to capital punishment that there is ample power, but when challenged, as I recall by way of interjection, he actually could spell out no power, and the reality is that there is no power. That is the test which ought to be applied to the amendment moved by the right honourable member for New England. With the greatest of respect to his eloquence, his experience in this place and his learning, I urge honourable members to vote against the amendment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the debate and voting on the euthanasia bill, I spoke quite clearly and candidly about the allegations of the member for Banks (Mr Melham) about the cutbacks and the effect on funding for the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Customs Service and the National Crime Authority&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8038">cutbacks he detailed as being near $120 million over a period of up to four years. What the member for Banks did not expand on was quite simply that these cutbacks are a direct responsibility of Labor's inability to financially manage the accounts of Australia. No government enjoys cutting back funding to anything, let alone law enforcement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, when those opposite gave cutbacks, they called them efficiency dividends. This is the same doubletalk, spelt l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w law, that really does not mean anything. If there is a blame to be placed for cutbacks in our law enforcement, the blame rests fairly and squarely with the opposition&mdash;people who have never been able to manage the finances of this country, people who indeed, when we look at the crime rate, have failed to really address it over the past 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Law enforcement has benefited from the Proceeds of Crime Act. In 1992 it benefited by $235,000; in 1993, $672,000; in 1994, a massive jump to $5.2 million; and in 1995, $5.4 million. That is a lot of money&mdash;money that has been well spent, because any money spent on law enforcement is indeed well spent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we listen to what the opposition says on this bill, you would consider that taking away the money from the trust fund and putting it into consolidated revenue was abolishing this funding to the police, Customs or, indeed, the National Crime Authority in total. It is not that at all. The difference between us on this side and members on the opposite side is that we are able to look at all projects put forward by departments for funding out of consolidated revenue and look at those in conjunction with all other monetary applications placed by all departments and assess them on individual merit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only a few areas have been able to escape the financial management plans that have had to be put in place by this government&mdash;a government that is financially responsible and, as I said before, a government that, whilst it did not create the problem, has inherited and intends to address the problem by making sound financial management decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cutbacks will not create the problems as painted by those opposite. In revenue, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> since inception of the trust fund, $29.8 million has been paid in, with a mixture of $26.4 million from the Proceeds of Crime Act, $34,000 from section 243 of the Customs Act, $3.3 million from the Customs Act itself and $22,000 from the Crimes Act. As I have said, they have all gone to good projects. But we are not abandoning those projects. Simply, we are funding them out of consolidated revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we get into the drug debate, which has been a large part of the debate on this bill, by the way the member for Banks and the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) have spoken, it was as though we were abandoning that. If they had read the explanatory notes properly, they would see that $2 million&mdash;the base core funding&mdash;will still be maintained. The cutbacks are not as those opposite would have us believe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I go through and I look at the parts of this bill, I am sure it would be a wonderful dream world if we could all sit down and not have to change anything. If there were indeed, to quote the previous Prime Minister, pixies and fairies at the bottom of the garden containing the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, our problems might all be gone. But, indeed, that is not the case. The picture is not as rosy as those opposite had us believe prior to the election when they basically said that the deficit would be somewhere around $1 billion to $2 billion maximum, not the $8 billion to $10 billion that we inherited. So to continue with programs to the same level as we would like is not at all possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is one of the key points of this bill that we encourage overseas countries to cooperate with and aid Australia in investigations of crimes that come under our Commonwealth acts so that, not only do we share in the dividend of the proceeds of those crimes, but those countries do too. If there is a financial incentive for them to cooperate, it will help resolve the matter. Some of the high&hyphen;tech and superhighway crime, where it goes beyond the capabilities and technology of our current force with the funding we are able to provide at the moment, can also be addressed by other countries. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8039">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spoke before about drugs. As a family man, with three young children about to embark on infants school next year, I have been made aware of drug problems by our local media. Drugs do not hit children only when they are in the 15 to 18 year age bracket and older. Kids as young as seven and eight are using drugs in school&mdash;bringing some of their parents' drugs into the school, trying them as a bit of bravado, and succumbing to peer group pressure. It is a very sad indictment on society when we allow that to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No drugs at all is a dream. The reality is that we have to work harder and harder to reduce the amount of drugs available in society. The national drug agencies are to be commended for the work they are performing. As I have said, the level of funding they get under the national drug strategy is never enough, but how do you afford it when you have so many needy projects? At least we understand that the money supply is not a bottomless pit, something which the other side was never able to address but still never fixed all the problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the bill to the House. It is worthy; it is something that needs to happen as a matter of pure financial management. As I have said, we are not abolishing the trust fund, just removing the major balance to go into consolidated revenue so that the money can be appropriated on the merit of each department's application for funding rather than being a single fund going to those who feel they have the best cause, thereby removing the feast or famine arrangement that occurs under the present funding arrangement.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to speak on matters contained in the Proceeds of Crime Amendment Bill, matters of the utmost importance, not only to those of us here in the House but to every Australian. As previous speakers have explained, the bill consists of two parts, the first dealing with provisions that will allow Australia to pay the proceeds of crime to foreign nations that have assisted in the seizure of those proceeds, and vice versa. The opposition wholeheartedly supports that initiative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of this bill, also alluded to by previous speakers, is one which the opposition does not support and which our amendment seeks to have deleted. It is a move to stop the proceeds of crime being channelled into a designated fund with the proceeds then being put to use on valuable projects in the field of crime prevention, and so on. Instead, the government is proposing that these funds go into general consolidated revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the confiscated asset trust fund was established in 1987, some $29.8 million has been paid into it. In 1995 alone, some $5.4 million was allocated to some 10 different law enforcement projects, including funding for the Insurance and Superannuation Commission for fraud detection; also for the National Crime Authority to assist with telecommunications interceptions; and for projects conducted by the Australian Federal Police, the ASC, and the Australian Institute of Criminology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the current legislation, half of the money allocated from the trust fund must go towards drug education and rehabilitation programs. Funds allocated for these purposes have been used for a variety of activities and initiatives, including funding for educational campaigns about the dangers of amphetamine usage; studies on the effects of both cannabis and ecstasy; and the development of training programs for those who deal with drug users.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The establishment of the confiscated assets trust fund and the allocation of these funds to worthy projects was a small but necessary part of the ongoing fight against crime, a fight which escalates every day and a fight from which we must never take a backward step. For instance, we must never fail to address the very serious issue of the importation of drugs into this country, and also the need for the federal government to redouble its efforts to stamp out what might be best described as this life threatening malaise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pressures on our young people these days, as alluded to by the previous speaker, the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin), are enormous. They are expected to meet the same standards of success as their parents and previous generations. They have as role models characters from the fictitious world of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8040"> television and other forms of mass media, reaching heights and achieving a way of life that they can never hope to emulate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know only too well the ultimate consequences of the disillusionment and feelings of uselessness that too many youngsters face in their lives. These consequences are played out daily in the laneways and other haunts of the drug addicts and street kids. Although in many cases this is taking place under our very noses, the average person becomes aware of the plight of these poor unfortunates only when they read about it as part of the latest spate of drug deaths, overdoses and suicides in the newspaper or see it in an expose contained in some current affairs program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know well that the level of drug addiction continues to be a festering sore in our society. We know that we have an appallingly high number of youth suicides and that many of them are drug related. Therefore, the government and the community need to combine to do everything they can to deal with this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The high rate of youth unemployment must be tackled. To date, the government has done little to support young people who are struggling to find a job and, of course, with most forecasts showing little hope of any improvement in the unemployment rate, many of those same unfortunates face a particularly bleak future. These are all too often the conditions that lead to drug use and the resultant destruction of young lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also concerned that at a time when our community is highly vulnerable to the ravages of drug usage and addiction our Customs Service has never been in a worse position to deal with the ever increasing flow of drugs into our country. In spite of the increased flow of cargo and personnel into Australia over the last five years, the Customs Service has lost around 20 per cent of its staff. It faces a further cut of some $79 million to its budget over the forthcoming five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There may be some short&hyphen;term financial gains to be made under this policy in the form of reduced staff costs, but in the long term the reduced capacity of the Customs Service to detect drug importation will weigh heavily on society and particularly heavily on our young. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> These circumstances and a concomitant diminution of funding for law enforcement and crime prevention, which may result from the scrapping of the fund that was proposed in this legislation, are cause for genuine concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my constituents, a man I now know having met him at one of my recent mobile offices, Mr Terry Cole from Edithvale, has formally written to me requesting that I ask the following questions of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on the pressing issue of fighting drug importation and drug use. Mr Cole poses the following questions: do the Prime Minister and his government accept that it is their responsibility to the Australian people to prevent the supply of illegal drugs from entering the country and causing death and corruption? Will the Prime Minister take a high profile leadership role with the states to coordinate national uniform laws and a strategy to prevent the inflow of drugs into the country in a similar way as was adopted for the gun law reform?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Cole also asks: will the Prime Minister provide the physical and financial resources to ensure the laws of Australia are enforced with respect to drug importation? Will the Howard government use the full weight of the air force and navy to patrol our coastline and safeguard it from the illegal importation of drugs? Will the Howard government provide sufficient financial resources to improve the Customs Service so that drug importation is stopped?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, Mr Cole poses the question: will the Prime Minister initiate an annual debate in federal parliament on the question of illegal drug importation and use so this life and death matter can be kept before the Australian people with the genuine importance status it deserves? I myself have in fact written formally to the Prime Minister, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I would be similarly grateful if you could reinforce the need for an answer to be put on the public record to these questions so that I may provide a formal response to Mr Cole and the Australian public at large so they have some clearer understanding of where the government is headed on this issue.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8041">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude my remarks by saying that I am somewhat disappointed that, by rejecting the opposition's amendment and abolishing the confiscated assets trust fund, the government is endangering some of the funding and projects which play a crucial role in the fight against crime. I have no doubt at all that members in this place recognise the pivotal obligation placed on us by the Australian people, many of whom share the views of Mr Cole, to provide leadership in this issue and that everything possible is done to ensure that our children can grow up in a crime and drug free society. I, therefore, urge the government to rethink its proposals and accept the opposition's amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The spiralling levels of criminal activity in society are an absolute scourge on society and more and more young people have ended up on that incredibly dangerous path to destruction by being involved with the drug culture. The Proceeds of Crime Amendment Bill is in two parts, as has been mentioned already. In addressing the issues of criminal activity generally, I wish to broaden the debate a little.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I start by referring to the fact that the bill seeks to foster cooperation between countries, in particular providing the motivation to foreign countries to assist in the recovery of assets in their jurisdiction which are subject to forfeiture under Australian legislation. It also seeks to provide that moneys seized under the Proceeds of Crime Act are paid into consolidated revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated, the drug problem is a very serious one. I intend to focus particularly on it because I think it is necessary to draw on one's experience here, and I have to say that my experience with the criminal courts in legal practice was fairly extensive. A great percentage of those who were involved in what you could call the criminal line were young people who, unfortunately, started out by smoking joints.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have never met a young person who has ended up a drug addict, a wrecked individual, who started on heroin. They always started on marijuana. I think it is important for the House to remember this, because there are a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lot of very interesting theories around about marijuana, particularly those which say, `It's a recreational drug which does no harm. It's harmless and victimless. It really is something that should now be decriminalised, be accepted in society, and so forth.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;and I need to re-emphasise this&mdash;that, of all the people whom I acted for who had serious drug offences that were being considered by the court, not one ever started on hard drugs. They all started on marijuana and, from there, they went on the inevitable downward spiral.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concomitant with the use of drugs and the increasing addiction to hard drugs on that spiral is the combination of offences that arise in order to feed that habit. It is impossible to feed these habits on the unemployment benefit. It is impossible to feed the habits on a basic job. So the insatiable desire to have an addiction satisfied invariably  leads to extra criminal activities. That is the scourge. The scourge starts small but ends big and invariably, along the way, a lot of innocent people are hurt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is drugs that addle the brain. We know that. The prolonged use of marijuana befuddles the intellect. Do not ever let the opposite be said. I do not care what the figures say. I have acted for many people who have smoked marijuana for years, and they are slow&mdash;slow of thought and slow of action. Those who are heavily addicted to marijuana cannot really keep a job. It is just not possible. The brain cells are not just temporarily dulled; they are destroyed. So I really want to give the lie to that theory from practical experience of what I have seen. Many addicts have said to me, in a very regretful way, that they wish they had never had their first joint because, `Look at me now.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to realise what the use of drugs does along the way&mdash;particularly in relation to the property crimes that can occur and the effect that has on the whole of society. I, unfortunately, have had plenty of evidence of that in my electorate, with a very high level of breaking and entering. Indeed, recent figures suggest that, in the metropolitan north area of Brisbane&mdash;which basically encompasses my electorate&mdash;the number of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8042"> breaking and entering crimes reported in 1994-95 was 7,198, and in 1995-96, it was 7,870.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The clean&hyphen;up rate of those particular offences is 12 per cent. I am not making any criticism of the police in relation to that. It is a difficult crime to detect and a difficult crime to obtain convictions on. What that figure does show is the level of harm that it occasions in the community. More often than not, as I have said, those responsible for perpetrating these sorts of offences are trying to feed a drug habit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to realise that the people who are running these drug operations are not the people out there selling. I am sure enforcement authorities realise that, but it is important for the House and the people of Australia to realise that you do not see people in suits selling heroin on the streets. They need the underlings to do it, and those underlings are the people out there who are frequently unemployed, without a home to live in, without a job, without a sense of self-worth and without parents who love them. Consequently, they finish up in the situation where they become the people who do the distribution. The real dirty work is done by the big time operators who, unfortunately, rarely seem to get caught.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those big time operators cannot exist without those people down there&mdash;the underlings&mdash;and I think it is important to realise that. If we are going to attempt to address the problem, we have to realise that it is a bottom end problem rather than a top end one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned earlier some of the property offences, and breaking and entering was one. Unfortunately, figures show that that crime has increased over the past year by something like 18 per cent. In these particular offences, the offenders are generally aged between 15 and 19. Again, that is a very sad statistic. Usually they are males, with about eight per cent being females. So the preponderance of evidence suggests that those involved in this activity are very young people, many of whom are juveniles&mdash;some younger than that, I might add&mdash;and male. What can be done about it?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In looking at the problem of the distribution of the drugs that have frequently come in here from overseas, there is no doubt that if we were able to address the old adage, `Where there are idle hands, there is mischief that can be done' by looking very carefully at programs that may assist young people at the grassroots, we would go some way to addressing the problem overall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) is very supportive of the CDEP scheme. I have seen how well that scheme worked at Cherbourg where, unfortunately, the level of offending has been very high. I can tell you this: when that scheme has been in operation, I have never seen a more satisfied group of young Aboriginal people than those working on that scheme, because they have got something to do. They are learning skills, building fences and doing other things. That program is able in a sense to imbue in those people a work ethic which addresses the offending behaviour. I am not trying to single out Cherbourg as being an area where Aboriginal people offend any more than anywhere else, but it has to be recognised that over the years there has been little work of a productive or real nature done in that area. Figures suggesting that there had been a significant downturn in property offences were quite clearly related to the fact that so many of these young people were taking part in this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question really is: if it is good enough for Aboriginal people in those communities, why don't we look at a similar scheme for young people in the general and wider community? While initially there might be some reaction such as, `This sounds a bit like civil conscription,' it is a problem that we cannot underestimate. People have had their homes violated by those who commit these break&hyphen;ins. It is something that will touch most people during their lifetimes. The figures suggest that at some stage of your life somebody is going to break into your home and disturb or interfere with your property. So it is a problem of quite epidemic proportions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do we really address the problem by having more police and spending more taxpayers' money? Certainly we do need more police; I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8043"> am not saying that we do not. But we are top ending the problem all the time instead of bottom ending the problem. We need to start looking at the bottom end of the problem, at the large scale movement and distribution of drugs from overseas and where it is happening on the street. We need to try to address the offending behaviour, and to do so without pussyfooting around.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very critical of some of the juvenile justice legislation that has been passed in recent years in Queensland. I have no difficulty at all with the issue of protecting a young person who commits an offence that is an aberration, perhaps even a person who slips into committing a second offence. But to have legislation that protects the  identity of repetitive offenders is absurd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community has got to be realistic about this matter. As one of the local police officers said to me recently, the moment a group of young people that had been offending in a particular area were incarcerated, the figures went down. As soon as they were released, the figures went back up. Yet under the then Juvenile Justice Act, if the police officer revealed to anybody in the street that they had to be careful with that group of people because they were known offenders, he would be committing an offence. We cannot have those sorts of silly ideas about how we should deal with this problem. We have to have a firm hand, and at the same time a kind and directing hand, in trying to solve the problem for these people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If these people were working they would not have the time to spend on these nefarious activities. One only has to look at the amount of graffiti in Canberra. If the people responsible for this graffiti were working, how could they go around half the night spraying things? It is as simple as that. You could not do it. The problem gets back to addressing what we can do about having these young people in work. If we can organise a CDEP scheme for young Aboriginals in Cherbourg, why can't we start looking very seriously at providing schemes&mdash;albeit on a modest scale&mdash;to give these people work which, in turn, will address the offending behaviour.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate, six young fellows, who were really on the edge, who nobody really wanted to touch, came along to the Bunya Bunya youth training program. The program also takes women, but this particular group involved six young men, all of whom had difficulties in their home life and had been involved in activity which was less than socially acceptable. They did a 12&hyphen;week course which trained them in rural skills such as horse riding, roping, fencing, tractor work, the use of a chainsaw and camping. In a short time these young men were given some skills they could take somewhere and utilise. I am pleased to say that all six young men got jobs out in the far flung areas of Australia. They have all been placed in a job. I am delighted to say that the outcome of that scheme has been a very great success. So it can be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is those groups of people that we must not forget about in addressing this overall problem, which is bound up with the level of drugs that have come into the community and that this bill is trying to address on a wider scale. We must turn our attention to the bottom end of the problem where the young people are; we must address the availability of drugs on the street and their distribution. That must be done by giving young people some hope for the future, particularly through employment and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that many of these people need to be given that start. They also need to be treated with firmness. Some of the trainers have done a great job with young people&mdash;some of them are particularly hard men themselves and have perhaps come up through the school of hard knocks. When they train these young people, while it is difficult at first, generally speaking, they are able to direct them along the appropriate path. In the case of the program I mentioned, there was a really great outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To sum up, I support the bill. I am mindful of the criticisms that have been made by the opposition in relation to funding. There have been a number of responses to that criticism in relation to the spending aspect. I do not wish to turn to those. All I wish to say is that the bill is a good first step in the direction that should be taken in this area. Overall, I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8044"> would like to think that we will address the particular problems by getting to the source. Frequently, the source is those groups of young people who have got nothing to do and who unfortunately turn their attention to things that lead to the sort of horror and interference that can occur. People come home from work to find their houses broken into and their property stolen. Frequently, goods with sentimental value have been removed&mdash;a lifetime's collection either destroyed or taken away. That, in itself, builds up enormous resentment and calls for greater police power. Perhaps if we address the problem at its source, we can solve it. I oppose the amendment moved by the honourable member for Banks. I support the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (Dobell)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(8.40 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak briefly during the second reading debate on the Proceeds of Crime Amendment Bill 1996. I agree wholeheartedly with the comments made by the member who led for the opposition in this debate, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), who spoke in quite some detail about the reasons why the opposition is very supportive of the first part of the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We support those parts of the bill that seek to ensure that Australia pays out from some of the proceeds of crime that we collect in this country to other nations which have assisted us in the seizure of those assets. At the same time, amendments which the opposition supports will allow Australia to receive some of the proceeds of crime which are seized by the police forces in other nations, for which the Australian authorities have assisted in some way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to concentrate on the elements of the bill with which the opposition has some problems. I begin by saying that the honourable member for Banks has proposed detailed amendments which go to the nub of our reasons for having concerns about the bill. When the former Labor government introduced this legislation, the intention in the original bill was that if people were involved in serious crimes, such as those mentioned by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith), the financial and monetary benefit that they obtained from <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those crimes would go back into the community. It would not just go into consolidated revenue. Half of the money would be used to help to improve the work carried out by our police forces and the other half would go back into drug education programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the amendments contained in the second part of this bill undermine that very worthy intention of the parliament and, I would have expected, perhaps even the secret hopes and desires of government members. The first we learnt about this was during the Senate estimates when, in the discussion on funding for public health programs provided under the Department of Health and Family Services, a question was asked of Ms Furler, one of the officers from the Department of Health and Family Services. She was asked about funding which had previously been provided for drug education programs out of the proceeds of crime which had been confiscated. Ms Furler said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The funding that was available to this portfolio as a result of the confiscated assets transfer fund will no longer be available after this financial year due to a decision made in the budget process.</PARA>
<PARA>She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been returned to consolidated revenue funds. It is not a decision which was part of this portfolio's responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA>So it is quite clear that Ms Furler is fingering the Expenditure Review Committee and senior government members who have apparently decided that these funds will in future go back into consolidated revenue rather than go towards those two very worthy purposes&mdash;giving extra money to police forces and providing money for drug education programs. That is the element which the opposition opposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You might be interested, Mr Deputy Speaker, in some of the drug education programs that have been funded by these measures in the past. They have included national projects on drug education aimed at children in school and also community based initiatives aimed at young people who are not in school. Confiscated funds from the proceeds of crime have been used to fund the second phase of the famous `Speed catches up with you' campaign against amphetamine abuse. They <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8045"> have also been used to fund research into the health effects of cannabis, a study of the health effects of ecstasy and the national initiatives in drug education program, which has been used to train teachers and parents in drug education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a real tragedy that this funding has been lost and that these valuable programs have now been put at risk. The money has been diverted away from drug education and the fight against crime into the Treasurer's consolidated revenue fund. You might be interested, Mr Deputy Speaker, in some of the other projects that have also lost their funding as a result of the government's proposed amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995, $450,000 was provided to enhance the Insurance and Superannuation Commission's fraud detection system. Money went to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to improve their movement alert system, which of course seeks to detect the movements of undesirable persons around Australia. There was also money for the National Crime Authority to assist with its telecommunications intercept capabilities, and others, including the Australian Federal Police and other police forces, have benefited from the funding through the proceeds of crime which were confiscated under this legislation in the past. Unfortunately, those drug education programs and those police forces will no longer be getting the funding which, we would have hoped, everyone in this House could have supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These cuts to public health funding have already led the government to cancel a number of important public health initiatives which were announced in 1995. The Howard government has cancelled additional money for the street slamming youth targeted public health program which has used very amusing programs and innovative initiatives such as the rock eisteddfod. It has also meant that funding for an extra $2 million per annum for the illicit drugs campaign and $1&half; million for the health of young Australians program has also been cancelled by decisions of this government. Perhaps it highlights the great gulf between the government's talk about public health and the actions that they have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> taken, or the funding that they have failed to provide those worthy programs&mdash;an important point we would like to make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We welcome the fact that the amendments in the first part of the bill seek to ensure that Australia works more closely with our international partners in confiscating proceeds of crime, especially those involved in importing and distributing drugs. We also want to put on record our great concern about the second part of this bill which seeks to discontinue very worthy efforts in funding drug education programs and making sure that our law enforcement agencies have the funding that they need to catch the people involved in drug importation and distribution. For those reasons, the opposition will be arguing very strongly for the amendments which have been moved by the honourable member for Banks.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Proceeds of Crime Amendment Bill has been designed to provide a more rational and flexible approach to the distribution of the proceeds of crime. It is also designed to assist in recovering assets from overseas when in the past these have been unrecoverable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first part of this bill concerns the distribution of the confiscated assets trust fund&mdash;the bucket, if you like, into which confiscated proceeds of crime are poured. Out of that bucket the government has to make a number of payments for statutory reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These include: a prescribed annual management fee; payments under the equitable sharing program to the states and territories where the Commonwealth has been able to recover proceeds because of the significant contribution of a state or territory law enforcement agency; payments to a government business enterprise where recovered proceeds relate to certain offences that caused financial loss to that enterprise; payments which satisfy the Commonwealth's obligations with respect to registered orders of foreign countries; payments to states and territories of money which has been paid to the Commonwealth on behalf of the states by a foreign country relating to mutual assistance in criminal matters; and of course payments by way of restitution to innocent third parties or where <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8046"> quashing of a conviction causes discharge of the forfeiture order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The balance of funds left in the confiscated assets trust fund is then split between law enforcement agencies and drug rehabilitation and drug education programs. In the past these have included: the Insurance and Superannuation Commission fraud detection system; the department of immigration's movement alert system; a public education and awareness program on amphetamines; a general resource document on the health effects of cannabis; and a variety of other projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill proposes that the funds that were previously split between these programs now be transferred into the consolidated revenue fund. Why then, you may ask, is the government cutting funding to law enforcement and health programs? This government fully understands the benefits of these programs. However, there are any number of worthwhile programs in all departments that deserve a chance to be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other departments have to fight to get these programs up and running. They set out their expenditure priorities in accordance with the budget appropriations and submit them for usual scrutiny. These programs then compete for that very elusive budget dollar and, if selected, are selected because they are worthwhile programs. No other department has the luxury of guaranteed funds earmarked for special programs above and beyond their allocated budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this government is seeking is for law enforcement agencies to set out their priorities and have them subjected to the usual scrutiny. Under the present system priorities were being distorted due to the top&hyphen;up effect of using recovered proceeds to further fund programs. This is not to say that these programs were not worth while. Far from it. Many of the programs funded in this way have served a tremendous purpose. Unfortunately, the system worked a bit like a lottery in reverse. It was either famine or feast for many of the programs. If the agency had a good year and proceeds from crime were up, the agency would get a windfall and could launch any number of programs.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happens the following year when proceeds are down? The agency has this great program up and running, it is just about to bear fruit but the funds dry up because the proceeds the following year have not been as great. If the program had been set up in the standard manner, with the agency applying through the usual budgetary process, the funds would be available to carry the program through to its completion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation with the national drug strategy funding is slightly different. The transfer of the confiscated assets trust fund money to the consolidated revenue fund will not have a great effect on the national drug strategy funding. The drug strategy's base funding of $2 million is not affected by the measures proposed in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need not be scared by the opposition's opposition to this bill. The Department of Health and Family Services' national drug strategy program receives an annual appropriation of $2 million regardless of the level of funds available in the confiscated assets trust fund. Because the department of health has already received $2 million through appropriation, all of the confiscated assets trust fund moneys paid to the department of health were then transferred to the consolidated revenue fund. The first $2 million of the confiscated assets trust fund money would remain in the consolidated revenue fund to offset the $2 million already appropriated while any surplus funds were appropriated at additional estimates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only effect this bill will have on that arrangement is that the national drug strategy may have in the past received slightly more than the appropriated $2 million. However, I again point out that the annual appropriation of $2 million to the national drug strategy is not affected by the transfer of the confiscated assets trust fund money to the consolidated revenue fund. Other health and drug programs previously funded by the confiscated assets trust fund will now be subjected to the same scrutiny of programs of other departments. As with the law enforcement agencies, the government believes the preferred way to fund these drug programs is through the budget in line with the priorities of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8047"> Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now that I have dealt with the funding issue, let me move on to the main provision of the bill&mdash;the sharing of proceeds with foreign countries. This bill will allow the Attorney-General to authorise a payment from the consolidated assets trust fund to a foreign country where that country has made a significant contribution to the recovery of proceeds of crime against a Commonwealth law. That is quite a mouthful. Quite simply put, it means that if evidence relating to one of our criminals is held overseas, particularly in a country with which Australia does not have an existing treaty or mutual assistance agreement, the Attorney-General will be able to offer financial reward to that country's government for assistance in bringing that person to justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The international equitable sharing scheme will, in essence, be similar to the current domestic equitable sharing scheme. This scheme was originally set in place in 1989 in response to the Williams and Stewart royal commissions. It was stressed at the time that there was a great need for cooperation between the Commonwealth and state law enforcement agencies in their struggle against organised crime. I guess it was felt that if crime could be organised why couldn't the crime fighters?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The program itself is quite simple. If a state or territory agency, such as its police force, contributes to an investigation which leads to a conviction, the Commonwealth shares part of the proceeds forfeited with the state or territory. The amount given is contingent on the degree or importance of assistance given by the state or territory. The amount paid is determined by the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The equitable sharing program has fostered improved cooperation between various law enforcement agencies across the country. It also ensures that the proceeds of crime are seized as quickly as possible to deprive the offenders. I would point out that it is not only the proceeds of crime itself that are seized but also the instruments used by the criminals to commit the crime.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendment would extend this scheme to foreign countries. Extending the sharing arrangements to foreign countries would no doubt promote Australian law enforcement strategy. It would do this by increasing the motivation for foreign countries to assist in recovering assets subject to forfeiture under Australian legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at a hypothetical situation. A drugs ring has been operating in this country for some time. Our law enforcement agencies know who is involved and who is heading the international cartel. However, because these organisations are highly organised and possibly protected by high ranking officials from their own country, our law enforcement officers cannot bring them to justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the country where these people originate does not have a formal agreement with Australia, there is little if no chance that they will help us in our endeavours. This could be for a variety of reasons. One such reason could be a lack of financial resources available to that country's law enforcement agencies to carry out the required investigations. These investigations can take some time and a considerable number of man&hyphen;hours. However, if the Australian government can offer some form of financial reward, there may be more assistance forthcoming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If these governments know that by simply assisting Australia to bring these people to justice they will get a financial reward, I am positive they would be only too happy to help. Depending on the amount seized, the return to the foreign government could be enough not only to reimburse them for work carried out on that particular case but also to help enhance their own law enforcement agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To summarise this hypothetical situation, Australia stands to benefit substantially from this arrangement for two reasons. Firstly, Australia often seeks assistance in relation to the investigation of sophisticated organised crime from other countries. This usually requires a significant contribution from other countries' law enforcement authorities and also government officials. Currently, these countries do not receive any compensation for their contribution to the investigation. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8048"> proposed amendment to the Proceeds of Crime Act will provide a much needed and long overdue incentive to those countries to embark upon investigations of major criminal activity on behalf of the Australian authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, Australia is not a major money laundering country for foreign organised crime groups. However, we do quite often assist international law enforcement agencies in investigation of these groups. As organised crime tends to favour Asian countries and countries such as the United States of America for money laundering purposes, Australia has, in the past, missed out on any confiscated proceeds. Under the proposed sharing arrangements, it is likely that there will be a net inflow of confiscated proceeds into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The international equitable sharing scheme will be quite distinct from the current mutual assistance agreements. In most cases, when Australian authorities are negotiating a mutual assistance treaty with a foreign country, the authorities generally seek to include a sharing provision. Of course, this is only done provided the provision is acceptable to the other country. Unfortunately, where there is no mutual assistance treaty in place or any similar arrangement, there is no appropriate avenue for a formal sharing agreement to be forged. In fact, some countries have no legislative mechanism in place for the forfeiture of proceeds or even to facilitate mutual assistance in criminal matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current Proceeds of Crime Act is very specific as to what can be paid into and out of the confiscated assets trust fund. In relation to proceeds from overseas, funds can be paid in `under a treaty or arrangement providing for mutual assistance in criminal matters'. The proposed legislation will allow Australia to engage in sharing in both directions. This would be without the need for a mutual assistance arrangement or treaty. Sharing could then be undertaken unilaterally at the discretion of the government and on case specific decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the domestic scene, there is a similar procedure to what has been proposed. For example, if the Attorney&hyphen;General decides that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Queensland police department's assistance contributed to about 40 per cent of the Commonwealth's recoveries, the Queensland government would be given 40 per cent of what is recovered&mdash;that is, the Commonwealth would share the proceeds with the state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that, no matter what we do in life, if there is a reward for our efforts, we will always try harder. What the government is proposing with this bill is to provide some incentive to foreign governments to try that little bit harder. And for those who already do assist unselfishly, simply through their desire to see justice done, the provisions contained in this bill will provide long overdue recognition for their efforts. It is for these reasons that I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(9.02 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of reasons why I support the initiatives contained in the government's Proceeds of Crime Amendment Bill 1996. It deals with so many real issues&mdash;issues of crime, issues behind why I helped set up the Victims of Crime Association in Queensland and issues of importance to people in my electorate. Previous speakers have handled so many of the details associated with this bill extremely well, so I will not labour their points here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, this bill will amend the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 to enable the Commonwealth to go beyond its current boundaries in recovering the proceeds of crime from foreign countries, by establishing an international sharing program. We already have domestic cooperative arrangements in place between the Commonwealth, state and territory law enforcement agencies, but we also need to enhance this to include the international arena to simply help us catch more big&hyphen;time crooks, particularly in the drug trade, and also to divest properly the proceeds of their crimes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The successful passage of this legislation will enable the Commonwealth to receive the proceeds of crime from a foreign country, irrespective of whether or not a treaty or arrangement exists in relation to mutual assistance in criminal matters. It will also <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8049"> enable the Commonwealth to share the recovered proceeds of crime with a foreign country which has provided significant assistance in the recovery of the funds. Sharing the proceeds in this way will encourage greater cooperation between Australia and other countries in fighting crime. I suppose it could be likened to a spotter's fee as well as reward for efforts made on our behalf, as the honourable member for Bowman (Mrs West) said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bottom line is: we will be significantly better off than we have been, not only in recovering more of criminals' ill&hyphen;gotten gains stashed away in other countries but also in increasing our own safety and security here in Australia. Simply put, the message is clear: crime will not pay; this government will not be soft on crime, as its predecessor was. Criminals will know they have been caught and justice will certainly be served.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as recovering more proceeds of crime from the international crime arena, this bill will achieve significant savings by transferring the net balance of the confiscated assets trust fund to the consolidated revenue fund. This will provide greater flexibility to the government. It will certainly continue to assist those affected and manipulated by crimes, particularly organised drug crimes. Those opposite have tried to paint a picture of the world coming to an end in this matter. It is quite simply not true, and I think the honourable member for Bowman put the case very well in her contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is calculated the savings to the budget as a result of this measure will be in the order of $7.246 million in 1996&hyphen;97 and $1.875 million in each of the years thereafter to the year 2000. This is improved efficiency as well as improved effectiveness. The net balance of the confiscated assets trust fund is arrived at after deducting those payments which have been made for statutory purposes, such as payments under the equitable sharing program to the states and territories where the Commonwealth has recovered proceeds because of significant assistance from a state or territory law enforcement agency. It also includes payments made by way of restitution to innocent third parties. The effect of this bill <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will be twofold, and I expect both measures to produce positive results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also provides a federal&hyphen;international arrangements version of what many of the victims of crime groups across Australia have sought for many years. I would like to broaden the debate to handle some of those matters. I do not think anybody in this place would dispute the fact it is fair enough to make criminals pay for their crimes and the hurt they have caused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Criminals make a choice to commit a crime. I know some will suggest criminals are forced into crime by social pressures, and we have seen 13 years of such claims in this country. The fact of the matter is: criminals do ultimately make the choice to commit a crime and, as a result, they must be responsible for their action. Victims of crime do not have a choice. They are not going to choose to be a victim. It seems very fair to me: if criminals are caught they must pay for their crime both in prison sentences and fines&mdash;often these are suspended and commuted in such ways as to make the penalty structures imposed by the courts a joke&mdash;but they also must pay in many other ways. They should go on paying for crime by helping the victim because the victim ends up paying for the crime for the rest of their life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not say, as others in this debate have said, the Labor government defeated on 2 March was especially soft on crime. But many people have said it already. There is certainly some basis to it, given the deteriorating social conditions in this country over the past 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My great concern is for victims of crimes especially those involving drugs, which this bill is directly addressing. I put the point simply&mdash;victims suffer for life. They suffer physical, emotional and societal scars. Victims, even those affected by crimes committed to pay for drug habits, such as break and enters, find it hard to trust their fellow man. Honourable members who talk to people in their electorates will be told, as a result of a break and enter into their home, victims have found it difficult to enter the home without all the lights being on first. They are always fearful of finding somebody on the premises.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8050">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Women say they rid themselves of all the underwear in their drawers as a result of a criminal rifling through their drawers looking for change, perhaps to buy drugs. I know of normal, very sane and rational people who have sought to buy guns in years past to try to defend themselves against crime, particularly drug related crimes. This very simple proposition can be supported: criminals get an early release out of the prison system while the victims go on suffering and do not get early relief from their part in the crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1988, I played a hand in helping to start the Victims of Crime Association in Queensland. Shari Davies and her father, Ian, were the main motivators behind this. Shari was the victim of a savage attack. She was left to die by a convicted rapist who had been released early from the Queensland prison system. This monster, Darren Osbourne, escaped Queensland authorities at the time. He went to Western Australia and killed a British tourist there in an attack similar to the one inflicted upon Shari. Osbourne is now in gaol, and I hope he never gets out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Shari and I met in 1988 when she agreed to an interview with me about how victims' families are left high and dry by the system. Essentially, the victim has been regarded in Australian legal parlance as evidence only and not as a person. The effect of the crime on the victim's family does not even count. Police officers do a valiant job to try to help victims of crime and their families, but there were no established mechanisms 10 years ago in Queensland and no help groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Victims of Crime Association in Queensland grew from this interview, much to the credit of my then boss, John Miller, who is still a highly regarded Brisbane radio journalist. John and I talked about Shari's concerns and rang the Davies's legal representatives the next day. We said we at Channel 7 would help to promote a victims of crime self-help group. John and I met further with Shari and her father, Ian, who is still the President of the Victims of Crime Association in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I pay tribute to the work of the Victims of Crime Association in Queensland. They help victims and lobby governments. They have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> brought about changes to state laws. They would like some assistance from this place in bringing about a fairer deal for victims of crime. VOCA were awfully frustrated under the `promise everything but deliver not much' Goss government in the six years from 1989 to 1995. Some changes occurred, but it was like pulling teeth. The Queensland Attorney-General in the current government, my friend and colleague the Hon. Denver Beanland, is proceeding down the right path now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ian Davies works on the board of the Corrective Services Commission in Queensland. Despite the fact he has been so badly touched by crime himself in a personal sense, Ian is very generous with his time. He helps prisoners who have committed all sorts of horrendous crimes to understand the impact of their crime on victims, and Ian and VOCA give practical assistance to victims and their families. Shari is now married and is planning a life through the natural stages, as you would expect, but she has had a horrible time over the past decade. The physical scars are still there. Because of the strong family support and the focus on helping others, her emotional wounds are healing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raise this because I believe the Commonwealth needs to strengthen the principles of this bill further to ensure criminals within Australia contribute financially to helping victims. Whilst elements of this bill are based on domestic arrangements and we are dealing with international drug matters in the main, we as a federal government need to coordinate the various states far better by revisiting some of the domestic laws relating to financial penalties imposed on criminals to help authorities meet the cost of compensating and servicing the victims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have only to look at the inconsistencies inherent throughout the system. Every state seems to have a different statute, rule or regulation regarding the role of victims in crime and the recognition of victims. Look at the maximum punishment for manslaughter out of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Laws of Australia</EMPHASIS> journal. It varies among the jurisdictions. In Queensland, the maximum punishment is life imprisonment with hard labour. This is under the Queensland criminal code. In the Northern Territory <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8051"> and South Australia, it is life imprisonment. In New South Wales, it is 25 years. In Tasmania, it is 20 years. It is 20 years in the Australian Capital Territory and Western Australia, and 15 years in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rules of this country are all over the place. The laws and penalties, and the impact on victims and the assistance offered to them are all over the place. While we are doing the right thing in looking at our international arrangements with countries we may or may not have treaties with, we have to look in our own backyard and consider we are not doing a sufficiently good job as a collection of governments in this country. States and territories need to be coordinated by the federal government, if necessary, to start bringing about some consistency in laws and the treatment of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not need a central government law to bring about such matters. We do not need to pass a bill in this House to prescribe the penalty for manslaughter or drug trafficking as such. We need the federal government to bring the states together to nut out an agreement on penalties and proceeds from crime just as we gained agreement a few months ago on uniform national gun laws. The fact we were able to coordinate all the various egos and interests in different state and territory governments to come up with some universal law on this front suggests to me we are capable of achieving great things on other fronts and not just on a government only basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Criminals know very well they can commit a crime in one state with less risk and less penalty than in another. Victims are shocked when they find out what they thought was the case in their state did not apply in another state. They find they are left a little higher and drier, depending on in which particular state they have a crime committed against them. All of this must change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While this bill goes down the correct road of addressing big ticket crime proceeds from crimes like international drug smuggling, which is a good thing, domestic crime matters cannot be allowed to continue in such an ad hoc way. As I said, if we are prepared as a federal government to restrict law-abiding gun <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> owners with uniform national gun laws, as we did some months ago, then surely all of us in this place must agree the time is now right to put all of the states together and get some uniform punishment in place for the criminals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The matters in this bill will go a long way towards making it tough on those who have committed crimes from one international country to this country. Matters in this bill will ensure we get good cooperation between other nation states which have an interest in ensuring they get some proceeds from certain crimes. This bill is all about international agreements and coordination. This is the right role of the federal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the concept of this bill needs to be extended further. I am glad the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) is in the chamber at the moment. I know he is listening to my words. I am sure we can talk about it as the next few months go by. It would be one of the better legacies of this Howard government to actually recognise decent Australians are being hurt by crime on an hourly basis. In fact, in the course of my speech, probably 10 or 15 crimes against innocent Australians have been committed. This is a frightening thought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a frightening thought to think there is such poor coordination in this country, after almost 100 years of federation, individual states maintain laws which are inconsistent with other states. I am by no means a centralist, but I think the time has come for us to sponsor, in the true spirit of federation, the best practice from each of the states into the other states. If I can help contribute to this, then people like Ian and Shari Davies and members of the Victims of Crime Association in Queensland, which I am proud to be a member of and proud to have played a small role in starting, will be able to stand up and say, `We have got the sort of federal government we want.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">VOCA may lobby the state government more often than not, but I can promise the Attorney he will get a few letters from them as well, because they see the opportunity with the change of government to bring about a fresh look at some of the inconsistencies in laws across this country not just for victims <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8052"> of crime in Queensland but for the whole of Australia. In a federal parliament, we must be prepared to make laws which benefit all Australians and which treat all Australians equally. I believe the proposition I have put forward in the course of this debate on this Proceeds of Crime Amendment Bill is worth looking at. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I rise to close the debate on the second reading of the Proceeds of Crime Amendment Bill. Members on both sides of the House have made conscientious contributions to the debate. Today, on this side of the House, we have heard from the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin), the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith), the member for Bowman (Mrs West) and the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave). I will mention the speakers from the other side in a minute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Proceeds of Crime Amendment Bill has two purposes. The first is to provide for the annual transfer of the net balance of the confiscated assets trust fund, CATF, to the consolidated revenue fund rather than having that fund divided equally between projects for law enforcement and programs for drug rehabilitation and education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second purpose of the bill is to establish an international sharing arrangement. There already exists, by virtue of provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act, an arrangement between law enforcement agencies within Australia such that, where proceeds of crime are recovered from an operation conducted jointly by different agencies, the proceeds are shared between the agencies proportionately to their contribution to the operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The international equitable sharing arrangement contemplated under the bill will authorise payments to be made to Australia by a foreign country in recognition of assistance provided by Commonwealth law enforcement agencies in a joint international operation. It will also give the Attorney-General the discretion to authorise payment to a foreign country where an agency of that foreign country has made a significant contribution to the recovery of proceeds under a Commonwealth law.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Increasingly, within Australia, law enforcement agencies are operating in cooperation with each other, given that organised crime does not respect state boundaries or any other sorts of boundaries. In addition, increasingly, Australian agencies are cooperating with overseas agencies in tackling organised crime, and in particular drug importation and money laundering. Agencies with which Australian law enforcement agencies have close cooperative arrangements include the Thai police and the Royal Hong Kong Police.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am grateful that the member for Banks (Mr Melham), the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) and the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) all supported the government's proposed international equitable sharing arrangements as set out in the bill. This arrangement is intended to promote Australian law enforcement strategy by increasing the motivation of foreign countries to assist in recovering assets in their jurisdiction which are subject to forfeiture under Australian legislation. The arrangement will authorise payment into CATF of payments made to Australia by a foreign country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will give the Attorney-General the discretion to authorise payments to a foreign country in recognition of a contribution to the recovery of proceeds under a Commonwealth law. Australia stands to benefit significantly from the arrangement, because the proposed sharing arrangement is likely to foster a net inflow of confiscated proceeds into Australia. In order to be able to encourage and promote sharing with Australia of proceeds recovered by foreign countries, Australia must be able to reciprocate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8053">  The honourable member for Banks, the honourable member for Isaacs and the honourable member for Dobell were all critical of the transfer of the net balance of the confiscated assets trust fund to the consolidated revenue fund. The government has decided to transfer that net balance each year rather than apply that balance, regardless of its amount in a given year, to the direct funding of law enforcement projects and drug rehabilitation and education programs. That is not to say that there will not be funding directed to law enforcement projects and to drug rehabilita tion and education programs. It is essential to ensure that the need for expenditure on agency programs is more rigorously considered against other expenditure priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Law enforcement agencies should set their priorities according to appropriations provided from the budget. The most effective way to fund programs to reduce the harm from consumption of illicit drugs is through budget funding. It is a matter for the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) what programs and priorities are pursued in that area and what amount of public funds should be sought for that purpose. The funding of drug programs will therefore occur in a planned and predictable way. Equally, the law enforcement agencies should bring appropriately prepared proposals for additional expenditure and have them tested in the budget process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent years the amount that has been received into CATF has been quite unpredictable. In some years the amount has been very high. In one operation there was an amount of tens of millions of dollars. In other years, very little is paid in. Distortion of the operations of law enforcement agencies will result if the focus is too much on the recovery of funds rather than on the prevention of crime and the apprehension of criminals. The proceeds of crime should be pursued, but that is just one objective of a coherent law enforcement policy and it should not be an overriding or distorting objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dobell asserted that transferring the confiscated assets trust fund to the consolidated revenue fund would cut funds to drug education programs. The national drug strategy's base funding of $2 million per annum is not affected as such by the proposal to alter the arrangements relating to the disposition of the balance of the CATF. Under earlier arrangements, all CATF funds paid to the department of health were transferred to the consolidated revenue fund. The first $2 million of these funds remained in that fund as an offset to the $2 million annual appropriation for the drug strategy, while any additional CATF receipts the department of health might have received were appropriated at additional estimates. The basis of that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> earlier arrangement was an agreement that the national drug strategy base funding be increased by $2 million and that the first $2 million that the department of health received from CATF on each distribution would be paid directly into consolidated revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1996-97 budget decision to transfer the net balance of CATF to consolidated revenue includes the share that had been provided to the department of health to fund the national drug strategy. That will affect the national drug strategy only to the extent that its share of CATF funding would have exceeded $2 million. The annual appropriation of $2 million is not affected by the transfer of CATF to the CRF as it is not dependent upon CATF funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national drug strategy was also affected by a decision taken in the 1996-97 budget to broadband all health advancement programs. Funding for the national drug strategy has now been folded into a pool which includes funding for the HIV&hyphen;AIDS program, women's health and childhood immunisation. The department of health has the flexibility to move funds between those programs so that the level of funding for the national drug strategy is now only notionally defined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In the last election, combating crime was a feature of the coalition's law and justice election policy. The government rejects any criticism that it is not concerned with combating crime or violence. Under the current budget the government has committed $9.2 million over three years to the national campaign against crime and violence. This is to be added to the amount of $3.8 million in existing programs. It demonstrates how strongly the Howard government is committed to reducing crime and violence in the community and, in addition, reducing the perception of crime and violence in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is also concerned to ensure that financial management of government revenues use best practices. The distortion of the budget process that can be achieved through appropriating unpredictable amounts to specific purposes will be eliminated by the measures effected under this bill. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA>As I said during my speech on the second reading debate, the opposition supports the thrust of the Proceeds of Crime Amendment Bill 1996 unequivocally in terms of the measures that the government has introduced into the House. The aim of the bill is entirely laudatory. However, we do disagree with the transfer of seized funds to consolidated revenue. The purpose of my amendment is to maintain the status quo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The status quo, as I said in my second reading speech, is that funds seized under the Proceeds of Crime Act are paid into the trust fund until such time as any legal proceedings in relation to those funds are determined. Where the Commonwealth is successful in proving that those funds or assets are the proceeds of crime, those funds become distributable for the purposes of the act. The opposition believes that the status quo should be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The clear message to send to the community is that, if the assets of those participating in this sort of crime are seized, they will be used in effect to directly overcome some of the things that have occurred. I think that is the best message to send to the criminals and to the community. It also assists the law enforcement officers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that, if I were a law enforcement officer, I would not be too confident with the current philosophy of this government or of the current Treasurer (Mr Costello). I would not give him anything because I do not think that I would get too much of it back in the current circumstances, given the policy of pursuing the bottom line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With that minor qualification, that is what this amendment is basically all about. I understand it is a philosophical argument. I do not want it to be taken that by moving this amendment, which we will divide and vote <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on, the opposition does not support all the other things that are in this bill. We do. We just believe it is a better signal if the proceeds of crime are earmarked and distributed as they are presently under the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We understand the uneven nature of revenue that might be raised in each financial year, but the bottom line is that if this amendment is not accepted then there will be less distributed to the law enforcement officers. I do not think that is the way to go. This was all covered in earlier debate. There is no need for me to keep the House any longer. I commend this amendment to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to not only speak to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996 but also make some comments about the history of Australia's immigration program, the race debate&mdash;if that is what it could be called&mdash;which Australia has recently had and the vacuum in which this entire issue is considered without a population policy based on the environmental carrying capacity of the continent. The principal bill proposes to effect a number of key changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, it seeks to roll the health services charge and the English education charge into one single visa application fee. It will also amend the Immigration (Education) Act 1971 and the Migration (Health Services) Charge Act 1991 and amend the power to make regulations under the Migration Act 1958, which of course will give the minister the capacity and the flexibility to cap various components of the migration program, in particular those parts of the preferential family category currently exempt from capping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will also repeal section 87 of the Migration Act 1958 to remove the legislative <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8056"> exemption to the minister's power to determine the maximum number of visas that may be granted within a financial year. It implements a legislative exemption to the Sex Discrimination Act to allow the minister to prescribe a two&hyphen;year cohabitation period in respect of applicants who apply offshore for migration on the basis of a de facto relationship. Finally, it will enable the minister to deprive a person of Australian citizenship where that citizenship was obtained as a result of migration fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, this bill provides the government with the means to deliver a planned, orderly migration program. It will allow us to deliver our 1996-97 migration program of 74,000, which includes restoration of the balance between the family and skilled streams. The bill also gives effect to our pre&hyphen;election commitment of cost recovery and reducing the cost subsidisation of migration applicants by the Australian taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill quite simply represents long overdue commonsense. The former government had allowed the family stream to grow last year by 27 per cent, the spouse category by 32 per cent and the parent category by a staggering 74 per cent. If the opposition does oppose the bill, as it intends, it will effectively prevent the government from ensuring that we have a greater proportion of migrants in the skilled category who are most able to make an economic contribution to the country and in return enjoy a life in Australia of value to them and their families. Without balance, without skilled and business migrants, we take away from them the opportunities they deserve and the wealth they assist us to create generally for the good of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a press release of 29 October this year, the opposition immigration spokesman advised us, amongst other things, that the Australian Labor Party would move to disallow the introduction of the requirement of citizenship for eligibility to sponsor a husband, wife, fiance, parent or dependent child. In the Senate it would seem that they have succeeded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What kind of nonsense is this? The government is saying that people must have publicly made a commitment to Australia by becoming <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> citizens. A big step though it may be, it is not as big as sponsoring another migrant. Where there are limited places available in the family categories, it is both necessary and fair to give priority to Australian citizens. Despite this, though, there will be limited exemptions for spouses and children in certain circumstances to overcome those situations where the changes would have unintended consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth digressing for a moment to consider the history of Australia's migration programs. During the 200 years of white settlement, Australia has relied on immigration to increase its population and industrial base. A surge of immigrant settlers came with the gold rushes in the 1850s adding half a million people to the population. A prolonged wave of immigration occurred from 1870 and lasted some 20 years. A further 300,000 settled between 1906 and the Depression of the 1930s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most significant social and economic development in post&hyphen;World War II Australia was the immigration program. It had become obvious during the war that a massive increase in our population was viable to Australia's future. We looked then to England and Europe to boost the population. From 1947 to 1973, over 63 per cent of all migrants were assisted&mdash;they received free passage, subsidised accommodation and free professional advice on social services, employment, health insurance, housing and education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Settlement policies for non-British migrants have made three significant shifts: assimilation in the immediate postwar years, integration in the mid-1960s and multiculturalism in the early 1970s. Assimilation was characterised by minimal settlement objectives, a lack of comprehensive planning&mdash;minimal public cost through the use of established non-government organisations&mdash;and people who were semiskilled and known as `Son of Toil' were preferred to professional or skilled workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Integration recognised the failure of older migrants from eastern and southern Europe to assimilate and their insistence on conformity was seen as coercive and unacceptable. From integration evolved multiculturalism. This was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8057"> taken up in the early 1970s when we saw the concept of a new ethnicity which rejected the earlier melting pot theories. Advocates at the time saw it as long overdue societal and political recognition of the distinctiveness and value of the contribution to Australian society made by groups with different backgrounds from those of the majority's Anglo-Celtic heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hanson phenomenon&mdash;some would say Hanson's disease&mdash;has its origins, in my opinion, in the failure of the previous government to listen to a sense of growing unease with the continued advocacy, frequently with religious fervour, of multiculturalism. Such concern could be best summarised by some of the constituents in my electorate who responded to the Bradfield community survey, which I conducted earlier this year. Some of the responses I received were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Immigration&mdash;I am certainly not against it. Apart from the aborigines we are all immigrants in one way or another to Australia but we must be allowed to discuss the issue freely without fear of being labelled a racist. We need quality not quantity and immigrants who will eventually become good industrious law-abiding citizens.</PARA>
<PARA>The second respondent:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is Australia really to become an Asian country? Where are we heading? Are we acceptable to the rest of Asia? How must our people change?</PARA>
<PARA>The third respondent:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Immigration leads to a larger population which may well place unbearable pressures on our natural resources so that we leave degraded land for our children.</PARA>
<PARA>The fourth:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Population growth&mdash;do we need to grow? Can we sustain growth? The question that needs to be asked is `Does Australia need multiculturalism?' We are not being asked&mdash;we are being told it is good for us. I question that.</PARA>
<PARA>And finally:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I feel powerless as I see Australia slipping down hill.</PARA>
<PARA>To those of us who feel alienated, hurt or resentful in response to the emotions unleashed by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), I think it is important to recognise the legitimacy of grief which many Australians feel as they see our country change, as the old and the familiar is lost. It is a phe <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> nomenon which in many ways could be expected as a response to the stifling imposition of values and thinking by the former Prime Minister. But changing we are and change we must.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley is a lightning rod for grief and resentment, and it is a challenge to the rest of us to put her concerns into a proper perspective and to respond to them with some fact. The member for Oxley seems to think that immigration causes unemployment. In the 1930s Depression, unemployment broke above five per cent in 1929 and it took over 13 years to restore full employment, with an average of 12 per cent unemployment over the intervening years. Contrary to Australian folklore, it was not World War II that fixed things&mdash;in fact, we were already down to eight per cent unemployment in 1939, trending toward five per cent by 1941&mdash;but simply the industrial age had caught up with Australia or us with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Committee for Economic Development of Australia landmark study on immigration refuted the argument that immigration causes unemployment. We had much higher pro rata immigration levels through the 1940s until the early 1970s with full unemployment&mdash;that is, one per cent to two per cent unemployment. In fact, net immigration levels at the time were about 1&half; per cent to two per cent of population throughout much of that period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every new immigrant family that enters Australia creates four new jobs for the first four years that they are here because of their consumption of services and infrastructure. There is also much that we could learn from our Asian migrants in particular&mdash;a strong work ethic, the pursuit of excellence, veneration and respect for older members of the family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I recently sought to educate myself more fully about the chicken meat importation issue, I toured a chicken factory in the outer suburbs of Sydney. After observing the predominantly Asian background of the work force, I asked the company's owner why this was so. He said, `I don't mind who I employ, but Asian people turn up on time, work hard, do an excellent job, have few sick days and are generally uncomplaining, grateful only to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8058"> have a job.' Who, I ask, is the problem&mdash;Asian people or those of us who seem to have some discomfort with them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To those who think that in some way Asians are less able than we are, I suggest that they are neglecting skyrocketing wealth and standards of living in countries like Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea. To celebrate our individualism as a nation and pride in our achievements, history and institutions are to be applauded. However, the pursuit of isolationist, irrational intolerance is morally questionable and economically stupid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS>, in its 18 November 1996 edition, presented some further facts which I commend to the House. They include the fact that working age immigrants, excluding those from Lebanon and Vietnam, are less likely to use social welfare than Australian born workers. Skills brought in through immigration do not reduce local training efforts. Despite their special handicaps, the refugees' jobless rate is below that of Australian born workers. Overall, Australia's immigrants are better qualified than residents. The value of overseas pensions paid to immigrants in Australia is almost double that of Australian pensions paid to immigrants who have returned overseas. Health and character screening means that immigrants are healthier than the resident population and less crime prone. Immigration does not offset the ageing of the Australian population. And immigration at any feasible level will not significantly change projections of ageing and welfare dependency. In fact, in the longer run immigrants are net contributors to Commonwealth and local government revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further to that, Bill Evans, Westpac's General Manager for Economics, says that immigration, for example, represents about 25 per cent of the present underlying demand for housing. Within six years, nearly half of migrant households buy a house. Within 10 years, it is 78 per cent compared with 71.5 per cent ownership by Australians who were born here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this country needs to develop and adopt is a national population policy which is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> based on our environmental carrying capacity. The immigration debate will continue to be facile, emotional, uninformed and irrational until we set long-term goals for population growth, of which immigration is but one part. Until such time also as demographers, politicians&mdash;people like us&mdash;business leaders, developers and the community generally appreciate that we have been living on environmental capital rather than interest, there is every reason to be pessimistic about the environmental future of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley appeals to innate fears and, in a sense, a primitive instinct that is in all of us of self-interested resentment of the different, of the unfamiliar. She appeals to opinions that are strongly held by some based on ignorance, prejudice and even hatred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Humanity is precious and, like hope, it is fragile. However, the greater achievements of history have been effected by those who treated all others as equals, by those who did not make themselves and their own selfish desires the centre of their own lives. Amongst those who might be considered to be worthy models in this regard&mdash;this did not spring to mind when I saw Mr Drane on the television this morning&mdash;few would rate more highly than Sir Weary Dunlop. Despite suffering and experiencing dreadfully inhumane treatment at the hands of his World War II captors as he administered care to his stricken colleagues, Weary Dunlop harboured neither hatred nor contempt to those who brought these injustices upon him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we fill leadership roles, of which being a parliamentarian is one, there are privileges attached to them but also responsibilities. Those responsibilities include the need to make others feel a reverence for themselves, and in particular not to make statements which demean, denigrate or alienate any section of society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are challenging times. The country has a number of directions in which it may head, and that creates an environment in which people are ready to listen if we have the right messages to give. The challenge for parliamentarians and community leaders is to see that their influence in society is inextricably linked to their willingness to confront <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8059"> contemporary issues, such as population planning and development, in a constructive and considered manner, and to challenge the nation's thinking on a range of fundamental, environmental, economic and social considerations relevant to Australia's population carrying capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, we live in a selfish world, in a world of fundamentalist intolerance and vast ignorance of the biological and ecological consequences of our actions. Australia is very much at a turning point in its history, of which the population, immigration and cultural debate are but one significant manifestation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Australians should remember, though, is that when parliamentarians are out of touch with their citizens, as I believe the previous Prime Minister in particular most certainly was; when we fail to recognise the need to lead, rather than follow, public opinion; and when we feel that in some way we need to subscribe to the populist views expressed, for example, by the member for Oxley, then the nation is vulnerable. In particular, when facts bow to bias, truth is in danger and evil in all its guises finds an environment in which it may flourish, if not triumph.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) represents commonsense. As I said last week in this place in debating social security amendments as they apply to migrants, the Australian Labor Party&mdash;not that I wish to give it advice, but I will give it anyway&mdash;needs to refocus on what the real things are that people are concerned about. Every section of this country at the moment is making a contribution to turning the deficit into surplus, to try to improve our national savings contribution. If, for example, you seek to exclude from that new settlers to Australia, you actually create more resentment from those people who are working and who fail to understand why they work so hard to contribute to government coffers and the money we distribute to those that are in need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I realise it is provocative to say it, if they continue down this road where they are concerned to see that people who are newly arrived in Australia have almost immediate access to a range of social security <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> benefits to which I would not be entitled if I went to eight out of 10 of the top 10 countries from which we receive migrants, then you are actually working as a transmission vehicle for the dissemination of what I call Hanson's disease. You will actually continue to foster a resentment in the community which is not healthy. In particular it is not healthy for those who are coming to Australia and for those, in particular, who want to see and do see all human beings as equal.</PARA>

<PARA>I have been asked by the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) to move these amendments, which he foreshadowed in the second reading debate. The honourable member is unable to be here tonight. The amendments involve adding two further provisions to the enabling provisions set out in the bill. Currently, the bill provides in section 50A in relation to the Northern Territory that the Legislative Assembly does have power to make laws with respect to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the withdrawal or withholding of medical or surgical measures for prolonging the life of a patient but not so as to permit the intentional killing of the patient; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> medical treatment in the provision of palliative care to a dying patient, but not so as to permit the intentional killing of the patient.</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments will add to this section the following:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the appointment of an agent by a patient who is authorised to make decisions about the withdrawal or withholding of treatment; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the repealing of legal sanctions against attempted suicide.</PARA>
<PARA>Some argue that the territories already have the power to pass such laws. This provision ensures that they do and encourages them to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments would allow the appointment of an agent for the purpose of making medical decisions, but not so as to permit the intentional killing of the patient. Hence, the amendment encourages the territories to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> introduce modern refusal of treatment legislation such as the Victorian Medical Treatment Act and the South Australian Consent to Medical Treatment and Palliative Care Act. Repealing legal sanctions against attempted suicide is humane and only reasonable, as depression and difficulties lead to attempted suicide and any legal complications following that only add further to and compound the problem.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendments which were moved by the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), which had their origin in some discussions that I had with the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), who is not here today, are those which I indicated in the debate in the Main Committee on the second reading I was proposing to accept. I indicate that more formally here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments relate to that part of the schedules relating to each of the territories which are the enabling provisions of the act. That is, in each of the schedules for each of the territories there are words, slightly different depending on each piece of legislation, to the effect that the legislative assemblies do have powers to make laws with respect to, firstly, the withdrawal or withholding of surgical measures for prolonging the life of a patient but not so as to permit the intentional killing of the patient and, secondly, medical treatment in the provision of palliative care to a dying patient but not so as to permit the intentional killing of the patient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those enabling provisions are based on the state of the law throughout Australia, with the notable exception of the Northern Territory. More specifically, they are based on specific legislative provisions in Victoria&mdash;namely, the Medical Treatment Act&mdash;and, in South Australia, the Consent to Medical Treatment and Palliative Care Act. What the honourable member for Lalor was concerned to do was encourage the legislative assemblies, particularly in the Northern Territory, not only to introduce modern refusal of treatment legislation but to introduce modern refusal of treatment legislation which enabled the appointment by a person of another person as their agent to make decisions on their behalf about <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8063"> medical treatment should they in the future become incompetent or incapable of making such decisions. That reflects the state of the law specifically in Victoria and South Australia and reflects some provisions by way of guidelines in some of the other states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It could be argued that it is open to the legislative assemblies of the territories to introduce provisions to this effect now. There is nothing standing in the way of doing so. But by adding this provision to those already in the bill which we have voted upon, it makes it clear that there is an encouragement to introduce modern refusal of medical treatment legislation in the territories. It is for those reasons that I indicated to the member for Lalor last week and to the member for Adelaide that, whilst in a sense these provisions are not necessary, it is still open for the legislative assemblies to pass such laws. This would give some encouragement to do so and therefore introduce modern legislation in that regard. For those reasons, I do not oppose the amendments moved.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this point, this matter becomes one of high farce. We are seeing substantial changes to a proposal that has been before the House for literally months. Suddenly, almost the week before Christmas, we are expected to vote on something which, as far as I can establish&mdash;there was no explanatory memoranda&mdash;involves a different part of the legislation of the territories. There was ample opportunity for these matters to be raised and put to this House in the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been told about the importance and significance of this legislation. I have reminded the House that it fails to deal with abortion. All of a sudden, we can moderate the issue without debate or discussion and at the 11th hour. It is either important or it is some political exercise. You can get somebody in Geneva to get someone else to move an amendment on a matter that should have been before this House at the commencement of this debate. It is a test for all of you. You can put your morality ahead of proper procedure or you cannot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You ignored these matters. You did not have a thing to do with all this during the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> debate. If you want to deal with it in that fashion, do so. Make yourself a kangaroo court. The reality is that this is not proper legislative procedure. If that is the way you want to behave, we know what you are all about, because you have read the letters but you have not read the legislation. These are the issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find that this is becoming more and more farcical as time goes by. It is an insult to the people who support this procedure and their members of parliament. Rights were granted by this parliament. Progressively, having granted these rights to people, we want to take them away. Suddenly we think that we should give them something back. Nobody really knows what it is. I challenge the speakers here to explain this one after another, admit that they have read this section of the Northern Territory act and that they are competent to vote on these amendments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I share some of the concerns raised by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). Even more so, I share a concern that we have here a sleight of hand. We have people who can suddenly decide that turning off a switch leading to death is not intentionally killing somebody.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea that we can withdraw services, to my mind, is not just sophistry and cant; it is pure hypocrisy. We have had two ways of putting it in this debate: one is they die of natural causes and the other one is there is no intent involved. These amendments go to that very same point. The fact is people who die from withdrawal of services, in many cases, die of starvation. Those people who are concerned about killing people are now saying, `It is okay to have people starve. That isn't killing them. That is natural causes.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is that turning off the switch to prevent blood circulation or oxygen circulation is natural causes and is not killing them. Those who want to argue cannot have it both ways. The new way that some bioethicists have found to get around the question of the maintenance of so-called life through life support systems is to say there was no intent and the person dies of natural causes. In the weeks and months ahead, you should go and work out your definitions of that because you will not find any real accuracy other than some semantic misuse of words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other question we also had was about how doctors and children will conspire to kill people. That is the other big voodoo question running. There will be a conspiracy to kill people. There are two points about that. The first point is that proper rules on euthanasia prevent that because they require some consent to be granted, which is not required now. The second point is that these amendments effectively authorise somebody to kill somebody else by withdrawing support.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the one hand, you have gone around the countryside boasting about how you are against people being killed but, on the other hand, you are putting forward amendments that authorise someone to kill somebody. That kind of contradiction is paramount. The member for O'Connor was right to feel indignant, because all through this debate we have been told the opposite. We have been told that this legislation was against people killing people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now find an amendment being accepted by the initiator of the legislation that authorises killing people. How can you do that? You either have one or the other. For those who insist on the sanctity of life, one should maintain the life support systems for as long as a person survives. One cannot turn that switch off. There is no rationalisation; there is no excuse; there is no way they can weasel out. Life does or does not have a sanctity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning off a switch cannot be seen to be unintentional. We are supposed to believe that a doctor or nurse turns off a switch and says, `Oh dear, what a shock, the person has died. I wonder how that happened.' These amendments are inappropriate in the context of the whole debate. I support them because I support euthanasia. I support a person's right to make a choice. But the way they have been brought forward is wrong because they were not debated as part of the ongoing debate; yet they were raised by the member for Lalor, (Mr Barry Jones) many weeks back and could have been brought into the debate, if the government or those managing its progress had done it properly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, more importantly, these amendments are completely contradictory. In years ahead, people looking at these debates and at these amendments are going to say, `How could those same people who argued all the way through about intent, sanctity and collusion, then at the 11th hour&mdash;without debate, discussion or any prior consideration or public awareness&mdash;slip in some amendments that do just that?' Basically, it is a justification for those people who have defined these new rules about withdrawing life support services and who still maintain that they believe in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8065"> sanctity of life. It is cant; it is hypocrisy; and, most of all, it is absolutely inappropriate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When this matter was being debated in the Main Committee, I indicated in my contribution that I had completed a power of attorney, a properly executed legal document. This has the effect of appointing a patient advocate to make precisely these decisions for me if at some time in the future, as a result of mental or physical incapacity, I am not able to make these decisions for myself. I indicated then that I was indebted to the Voluntary Euthanasia Society for the essential draft of that power of attorney with the appointment of a patient advocate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it simply does is this: I have indicated in that power of attorney that if at some time in the future a debilitating disease or a deterioration in my mental and physical capacity were progressive and irreversible, then in those circumstances I would not want to be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> kept alive by artificial means. I am quite happy to leave that judgment to qualified medical practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have appointed a patient advocate, who happens to be my wife. I have sufficient confidence in her to believe she will respect my wishes and, to the extent that she is able, she will make those decisions for me at some time in the future if I am not able to make them for myself. I have also appointed an alternate patient advocate to make those decisions for me if I am unable to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to confuse this issue, but I add the point that, as far as I was concerned, the draft legal document which was made available to me did not go far enough, so I added provisions of this kind and they are now included. I am not suggesting that this amendment is designed to do this. But I said that, if in the future circumstances were such that my physical and mental deterioration was progressive and irreversible, and despite the fact that my patient advocate or my alternate patient advocate had indicated that no life support systems were to be attached to me to keep me alive artificially and they were withdrawn, and my life then continued to be extended as a result of natural causes, I authorised and instructed the people who were responsible for me&mdash;and within the light of the legislative legal powers they would have&mdash;either to assist me to take my own life in those circumstances or, if I was physically or mentally incapable of doing that even with their assistance, to do it for me for the whole range of reasons that I enumerated in the debate which took place in the Main Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The initial legislation says essentially that, as a result of this legislation, the power of the Legislative Assembly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . does not extend to the making of laws which permit or have the effect of permitting . . . the form of intentional killing of another called euthanasia . . . or the assisting of a person to terminate his or her life.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with what the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) has said. What she said this evening is perfectly correct. She has more than adequately made clear her intentions in these amendments, and they were well and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8066"> truly canvassed in the Main Committee. These amendments propose to allow the appointment of an agent by a patient and that agent is then authorised to make decisions about the withdrawal or withholding of treatment. I repeat: I have already appointed such an agent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing is the repeal of legal sanctions against attempted suicide. I conclude with this point: my life belongs to me; it does not belong to the state. That is the fundamental question behind this whole issue. I have made those arrangements and I prevail and appeal to my colleagues to allow those, at some time in the future in some form, to be given legal effect.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief. I simply make the point that the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) talked about a feeling of ambush. I have to say there is nothing in the amendments which remotely resembles an ambush. The appointment of an agent does nothing more than effectively encode the position in the common law. The critical question is one of intent to kill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the amendment does is assuage any sense of apprehension others may have that the legislation before the House may somehow put legal practitioners in a position of jeopardy if they do what they have been doing for not only decades but centuries, and that is to act in the interests of their patient and in cooperation with their patient but never with the intention to kill. That is the very simple position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment is completely benign in that sense. Somebody like Brian Pollard, who has been practising in the field for two generations, makes it very clear that he has never been called upon to make a decision to intentionally kill a patient. The withdrawal of life support is not an intentional decision to kill; neither is the prescription of large doses of the methadone or pain killing treatment. The critical issue is that we must preserve the basic common law principle that we as a parliament never sanction the intention to kill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment does not do that. In that sense there is nothing of the nature of an <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ambush about it. It is a fairly elementary, simple and uncomplicated amendment. There is nothing adventurous or ambitious about it. It simply makes it unequivocally clear that the administration of normal medical treatment for the alleviation of pain does not put a medical practitioner in any jeopardy, neither the appointment of an agent to do the same.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The perceptions in the Andrews legislation, which is before the House, and the additional amendments moved by the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), which I fully endorse and support, do nothing more than give effect to the very principles which South Australian law enacted some years ago and which Victorian law also seeks to put into practice. They are vital amendments to this kind of legislation, making clear as they do the federal parliament's intention&mdash;if they are carried&mdash;to accept these kinds of structures in Northern Territory law. That is the only distinction which they make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Intention has always been critical in law. It is no more critical and especially critical in areas related to death and dying. That is where intention becomes absolutely paramount in both an ethical and a legal way. It is certainly the case that a doctor may provide pain relief knowing that, as an incidental effect of that pain relief, he may shorten the patient's life or a doctor may disconnect a life support system from a patient where continued application of that life support system would be burdensome and futile in the case of a patient who is suffering a terminal illness. That is not intentional killing; that is compassionate medical procedure, a very appropriate procedure, and should be legal under our laws in every state and territory of this Commonwealth. That is the kind of compassionate society which I think those who are supporting this legislation wish to see in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendments moved by the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) from a different perspective than most of those who have supported them. I very strongly opposed and regret the House's decision to give a second reading to the Andrews bill because I very strongly support <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> active voluntary euthanasia. I did not seek to oppose the Andrews bill on the basis of territorial rights, although that was something about which I spoke because it is a matter about which the bill, of course, has profound implications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My opposition to the bill is one of principle expressed very articulately by the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who said, `My life is mine. It doesn't belong to the state, and the decisions that should be made about its termination should be mine, not those of the state.' I strongly share that view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I support these amendments is that they are, while pathetically inadequate, a very small step back along the road towards empowerment of and autonomy for the individuals whose interests I thought I was speaking for when I sought to oppose the Andrews bill in the first place. It does give somewhat more, although a pathetically inadequate amount, of the rights back to the individuals in the territories to have their views about their life, their circumstances and their wish to have their life concluded. It gives some of that power back to those individuals and some of the power back to territory assemblies to reflect the wish of the majority of their members and of their constituents in the laws of those territories in the way that the states have the capacity to do if they so choose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is of no consequence or interest to me whether this is the law of South Australia or not. I have to say to my colleagues and others who think that that is a persuasive argument that I find it significantly unpersuasive. But it is important that we recognise that, even if we are strongly opposed to the decision the House has just made because of its impact upon the rights, the empowerment and the autonomy of individual Australians; even if, as I am, we are concerned that access to euthanasia, which will still be available to those with the resources to find it but will now be extremely hard to find for those weaker members of our community who do not have the knowledge, the contacts, the money or the influence to get access to those services even though that will, therefore, make our society less fair and, in my view, profoundly less compassionate and take power <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8068"> away from individuals; and even though the bill itself and nothing in these amendments can change the fact that the bill itself takes important rights away from Australians in three categories, those who live in the Capital Territory, those who live in the Northern Territory and those who live in Norfolk Island&mdash;this bill extends a small sliver of those rights back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I profoundly regret the fact that the House has taken that body of rights away, but I welcome this very small glimmer of light in an otherwise dark horizon about these matters. Therefore, I support these amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (d) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the repealing of legal sanctions against attempted suicide.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it is okay to try to suicide, but don't succeed. With due respect, that is what it says. You will be able to take away all the legal sanctions on suicide.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is how farcical this thing is becoming because it has not been given proper scrutiny.

One might wonder how those who are totally committed to preventing death are going to deal with that amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pretty comfortable about it if people take it as their own right, but we are actually doing that. This is my protest on this particular amendment. They are serious amendments that have not been given proper scrutiny by this House. In a minute, someone is going to say, `I move that the motion be put,' and they may as well, because that entrenches the farce that we have dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the reality of these amendments: a doctor will not be able to assist somebody to take their life on that person's own decision and under the provisions of the Northern Territory legislation, but we will withdraw any sanction against people trying to kill themselves. Things might be a bit dirtier and nastier because they will probably have to put a shotgun to their mouth&mdash;that will be the alternative&mdash;but that would be legal if we give people permission&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the reality is that with these amendments there is a proposition that people are entitled to attempt suicide&mdash;why not, if that is their choice&mdash;but apparently that proposition will apply whether they have a terminal condition or not. The relevant amendment proposed that we empower the territories&mdash;we cannot empower the states&mdash;in the repealing of legal sanctions against attempted suicide. We currently attempt to prevent suicide by legal sanction because we think that we might save the odd life; the fact that it is illegal might prevent someone from trying to do it.

In the Main Committee the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) and other members referred to these issues. I certainly referred to them. We are now in the committee stage, and the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) has been around long enough to know that this is precisely the stage at which issues like this are canvassed and discussed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the amendments give the Northern Territory parliament, and others affected by the proposed legislation, appropriate support and direction in adopting models which were adopted in Victoria and South Australia&mdash;after a great deal of consideration and after a great deal of scrutiny&mdash;and which have worked well. The Victorian legislation, with which I am familiar, is referred to as the `dying with dignity' legislation. Its adoption in Victoria some years ago represented a landmark in developing the issues before us with respect for the rights of patients who are placed in very difficult situations. I commended that legislation to the parliament previously, and I do so again. I know that is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> one of the reasons that the member for Lalor was keen to see these amendments put to the House. It certainly represents an improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments provide a clear distinction between, on the one hand, euthanasia, the intentional killing of a patient, and on the other hand those measures&mdash;palliative care, pain relief, withholding of treatment&mdash;which might be found to be important at appropriate circumstances in the lives of patients. That is a very clear distinction. Anyone who is critical of these amendments has failed to appreciate the significance of that distinction. That is why the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) and others of us are able to support them. There is a clear difference between attempted suicide and state sanctioned killing, which euthanasia amounts to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I and others who have supported the Andrews bill are not opposed to the withholding of futile treatment for people who are in the most appalling of circumstances&mdash;on some occasions, brain dead&mdash;and I would certainly reject the idea that the withholding of treatment amounts to the killing of a person. In fact, a person dies because they are unable to live other than in artificial circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A person who dies as a result of a life support machine being turned off is not being killed; they die because they are unable to survive otherwise. That is a completely different thing from the intentional killing which euthanasia amounts to. I support the amendments moved by the member for Adelaide.

I personally know two people who recently took their lives. I do not want to make this a personal address, and I will not do so, except to say that we have a great responsibility as a federal parliament to think very carefully about what we say, particularly to young people. What we do can give a legal sanction, or it can be educative or punitive.</PARA>

For the memory of members in this House, the ACT is a territory and is one of the areas of target under the Andrews bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I need to remind the House that the ACT has twice examined euthanasia in one form or another and twice rejected it since 1989, since self-government. In 1993 or 1994&mdash;forgive my memory&mdash;the ACT actually passed a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> medical treatment bill which is, in other common language, a living will piece of legislation. I find it a little bit paternalistic or maternalistic, whichever way you tend to view it, that this House now believes it needs to somehow protect the ACT to allow it to maintain its own law when it has in fact in a very mature fashion reached the stage that it has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did not know these amendments were going to be moved until they were moved, even though they may have been debated earlier in theory. My confusion is that I do not know legally whether the Andrews bill will negate the very good law that we actually have in this territory in relation to the medical treatment bill or whether these amendments are actually required. I find it a bit deplorable as a member representing part of this territory that I have to actually ask this question. I find it a bit poor that this has not been clarified prior to this point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said a moment ago&mdash;and I repeat&mdash;no speaker who has addressed these amendments to this point has actually realised or said they realise the ACT already has its own medical treatment bill, its living will legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can I indicate that I am not fixed in whether these amendments are passed or not, but I would like at least for members, when they are debating them and making a decision about them, to understand the way in which they operate. I will go back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">About three decades ago, each state in Australia, as I recall, repealed their laws against suicide. It was stupid to have a law against suicide. If a person had suicided, how could you criminally impose some offence against them? When they repealed those laws against suicide, generally they also repealed laws against attempted suicide&mdash;that is, if someone was in such a state psychologically that they tried to suicide, it was inappropriate to actually charge them with a criminal offence. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8071">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to discourage suicide in some instances a provision was introduced&mdash;for example, in Victoria&mdash;which said that, if you aided, abetted or incited a person to suicide, that was a criminal offence. Also in the Victorian Crimes Act, in section 463B, you can take reasonable steps to stop someone, prevent somebody whom you reasonably believe is about to commit suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us take the classic example: if someone is caught climbing over the fence at the top of the Westgate Bridge in Melbourne and you reasonably believe they are going to jump off, you can use reasonable force to prevent them from doing that, and that is a discouragement against suicide. So far as this provision is concerned where it says that the legislative assemblies may make laws repealing laws or offence of attempted suicide, there is nothing in this provision that the territories and the states cannot enact at the present time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other part of the amendment which has been moved by the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) relates to the appointment of an agent. There are situations where, for example, under the common law a person may refuse medical treatment but, if that person becomes incompetent, becomes incapable through illness or disease, to be able to express that refusal of medical treatment, there is a doubt that anybody can actually refuse on that person's behalf. Therefore, in Victoria and in South Australia, as the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) has pointed out, legislation was introduced to allow a person whilst competent to appoint another person such as his or her spouse, as the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) indicated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the member for Charlton became incompetent&mdash;God help the day&mdash;his spouse could make medical decisions on his behalf. This provision does not go to the extent, I should say, that the member for Charlton would like it to, which would be to assist his death, but it says that his spouse could under this sort of legislation make a decision about refusing ordinary medical treatment provided that refusal was not done with the intention to kill the member for Charlton.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will answer the points made by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas). Whether you vote for these amendments or not, you should at least understand what they mean. These amendments are imposing nothing on the Northern Territory. They simply say that the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory may, if it thinks fit, introduce legislation to allow the appointment of a medical agent or introduce legislation to repeal sanctions against attempted suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory, the Legislative Assembly of the ACT, as the honourable member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) has pointed out, and the Legislative Assembly of Norfolk Island already have the power to do this if they so wish. It is simply clarifying that those legislative assemblies have that power, if they so wish, to introduce such legislation. It is imposing absolutely nothing on the legislative assemblies; at best, it is encouraging them to take that course. As I said, honourable members may have some misgivings about whether they vote for this or not but, with due respect to all, at least understand that that is the effect of the amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on this occasion essentially to endorse and support the comments that were just made by the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) on the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996. It is important that, when members vote for or against these amendments, they understand exactly what they entail. The Andrews bill will not have the effect of taking away from people the right to refuse medical treatment or to have medical treatment, particularly those artificial life&hyphen;sustaining devices and attachments, withdrawn.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All that the amendments now seek to do is to ensure that, in those cases where a patient loses the capacity to make those decisions for him or herself, a patient advocate would have the legal right to do it for him or her. As I indicated, that is the situation which I find myself in in connection with the power of attorney or the appointment of a patient <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8072"> advocate which I have already legally effected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to respond to one of the concerns raised by the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). He implied or may have believed that the effect of this would be to repeal legal sanctions against attempted suicide and suggested that, since it was only against attempted suicide, successful suicide was in some way without legal sanctions. Yes, in a very real sense that is what it does mean because the alternative would be quite absurd. How do you impose legal sanctions against someone who is dead as a result of action taken by themselves?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are going to have legal sanctions against someone, it has to be only for attempted suicide. I emphasise that the proposed amendments do not require the Northern Territory or the ACT or Norfolk Island to legislate to allow the appointment of a patient advocate in the circumstances that I have described. It simply confirms their right to do so. Nor do these proposed amendments require that any of those three territories repeal legal sanctions against attempted suicide. It simply allows them to do so if they so wish. In fact, all it does is to confirm their right to do so, just the same as all of the states currently have a right to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I believe that the amendments do improve the initial bill. Let me make the point that I opposed and have spoken against with some degree of vigour the Andrews bill, but I will vote for these amendments because I believe they are an improvement. In my case, I repeat that if I lose the capacity to take advantage of what the Northern Territory under the Andrews bill would allow me to do, then the appointment of a patient advocate makes it possible for it to be done anyway. A similar type of provision relates to attempted suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I want to endorse what my colleague the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) said. While we can be very pedantic about what is involved in the removal of those artificial life&hyphen;sustaining attachments, the simple fact is that they keep a person alive and their withdrawal causes the person to die. Do not tell me that that is not intentional. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> That is the absurd position that we now find ourselves in. However, these amendments do improve the Andrews bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I was a member of the Victorian parliament, it enacted the refusal of medical treatment legislation. It was done largely on a bipartisan basis after a lot of consultation. I am fairly certain that all of the churches supported that legislation also, perhaps with some minor modifications. The arguments in support of these amendments frankly surprise me because, first of all, I am informed that the Andrews bill does not take away the existing powers of the territories to deal with these matters if they wish. In fact, some territories have already done that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the first thing is that the amendments are not needed because the Andrews bill does not change the existing laws. The existing laws quite clearly, on the advice I have received, enable the territories&mdash;and some of them have already done it&mdash;to make laws to that effect. So the amendments are merely some form of dressing up. This is a conscience vote for all of us. I want to let all my colleagues know that I strongly support the right to refuse medical treatment legislation. In fact, I helped write it in another parliament. But I do not think it is necessary in this case in this place to enshrine it in the Andrews legislation. For that reason, I will not be supporting these amendments because they are not needed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not go over ground already covered particularly well by the members for Menzies (Mr Andrews), Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) and Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), who have spelt out very clearly the differences regarding what is euthanasia and what these amendments actually do. There are a couple of things I would like to add to what has already been said. That is, it is not prescriptive. It is not telling the territories what they must do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because some have put forward the argument at various times that, by passing the Andrews bill, we were preventing reformist legislation taking place in those territories, it seemed a sensible thing to add these amendments. I was not the only one to have that idea. I say to the member for O'Connor (Mr <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8073"> Tuckey) that it does not concern me at all that he did not listen to my speech. But, if he had taken a passing interest in any number of the speeches that have taken place, he would have found that a number of people referred to these arguments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might also add for those who have felt that they have been hijacked, taken by surprise, or have not had time to consider it, et cetera, that I was grateful to the clerks for ensuring that the amendments in my name were on all desks at about 12.30 p.m. today. It would be of further interest to those who did not note things that I have been informed that the amendments of the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) were actually circulated on 28 October. So in raising matters in this place, I would think it sensible to be calm and factual about these matters.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That paragraph (c) be omitted.</PARA>
<PARA>This is simply a procedural mechanism to ensure that the parliament has the opportunity to vote on the substance of each of the issues. For example, the proposal in amendment 1(c) is of substance very different from the proposal in item 1(d). Whilst these amendments may be making no substantial changes to the current ability of the bill, by putting forward these proposals the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) has asked us to opine on each of these issues. I believe they are very different in substance. Indeed, the only procedural way that we can deal with these separately is by moving that one of the items be omitted.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Returning to the original amendments, I want to make a couple of points in response. Personally I would be quite happy for these matters to pass on the voices. Having had some chance to consider them, the reality is that I will classify them as the wink, wink, nod, nod amendments. As I said earlier, they really bring this legislation back to high farce. But it does not alter the fact that I think history will not treat us kindly in our dealing with this matter, particularly in terms of these <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> two amendments. I do not think they have been given the proper scrutiny of the parliament, and I stand on that point. The opportunity for legal dispute is now enhanced, because we have a situation where we are duplicating something that we are not sure we ever took away in the first place. When parliaments allow themselves to get into this situation they eventually regret the circumstances. It does not matter what the views are. I do not disagree with the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) and other speakers who say that some of these things have been done in other places. Maybe they have. They have not been done in this context.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not aware of amendments put by the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), because there is procedure in this place that says that I ought to be able to collect them off that table. It is not sufficient to raise matters in debate and then not have the amendments properly circulated. The member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) had an amendment; he brought it down at the commencement of this debate. Other members had amendments and brought them down at the beginning of this debate. They became part of everybody's understanding. But I think we are hell bent on this. If it goes through on the voices, I will not be calling for a division. If there is a division I will not be part of it; I will abstain, because I will not be part of this process. The reality is that I do not think it alters the fact that we have now identified how farcical this whole thing has become. We have set out to tell a territory how to run its legislature. Having done so, we are now trying to find out how far it can go. No doubt after someone has seen this bill passed and maybe become an act, if the Senate is foolish enough to take a view similar to the one taken by this House, somebody will be saying, `Hang on a minute, what about 50(2)AX?' after they have got through all the other letters. That is where we are heading. The farce of this matter is best demonstrated by these two amendments.</PARA>

Standing order 308 says that, in the case of grave disorder arising in the House, the Speaker may adjourn the House without the question put or suspend any sitting for a time to be named by the Speaker. I submit to you that a defiance of your ruling made in proper application of rule 202 does amount to grave disorder. You are accordingly entitled to suspend the House. I suggest that you suspend the House for as long as it takes to resolve this issue. I imagine that it would take about two minutes to go out the door. You would then resume the sitting of the House and act as appropriate, once the division is completed, by acting on an appropriate motion to deal with the breach of discipline with which you have been confronted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from Telstra:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) No. The position to which Mr Scoble was appointed in 1985 was not publicly advertised.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The existing criteria for the provision of a street posting box are that:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Yes. Australia Post understands that the Estate in question is still undergoing development, is primarily residential and does not appear to have an area set aside for shops or essential services. In addition, a street posting box is provided at the local Licensed Post Office which is situated approximately one kilometre from the Estate. Nevertheless, as the area is in the developmental stage Australia Post will review the situation in 12 months.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr Warwick Smith</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from Australia Post:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Australia Post's Security Post service was withdrawn on 1 October 1996, along with the Certified Mail service, as part of a rationalisation of the Corporation's `security' services. These services were replaced by a new Registered Post service. Consultation on the initiative was undertaken in the normal way with the main union representing Australia Post employees, the CEPU.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) In addition to the CEPU, Australia Post also consulted with a broad cross section of regular users of both services. The decision to streamline the range of `security' services was also supported by market research which showed significant confusion among individual customers in differentiating between Security Post and Certified Mail services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) While the precise details are commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence, Australia Post has indicated that, following a small loss in 1994/95, the Security Post service was profitable in 1995/96.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Full absorption based costing was used as the basis for charging for the service. The price charged was designed to cover all direct and indirect costs and all allocated overheads, in addition to providing a margin for profit. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) While individual customer information is confidential, Australia Post has indicated that the main users of the Security Post service were from the Government (Commonwealth and State), Security, Education, banking, retail and medical sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) It is assumed that this question relates to the separate but concurrent decision to restrict the carriage of large amounts of bank notes in the mail. That decision was made following a review earlier this year of the use of the post or the carriage of bank notes, coins and bullion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Among other things, the review identified that very large amounts of cash were regularly transiting the post, principally from banks, creating a potentially serious risk for Australia Post staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia Post is not equipped to handle bank notes securely and the carriage of large amounts of money was not consistent with its duty of care for its employees. Consequently, the Corporation decided to limit its exposure to the risks associated with the carriage of large amounts of cash through the post, with effect from 1 October 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Bankers Association and the Reserve Bank were advised of the decision on 5 July 1996, so that alternative methods of cash conveyance could be put in place by their members/branches prior to 1 October 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the banks and other financial institutions had grown used to the convenience of the post for moving cash in some places, particularly to and from remote locations, it was Australia Post's view that there were more appropriate alternatives available, such as specialist cash carrying firms and the airlines which service the locations concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) There was no requirement for customers to disclose the amount of cash they were sending through the mail. However, discussions with various financial institutions earlier this year provided a clear indication of the very large amounts of bank notes that were being sent on a regular basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Security Post service offered a $75 compensation limit for loss of an uninsured article. This  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8084"> limitation was contractual not statutory and was, therefore, open to challenge. Insurance cover up to a maximum of $5,000 was available under the service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) Australia Post understands that the financial institutions did in fact carry their own insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) The Security Post service was introduced in October 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10) Since 1991, there have been four armed robberies committed in the transit process for the delivery of Security Post items. In three of the four incidents, significant amounts of cash were stolen.</PARA>
