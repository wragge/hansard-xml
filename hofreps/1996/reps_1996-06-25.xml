<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Last Tuesday you told this House that not one minister of a foreign government had raised with you the scrapping of the DIFF scheme. These were the words you used last Tuesday:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . not one minister&mdash;be he a foreign minister or an economic development minister&mdash;has expressed any concern to me about the abolition of the DIFF program.</PARA>
<PARA>Did you not admit to the House last night that you had in fact discussed the abolition of DIFF with Professor Ginandjar, the Indonesian Minister for National Development Planning, and Dr Habibie, the Minister of State for Research and Technology? Aren't they not only the two most important economic development ministers in the Indonesian government but two of the most important and distinguished ministers in the entire government? How could you possibly have forgotten that these two gentlemen met with you, what they said to you and what you said in reply in this your first face to face meeting with them in Jakarta on 16 April?</PARA></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Given that a competitive banking environment provides real benefits for consumers of home mortgage products, can the Treasurer advise the House that the government is intending to take action to further foster competition in the banking <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sector? If so, can the Treasurer advise what steps the government will be taking and what are the likely benefits for consumers?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already made it clear on behalf of the government how we believe it is important to foster competition in the finance industry. As a result of competition in the mortgage industry, we have seen variable mortgage rates decline over recent months. It is the government's intention to increase competition in the banking sector by reforms to the interest withholding tax exemption, section 128F. This is a relic of the tax act from some 20 years ago, legislated for another time and another place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The existing exemption arrangements prevented low cost overseas funds being lent to home buyers and consumers, because under the existing law the exemption could only be accessed where overseas borrowings were used for Australian business, that is, they had to be used for business purposes. By removing this requirement, Australian borrowers will be able to apply overseas borrowings for home lending and consumer finance. This was not allowed under the existing law. This will have a noticeable impact on the competitiveness of the home loan lending market and it will give the opportunity for increased competition ultimately to benefit consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be ensuring also that fundraising by Australian financial institutions overseas is more transparent and open to further competitive pressures. Under the current IWT exemption, debentures issued by an Australian company overseas must be widely distributed in the retail market. This requirement will be replaced by a public offer test extending the exemption to borrowings on wholesale capital markets. This will ensure that when Australian borrowers&mdash;</PARA>

It is the policy of this government to make the banking sector as competitive as it can possibly be.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5T4">Mr BRERETON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I remind the minister again of his words last Tuesday when he told the House that not one minister, be he a foreign minister or an economic development minister, had expressed any concern to him about the abolition of the DIFF program. In your article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> , and submitted by you before question time yesterday, didn't you change your story to exclude any reference to economic development ministers? Wasn't your new formulation of who had not approached you merely a ploy to avoid correcting your statement in this parliament of 18 June? If you were only in a position to advise the House of your meeting with senior Indonesian economic development ministers as a result of the search of records initiated after question time yesterday, why did you omit any reference to economic development ministers in the article? If you had recalled the Indonesian meeting in time to put this new formulation into the newspaper article submitted before question time, why couldn't you recall those meetings during question time itself? Haven't you just been too clever by half?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not correct. I have to say that I really explained the position fairly fully yesterday. I have made it perfectly clear to the House that I was very happy to check the records. I went through the records, I had a look at some of the material, and I made an explanation in the parliament last night. I think this issue of ministerial responsibility is an important issue, and I am very happy to uphold the principles of correcting a record if ever I need to correct it. I am delighted to have been able to do that. I do not think under the previous government there <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was always a willingness to correct records.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IK6">Mr LLOYD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister's attention been drawn to certain ministerial omissions which could have invalidated a range of conduct under the Native Title Act?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="2626" SPEAKER="Howard, John, MP" NAMEID="ZD4" ELECTORATE="Bennelong" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My attention has been drawn to a very serious lapse of ministerial responsibility and behaviour under the Native Title Act. The situation is that, consequent upon the passage of the Native Title Act by this parliament in December 1993, it was an obligation of the then minister, the former member for Robertson, Mr Walker, to issue a determination under that act. I have ascertained on advice that the determination was signed by the minister on 24 December 1993 but, in fact, was never tabled by the former minister. It was signed, I repeat, on 24 December 1993 but was never tabled. The fact that it was never tabled has recently come to the attention of my department, and that advice has been passed to me&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has taken three years.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Fremantle, who is an expert on remembering things, interjects and says, `It has taken three years.' Can I just say that the determination was signed by the former minister, Frank Walker, on 24 December 1993, and the fact that it was not tabled came to light because some amendment to that determination was required. When an amendment of that determination was required, then recourse was had to the record to see the date of the tabling of the original determination. It was ascertained that that had simply not been tabled by the former minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have to say that I cannot think of a baser example of ministerial failure than an inability, having signed a document, to even table it. I say to the House that the net effect of the failure of Frank Walker is that he, by that failure, and the former Keating government, by that failure, could well have cast a legal doubt over a large number of acts affecting the Aboriginal community, the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2627"> pastoral industry and the mining industry as a result. No wonder there has been a decline in confidence in relation to ministerial competence and a decline in the attitude of the community towards ministerial standards. The situation is that Frank Walker failed, having signed the determination, to put it on the table. That has recently been discovered for the reason that I explained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will table the determination later this week. Talk about a lapse of time! He signed it in December 1993 and we have to table it, belatedly, on his behalf. He has proved himself to be a rank, incompetent minister. He is an example of the rank, incompetent ministerial standards of the former government. We will table that determination. We will also take advice from the states&mdash;from the mining industry, the pastoral industry and the Aboriginal community&mdash;as to whether any other patch-up remedial measures are required. I remind the House that the legislation that was meant to be the piece de resistance of the social agenda of the Keating government meant so little to Frank Walker that he even forgot to table a bit of paper.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Minister, you told the House on 18 June, and reaffirmed it in today's article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> , that not one minister raised with you the scrapping of DIFF. Given that you have now acknowledged that at least three ministers have raised it with you, is this what you really meant when you said not one? This is not P.G. Wodehouse; this is Monty Python. If so, are there any more that you have just remembered to compound this double&hyphen;speak? Despite the bravado of last week, don't you now concede that there is significant opposition at home and abroad to the decision to scrap the DIFF scheme, and will you review that decision?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="2627" SPEAKER="Downer, Alexander, MP" NAMEID="4G4" ELECTORATE="Mayo" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Foreign Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will not be reviewing the decision. That is the first point. The second thing I would say about the DIFF scheme, as I have made clear all along, is that, inevitably, those who receive the money would rather continue to receive it. Naturally enough, if that is taken away, that is a point <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of disappointment. We understand that and we accept that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been left with a simply horrendous budgetary situation in this country. We have been left with an $8 billion hole, and we simply have to make hard decisions. It would be one thing to do what Labor Party suggests we do&mdash;that is, not make any hard decisions and walk away from the fiscal problems that we have. The fact is that we have to address those issues.</PARA>

That is something that is well and truly understood in the region and why we have to make these sorts of decisions. The opposition leaves us with a problem to fix up. When we start fixing it up, they start complaining, as you would expect. We can only ask, `What would your solution be to an $8 billion hole in the budget deficit?' Would it be increased taxes or would you just leave the $8 billion hole? You answer that question. What is your solution?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. I seek clarification on aspects of the coalition's workplace relations bill as it relates to women. Are claims that the bill will remove paid maternity leave and provisions about predictable part-time work hours from award entitlements correct?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="2627" SPEAKER="Reith, Peter, MP" NAMEID="WI4" ELECTORATE="Flinders" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Industrial Relations" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question seeking clarification. Those claims which are prevalent from opposition members are demonstrably incorrect. Their constant repetition only highlights the fact that they do not have a substantial argu <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2628"> ment against the principal elements of the package that we are putting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you take the two matters which the honourable member has raised, I actually have a document entitled `News alert' from Senator the Hon. Margaret Reynolds. This document of hers is clearly wrong. She says in this document that, under the government's policy proposals, various items will be removed from awards entitlements. For example, she lists paid maternity leave. That is just blatantly wrong. The proposition which the government is putting will see that paid maternity leave is an allowable matter. It is quite specifically mentioned in the list of allowable matters, as are other important entitlements for people, including carers leave, paternity leave and adoption leave, just to mention a number of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Reynolds also says that we are removing from awards entitlements the subject of redundancy. That is patently wrong. If the senator cared to read the government's proposals, she would see that redundancy is specifically provided. In fact, it was a matter that was raised with us during the consultation process. We ensured that it was added to the list so as to protect that basic entitlement of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Reynolds then goes on to make claims about the impact of the approach that we are taking in respect of part-time work. The claim there generally is that this will place employees essentially at the whim of employers in the times at which they work. That is quite wrong. Not only is it wrong, but it is hypocritical for that claim to be made against the government because we are actually attempting to correct one of the problems in the existing system where we have seen in recent years an explosion in the number of people who are undertaking casual work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The number of employees involved in casual work has grown from 17 per cent in 1986 under the previous government to 24 per cent of employees in 1995. The reason for that is that there are so many restrictions on the capacity of people to take up part-time work opportunities. We are removing those barriers to those opportunities for people in this proposed legislation. Women who often <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> want to juggle family and work responsibilities are denied those opportunities today by the system which was put in place by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have demonstrated, these claims are clearly and obviously demonstrably false. These are important issues. We have had a lot of discussion with women's groups about these issues. I can assure the House that we will continue those consultations during the months ahead with the Senate committee process under way. We do so on a genuine basis because we think they are important issues. We want to see the legislation changed in this country to provide real opportunities for a lot of Australians, particularly for women.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

In the process of abolishing the DIFF scheme, naturally enough there are companies that will miss out. The government obviously had to fulfil its legal obligations and we did that. But to accuse the government of somehow running what was described, I thought rather curiously, as a lunatic trade policy when it is an aid program is a bit rich coming from that side of the House when we saw under your term in office Australia's share of Asian markets actually decline under you people. Here you are criticising an aid program which you say is a trade program whilst at the very same time we saw Australia's share of Asian markets decline. Yes, the exports grew, but the fact is that our share of the markets actually declined. For you to criticise other people's trade policies, if I may say so, is a little rich.</PARA></TALK.START></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Herbert for his question because many questions have been asked in the aftermath of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> death and the loss of those 18 soldiers as to how their families are being compensated. We said at the time that we would look after those families and we will.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The compensation comes from three sources: firstly, from the military compensation scheme, with a lump sum payment of $158,000 with $52 per week payable in respect of each child, with 10 per cent for each child being held in trust until they are 18 years old; secondly, there are sums from the superannuation schemes, and there are two of those for dependants; and then there are repatriation benefits available under the VEA scheme, the veterans entitlement scheme, which is applicable to only a small number. All of those calculations are being done and, as we speak, we have a team of people going around and speaking with the dependants so they will know precisely what they are entitled to and when that money will be made available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other questions that have been raised include: what is the future of the tenure of the defence housing in which those families presently reside? The ordinary scheme of things provides that families, in the event of death, may remain in that housing for three months. We have doubled that period to six months and, if it is required to be longer, that period will also be made available. Where families are in urgent need of finances, money has already been made available from the army relief trust fund. There is also counselling advice which is going on and will continue to go on as any family is in need of that, together with the advice concerning compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would just like to also thank my colleague the Minister for Veterans' Affairs for his assistance in this matter. I think that the cooperation that has been had all round from people within the Defence Force is to be commended. Everybody has acted as speedily as they could to ensure that any hardship is minimised and the compassion is really there.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very happy to answer the question. Let me begin by saying that I have said all along that as the minister I obviously accept the responsibility for the problems that have occurred over Mr Kupa's appointment. That is a principle we apply on this side of the House. I am the minister. I inherited certain procedures from the previous government in terms of appointments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My recollection is&mdash;and I think it is correct&mdash;that I received a submission from my department, which was signed by Mr Flood, who&mdash;you are correct&mdash;was the ambassador in Jakarta in 1992.

I am quite happy to add&mdash;but all within the context of me accepting full responsibility for this; I am not trying to duckshove the responsibility to anybody else, I accept full responsibility for these problems&mdash;that the first I learned of the problems in relation to Mr Kupa's proposed appointment as ambassador to Jakarta was when I was in New York. I was faxed the usual media clippings that my department faxes to wherever I may be. One clipping was from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  referring to the 1992 incident relating to Mr Kupa.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had a function to attend. When I returned from the function, I phoned my department in Canberra. There was a discussion about this. When I got back to Australia, I saw Mr Kupa and had a discussion about that, and, I think in a very proper and very decent way, Mr Kupa offered to withdraw from the nomination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know there is this argument that you see in Greg Sheridan's columns which is your only source of ideas, as far as I can make out. I said to my staff this morning, after reading Greg Sheridan's column, `I expect he'll get up today and ask: when did I first find out about Miles Kupa and the 1992 events?' You <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> did it because it was there at the bottom of the Greg Sheridan column, wasn't it, `Don't forget, Laurie, to ask Downer that question?' I thought you would do it, and you did it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that I do not have a recollection of the 1992 events. Of course, as I have explained, my department did not canvass that issue with me. As a matter of fact, after we put the name forward to the Indonesians, to the best of my knowledge&mdash;and I tried to check this today with the department after I read the Greg Sheridan column and anticipated your question&mdash;I have been told that the Indonesians did not raise this matter either. It was not until after the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> article appeared that this matter was given consideration.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude with one other point. I accept responsibility for this, but I would also add that this has done not one jot of damage to our bilateral relationship with Indonesia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Lindsay for her question and her interest in this important matter. I am sure that most members of the House would agree that there are very few more important things than that students should acquire adequate literacy and numeracy skills while at school, and particularly while in primary school. Members of the House who were here in 1992 would remem <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2632"> ber that the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training&mdash;a bipartisan committee&mdash;stated that up to one in five children may be finishing primary school with literacy problems and that in some schools this number may be as high as even 90 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Illiteracy is a problem which is very difficult to address in high school. If it is not addressed in primary school, it is not effectively addressed at all for the vast majority of students. Estimates of the cost of illiteracy range from $3 billion to $6 billion a year in lost production. It is a significant source of behavioural problems in schools and is, of course, linked to youth unemployment. Evidence suggests that those who have not attained literacy skills in the early years of schooling are less likely to finish year 12 and that those who leave before the end of year 12 are disproportionately represented amongst the young unemployed.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a further aspect to this problem that I would like to inform the House about. It relates to the $2 billion man sitting on the other side of the House. One of the first things that seemed to us important to do was to get some research undertaken on the precise relationship between literacy problems and youth unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was aware of the fund known as the projects for national significance fund, which had about $2.8 million in it to be spent during this calendar year. When I asked the department, `Why don't we initiate some research on the linkage between literacy and youth unemployment,' they said, `Well, Minister, it is doubtful that there would be enough money left in that fund to do that.' Of course, I asked, `How could it possibly be? This is the fund for the calendar year. The election was called at the end of January; how could it be that there is almost no money left in this fund?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It turns out that after eight per cent of the year had passed, a portion of the month of January, some 76 per cent&mdash;$2 million&mdash;of the funds had already been spent. That shows that no sum is either too large, whether it be $2 billion, or too small, whether it be $2 million, for these people not to have spent in the run&hyphen;up to the election to try to protect their own hides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It turns out that $600,000 of this fund was spent on the last working day before the election was called. The member for Hotham must have known what was coming up. He certainly knew how to spend the money. He did that at the expense of the unemployed in this country. He did that at the expense of the training providers.

Can the minister inform the House of the government's progress in relation to the implementation of the coalition's election commitment to the upgrade of the Pacific Highway?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="2635" SPEAKER="Sharp, John, MP" NAMEID="AJ4" ELECTORATE="Hume" PARTY="NP" MINISTERIAL="Transport and Regional Development" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Richmond for his question. Indeed, he along with a number of his colleagues&mdash;the member for Cowper, who has been campaigning on the Pacific Highway for the whole of the period that he has been in the parliament, some 11&half; years; the member for Lyne, who has been raising this issue as a very high priority in his own electorate; the member for Page, who has been bringing this issue forward as an important issue for his electorate; and, of course, the member for Paterson, who has also highlighted this as a very important issue in his electorate&mdash;have been highlighting the concerns of the Pacific Highway for the period that they have been in the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And well they might because, as members of the House would know, the Pacific Highway has been the subject of the worst road accidents that we have seen in this country over the last number of years. There have been some 600 deaths on the Pacific Highway in the last 10 years and some 10,000 people injured on that highway over the last 10 years. Of course, the proof of that is in the quality and standard of the road itself. Anybody who has travelled on it will know it is a very poor standard road that services the fastest growing areas in Australia. So there has been a need to upgrade that road.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last election campaign, the Prime Minister&mdash;I think it might have been in the honourable member for Richmond's electorate&mdash;announced a coalition commitment to allocate $750 million over a period of 10 years and that this would be matched by the state governments in Queensland and New South Wales on a pro rata basis. Ultimately, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2636"> with the funds that the two state governments had already committed to works on that highway, that would see some $3.1 billion allocated by the three levels of government over the 10&hyphen;year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a very important initiative undertaken by us and, of course, it is one that we treat with great seriousness. We indicated at the time that we would be identifying the three worst black spots on the Pacific Highway&mdash;the Chinderah-Billinudgel section, the Brunswick Heads bypass and also the Possums Brush&hyphen;Coolongolook&hyphen;Bulahdelah section, all of which are well&hyphen;known black spots on that highway and, indeed, recognised as the worst sections on the Pacific Highway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People have become somewhat cynical about promises in regard to the Pacific Highway. People will recall that in 1990 the former Labor Commonwealth government made a commitment to allocate $100 million a year for 10 years to upgrade the Pacific Highway. We had the experience of a former Labor government promising, from 1990 onwards, to spend money on the roads. People were concerned because, what happened when Labor got into office after the 1990 election? Did they deliver on their promises to put $100 million into the Pacific Highway for the next 10 years? The answer is: no, they did not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I am very pleased to inform the House that the New South Wales Minister for Roads, Michael Knight, has announced the New South Wales government's intention, along with the Commonwealth's, to commit to the Pacific Highway the funds that were outlined by me just a few moments ago. The Minister for Roads in New South Wales, Michael Knight, has indicated that they will be addressing the Coolongolook to Bulahdelah section first, and also the Brunswick Heads bypass. I note that the New South Wales minister has not announced at this stage the Chindera to Billinudgel section of that Pacific Highway upgrade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call on the Minister for Roads in the New South Wales parliament, Mr Michael Knight, to join with us in our commitment to that road. I know the honourable member for Richmond is totally and utterly committed to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the upgrading of that section of road&mdash;indeed, a complete new realignment for that section of road&mdash;that will lead to a large reduction in the number of deaths and injuries that occur on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I ask the New South Wales minister, Mr Knight, to join with us in that commitment to the Chindera&hyphen;Billinudgel section of the Pacific Highway, to upgrade it to ensure that we reduce the number of deaths and injuries on the Pacific Highway.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Can the minister outline how the government's industrial relations reforms will benefit the thousands of small businesses and the unacceptably high number of unemployed people on the Mornington Peninsula?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question without notice seeking clarification of the impact of the bill. There is no question that this bill is directed to providing some real incentive and encouragement to small business; and in the area that we represent jointly on the Mornington Peninsula the small business community is the backbone of the private sector. It is only by giving the backbone of the private sector some real encouragement that we are going to eventually turn around the unemployment problem inherited from the previous government.  </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2637">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no wonder that the former Minister for Industrial Relations was given the foreign affairs job, because I tell you what: he couldn't go around Australia talking about economic policy domestically. I suppose it is no surprise, given the record of the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, that they gave him a Treasury job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of small business, what are we doing? We are certainly proposing the change to the infamous unfair dismissal law. There is a lot of evidence, anecdotal recorded evidence, that that law of Labor's&mdash;the Brereton law on unfair dismissal&mdash;has actually been a major disincentive to job creation. The sooner we chuck out his law and replace it with a fairer law, which is what we propose to do, then the better chance there will be that people are going to have jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at what we are doing in the training area: that again is going to free up a lot of opportunities for people to get a job and some training to go with it. The great thing about that is that it opens up prospects for people to earn more in the future and make a real contribution to our small businesses. On the Mornington Peninsula, where vignerons, for example, have a growing industry dovetailing with the tourist industry, there are tremendous job prospects for growth, for higher wages for people in the future&mdash;opportunities that have been denied by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Lastly, I could not sit down without mentioning the plight of young people in particular. We have in so many parts of regional and rural Australia very high levels of unemployment amongst young people, and they are very concerned that if Labor's scheme to abolish junior wage rates were to come into place next year then a lot more young people would in fact lose their jobs. For that reason we are moving to shut off that particular time bomb ticking under the Brereton legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Are we directed to helping small business? Absolutely yes. Will this industrial relations package be a great benefit to small business? Absolutely yes. That is why we are determined to seek its early passage.</PARA>

It came from a series of answers given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the course of the previous weeks in which he denied up hill and down dale that he had been the recipient of any senior level approaches, had engaged in any senior level discussions on these matters with those representatives. It would be very simple for him to come in here today and say, `Oh, by the way, when I said "by the way" about that last night, I was talking about a piece of advice which triggered my memory after question time yesterday that I had had those conversations.' In question time yesterday we put a persistent series of questions, as we had before, to the Minister for Foreign Affairs as to whether or not to his knowledge there had been, or whether or not he could recollect, any sets of conversations he had had with people on this absolutely vital matter of national importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The DIFF program is no joke. This program has become central to our aid program over the last many years now and it is one of those elements of our aid program which builds a very substantial level of confidence in our region in Australian business. It is one of those things that, when you go out to the public and defend our foreign aid program, you are able to point out is not only a question of largess and basic human decency, important though they are in a foreign aid program, but also a matter of advancing Australian interests and Australian jobs.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a serious program. The level of objection which the Minister for Foreign Affairs has received indicates how well received it is. He has received objections now from the very highest level of the Chinese government and, he admits to us, from the very highest level of the Indonesian government. But here he has squirmed away from his lying to this House a second time.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He deceived this House for a second time. It would have been the easiest thing, if it had struck his mind, for him to stand up in this place and say, `Look, I found out about this after question time yesterday.' But he did not do that. He said that `sometime this week' he had been advised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is absolutely critical. That is why there is a question time. That is why you are accountable in this place at question time. You are allowed to evade answers, if you wish. But, when you do give answers, you are obliged to give precise and accurate ones. In this debate you are not in a situation where you are permitted to slip slide away&mdash;to come into this place and say, `Oh, well, sometime this week.' If it happened to be that you received that advice before question time yesterday, then on those grounds you are, in addition, culpable for having deceived this House, for having misled the public and for having misled Australia. You have committed again, for the second time, a most serious dereliction of your duty to this chamber as a minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not often in censure motions in this chamber that we get a serious censure motion. Generally speaking, the moving of a censure motion in the Australian parliament is the sort of thing that is done at the end of a session. You may be dealing with some aspect of the government's handling of the economy and you have run out of being able to use the MPIs for those sorts of processes, so you get into the chamber and  move a censure motion on the handling of the economy or something like that. I am afraid to say that, over the years, the censure motion has become much <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2640"> devalued currency indeed. What the censure motion, properly used, is really about in this chamber is going to the heart of the accountability of a minister and a government&mdash;accountability for their performance and their willingness to adhere to the standards that have been set them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where has this minister failed to adhere to the standards? Firstly, he failed last week. For that, we moved this proposition yesterday. He is being mocked in the media today&mdash;not simply by Greg Sheridan and everybody who chooses to abuse this place, but by virtually every other journalist who carries the parliamentary pages. They can see, even if the foreign minister cannot, that a letter which is signed on behalf of a minister is a letter from a minister. They can see that; he cannot, apparently, see that. He has got up and fessed up, effectively, to misleading on that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then he came into this chamber last night and put down the most revealing and pathetic excuse. Whatever interpretation you might have about Madam Wu and the way in which she conducts her correspondence, whatever view you might have of Minister Wu on whether or not she really corresponds with you when she corresponds through one of her vice ministers, you cannot possibly have that view of Professor Ginandjar and Dr Habibie.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nobody who knows anything about Indonesia fails to know those two gentlemen. Those two gentlemen are not only their nation's senior economic development ministers; those two gentlemen are often touted in the media as potential presidents of their nation. I said yesterday I did not find it terribly surprising that the foreign minister could come into this place and say, `Well, no, I haven't been approached by people at ministerial level,' and to sort of wrap that smarmy scarf around himself that he does and say, `Maybe it's been raised with junior officials but it's never been raised with me.' That does not surprise me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the first meeting he has had with these gentlemen. The normal way of being dealt with in this region is that you do not put on the table difficult things for a first meeting. They are trying to get to know you. They are trying to get to understand you. They are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> trying to see where you come from. It is a most unusual thing for them to put any matter of controversy on the table. They assume that you have a degree of intelligence. When you come in, they make that basic assumption&mdash;they assume that you have a degree of intelligence. They assume that, when you approach them and have been advised by your advisers about their concerns, you know about them and do not need to be reminded. Maybe, just maybe, over lunch they might quietly mention these matters to you. But, if they mention them at all, it is most unusual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you came into this place and fessed up to yesterday was the fact that you had had a conversation with two senior ministers&mdash;and if they raise such matters with you in your first meeting, by golly, they mean it. If they are in a position where they will step aside from normal processes in this region and raise with you a controversial matter, you know this is something they believe to be a very serious matter indeed. `Oh,' you said, as you came in yesterday, `I had a few brief remarks referred to me by them in the course of that.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then you found yourself trapped. How did you try to get out of that incredible trap yesterday? You said, `I was not lying to you, I was not deceiving you, because I have decided to close the envelope.' So it does not matter that we announced that the DIFF program was gone on 15 February. No, the time the DIFF program went was really 16 May when we made an announcement about it then. It was really in existence until that point of time&mdash;not under any threat at all at that point of time. No, the DIFF program was out there singing and dancing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So obviously Minister Habibie, Minister Ginandjar and probably also Minister Wu were dragging it out of the heavens&mdash;it came down along with the mandate and was something that they could raise with you by virtue of the fact that they have third, fourth, fifth and sixth sight. No, Minister, they raised it with you because you had announced that program. However, I guess what we will get is for you to stand up here and say, `Well, you know, between the dates of 16 May and 17 May or at precisely 12.01 on 17 May, I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2641"> did not receive any serious approaches from any minister concerning that DIFF program.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No. You redefined it yesterday. That was not defined that way in any question that has been directed to you or any answer that you have given. That was a convenient little slip slide on 16 May which you decided you would just try to skate away with&mdash;just as you have been trying to skate away with every foreign policy boo&hyphen;boo, faux pas, that you have managed to commit since you have had this job. So you redefined it. Well, you might redefine it because, at the very least, if you fail to convince anybody that you redefined it&mdash;if you fail to convince anybody that somewhere or other embedded in those questions, embedded in the answer, is the ice that you gave them to skate on&mdash;you have lied twice.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has misled twice. He misled once last week when he gave that answer on Minister Wu and he misled again yesterday. The consequences of that misleading ought to be severe for any minister. He chose yesterday not to defend himself but to attack the former Minister for Transport, the now shadow minister for foreign affairs, the honourable member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton). His method of defence was not one that you would normally mount in these sorts of matters; it was an attack. He will need to do a great deal better than that today because he has now added to the record very dramatically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Go back over the questions that he answered and look at his defence on this most serious matter. He has been on the back foot for the last few months as far as DIFF is concerned. He has sought a defence in the view that this is not taken terribly seriously. He has sought under constant pressure&mdash;it is not as though we have asked him no questions on this&mdash;to have the view abroad that, even though this is a bit of a problem, it is being handled effectively at the lower levels and it is not something that need impinge upon the relationship between the senior figures in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that defence he bases the notion that he is an acceptable foreign minister. On that defence he bases the notion that he is capable of handling the issues of survival for the Australian nation. The Minister for Foreign Affairs handles the issues of survival for the Australian nation. His relationship with the countries in the region is critical. His ability to deal honestly with the Australian people is critical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we find is sleight of hand, tossed off; on a couple of occasions he comes into this chamber and fesses up. He did not accept the view that he had offended in any way. He chose to interpret what is blindingly obvious to absolutely everyone around this place as <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2642"> something different&mdash;black was white as far as he was concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second time round he could not get away with that. There is absolutely no way you can describe those two officials from Indonesia as anything other than precisely the sort of people he had denied he had ever discussed these matters with. He invented another block in the process to explain a set of totally and utterly inaccurate answers in this House. That second block was to put that proposition down about the 16th. He compounded all of this by misleading the Chinese, Indonesians and everybody else as to the true reasons they arrived at the position they arrived at on DIFF.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is critical in his failure to answer the questions that I have just put to him&mdash;and you would have to say that if the answer were not bad then he would have had no compunction in giving it&mdash;is that, had he been advised by his department of the existence of those conversations prior to the answers that he gave in question time yesterday, then he has, under any conceivable interpretation, under any interpretation that can be put down by anybody who has ever debated a censure motion in this chamber or anywhere else that devotes itself to the Westminster system, gone on immediate advice and walked into the chamber and been unwilling to accept the embarrassment. He has concealed the source of that embarrassment and misled this House in the grossest possible way. That is completely inconsistent with his oath of office and with the obligations that are imposed upon him by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For that reason alone, and on hearing this debate and hearing question time, the Prime Minister would be obliged to pick up the phone and ring the minister the moment he leaves this chamber and tell him, `You are on a week's notice. We will find some way of getting you through, Alexander, until this week is over so that we do not take too much embarrassment, but after that you are the ambassador to the Netherlands.' That is what ought to occur if that happens to be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if he is now able, having ducked the opportunity to clear his name twice in question time, to get up and say sotto voce, if he <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is capable of sotto voce in this place, `No, I did not receive that information until yesterday afternoon, after question time. My memory was triggered then.' he still should be censured by this place for what he revealed yesterday afternoon and his continuing failure to give a satisfactory explanation on anything other than a defeat on party lines on the earlier point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point about all of this&mdash;and we have to get back to this to set the scene for the seriousness of all of this&mdash;is the position they hold on DIFF. It is fundamentally based on another untruth handed out to the Australian people. They say the position that they are adopting on DIFF is a position that they are adopting because they found themselves in an unexpected budgetary situation. They did not. The position that they adopted on DIFF is identical to the position that they adopted in the election campaign. DIFF was sacrificed to pay for pork&hyphen;barrelling. It was in `Meeting our Commitments'&mdash;part of the funding base for the pork barrel that they put in place during the course of the last election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why you put it in place. It had nothing to do with alleged deficits. It had nothing to do with savings ratios. It had nothing to do with a vital budgetary task. It had everything to do with how you pay for the opportunity to sleaze your way into office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not as though you were not picked up on all of this. Even your own director was getting up there and saying what a pity it was that you found yourselves in a position where you overpromised, when you discovered with a shock that we were not matching your promises. What we were doing during the election campaign was levelling with the Australian people that you cannot do these things, while you went in and overpromised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2643"> So you have knocked over a vital element of Australia's national interest, a vital employment opportunity to a large number of Australians. You have compounded that deceit with a series of serious misleadings to this House&mdash;a misleading in relation to the Chinese and a misleading in the relationship now, which you revealed yesterday, with these two Indonesian ministers. That has been com pounded by your unwillingness to give an honest answer in this place on when your memory was triggered about your conversations with those Indonesian ministers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must admit that I did think the effort at question time today was one of the great damp squibs of Australian politics. There they have been all morning trying to think up some tactic to try to keep their momentum from yesterday going. There in particular was the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) sitting down reading once more through the articles written by Greg Sheridan to see if he could get any ideas, which is where the only ideas he has ever had since he has been in this position have come from. We had question after question and, frankly, they were questions which I thought were weak, unimaginative and uncreative. There is no doubt that this is just an attempt to reheat what was done yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously the government totally rejects this censure motion. I made many of the points perfectly clear in the statement I made last night and in question time yesterday. In relation to the letter from the Chinese vice minister, for example, I made the point yesterday in question time that my recollection was that the department had said a vice minister was the equivalent of a departmental head. It just happened that after question time but before the censure motion it was drawn to my attention that in fact this position was the position of deputy secretary rather than of secretary in our system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did say, and I made it perfectly clear, that I would go away and have a look through papers that were in the department. After question time I had a meeting. After the meetings I had were concluded, I went through material to see whether there was anything I should add to my comments. That is what I owe the House. This is not some gross act of deceit and deception, as the opposition is claiming. I went back to my office and had meetings. I had to fulfil my <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> meetings&mdash;some of them were somewhat put back because of yesterday's stunt&mdash;and then I went through material with a view to coming back to the House, fulfilling the commitment I had made in question time and adding to anything I had said during the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has made clear in his standards, he expects ministers to correct records or add to records if it is necessary. The fact is that I did. I fulfilled that responsibility. This censure motion is not worthy of the House when for the first time in many years we are seeing ministers fulfilling their responsibilities&mdash;ministers who are prepared to come here and correct the record if that is necessary, which I did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is the Labor Party arguing that I should not do that? Is that what it is arguing? That is what the Labor Party argues&mdash;that I should. And I did. The fact is that I gave a commitment in question time, I fulfilled that commitment and I made the statement that I made at 8.32 p.m. yesterday evening when the House sat. My recollection is that the House rose rather early yesterday afternoon and did not sit through until 6.30 p.m. Then I went back to the House at 8.32 p.m. after there was an initial discussion in the House. I left a dinner, which the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) attended, and simply made a statement. You cannot ask more of a minister than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other argument the Labor Party is pushing is this argument that we said before the election we would abolish DIFF. Yes, we did. We did exactly that. After the election, as is obvious from the newspapers, there were people in the business community&mdash;it is true; I admit that&mdash;who came to us and asked us to review the decision. Even today we had the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) asking us to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact is that, due to the fiscal circumstances we inherited, there was simply no way we could afford to do that&mdash;or yes, I suppose we could have. What we could have done is abolish $124 million or so worth of other programs in the overall aid programs. Is the Labor Party asking that we do that? Is that the proposition that is being put by the Labor <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2644"> Party? That means that we would simply have to cut back programs on HIV&hyphen;AIDS in Africa. We would have to cut back on programs in the South Pacific and Pacific Islands countries. Frankly, I think that would have been a harsher thing to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not to say that the DIFF program disappears without some people bemoaning its departure. Of course, there are. The Labor Party, with confected anger, says that it is now sorry about this decision. You say that it was in meeting our commitments; you did not raise it during the election campaign too often.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All this brings me to the final point I want to make in this debate, and that relates to the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith. Yesterday in question time the member for Kingsford Smith&mdash;playing a political game, which is all this is about because he cannot think of anything serious to do during question time except ask trivial and irrelevant questions&mdash;said this in a question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can I conclude by asking: what is the minister's response to the fact that the letters exchanged between the minister and vice minister of the Chinese ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation concerning DIFF were actually leaked from the Chinese embassy in Canberra on the day after your answer last Tuesday?</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to make further points. Then during the MPI, not recognising the mistake he had made, he compounded the problem when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is little wonder that the Chinese government was enraged . . . that within 24 hours they had taken action to expose the minister's deceit.</PARA>
<PARA>My department had a telephone call later that afternoon from the Chinese councillor, the deputy ambassador, the deputy head of mission at the Chinese embassy. My department passed on to me that the ambassador had categorically denied that the embassy had issued to anybody a letter sent by the vice minister to me, the opposition or the press. We had the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith, who had suddenly become the guardian of integrity, in here accusing the Chinese embassy of leaking. We then had the Chinese embassy put into a situation where it simply had to make some sort of response. Subsequently, the Chinese government has instituted an investigation into this matter. I rang the Chinese ambassador this morning to talk to him about this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can tell you what I am concerned about: the opposition's frolic has been abused by the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith. As a result of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that, the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith has done material damage to our relationship with China from his position as a member of the opposition. That is quite some achievement!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Chinese ambassador has been seriously concerned about this issue. Let me not go too far on this matter. Let me not say too much. It is all very well for them to attack me as a minister of the Crown, and I am quite happy to put up with that. But it is not all right to launch an attack on the Chinese embassy and accuse it of leaking. It is not all right to do that. As a result, I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"this House censures the Member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith for his allegations yesterday that the Chinese Embassy and the Chinese Government had deliberately leaked correspondence sent to the Minister for Foreign Affairs from a Chinese Vice&hyphen;Minister, Mr Sun Zhenyu, which have the potential to damage Australia's relations with the People's Republic of China."</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let the House be in no doubt: there are no excuses left for the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer). He cannot claim that there has been a corroboree this time, he cannot say that he has undergone any sort of emotional experience and he cannot say that there is something else out there that was on his mind at the time. For two weeks now he has had every chance to come to the parliament and fulfil his duties as a minister by being honest in the manner in which he answers questions. For two weeks he has done nothing but mislead this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is with a great deal of regret that we see ourselves on this side of the House with a second censure that we have been forced to bring into this House when we have already determined that that would be the last thing we wanted to have happened in the first term of this government. Why have we been forced to do it? We have been forced to do it because of the utterly disgraceful performance of the minister and the fact that, although he has been given every opportunity, he would never answer the key question of when he was told, when he became aware and when he was advised by his department that he had misled the parliament. Clearly, in our view he <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2646"> was told that at least immediately after his performance in this chamber on 18 June. One cannot believe that the department would not have brought it to his attention immediately. They had before them&mdash;indeed, the whole of the department was watching on the scanners&mdash;the words of the minister when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have travelled around South&hyphen;East Asia and North&hyphen;East Asia and met foreign ministers and other ministers from those countries there and here, not one minister&mdash;be he a foreign minister or an economic development minister&mdash;has expressed any concern to me about the abolition of the DIFF program.</PARA>
<PARA>You could not get a more open and shut case of someone being plainly, completely and absolutely untruthful in the manner in which they handled and answered a question in this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been an elected member of one parliament or another since 1970. I have never seen a performance such as this. I have never seen a more disgraceful demonstration by anyone in a betrayal of their fundamental duty under the Westminster system. The minister stood here in the chamber and said to everyone, including the Australian parliament, the Australian electorate and our international neighbours, that he had not received a single representation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not one! If this was an issue of some deep and abiding concern to the few countries that you mention . . . </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as the Labor Party spuriously tries to claim, then you would have thought that they would raise it with me as the foreign minister.</PARA>
<PARA>What was the House supposed to make of those comments? What were the Australian people supposed to make of them? What were our neighbours&mdash;who had beaten a path to the minister's door, had written letters, sent their envoys and their diplomatic missions and had seen him in person at the very highest levels&mdash;to make of an answer such as that? It was such an untruthful and absolutely dishonest answer. He went on that day to say:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is that of course some officials who are involved in the details . . . have raised issues with my department, and you would not expect otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA>What are we to make of that? We are to make of that that this was an absolute nothing, that nothing hung on it and it was not a big deal. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But if this was a serious issue in our relationships they would raise it at the ministerial level.</PARA>
<PARA>He did not know then that we would be fortunate enough to have those letters fall into our hands&mdash;the letter written by Vice Minister Sun on behalf of Minister Wu. When this man was untruthful in the parliament he obviously did not know that those letters were going to fall into our hands. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They would be writing me letters. They would be expressing their concerns to me. There has been not one raised.</PARA>
<PARA>All the time he had letters and he had personal visits and discussions not with one minister but with at least three ministers that we know of now. There are probably a whole lot more of them out there. Could he tell the truth? Not on your nelly!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said this morning that the honourable member's problem is that he suffers from smart alec syndrome. He has been caught as a victim of his own disease. Given the opportunity of coming to the parliament, as was his beholden duty, and answering honestly, he would not do it. Given the opportunity, having been told immediately afterwards that he had misinformed the parliament, did he come here on the Tuesday night in respect to the Chinese letters? Did he come here on the Wednesday, all day and through the evening? Did he come here on the Thursday? Did he come here before the parliament adjourned? Did he come to the parliament first thing yesterday when the House met? Not on your nelly he didn't. He sat back aiming to con his way through this&mdash;aiming to deceive Australia, this parliament and our neighbours who had gone to him with their complaints in good faith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not just 18 June that saw him being so absolutely dishonest. He stood here in the chamber yesterday and said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2647">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am happy to check my records in relation to any other conversations I have had, but I certainly have no recollection whatsoever of foreign ministers or presidents raising this issue with me. The simple point is that this is not a matter of deep contention in our bilateral relationships.</PARA>
<PARA>Members will notice the different formulation of words. He was admitting that he had been told by the department about the Chinese letters, but he was not letting on for a moment about the fact that his answer on 18 June was plainly deceptive in respect of the visit to him by two Indonesian ministers. He knew then, and of course he had already written that wonderful article for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  submitted before question time yesterday. I might say that this is the article which very robustly and probably unfairly&mdash;one could not believe the truth of what he asserts&mdash;attacks the newspaper's foreign correspondent. This is what he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not one foreign minister, minister for trade, president or prime minister from the region has ever once raised the issue of DIFF with me. Not one. Not ever.</PARA>
<PARA>Not one! Not ever! In that formulation of words, as we pointed out in question time today, there was suddenly an omission&mdash;economic development ministers. Such a prominent feature in the answer on 18 June suddenly disappeared and has been replaced by `prime ministers' and `presidents'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does this mean? I will tell the House what it means. It means that this man is the all&hyphen;time deceiver. He knew exactly what he was doing. He knew it on the 18th. He knew it when he did not come into the House on the 19th or 20th or yesterday. He knew it when he came to this chamber and answered the censure motion and again failed to fess up, failed to own up, failed to make any mention about Habibie and failed to be truthful in his dealing with the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first lesson I learnt came from a leader of a parliament in 1981, Neville Wran, who said, `You don't have to answer the question in any way other than you see fit. It is not mandatory that you tell them everything they want to know, but the one thing you must never do is tell a lie knowingly or even unwittingly. If you do so unwittingly, you make sure you beat it straight back into the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parliament and repair that situation and straighten up the record.' Some years later I came to Canberra and my colleagues here on the opposition benches and those who have served in cabinet would recall the advice of Prime Minister Hawke and later on the advice of Prime Minister Keating, which was, `The first lesson is that you don't tell lies, because lies are the one thing that run you out in this business. Lies are the one reason you will have to resign. If you tell a lie, that's it. Your beholden duty is to tell the truth and not mislead the parliament.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This fellow has not lied once, he has not lied twice; he has lied repeatedly, and he has lied in respect of his beholden duty. He has lied to the Australian parliament; and he has lied to the Australian people.</PARA>

In the process he has betrayed his obligations to represent Australia. This is the man who is the diplomatic face of Australia. This is the man whom we have to rely upon in terms of the trusts, understanding and honour that exists between us and China, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines&mdash;all of whom have been deceived along with the Australian people and this parliament by this minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today there were two questions in 10 minutes. Would he answer either of them? Not on your life! Would he answer them? Even at this point, do we know exactly when he was told? Of course we don't because, as I said, he suffers from smart alec syndrome. He said here in answer to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) that this was just a political game by the opposition, just a mere frolic. This is no frolic. This is his honour; this is his ministerial life on the line. Have no doubt that, no matter what happens today, no matter what the application of the numbers in this parliament is and no matter what happens in this parliament, he can never properly represent our interests internationally again, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2648"> because he is simply a deceiver and someone who has betrayed his absolute duty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the start of this debate when the Leader of the Opposition was on his feet we saw something pretty serious. We saw the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) come into the chamber and take the minister aside. Those of us who were watching intently from this side of the House saw the colour drain out of the minister's face. We know what the Prime Minister was telling him. He was saying, `You may have lied to the parliament on the 18th. You may have failed to tell the truth ever since, but right now you had better start telling the truth.' Did he do it in his reply? Did he fess up to when he was told? Again, obfuscation; again avoiding it. The fact is that this fellow will only ever own up when he is caught. That is what today has established. He will only ever own up when he is caught, and even then he will squirm and try every device possible to weasel his way out of it. Well, he has been caught, caught, caught and caught again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nothing is more instructive in this than to look at the words he chose to use when he slunk into this chamber, without the customary advice to the opposition, at 8.32 p.m. last night and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So that the record is complete, I have had records checked back to 11 March, when the government came to office, to establish whether the issue was discussed at all by me with any minister prior to the abolition of the DIFF program. On 16 April, a month before the abolition of the DIFF program, the program was briefly referred to in a discussion with me in Jakarta by Professor Ginandjar, the Indonesian Minister for National Development Planning; and Dr Habibie, the Minister of State for Research and Technology. I tell the House this so that the record is complete.</PARA>
<PARA>Then he slunk out of the chamber. He was dealing there with two of the biggest hitters in the whole of the Indonesian administration&mdash;people he thinks he can take lightly and be untruthful to&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said it rather well&mdash;perhaps it was a slip of the tongue&mdash;when during his contribution he said words to the effect that in all these years in this House you do not see many genuine, decent, substantial motions of censure. How true he was. In fact, this is yet another example of a censure motion which lacks substance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those who might be listening to this debate at home, it would be fair for them to ask themselves what all the brouhaha is about. In very simple terms, yesterday's censure motion was on the rather flimsy basis that a letter from a vice minister from the Chinese government was equivalent to a ministerial representation when in fact the vice minister's equivalent status in Australia is that of a deputy secretary&mdash;so clearly not a ministerial matter. But, when you are desperate for a line, that is sufficient to mount a censure motion. When you have had a few years in opposition, which this tactic suggests you will have, you might then appreciate that if you are going to run a censure motion you really need to have some substance to it. That was yesterday's motion disposed of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today's censure motion is just as flimsy as yesterday's. Today's motion is really based on some allegation about when the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) may have examined material about conversations and discussions he had had with certain senior members of the Indonesian government. As the minister has said, he did not examine that material until after question time. As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record shows, he came into the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2649"> House last night and made a full statement as to the circumstances of those conversations and discussions and made the position very clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the opposition had any sense of reality and there was any sense of substance to these propositions, quite frankly that would have finished the matter there and then. But so short are they of argument that they have mounted yet another censure motion. What is interesting is, so inexperienced is the shadow minister for foreign affairs, the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton), that the only damage to come out of this is the collateral damage to our relationship with the Chinese government, in particular the embassy, by the unfounded and false allegation that the Chinese government had leaked material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are quite entitled to be unhappy about the allegation made by the shadow minister for foreign affairs, the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith, who said only yesterday in this House in one of his questions, which would be better described as a speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can I conclude by asking: what is the minister's response to the fact that the letters exchanged between the minister and the vice&hyphen;minister of the Chinese ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation concerning DIFF were actually leaked by the Chinese embassy in Canberra on the day after your answer last Tuesday?</PARA>
<PARA>That is the most substantial of the issues which have arisen in the debate we had yesterday and the debate we are having today. It follows a course which must now be familiar to the Minister for Foreign Affairs&mdash;that is, his job is basically to clean up the mess left by the previous government, the damage caused by the previous government, and the damage they are still continuing. So expert are they at incompetence that their incompetence has extended into opposition and we have this unfounded, false and unreasonable allegation made against the Chinese representatives in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For that reason the amendment ought to be carried by the House&mdash;I confidently predict that it will be&mdash;and I think that would be a fair outcome and a fair adjudication of the issues. The fact is that the shadow minister should be condemned for making such an allegation against the Chinese embassy. As I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> say, it is a pattern of conduct familiar to the minister because he has had to clean up the opposition's incompetence and the damage done to Australia's relations with so many others in our region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure many members will remember the unfortunate damage done to the Australia&hyphen;Malaysia relationship by the previous Prime Minister in his personal remarks about the current Prime Minister of Malaysia. He then had the gall to say during the election campaign that the coalition parties would have difficulty maintaining and establishing good relations with our neighbours. It was simply a matter of weeks that the Minister for Foreign Affairs was able to initiate high level meetings between the two Prime Ministers and set that relationship on a sound footing. We on this side welcome a sound footing with our Asian neighbours, the Malaysians in particular, with whom we have had a good, substantial relationship over a very long period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate the minister on that early success of his in the foreign affairs portfolio. Likewise, in our relationship with New Zealand. The opposition is talking about the importance of our relationship with our neighbours. They are talking about it, doing some collateral damage as they go, but the fact of the matter is that the one person in this parliament who has actually had to take the initiative to rebuild our relationships is none other than the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate him on his rebuilding of not only our relationship with Malaysia&mdash;which must be a matter of great embarrassment to members on the other side&mdash;but also our relationship with the New Zealanders, which was done irreparable damage by the clumsy handling of the shadow minister at the table. Those are just two of the early successes of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His record shows that in the early months of his time as the minister he has notched up a number of successes in the Australian national interest. For example, in respect of the issue of land mines he has delivered support for the international ban on production, sale and distribution of landmines and suspension on Australian use of landmines, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2650"> which is something the previous government was unable to achieve, and has established the free Indo&hyphen;China of landmines program, with a $12 million initiative.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, sure. I will say something about that in a moment, if you can contain your party political interest in the matter. In the national interest, the minister has established a good working relationship with the foreign minister of Indonesia. That is very important to Australia's interests. He raised the sensitive East Timor issue consistently and firmly. Very importantly, and it will be welcomed by many Australians, he won a concession from the Indonesians about the need for true productions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has also had a very successful visit to Singapore, which has been indicated by the declaration of Singaporean support for Australian membership of ASEM, and he won wide support in the reporting of his trip to Indonesia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addressing Australia's massive $8 billion black hole, which we inherited from the previous government, obviously a lot of hard decisions have had to be made. In regard to the aid issue, we had a choice to make: a choice between cutting back some parts of the program as opposed to others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the options would have been to cut back further on humanitarian aid. But we have made a choice not to do so and to make a choice in regard to that aspect of the aid program which in particular delivers and is relevant to the Australian business community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to that pre-election commitment, and in the implementation of that policy since the election, there has been some criticism. Of course there has been. There are some Australian companies which have benefited from that program in the past, and they would like that program to continue. It is true that in the region there are some who would likewise like that project and that program to continue. Representations at various levels have been made to that effect. But, in any fair analysis, the representations that have been made and the criticisms that have been levelled are very much at the margin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is really stretching a long bow to suggest that these issues in some way go to the substance of our relations with those in our region. I do not think that even the shadow minister&mdash;incompetent as he might be; if only you could get him aside and get some sense out of him&mdash;would attempt to claim otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should add that the Australian community, particularly those from non-government organisations, have been very critical of the DIFF program over the years. That just reflects the fact that there is a balance of opinion about the DIFF program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no surprise that the opposition would recoil at the fact that the government might continue with a commitment that it gave prior <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2651"> to an election. Their history shows that the commitments they made prior to elections, particularly prior to the 1993 election, were commitments that they then immediately broke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The more general point I want to make is that the minister in this particular case has made a very clean breast of the situation. In fact, during question time he said that he had checked the record further, and he came in last night and said that this was the situation and this was the advice that he has been given. He has been totally open about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it absolutely amazing that these people have moved a censure motion after we have witnessed the low and the poor&mdash;in fact, the non-existent&mdash;ministerial standards exhibited by them for years and years when they were in government. One example that comes to mind is the standards exhibited by the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence). It would not be parliamentary for me to hold up an extract from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of 19 November 1995. The fact is that that minister was shown to have not told the truth. That was adjudicated by an independent royal commission. When we called for her resignation, there was no prospect of you upholding ministerial standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes to ministerial competence, we on this side find it a bit galling to get a diatribe from the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith. He is the man who, for example, introduced the unfair dismissal law, based on an ILO convention, which has been one of the great fiascos of industrial relations law, and perhaps the highpoint of his incompetence, but backed up by a series of blunders as a minister, which I am sure many members will remember: the single aviation market with New Zealand, the Monarch Seaview disaster, the claim that you could not give ANL away, which was the subject of a series of censure motions, of course totally disregarded by the other side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the fact of the matter is that yesterday's censure motion was about the status of a letter from a deputy secretary; today's censure motion is about when the minister examined material. The fact is that he examined material after question time and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> he came into the House last night. The fact is that your ministers never reached such standards in the whole 13 years you were in government. As has now transpired, collateral damage has been done and the shadow minister ought to be censured. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The two sets of remarks that you obliged me to withdraw were when on one occasion I used the expression `deliberately misleading' and when on another occasion I used the expression `lie'. The point I made to you very briefly was that, in a censure motion, both terms have been found to be parliamentary in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now cite for your consideration&mdash;you can go away and think about this&mdash;a motion moved by the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the then Leader of the Opposition, in the course of a debate in the middle of last year. I could draw attention to many others. The motion says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this House condemns the Prime Minister for deliberately misleading the House . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The term `deliberately misleading' was used then and, I might say, was repeated throughout. At one stage of the remarks&mdash;and he was not obliged to withdraw them&mdash;Mr Howard said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That was not a vague statement; it was not an expression of opinion; it was not an exaggeration; it was, in our view, a straight&hyphen;out lie. I repeat that: it was a straight&hyphen;out lie, lie, lie by the Prime Minister. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>

And while in absolutely every other set of circumstances they have been obliged to be withdrawn&mdash;indeed, from time to time I can recollect you yourself advising us on the deliberately misleading one, not the lie one, that if we wish to add the word `deliberately' to the word `misleading' then we are obliged to move a motion in order to be able to do that&mdash;there is ample precedent that there are circumstances in one type of debate only, and that is a censure debate, when both those expressions are permitted.</PARA></TALK.START>

There is a very big difference. What you decide to do in relation to the matter is entirely one for you, sir.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply make the two points&mdash;I notice your predecessor nodding assent that there is a difference&mdash;that there is a difference, and that difference has been pointed out in the past by people occupying the chair. I think the former Prime Minister made that observation&mdash;not that I would normally draw on him as an authority on parliamentary matters. But I do think there is a difference between describing a particular proposition as a lie and branding somebody as a liar. I think there is a qualitative difference between the two.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second observation I would make is that, if you go back over the record, you will find that the literature is very mixed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;There can be few issues that touch the public closer than the safety of our public transport. And one of its most sensitive aspects, where there has been grave concern for some time now, is aviation safety.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 3 May 1994 I rose in this House to speak on the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1994 and addressed in my speech the matter of the Monarch air crash that took place at Young, on 11 June 1993, killing all five passengers, the pilot and the co&hyphen;pilot. I took a close interest in that tragedy because all the passengers were known to me and most of them were my constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is now over three years after that air crash and, on 6 June this year, the New South Wales coroner delivered his findings at the Young courthouse, following one of the longest coronial inquests in this country's history. His findings have confirmed many of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2657"> the concerns that I put before the House on 3 May, two years earlier. I told the House then that the Civil Aviation Authority had been aware for some time of the deficiencies of Monarch Air and that, despite recommendations by airworthiness inspectors to ground the operator, these recommendations had been overruled by senior management. I told the House that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CAA has obviously fallen down in its prime responsibility to conduct safety regulation of civil air operations in Australia. It has no excuses. The CAA has been given the teeth. The problem is that it is not using them. My constituents, through no fault of their own, flew in an aircraft that operated and that the CAA knew was likely to operate in breach of air safety regulations and were the victims of a fatal accident.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>I also alerted the House to the fact that the Monarch case was not the iceberg itself but merely the tip of the iceberg. I cited another airline&mdash;Seaview&mdash;which was also being allowed to operate despite the recommendation of an airworthiness inspector to ground it. I told the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CAA has been aware of the situation for some time and, once again, nothing has been done to stop that operator from risking the lives of the unwitting passengers despite a CAA airworthiness inspector's recommendation that the operator be grounded.</PARA>
<PARA>In the week before I made that speech, a DC3 had crashed into Botany Bay narrowly avoiding sending its 21 passengers&mdash;a school party on their way to Norfolk Island to participate in Anzac Day celebrations&mdash;to their deaths. My warning regarding Seaview was not heeded. On 2 October 1994, a Seaview plane crashed on its way to Lord Howe Island killing all eight passengers and the pilot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is one of the great tragedies of our time that it took the senseless and needless deaths of 16 people to provoke action to deal with the situation that I put before the House on 3 May 1994: that the CAA had clearly lost sight of its primary responsibility for the maintenance of air safety above all other considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I brought that state of affairs to the attention of the House on 3 May, I said that there were several measures that were essential. I said then that the first action must be for the government to review the priorities of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Civil Aviation Authority. I said that it must investigate the association between flying operations inspectors and airline operators to ensure that no opportunity for corruption can occur. I said that viability must be included among mandatory criteria when the Civil Aviation Authority is considering an air operator's certificate. I also said that insurance arrangements should be changed so that unscrupulous insurance firms cannot weasel their way out of their obligations by claiming that the operator breached safety regulations, thus voiding the policy at the expense of the victims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsequently, I called for the removal of certain senior managers. It is unfortunate that the culture that then existed in the CAA involving a disposition to shoot the messenger rather than to listen to the message prevailed for some time despite the advice that I gave the then minister immediately following my speech in the House on 3 May. I advised the minister that he should separate the regulatory function of the CAA from its commercial service provider functions and should subject the organisation to rigorous examination. I offered him my bipartisan support in doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the release of the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation report on the Monarch accident in July 1994, the then minister announced the separation of the regulatory function from the commercial function, but under the same chief executive officer. At the same time, he announced a reference to the House of Representatives Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure for an inquiry into aviation safety in general aviation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inquiry became one of the most remarkable the committee has undertaken. Chaired by the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), it heard some extraordinary stories and was witness to some of the most acrimonious evidence that could possibly be given to a parliamentary inquiry. The evidence led the committee to conclude that the CAA was an organisation at civil war with itself. It was clear that there were enormous problems based around personalities and interest groups which greatly reduced the effectiveness and capacity of the organisation to perform its duties.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2658">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the chaos that ensued following the Seaview crash, the government of the day finally introduced legislation splitting the CAA into two separate organisations&mdash;much as I had suggested to the then minister in May. The House of Representatives Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure was closely involved in the refinement of the legislation, and the resultant bills gave rise to the new organisations known as the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Airservices Australia&mdash;the former regulating aviation safety and the latter providing commercial services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have the greatest regard for my colleagues on that committee, and participants in and users of aviation in this country are indebted to them for the work they have done in identifying many of the issues in aviation safety regulation that urgently need improvement. Their report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane safe</EMPHASIS>, has made many concrete recommendations, and the government will be responding to these shortly. That response will be a thorough one and a draft is currently undergoing several revisions that I have requested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most important initiatives to come from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane safe</EMPHASIS> report will be a system of public reporting of serious deficiencies found by CASA in individual air operators. This will enable travellers to be informed as to the record of a particular operator. It will also mean that, if a particular operator contravenes regulations, they will pay the price in lost reputation and lost consumer confidence, with market consequences for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the hardest things for the victims of aviation tragedies&mdash;such as the Monarch and Seaview tragedies&mdash;to understand is that they live with the consequences of those tragedies daily, yet the operators and regulators who failed to do their jobs properly and who erred seriously in their duty of care seem to escape any consequences. Three years after the Monarch accident none of those who were negligent have been brought to account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the first principles of regulation should be that the regulators themselves are accountable for their actions. They should be congratulated when their efforts to maintain <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> safe travel are properly, carefully and fairly carried out. They should also be accountable when their failure to do so leads to tragedy or when their failure to do so exposes the very people they are supposed to be protecting to danger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Monarch coroner's findings have made specific criticisms&mdash;some of them about particular people and some of them about the organisation itself. The coroner has made several recommendations, some of which, such as those relating to insurance, have already been implemented. It is now mandatory for aviation operators carrying passengers for financial reward to have non&hyphen;voidable insurance for their passengers. That has not helped the victims of the Monarch crash, who are still waiting for acknowledgment and settlement of their claims against the insurer of the operator. The changes to the legislation were made necessary largely because of the disgraceful treatment they have suffered, and still suffer, at the hands of Monarch's insurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other recommendations of the coroner that fall within the federal jurisdiction. I am referring them to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Airservices Australia for urgent advice and action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is determined to ensure that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority will not repeat the errors of its predecessor. I personally have a great deal of commitment to this. I have made it clear to the Director of Aviation Safety that I expect his officers to be fully accountable for their actions. There is no place in the new CASA for officers who hide behind a cloak of intimidation and secrecy to avoid the consequences of their failure to carry out their duties to the highest standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Bureau of Aviation Safety Investigation report into the DC3 crash in Botany Bay, released earlier this year, identified several major systemic failures within the CAA and I have sought detailed explanations from the Director of Aviation Safety of what measures are being taken to identify why those failures occurred and who was responsible for them. I am not yet satisfied that everything that should be done to overcome them has been done. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2659">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, the report that CASA prepared for me has raised several issues that I wish to pursue further with the director before I will be satisfied that the problems that led to such major bungles as incorrect classification of the aircraft and improper extensions of engine hours have been adequately addressed and those responsible held appropriately to account.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that the old culture still exists despite the change of name.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most unsatisfactory elements of the old CAA was that its officers seemed to believe that they were somehow immune to the consequences of their own wrongdoing. That attitude will have to be well and truly purged from the new CASA. It is the job of the government to ensure that this happens and this government will not be repeating the errors of the previous government in allowing that attitude to continue uncorrected. The Monarch coroner noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no satisfactory explanation as to why the CAA refused to suspend Monarch's AOC before the crash.</PARA>
<PARA>He also spoke of an atmosphere of intimidation of officers who sought to take such action, and referred particularly to a memorandum of a particular officer as having a threatening tone. That kind of intimidation has no place in CASA, or any other responsible organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, the coroner identified the Flying Operations Manager at Bankstown as having decided to take no action on the recommendation of an airworthiness inspector to revoke or suspend Monarch's air operator certificate, which had been made only a couple of weeks before the crash. Since the coroner concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear that had the CAA management paid more attention to the law and less to accommodating their "customers", NDU (the aircraft that crashed) would have been grounded and AOC suspended until the plane was safe to fly and these deaths would have been avoided.</PARA>
<PARA>This raises serious issues that have yet to be resolved but which must be resolved if the public is to have full confidence in the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. The government agrees with the coroner that the culture that prevailed in the CAA was absolutely unacceptable. It is unacceptable in the CAA's successor regulatory body CASA and the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government insists that this be absolutely clear and be seen to be so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coroner praised the Reason model of investigation and analysis utilised by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, yet counsel for the CAA spent a great deal of time and effort and taxpayers' money during the coronial inquest in seeking to discredit it. It is just that kind of self&hyphen;interested defensive reaction&mdash;at the expense of the taxpayer and the industry&mdash;that must be shunned if the public is to have faith in the regulator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not make sense for the regulator to spend more money in defending itself than the claims it was seeking to forestall would have amounted to. All that does is deny the victims' families their due compensation. There must be an open and honest culture, and that is still lacking in the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government expects its safety regulator to admit its errors when appropriate and to take remedial measures to reform its culture in order to make it properly responsive to its very weighty responsibilities. The CAA was dismantled and split into CASA and Airservices Australia, but many of the people who were responsible for the dereliction of duty and the perversion of regulatory responsibility that gave rise to the Monarch, the DC3 and the Seaview accidents, as well as to countless other debacles, are still with the new regulator. It will be a major tragedy if the only thing that happens is that the shingle on the front door is changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Director of CASA has already taken some measures towards cultural change. The government will be ensuring that the change continues and is achieved without delay. I noted in June last year during the debate on the legislation establishing CASA that a great deal of expectation and hope would rest upon the shoulders of the board of CASA. That board, I said, would need to be expert and effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government went into the last election with a campaign commitment to ensure that the board of CASA had the necessary aviation experience to ensure expert and effective oversight of aviation safety. The present board does not in the opinion of the government <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2660"> contain that expertise. There is only one of the four non&hyphen;executive members of the board with aviation expertise and this is, in the view of the government, inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On coming into government I made this position clear to the board. The chairman chose not to accede to my request to the board to offer their resignations. In putting their own interests ahead of the need to have the best available people with appropriate expertise and qualifications, the board members were effectively putting their own needs ahead of aviation safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, the government has introduced legislation which will enlarge the board by two members, one of them in the new position of deputy chairman, to enable the appointment of people with appropriate expertise. I hope that this move to bring to the board of CASA greater expertise and depth will find bipartisan support from the opposition. The people of Australia are entitled to the very highest standards in aviation safety regulation and therefore those who are in charge of that regulatory function must have appropriate qualifications. If CASA is to be able to perform its task adequately, it must be governed by a board that is able to give it expert direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next stage of the change of culture will be reviews of the regulatory framework and of the regulatory role. On 28 June, I will launch some important initiatives towards this end. They will involve the industry itself, through a series of technical committees, in reviewing and writing the rules that govern civil aviation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communication and Infrastructure found in its inquiry into aviation safety that there was enormous confusion about the rules and regulations governing aviation safety not only among those participating in the industry but also among those regulating it. The rules conflict, are often ambiguous and are interpreted differently in different areas. The review of the rules will clarify them and rewrite them in ways that ensure they are comprehensible and consistent. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new government has recognised that the regulatory framework has grown out of outdated regulations with various amendments over the years and that this needs a complete overhaul. This overhaul will be done with full industry participation and leadership. That overhaul will not be effective, however, without a complete and complementary change in the way CASA goes about its business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 28 June, the Director of CASA and I will be seeking the comments of industry and its support for the proposed reviews. In particular, we will be seeking a commitment from industry to nominate appropriate representatives to the program advisory panel to oversee the reviews. That panel will nominate people from the industry with the appropriate expertise to work on the technical committees which are a key part of the regulatory framework program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry will have an opportunity to have its input into the direction of the program and the timetable for change and to accept responsibility for applying the new rules in their own environment. However, the greatest challenge will be for CASA itself to accept a new culture of accountability not only to me as the minister responsible but also to the parliament and ultimately to the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Monarch and Seaview deaths were a shocking waste and have left continuing heartbreak and tragedy for the families of the victims. The only recompense we can give them is the certainty that the lessons have been learnt and action taken to ensure that those tragedies are not repeated. When I spoke in support of the legislation creating CASA, I pledged to continue to act as a watchdog over its operations and to be vigilant. I said that I hoped that others associated with the industry would also be vigilant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have now been given a ministerial responsibility that makes that pledge and hope a duty&mdash;and one I am determined to fulfil. This government is fully committed to that goal. It will not allow the deaths of the victims of Monarch and Seaview tragedies to have been entirely in vain.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2661">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The review that I will launch on 28 June will be the most significant step taken towards ensuring aviation safety for many years and it will be accompanied by this government's insistence on the full accountability of our aviation safety regulators. There is much to do until we can be assured that there will not be another repetition of Monarch and Seaview. I present the following paper:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aviation Safety Regulation&mdash;Ministerial Statement, 25 June 1996.</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="2661" TIME="5.09 p.m." SPEAKER="Tanner, Lindsay, MP" NAMEID="YU5" ELECTORATE="Melbourne" PARTY="ALP" GOV="0">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YU5">Mr TANNER</NAME>
<ELECTORATE> (Melbourne)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(5.09 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The opposition is strongly committed to the maintenance of a rigorous and high quality aviation safety regulatory system in this country, and the Monarch and Seaview tragedies, and of course the near tragedy with the DC3 going into Botany Bay slightly over two years ago, emphasise the importance of ensuring that aviation safety regulation in this country is of a rigorously high standard. In principle, the opposition supports the proposed review of civil aviation regulations which the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) has announced today, subject to hearing more detail of how and by whom the review will be undertaken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is somewhat puzzled by the bifurcated nature of the announcement of the review&mdash;first today and then on Friday, when the parliament will no longer be sitting. The opposition would question precisely who will be involved in the review. The minister indicated that the industry will be involved and laid great emphasis on its involvement. The opposition would ask whether this is going to place undue weight on the views of industry lobbyists and in particular whether there will be a significant input from consumers, passengers and the general public into the review of the civil aviation regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition believes in a strict and rigorous approach to aviation safety regulation, particularly to the maintenance of public confidence in the safety of aviation in this country. It is, I think, common ground between the opposition and the government that that confidence has been shaken by the disasters and tragedies the minister referred to in his speech.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the minister referred in his speech to the need for `a complete and complementary change in the way CASA goes about its business'. The opposition does have some difference with this point of view. First, the minister failed to mention that the main thrust of the Morris committee inquiry was the need for a change of culture in the industry. Yes, there was a recognition of problems with CASA, or the Civil Aviation Authority as it then was, but the main thrust related to the need for a change in the industry culture, and the minister did not mention this. There is no mention from the minister, other than one brief mention that he will pursue things with the director, of how he intends to go about changing the culture in CASA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, most importantly, there is no evidence that the matters he has adverted to have been continuing to occur over the past 12 months or so under the new board. We are left in the dark as to whether the particular problems that have been identified, for example, by the coroner in the Monarch inquiry, Peter Gould, are continuing&mdash;whether the same lax approach to safety and the disregard of safety regulation in response to commercial pressures are happening now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no evidence one way or the other put forward by the minister to suggest that is the case. Yet he does say, `I am concerned that the old culture still exists despite the change of name.' He states that officers of the then Civil Aviation Authority felt `somehow immune to consequences of their own wrongdoing' and that the government `will not be repeating the errors of the previous government in allowing that attitude to continue uncorrected'. The opposition finds it disturbing that the minister appears to be saying that these problems are continuing and yet is proposing a review of the regulations but does not suggest that he will be doing anything about the people in the Civil Aviation Safety Authority itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition finds it disturbing that a very substantial accusation is being levelled on a continuing basis against hardworking and loyal officers of the Commonwealth government in CASA without that being substantiated by contemporary events. It is worrying that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2662"> we have a minister who is responsible for the performance of the organisation continuing to undermine the organisation, continuing to attack the organisation from above. It would be helpful if the minister realised that he is no longer the shadow minister and that he now has a responsibility for the organisation and for its public performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is significant that the minister refers to the board of CASA: as he himself admitted, not one of his best performances. I remind the House that after becoming minister he asked the board&mdash;first on the phone, then in a meeting, then by letter&mdash;all to resign. The only reason he gave for this requested resignation was, `I have obligations to other people.' In other words: `I want to put some other people on the board.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The board members had been in office for nine months. To this day there is no substantial complaint laid against them with respect to their handling of their responsibilities. Disasters such as the Seaview and Monarch tragedies occurred two or three years ago, well outside the time they have been responsible for the authority, yet the minister has the gall to come into this House and accuse them of `putting their own interests ahead of the interests of aviation safety'. This is an outrageous and baseless accusation against people who have been doing a dedicated and thorough job, and no evidence has been advanced in the House today by the minister to support it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge that the coalition policy prior to the election was to ensure that more aviation expertise was represented on the board of CASA. This promise, along with a number of others, was linked to the strong support that the minister and the coalition received from the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association&mdash;headed by Dick Smith&mdash;in the course of that election. The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association has been in a state of direct conflict with CASA on a variety of issues, including electronic located transmitters, the labelling of seat belts, conflict of interest allegations with respect to CASA inspectors, the overall cost of safety regulation and the like. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association represents a particular segment of the aviation industry, and it has strong views. It has been very supportive of the minister, and the minister so far in his agenda in this area has been very supportive of AOPA&mdash;no more so than endeavouring to rid himself and them of the existing board of CASA. The main reason that has been given is that the board members lack the expertise to fulfil their responsibilities. They are Justice Bill Fisher, a judge; Clare Pollock, a systems safety expert; Gabi Hollows, a consumer advocate; and Geoff Molloy, a retired pilot. All of these have some relevance to the role of CASA. They are not all aviation experts, but they do have relevance. The judge obviously has legal expertise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps I should remind the minister, because he may not be aware of this, that the systems safety expert, Dr Clare Pollock, actually studied under Professor James Reason. He may know&mdash;in fact, I think he might have even referred to it&mdash;about the Reason method of pursuing a disaster inquiry. Professor Reason was the person who headed the inquiry into the Manchester plane fire disaster. Systems safety is a critical area of CASA's responsibility. So, contrary to the sorts of stories that have been put around, Dr Pollock has very directly relevant expertise to the role of CASA. Safety is CASA's business. Consumer advocacy also has a significant responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition's view is that we do not object to the extension of the board. We do not object to the CASA board having additional people of aviation background on the board, but we do say that generalist skills as well as aviation skills are needed. Aviation, like many other industries, is riddled with sectional interests, with competing factions and competing claims. The last thing that we want to see in our community is a board of the safety regulator become a battleground for competing sectional interests within the industry. That is why you do need some people on the board who are at arms length from those competing claims and competing interests, who can take an independent role but who have the general expertise. If you <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2663"> look throughout the community I doubt, for example, whether you will see too many former iron workers on the board of BHP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister might well ask why it is that he has appointed a geneticist as the head of his department if he is so keen on making sure that people have direct hands-on experience. It is interesting to see some of the transcripts. I should add that I applaud the appointment of Dr Hawke. He is an excellent choice but, of course, he is not a pilot or a mariner or a train driver. On the minister's logic, perhaps he should be.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YU5">Mr TANNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is exactly right. On the Ita Buttrose program some months ago, the minister very deliberately obfuscated on this issue and effectively implied that board members of CASA are actually out there checking planes. That was the effect of what he was saying, which is, quite clearly, very deliberately misleading the public in order to pursue the agenda that he has with respect to their future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition does not oppose the CASA bill to expand the board, but what it does oppose is adding advocates of sectional interests within the aviation industry to the board. In our view, it is highly inappropriate for a high profile campaigner or lobbyist to be appointed to this position because CASA makes very difficult decisions&mdash;decisions which affect the livelihoods of people within the industry, decisions which affect the lives of people who are affected by the industry. To turn the industry regulator into a battleground for sectional interests within the industry would be a disaster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For that reason, we will oppose the amendment that has been mooted to give the minister power to sack the board for six months. For that reason, we oppose the suggestion of Dick Smith being appointed to the board, and it would be good if the minister would come clean on whether or not he intends to appoint Mr Smith to the board. For that reason, the opposition does not support the so-called affordable safety philosophy that has been advocated by Dick Smith. I would like to quote very briefly from the report of the coroner, Mr Peter Gould, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> into the Monarch crash. At page 8 of his report, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A former Chairman of the CAA had advocated a policy of "affordable safety" which favoured a very lenient approach to policing the regulations . . . senior echelons of the CAA placed undue emphasis on promoting a "viable" industry and as a consequence were loathe to prosecute airlines for breaches of the Regulations or to revoke an AOC and this had its effect on the Airworthiness and Flight Operations Branches which were responsible for policing the Regulations. Internal memos passing between inspectors show that they resented the restrictions imposed on them by their superiors. An inspector at Wagga Wagga who took a hard line on enforcing safety regulations alleges he was victimised by his superiors and transferred from his position. The effect of all this was that inspectors were unable to take any action against airlines for breaches of the regulations apart from giving warnings and so-called counselling.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, at page 50, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pilots and LAME's were also in breach of their duties in not standing up to McLean's interference.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is inexcusable but it is understandable. They all knew that there were plenty of unemployed pilots and engineers to take their place if they did resist McLean. They probably had a pretty good hunch that the CAA would do absolutely nothing to protect them if they stuck their necks out and insisted on the CAA Regulations being complied with.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, at page 73, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Dick Smith, Chairman of CAA from 1991-1992 gives evidence that there is a gross misallocation of resources spent on safety surveillance and is of the opinion that it should be left to each operator to determine the "level of safety" at which its planes will fly so long as the public are duly informed in which case, he suggests, many people would be happy to pay another $100 more and have the higher level of safety if and when they can choose.</PARA>
<PARA>It is clear that the coroner believes that the Smith administration of the Civil Aviation Authority was central to the Monarch crash and the failure of regulatory standards which were associated with that crash. I ask the minister: will he appoint Mr Dick Smith as one of the new board members if the legislation is passed by this parliament?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an enormous contradiction inherent in the minister's position. He has campaigned long and hard on the question of aviation safety and the lapses which have led to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2664"> Monarch and Seaview tragedies. But, on the other hand, his strongest support from within the industry and the closest agenda which he is associated with within the industry is that which is pushed by AOPA, which preaches affordable safety and less regulation. That inherent contradiction will come home to haunt the minister at some stage. The best example of this is his recent decision to override his own expert advice from CASA with respect to electronic located transmitters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not go into the details of the decision, but it is a complex issue. The minister has chosen to allow hand-held ELTs to be used as substitutes for fixed ELTs. Neither of them totally cover each other. They are not interchangeable. I hope, for the minister's sake, that no situation arises in the future where a crash occurs in a remote area and people die because they did not have fixed transmitters and the hand-held transmitters were not appropriate in the circumstances. I hope, for his sake, that that is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This raises the question as to why the minister needs the review in the first place. He has already determined that he can override, unilaterally, the advice of his own safety regulator on what the content of regulation should be on this fairly important matter. Why doesn't he just do it for everything? If he is confident that he has the expertise and the knowledge to do so on this very complex issue of ELTs, why doesn't he simply do that on every other matter as well?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the issue of aviation safety regulation is far too important to be left purely to sectional interests within the industry. It is far too important to be the subject of ministerial whim with respect to individual regulations like the ELT regulation. It is far too important to be the subject of paybacks for previous political support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition supports the review of regulations that the minister has announced, as I said, subject to being informed of the detail of precisely who will conduct the inquiry and in what way it will be dealt with. The opposition calls on the minister to take off the cowboy boots and start dealing with aviation safety issues constructively, to not look for shoot-outs with the CASA board, to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not overrule his own safety experts and to not appoint partisan advocates of sectional interests in the industry to the CASA board. The role of the board should essentially be that of an umpire; it is not there to be a battleground for sectional interests within the aviation industry.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was saying last night that the export market development grants bill is important and that the opposition was not going to decline to give it a second reading, although we were moving an amendment. I had foreshadowed that I would be moving a number of amendments in the consideration in detail stage. Those amendments have been circulated through the House.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2666">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was also talking last night about the reaction from the industry to the suggestion that the EMDG scheme was going to be cut, saying that this was clearly against not only the spirit but also the actual words of the then opposition, now government, in their policy towards tourism. I referred to what Mr Bruce Baird from the Tourism Council of Australia had had to say about this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was also about to refer to some other comments. The Hotel Motel and Accommodation Association, for example, under a press release on 19 April headed `Dumping of Export Scheme to Spell Disaster for Tourism', also hopped into this suggestion that the government's promise was not going to be delivered. That is not language that people in the industry would use lightly if they did not think that this was a concern. They went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . reported threats by the Federal Government to scrap the Export Market Development Grants (EMDG) scheme represented a `kick in the pants' for Australia's biggest and fastest growing industry . . . Any move to scrap EMDG would also be a bad omen for this Government's attitude to an industry that generates so much income and employment for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The Inbound Tourism Organisation of Australia had similar concerns. I referred to those in a speech I delivered in this place on 7 May. They said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tourism was one of the nation's biggest export earners and it would be devastating to the industry and the Australian economy if the export assistance scheme was abolished.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tourism Now</EMPHASIS> , a publication of Tourism Council Australia, had Mr Baird being quoted as saying that the coalition's agreement to wipe out the discrimination relating to the export market development grants scheme as soon as possible was restated by the minister in a meeting that he had with Mr Baird. Quite clearly, there was an agreement reached with the tourism industry before the last election campaign by the then opposition. That agreement was that the full 50 per cent rate would be extended to the tourism industry&mdash;that that would benefit small operators particularly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am delighted that the honourable Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) is in the chamber tonight because, as <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I have oft remarked to him in this place, it is small business that makes up a very large proportion of the Australian tourism industry. He is one that is championing the role of small business in Australia at the present time, as is the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), and saying that, at the end of the day, this economic resurgence that is under way will come from small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may happen that way and it may be that small business will contribute as it should and that employment opportunities will be generated. But, as I say, a promise is a promise. A commitment is a commitment. Those on the other side have made much of standards inside and outside this place, and one cannot help but remind them of that at every opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), in introducing the opposition's position on this matter yesterday, said that a report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology of June 1993, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Undersold overseas</EMPHASIS>, recommends the application of the export market development grants scheme be extended to include all the tourism industry. It goes back as far as that when we had a parliamentary committee with a unanimous recommendation that that should happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsequently, the very famous House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration brought down a report called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Taxing relaxing</EMPHASIS>. They were looking into the tourism industry specifically. They talked about the EMDG scheme. They said&mdash;I will send you a copy of the speech, Geoff&mdash;that, once the export market development grants scheme is fully implemented, consideration should be given to the provision of equal access to the scheme for single&hyphen;service providers at the rate of 50c in the dollar&mdash;again, increasing it in line with the coalition's commitment to this policy in the last election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it distressing that, when you go and talk to people in the tourism industry, you find that the extent to which the EMDG scheme and its elimination might be detrimental to tourism is quite staggering. Look at, for example, a letter that has been sent to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2667"> Prime Minister from Flag, the group of hotels, inns, resorts and apartments. The language is extraordinary. It says here that, should the EMDG scheme be abolished, Flag would have to seriously reconsider its overseas activities and such an action would have serious ramifications on the employment prospects of a number of Australians and have a negative impact on the viability of Flag member properties. I think that puts an added dimension on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice the honourable member for Dawson (Mrs De&hyphen;Anne Kelly) is in the chamber this evening. I am not sure if she is down to speak. She comes from a very important part of Australia where the tourism industry is of great benefit to not only the local people but also those in the wider region. I know that she made a submission to the inquiry following which the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Taxing relaxing</EMPHASIS> was produced, because I have read it. She said some interesting things about the diesel fuel rebate scheme. She said some other things about tourist operators in her area. She was not a member of parliament then, but that is fine; she is here now. She is a voice for tourism from the Mackay region. I will look forward to her contribution here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of my amendments, which I have already circulated in the House, is just to keep the government honest, to get them to adopt the policy which they clearly enunciated in the election campaign. These amendments, therefore, I would think would be overwhelmingly supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a division is called, the member for Dawson will have to go over to the other side. We will go with her; we will all go over to that side. All the members of the government will still be over there because we will all be supporting these amendments. By way of these amendments we are saying, `Let's give the same break to the tourism industry that is given to others eligible under the EMDG scheme.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is fair to say that, in the past, there might have been some criticism levelled at the former government for keeping it at 25 per cent. Now we are saying that it should be 50 per cent. I think that was more a response <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of economic rationalists looking at what it might cost than anything else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can clearly say to all those in the House that this policy should be supported. We certainly do. We are serious about it and will be moving amendments, which we hope will be supported by everybody in the House this evening. I hope that in the consideration in detail stage all members of this chamber will rise in their places unanimously to support these amendments. After all, at the end of the day we are simply trying to ensure that the honesty in politics that we hear so much about from those in government will be put in place.</PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (Herbert)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(5.39 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) for the speeches he gave yesterday and tonight. I would like to make it very clear up&hyphen;front, as the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) did in the second reading speech on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill (No. 1), that introducing this bill is in no way an indication of the progress of the budgetary discussions. I have heard suggestions that this program might be about to disappear due to budget funding cuts. Such speculation concerns me for a couple of reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, it would appear that the export market development grants program has been a successful program. While I feel the Australian businesses and corporate sector should become less reliant on government for support in establishing trade links, be it export or import, government assistance does have a limited place and if utilised properly can be of great benefit to the country. Sound programs which assist Australian businesses should be supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, it concerns me that if rumours turn out to be just that&mdash;rumours&mdash;it really does not do anybody any good at all. Scaremongering just means the program suffers as businesses are left uncertain as to where they stand. It is a fact that the deficit left to the Australian people will be on the shoulders of those opposite&mdash;a going away present following the last election. I have said very clearly to my electorate that the country just cannot continue to spend more money <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2668"> than it has. That will be considered as part of the budgetary process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appreciate the opportunity to speak in support of the amendment bill tonight because of the increasingly large role that export and market development have in my electorate of Herbert in Townsville. In my first speech, not so long ago, I tried to put the spotlight on a number of export oriented projects being developed in the Townsville region&mdash;some big, some small. I firmly believe that Townsville is one of Australia's brightest stars in export potential and has begun a period of significant growth and economic development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Townsville's future is supported by mineral deposits of world significance and by marine science and tropical medicine research of major significance to the Asia-Pacific region. One such project announced today by James Cook University will play a major part in a world health strategy. There is going to be a collaborative centre developed by the World Health Organisation from the filariasis control section of the Department of Public Health and Tropical Medicine underwritten by Dr Paul Turner. I advise the parliament that I received confirmation a couple of moments ago that that will happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Asia is also looming large in the picture with Korea demonstrating considerable interest in our region, predominantly through the choice of Townsville as a site for a zinc refinery. There are a couple of other trends in the Asian region that are occurring in conjunction with rising average gross domestic products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the Queensland Department of Primary Industries' agribusiness marketing analyst, Mr Robert Doolan, the development of the food store retailing industry is occurring at a rapid pace across all Asian countries. Modern chain supermarkets, convenience stores and department stores are replacing traditional `wet' market stalls in the developing and emerging Asian economies. Opportunities to supply these modern retail outlets with Australian raw and processed food materials should be capitalised on&mdash;in other words, assisted with export market development grants.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other main trend which is occurring is the development of food service industries in Asian markets. This industry, Mr Doolan says, is the fastest growing industry in the Asian agribusiness system today. The growth in food service, which is essentially all food prepared away from home&mdash;for example, restaurants, fast food outlets, catering, hotels, hospitals, schools, the military and so on&mdash;has risen out of a number of common demographic trends. Increasing disposable income in Asia, busier lifestyles, an increasing number of working women and more single parent families mean less time to shop and prepare food. Therefore, it is easier to eat out or take away, and demand inevitably dictates supply. Australia should be focused on this opportunity for export.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Japan, for example, 45 per cent of food is prepared away from home. The other 55 per cent is bought at retail outlets and prepared at home. This trend to increasingly eat out is being mirrored in other Asian countries as consumers become more pressed for time and demand greater convenience products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The expansion and penetration of formula driven chains in these markets in the fast food, restaurant and associated industries will mean greater opportunity for supply of processed foods and raw ingredients to the food service markets in these countries&mdash;in particular, meat products such as chilled beef, frozen beef patties and steaks, frozen and fresh cut vegetables and fruit, dairy products, seafood and wine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Demand for convenient food inevitably means greater demand for convenience food such as microwaveable products and frozen foods, says Agribusiness Marketing Services. Australia has an advantage in its proximity to the Asian markets, so we can supply fresh food produce quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year, the Queensland Department of Primary Industries released a series of reports, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Food Retail 2000</EMPHASIS> series, which provided detailed strategic business information for Australian businesses wanting to trade in the food markets of South-East Asia. According to an article in the October 1995 issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Asia Pacific food industry</EMPHASIS>, a major theme of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2669"> report series was the need to develop supply relationships with food retailers in East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Three independent studies have supported the view that Townsville and the northern region are a perishables export growth area, reliant on excellent international transport links to accelerate this growth. According to the North Queensland Economic Development Board, agribusiness alone has the ability to create a demand for international airfreight capacity into North Queensland. Townsville in particular is perfectly situated to take advantage of developments in Asian markets across a wide variety of fields, food and retail industries included.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have already mentioned, in my first speech to parliament I flagged the fact that there are a number of areas with export potential in Townsville and North Queensland, which certainly make them well positioned in this respect. One of those areas was the possible development of Townsville airport's airfreight operations, particularly in the area of perishable goods transportation. The Burdekin and Bowen areas of north&hyphen;east Queensland produce about one&hyphen;fifth of the state's fruit and vegetables, at the moment most of it tagged for internal sale and consumption. With the development of cold storage and other facilities at Townsville airport, the possibility is clearly there for airfreight operations to South-East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While they would not fall under the export market development grants shadow, with the upgrading of facilities at Townsville airport there would be many fresh food and processed food producers in Townsville for whom export market development grants could well assist in the establishment and operation of small business exports with our northern neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Live cattle exports are a further area in which Townsville is set to capitalise on the remarkable growth we have seen in the last four or five years in South-East Asia. Only last week, as I understand it, about 50,000 head of cattle went through the Townsville port destined for the Asian market. Live cattle exports is the only shining light in an Australian beef industry that continues to suffer from the effects of drought and low prices. The <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> extraordinary growth Australia has witnessed in live cattle exports over recent years has been directly linked to growth in demand for beef in South-East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With more emphasis placed on developing these export markets, North Queensland and Australia stand to benefit enormously. It is the potential of areas such as those I outlined tonight which makes it necessary that this bill be passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to quickly touch on two points relating to the bill. Firstly, schedule 1 of the bill reduces the maximum grant payable in any one year by $50,000, lowering the upper limit of $250,000 to a maximum of $200,000. From that will come a better, more fair distribution of available funds to small and medium size export businesses. The reduction will be able to cater for the larger exporters as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to the small business sector. The government is keenly aware of the significant impact the small business sector has on the performance of the economy. Indeed, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) says, small business is the engine room of our economy. To illustrate that, there are more than 860,000 small businesses throughout the country. This represents almost 96 per cent of all enterprises. They generate almost a third of the country's gross domestic product. They are responsible for nearly half of total employment in Australia, which translates to about 3.6 million jobs. Over the past decade, employment in the small business sector has been growing at about 3.6 per cent a year. This is twice the national average.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business is also playing a prominent role in research and development. For example, in 1993-94 the small business sector spent almost half a billion dollars on research and development. This represented 15 per cent of the total amount spent on R&amp;D in Australia by all business enterprises. By any measure, the small business sector is a major driver of wealth creation and economic prosperity in Australia. I thank the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) for providing me with that information. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2670">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, I would like to refer to schedule 9 of the amendment bill. It establishes a grants entry test for first&hyphen;time export market development grants claimants. It is important to have safety nets, or certain checks, to make sure the money the government invests in any program is well spent. Providing financial support for bad programs time and again is simply throwing good money after bad. Currently, 12 per cent of first&hyphen;time recipients never reapply. This figure needs to be reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the grants entry test will not be overly onerous, it will be there to provide that checking element. It will check that the claimant has a product or service for export, that the necessary planning is in place, that research and development has been done and that adequate resources and commitment to management exist to give the claimant the best possible opportunity to do well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have consistently heard of the need to pay attention to our Asia-Pacific neighbours. For many Australian businesses, especially in North Queensland, the next five to six years are going to be very important in establishing footholds in South and East Asia. Asian markets and businesses, particularly in the retail food industries, are rapidly catching up in being able to provide quality products. They already have the jump on Australia in production and labour costs. The ground floor elevator is waiting for Australian businesses in many of the areas I have highlighted here tonight. I therefore commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill before the House is substantially the same as the bill introduced by Labor last year, what I and the other speakers from this side of the House will be at pains to present is the case for retaining the export market development grants scheme. It certainly has become obvious to us all that this government is hell-bent on some sort of son or daughter of Fightback to radically cut or eliminate many essential and worthwhile programs. We saw it recently in this chamber with the emasculation of the Housing Assistance Bill, where funding was cut from three <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> years to one year, making any meaningful capital works planning absolutely impossible for the states. We see it again now with the reports&mdash;unfortunately, all too reliable reports&mdash;that this government's real agenda is to turn the export market development grants scheme into a budget saving. This represents a broken election promise, and that, unfortunately, is also becoming par for the course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's trade policy document `Meeting the challenges' committed the government to the continuation of the scheme. This was a promise reiterated on numerous public occasions by the now Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer). However, just like promises made in the area of my own shadow portfolio areas to protect the weak and vulnerable in our society, these promises to preserve the export market development grants scheme are also about to be broken, or so it seems. This represents a broken promise to one of this government's most frequently claimed constituencies&mdash;small business, whose difficulties with unfair dismissal laws are not worth a separate bill to facilitate the passage of some measure of repeal or reform through this parliament. And now it seems the export market development grants scheme is under threat. One wonders how small business will respond to this news.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no surprise that the reaction of small business has been one of shock, dismay and despair. The reason for that is that the export market development grants scheme actually benefits small businesses. It helps them to operate successfully, to grow and to become more prosperous. It is government and business working hand in hand to create jobs and wealth for this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reviews of the scheme carried out in recent years have confirmed this. The main clients of the scheme are small to medium sized businesses. Yesterday's mail here at Parliament House contained a copy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Information Industry Association Bulletin</EMPHASIS> representing the views of close to 85 per cent of the information technology and telecommunications industry. This is an industry with a large representation&mdash;around 70 per cent&mdash;of small and medium sized businesses, at the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2671"> cutting edge of new technology and whose growth and prosperity is crucial to the wellbeing of this country. As that organisation said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The chief benefit of the export market development grants scheme, as far as our membership is concerned, is that it is a benefit mostly available to small to medium enterprises. Further, in the information technology and telecommunications industry, that is particularly significant because there is a very high proportion of members who actually export.</PARA>
<PARA>How have the Australian Information Industry Association reacted to the possibility of the scheme being axed? In their bulletin they say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">EMDG is perhaps the only benefit at the present moment that is available to assist small and medium enterprises to export.</PARA>
<PARA>Over the page they say further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we are arguing against specifically now is the outright abolition of this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>A little further on they say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would be fundamentally opposed to the abolition of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to talk briefly about the possible effects of the abolition of the scheme on a couple of local businesses. In Greensborough in the northern part of my electorate of Jagajaga is located Mi&hyphen;Sporting Products, better known, I am sure, to many football supporters in this House as Blades&mdash;the manufacturers and exporters of the world famous Blades sporting footwear. Through the sheer quality of its products, coupled with incredible tenacity in the face of adversity and ferocious competition, Blades has carved out a market for itself in the very competitive world sporting footwear market. Blades products are exported to the United Kingdom, South Africa, Sweden, Greece, Italy, Holland, Spain and a number of South American countries. Subcontract work for Blades forms the core business for 14 local companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most people will remember the battle Blades had to establish their football boots with the then Victorian Football League. League marketing agreements gave exclusivity to other football companies, but VFL footballers generally preferred Blades. In a case that created a massive media carry&hyphen;on at the time, Essendon captain Simon Madden even went to the extent of painting white <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stripes on the sides of his Blades boots to try to circumvent his club's exclusivity arrangements. Today many AFL players wear Blades boots, including the whole of the Footscray football club. The boots are claimed to reduce the chances of knee injury, and in a year marked by a shocking incidence of knee injuries to AFL players none of the players injured were wearing Blades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Blades is a wholly Australian owned company and describes itself as a company whose main business today consists of `research and development of new technology and the worldwide licensing and export of that technology'. In a letter to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, the owner of Blades said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We wish to protest in the strongest possible terms against the proposal to abolish the export market development grants scheme, as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  of Friday, 19 April 1996. We have put 11 years of research into the successful development of a revolutionary new technology for sporting shoes. This technology is used in the production of the Blades' range of sporting shoes now widely acknowledged as the world leaders for performance characteristics in their categories. The products have been well and truly tested and proved in the Australian and international markets, with extensive and growing sales, both here and overseas, particularly in the United Kingdom.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to fully exploit this Australian technology and to maintain our R&amp;D program, we need to expand sales into the United States of America, Europe and Asia. These extremely competitive markets are driven by advertising and are dominated by the multinational household names such as Nike, Adidas, Reebok and Puma. They each spend literally millions of dollars annually on advertising and promotion. This sort of spending is far beyond our resources at present so, over the last 12 months, we have developed a responsible and cost&hyphen;effective export development strategy which will enable us to compete with these foreign companies.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>A little later, the letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The economic viability of the program depends on continuation of the EMDG scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter also states&mdash;and I think this is the most important part of my remarks on this letter from the managing director of Blades&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Abolition of the EMDG scheme would mean, for us, the following things: <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2672"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. The loss of this window of opportunity to obtain for Australia a share of the multi&hyphen;billion dollar sports and leisure industry, with its potential spin&hyphen;off benefits for other Australian businesses, as well as increased employment opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. Abandoning commitments to foreign firms, international agencies and world&hyphen;wide media organisations, with resulting damage to Australia's international trading reputation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. The damaging publicity caused by foreign and Australian media coverage of the chain of events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. Lost opportunities to enhance Australia's reputation as a leader in technological research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. Loss of valuable foreign currency and export incomes for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. Curtailment of our extensive technological research and development program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. Possible staff reductions.</PARA>
<PARA>He finishes his letter by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For these reasons, we strongly urge you to resist the proposal to abandon the EMDG scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>My colleague and neighbour, the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), will also be referring to Blades, many of whose work force live in his electorate. He will also refer to the disgraceful treatment that this company is receiving from the Deputy Prime Minister. It is clear that this is a vital and innovative Australian company, competing in the world's toughest markets, whose future prospects are being placed in jeopardy by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another relatively young Melbourne company whose success and growth can, in great part, be attributed to the support of the export market development grants scheme is Shock Records. Shock Records started business in 1988, with a staff of three: the original owners and directors of the company. Today, Shock has a staff of 110 people and an annual turnover of $27 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key point here is that, of that $27 million turnover, approximately $10 million comes from exporting&mdash;the exporting of Australian music and Australian manufactured music products. Further, the major part of that export growth occurred over the last five years&mdash;years when Shock Records was in receipt of assistance through the export market development grants scheme. In those five years, Shock's export division grew from <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> one part&hyphen;time worker to around 20 full&hyphen;time employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to Frank Falvo, the managing director of Shock exports, the EMDG scheme has assisted greatly in helping Shock to have the confidence to invest more strongly in export oriented activity. This encouragement occurred in two ways. Firstly, it encouraged Shock to offer more recording contracts to young Australian bands. Secondly, it further encouraged the company to commit large sums of money to the development and promotion of these bands, including financing tours to overseas markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of these initiatives, Shock has signed numerous licensing arrangements with record companies in other countries, to release the recordings made by these artists. The Melbourne band Bodyjar is just one example of a band whose recordings have been licensed and successfully released into most of the world's music markets. Another is the Pearly Gatecrashers&mdash;I hasten to state that I have not heard of these bands myself, in case I sound too modern to those opposite&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My children certainly do not think I am. The Pearly Gatecrashers are about to release their second album in Japan. Shock, in fact, represents or distributes for export over 200 Australian bands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That Shock is a company at the cutting edge of innovation in the music industry is even recognised by this government, I am pleased to say&mdash;it was in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. Last week, in answer to a question about the price of compact discs, the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith) commented that Shock had introduced a major discounting campaign which, as he said, the government welcomed and the minister saw as reducing the need to consider abolishing copyright to allow parallel importing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that that minister convey to his colleagues the views of Frank Falvo on the importance of the retention of the export market development grants scheme, EMDGS, in the ongoing success of the company. Mr Falvo states that the EMDG scheme allowed <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2673"> Shock Records the flexibility and backup support necessary to take investment risks with Australian bands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Falvo's view, the music industry faces two major threats to its continued viability. The first threat is the possible introduction of parallel importing and the second is the abolition of the export market development grants scheme. The proposal to end this scheme represents economic rationalism of the worst sort. There are still many opposite who have sold their souls to the concept of the level playing field, even if levelling the playing field involves cutting down our local champions, the likes of Blades and Shock Records.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Blades and Shock Records expanded their employment massively, as I have just demonstrated. To expect that a company like Blades, competing in the ruthless international sporting footwear market, can develop a market share without some measure of government assistance is naivety of the worst sort. It is not about picking winners; it is about helping those who have demonstrated their capacity to be winners to actually get out there and win.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA>I have moved this motion so that we can establish a schedule for the balance of this debate which will allow a series of speakers until 10 p.m., at which time there can be the usual number of divisions and time wasting that we can expect from the other side and we can then proceed to the adjournment as usual. That is the reason for moving this scheduling motion. It will mean that we will have a balance of nearly four hours of debate. There are five or six hours of speakers on the other side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By moving the specific motion that has now been moved, we will also allow the opposition to decide how many speakers they have and how long they are going to have.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They of course will, as the Deputy Leader of the House says they will. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> What they are setting themselves up for is for us to move a guillotine motion tomorrow. Tomorrow we are debating the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. We have set aside the whole day for that debate. We do have an agreement with the opposition that there will be no quorums called during the dinner break tomorrow night&mdash;between 6.30 p.m. and 8.30 p.m. was the agreement&mdash;but as is often the case, the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) has already told me he is going to breach that agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not surprised about that, because when it comes to breaching agreements in the operation of this House the opposition has for weeks pleaded with us to sit down and come to an arrangement with them, which we did last week, for example, on Wednesday night. As soon as we had an agreement, they breached it. We had an agreement last Wednesday night so that your people could have ample opportunity to speak on the workplace relations bill. The agreement was that there would be no quorums between 6.30 p.m. and 8.30 p.m. At 6.37 p.m., only seven minutes into the operation of that agreement, you broke it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to cap it off, to cover his tracks, the Manager of Opposition Business went up to spin his line to AAP. He claimed to AAP that they had not breached the agreement and the reason they had not breached the agreement was that the quorum was called before 6.30 p.m. That is what he claimed. He might like to explain to the House how it is that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> records that the quorum was formed at 6.37 p.m. Just in case you think that it takes seven minutes to form a quorum, under the standing orders, the most time that is allowed is four minutes. So you breached that agreement&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just to show you how trustworthy they are, I said to them that, at the most generous, this was Leo in a fit of pique. I said, `We will allow the House to continue through, we will continue to stick to the agreement.' But, as soon as we get any signal of a repeat of the childish antics which occurred in the previous fortnight on Wednesday,  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2675"> we will close the House down. It is pointless for the House to sit when you people abuse the opportunity which members on both sides of the House wanted to discuss the workplace relations bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">True to form, the no&hyphen;quorums position then held until 8.30 p.m., because presumably someone had brought Leo into line. There were certainly big discussions going on in the office of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) that night, bringing Leo into line. At about 8.35 or 8.36 p.m., away goes the quorum again. Couldn't be trusted for more than a few moments!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are happy to have an agreement in respect of tomorrow. If you want to come to an agreement with us in respect of tomorrow, we are open to that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition opposes this proposal. This is the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) who has lost control of the management of the place. This is the Leader of the House who has got twice the majority that we on this side of the House have but still cannot get his business through the place. What sort of numbers do you need to actually manage activity in this place?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only reason we have got this proposition tonight is that you have got a backbench in total revolt over the way in which you have managed the affairs of this place. You told them at the beginning of this session, `We will have two late night sittings, but do not worry. You can all drift off home, you can have your parties around Parliament House or you can have your nice little get&hyphen;togethers. We will organise rosters. When it comes to quorums, do not worry; we will simply do it for the convenience of the opposition.' That was dead wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We argued vociferously against the late night sittings. We said this was what it would lead to. We offered a proposition that gave you the same amount of sitting time but in a much more organised way: a way that was looked at by a joint committee of this House, under a proposal that was recommended by this House. But the Leader of the House knew <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> better. The Leader of the House said, `What we'll do is keep them sitting Monday and Tuesday nights, because we will get a bit of fellowship.' This is some fellowship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Wednesday night, as soon as the division was called after 8.30, you closed the place down. Do not give us any nonsense about wasting time on our side last Wednesday night. The reality is the agreement was 6.30 to 8.30, which was delivered. What happened after 8.30? In fact, at a quarter to nine, we moved a quorum, in accordance with `the agreement'. What did he do? He closed the joint up. Who, therefore, shut the place down? Who denied us the opportunity to have an extra two hours of debate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I told him when he rang me just before the parliament came back&mdash;two weeks ago&mdash;that, even with two extended sittings on Wednesday, there would not be enough time to complete the industrial relations bill. He tried to make some comparison with the length of the debate last time the bill was changed. There is no comparison at all. This is such a fundamental change to the industrial relations bill, to the rights of unionists and to the rights of workers&mdash;such an attack on living standards&mdash;that we have many people on this side of the House who want to debate it. But it is not just that; it is the broken promises.</PARA>

You have got the EMDG scheme. Where is the current leader of the National Party, Tim Fischer? How long, Tim? Now we have got young Peter there&mdash;Yahoo Serious&mdash;jumping up every chance he can get and establishing his leadership claims against John Sharp, who takes the more serious look. He was the only one who was prepared to come in and defend Alexander Downer yesterday. Why was that? It was because he thought he could go on the attack after Laurie Brereton. There was not one word of defence for Alexander Downer. No wonder he is floundering. No wonder you are in such poor shape.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have got is a position in which you cannot control the proceedings of this parliament. You have now got the place in total confusion. The export market development grants scheme was something the Leader of the National Party went to the National Press Club and said we would retain. You went to the National Press Club and said, `We will retain DIFF,' yet tonight we are debating cuts to that very scheme. You know you are. You are setting the basis upon which that scheme can be cut.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that these are serious debates. That is why we need time, not gags. This is the fifth occasion in six weeks on which we have had the gag proposed. It was proposed on the Telstra bill, on the social security bill and twice on the legislation setting up the committees of the parliament. That is some lifting of standards and some `supremacy of the parliament'. You say it is the parliament that will reign supreme over the executive, but you come in here and ram through executive decisions. You ram them through badly. You have got your backbench in revolt.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill. This is commonsense legislation to better target government assistance through the export market development grants scheme. I would like to give a brief overview of how the scheme works, the relevance of the EMDG scheme to the tourism industry&mdash;which I am proud to have a good deal of in my electorate&mdash;and, lastly, some of the amendments that are going to be made to the act through this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Export market development grants encourage Australian exporters to develop overseas markets for goods, services, industrial property rights and general know&hyphen;how. There is a 50 per cent reimbursement for the costs incurred in overseas marketing. I might add that, for the tourism industry at present, that reimbursement is only 25 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to this legislation being enacted, the taxable grants have a maximum ceiling of $250,000. An individual or a company can have up to eight grants, with three additional grants for each new market that is opened. The definition of a `new market' is one where the export sales for the last three years are not greater than $300,000. There is also a $30,000 threshold. In other words, an individual or a company must have expenditure of $30,000 or more to be able to access the EMDG.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some sensible savings in better targeting this grant to assist fledgling exporters in small companies. In the mighty seat of Dawson&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FK6">Mrs DE&hyphen;ANNE KELLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. In the mighty seat of Dawson, where we have the Whitsundays, there is a great deal of use <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> made of export market development grants by the tourism industry. I would like to give you one instance. We have an agricultural tour company and they assist visitors to come to Australia who are interested in our agricultural pursuits. For instance, overseas cattlemen visit Australia to have a look at the breeding herds here, to look at pasture development and so on. Next year there is to be held in Australia an international conference on beef breeding. This particular tourism company has had the foresight to distribute to 2,500 overseas beef breeders $40 packs describing the conditions in Australia, the herds, places to visit, pasture improvement and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a considerable expenditure, I must say, and they are able to do this because of the export market development grants scheme. Those who come to Australia plainly will increase the number who visit Australia and will also extend the time that they spend here and, hopefully, will extend the amount of money that they spend here as well. There is a considerable advantage for small exporters, which this agricultural tour company is, in having access to export market development grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would just like to quote Keith Neilsen, who addressed our government committee on tourism last week. He is the Executive Director of the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators. He has said that tourism is a big industry; it earns big dollars&mdash;they are disposable dollars. But people have to be convinced to take a holiday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tourism has done Australia very well in international terms. A few years ago, we had only one million visitors per year. Let me say that, of those one million visitors, 350,000 were repeat visitors and 650,000 were first&hyphen;time visitors. They have to be encouraged to come to Australia to spend their holiday. We are now up to the level of three million visitors per year, and what that means is that we have to attract as first&hyphen;time visitors 1.7 million visitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a considerable challenge for the tourism industry here, and I must say that it is a very expensive challenge. They have to convince the wholesalers and agents in other countries that Australia is the place to visit. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2678"> The tourism industry has a very proud record as one of those who access export market development grants. Austrade has recorded that in 1993 the dollar export earnings compared to the dollar cost of grants for the tourism industry are in a ratio of 25 to one. In other words, for every dollar spent on the grant, Australia benefits by $25 in income, whereas manufacturing has a ratio of only 18 to one. Tourism makes good use of the grant. They convert those grant dollars into big export dollars for this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there are other difficulties for the tourism industry. For example, if you are in manufacturing, it is very easy to put a spanner or a set of drawings into a post bag and send it overseas. Unfortunately, you cannot parcel up the Whitsundays and send them overseas&mdash;thank goodness! What we need is the opportunity to bring the wholesalers and agents to this country and have that recognised as a sample. They are the ones who will promote our product to potential customers overseas and they have to have a sample of Australia. The only way to sample a tourism destination is to go there and see all of the benefits that it offers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the tourism grant should in fact be 50 per cent. Our mighty tourism industry should be recognised as the great exporter that it is. I believe it should not take second place to other exporting industries and I look forward in the budget in August to tourism being recognised as a full grant recipient of the export market development grants scheme. I certainly trust that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) will keep to his commitment to see that tourism is recognised as a full export industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to some of the changes that this legislation will bring about. We will reduce the maximum grant from a quarter of a million dollars to $200,000. Only 200 claims made every year actually receive such a large grant&mdash;only five per cent of the overall claimants. These are the larger resource companies, companies that are well able to afford to promote their own activities overseas. We want to see grants directed at the small, emerging tourism and exporting sector.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another change will ensure that those claimants for an export market development grant will not be able to add to the expenditure after the claim has been submitted. There will be an allowance of 10 per cent of the overall expenditure to cover genuine reasons why amounts which have been overlooked should be expended. This will ensure that claims are completed on time and that the accounting is done thoroughly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will also limit the membership of multiple joint ventures and consortia. With the present threshold of $30,000, individuals and companies can join a consortium or a joint venture to access that threshold. We will limit to three the number of joint ventures that one can be a member of, although that will be varied at the minister's discretion should the need arise. This will prevent smaller export companies from overextending themselves and ultimately, perhaps, failing in their export drive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will also ensure that claims will be disallowed if they are prepared by a disqualified individual. Many of the exporters use consultants. Those who have been disqualified, on good grounds, will no longer be allowed to prepare claims. But all of those small businesses and exporters who have, with the best will, gone to a consultant will have a further 90 days to put in a fresh claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly pleased about the amendment whereby expenditure relating to illegal activities will not attract a grant. Australians would be, frankly, offended if taxpayer moneys were expended on what they saw as illegal activities, either in this country or in another country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will also prevent grant eligibility for an interposed company where somebody who was ordinarily employed by that company is, in fact, receiving a grant to cover wages or salaries. This practice has been used in some cases and the grant has been paid for ordinarily employed persons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will also bring in a register of first&hyphen;time claimants and a grants entry testing which will apply to about 1,200 new claimants every year who are trying to access the scheme. The registration will be very simple and it will look at five particular areas: importantly, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2679"> whether the claimant has a product or a service for export; whether they are adequately resourced; whether they have done their market research; and whether their management has a commitment to an export drive. These are very commonsense changes that will better direct the grants to small and medium firms that are emerging as exporters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to move on to a general discussion of the worth of savings. Certainly there are going to be savings from the amendments that are being made to the export market development grants scheme. This is most important. With the $8 billion black hole that we have, savings have to be found. It is necessary that we look at ways in which this can be done which still allow us to boost export earnings for this country, that still allow us to direct our activities towards the productive sector. It has to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In view of the flak that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) is receiving as a result of the measures he is taking, I would like to make a comment now about our future Australians. During my maiden speech I mentioned that a nation is not simply those who live now; it is past Australians, it is present Australians and it is future Australians. I am very pleased to see that the government and the Treasurer are taking measures which are going to give our future Australians&mdash;our children and grandchildren&mdash;an opportunity that we in this country have enjoyed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment I believe that the previous government has mortgaged our children's future, that they have ransacked the future to pay for the present, that they have indulged in inter&hyphen;generational theft. I believe it is most important that our government takes a responsible view of the future, that while we care for the vulnerable and give a stimulus to the productive sector we ensure that we do not add to what has been a disgraceful record of inter&hyphen;generational debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the Export Markets Development Grants Amendment Bill to the House. I look forward to future changes to the tourism industry which will put it on a similar footing to other export industries in this country in respect of the level of grant allowed.</PARA>

If the honourable member for Dawson has the courage to enter the chamber when the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) moves his amendment, she will have a chance to vote with the Labor Party to ensure that the House of Representatives carries a motion tonight ensuring that the tourism industry does get paid at the same rate as other industries.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would be interested to know whether the honourable member for Kennedy believes, like the member for Dawson, that the tourism industry should be paid at the 50c in the dollar rate, because they are going to get a chance tonight to vote on their election promise. We will not only give the National Party a chance to let the tourism industry be paid at the 50c rate but also let the honourable member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith), who claims to be a friend of the tourism industry, ensure that all the people who work hard in the tourism industry in Tasmania get a chance to be paid at the 50c rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some unkind people in the opposition might say that the Labor Party, having granted only the single service tourism operators the 25c rate, does not have the right to speak out on this issue. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the two of us on this side of the chamber and the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), who is in the chamber at the moment, have a special reason for being able to speak in favour of paying single service tourism operators the 50c in the dollar rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason we have got that special right is that, for our sins, we served on the House of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2680"> Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. I had the privilege of chairing the committee which carried out a number of public hearings on this issue. While I did not have the honour of being the chair of the committee when the report was actually delivered&mdash;that was handed over to my colleague the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis)&mdash;it is no secret that I was one of those people who argued most strongly within the committee, within cabinet and on many other occasions to pay the tourism industry the full 50c in the dollar rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I can say is that, in the Working Nation package, single service tourism operators got their foot in the door&mdash;they went from zero to the 25c rate. While I know our friends from Austrade and the department are always very keen to see export&hyphen;generating industries like tourism do better for their country, I have to say there was the odd sceptic both in Austrade and in the department&mdash;and even in the tourism industry&mdash;who had doubts about whether that was the best way to provide new assistance to the tourism industry. It was always my view that providing that 50c rate would be achieved eventually, and we would like to now make sure that this government is held to its promise. Having gone to the people saying that they would ensure that single service tourism operators did get paid that 50c in the dollar rate, we are quite determined to make sure that they get a chance to vote to implement their election promise. That is the amendment that we will be moving later tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was intrigued that the member for Dawson said that she supported savings measures which, as she put it, need to be found to meet the $8 billion deficit which she claims is there. I will leave for another occasion the argument about whether there is an $8 billion deficit and simply address&mdash;</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Richmond interjects and says there is. He might not understand that fourteen&hyphen;fifteenths of the $8 billion is a result of changes in growth and the inflation estimates. One&hyphen;fifteenth is due to additional spending that was announced by the Labor government between the 1995 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> budget and the last election. Fourteen&hyphen;fifteenths are due to some of the bodgie figures&mdash;the very pessimistic figures&mdash;that have been factored into the calculations of the Treasurer (Mr Costello). But let us leave that argument for another time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dawson said she supports savings measures to fill that gap. I would like to ask the National Party and the member for Dawson&mdash;and any other National who is going to jump up tonight&mdash;whether they include in any of the savings measures that you might support the complete abolition of the export market development scheme, because we all know that that is one of the measures that is at risk in this budget. We know that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), has been arguing with your leader, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer), about where the savings will be found in his portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that Alexander Downer, the member for Mayo, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, is trying to shaft your leader. I see that the Deputy Prime Minister is actually in the chamber at the moment, and I would like to say to the Deputy Prime Minister that, in any battle between Tim Fischer and Alexander Downer, we are with you, Tim. We think that Tim Fischer should win this battle in his attempt to make sure that we protect the export market development scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope the member for Aston will declare his support for the Leader of the National Party, despite the fact that he is a member of the same party as Alexander Downer, the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Tim Fischer loses this battle, not only will there be no additional grants or extra money for single service tourism operators but the grants will go from 25 per cent to zero, and every other industry will also lose their export market development grants. The reason we are so concerned about it is that we know the impact it will have on all sorts of companies and industries that have had some success in developing new export markets because of this scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been a very successful scheme. There have been analysis and reviews and studies into how effective EMDGs have been, and one of the fair assessments has been that, for every dollar you spend in providing export market development grants, you get $9 back in extra export earnings for Australia. Leaving aside the fact that the government rakes about 45 per cent of the grant back in extra tax revenue and leaving aside the fact that every dollar spent in promoting the Australian tourism industry brings back not $9 but about $30 or more, you can see why it is so important that we make sure that this government does not break its election promises and abolish EMDGs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are all sorts of industries that are concerned about all this speculation. With the Deputy Prime Minister in the House at the moment, I was interested to read that he has had some correspondence from people involved in the Australian publishing industry. We know that before the election the coalition in its trade policy, `Meeting the challenge', committed the opposition to making sure that they would retain the export market development scheme. Yet, when Peter Campbell from the Australian Publishers Association raised this matter with the Deputy Prime Minister, he received a letter back which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The process, as you say, has still not been resolved and will be an ongoing process. Consequently, I am not able to comment on the future of the scheme. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>So we have the spokesman for the government&mdash;the Deputy Prime Minister&mdash;saying he cannot tell us whether there will be an EMDG scheme after 20 August.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to challenge the member for Aston, the next speaker in this debate, to give us his personal assurance that he will be one of those who will be fighting for the retention of the scheme, having signed a unanimous report recommending that EMDG should be extended at the full 50c in the dollar rate to the tourism industry. I am sure he understands how many of our service industries and how many of our manufacturing industries rely on the EMDG scheme to make sure that they can compete in overseas markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I, for one, think that Australia should never be ashamed of grants schemes such as this. Sure, all of us&mdash;especially the National Party&mdash;like to support free trade. Sometimes I think we do not look closely enough at some of the export facilitation schemes that other countries have developed. I think EMDG is a very good example of a scheme that has provided a great deal of assistance to industries in days gone by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think you need me, Mr Deputy Speaker, to quote again from the numerous clips that abound from industries that have expressed concern about the abolition of export market development grants. Anyone who has had any dealings with Glen Taylor and the Inbound Tourism Operators Association of Australia knows that ITOAA is one of the strongest supporters of the EMDG scheme. They have issued a number of press releases expressing their concern about the cloud over the very existence of the export market development grants scheme. We have the people who represent the accommodation industry expressing concern; we have the recent meeting in Sydney of all sorts of industries representing people involved in information technology industries; we have had people such as Don Larkin, the spokesman for the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry saying that he is concerned about whether or not Tim Fischer will lose the battle with the Minister for Foreign Affairs; we have had people such as the former chairman of Austrade, Bill Ferris, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2682"> strongly criticising any move to abolish export market development grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lest some people think this is a battle between only the National Party and the Liberals, I would like to tell the member for Aston that Jeff Kennett, the Premier of his own state, has come out in favour of the Leader of the National Party and has supported the retention of export market development grants. I know that the member for Aston is a strong supporter of Jeff Kennett and a strong supporter of some of the measures that have taken place in his state that those of us on the Labor Party side have reservations about, but if anything will persuade the member for Aston to break ranks with the Liberal Party and support the National Party it will be the fact that Jeff Kennett has come out in support of the retention of the export market development grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the point once again that many studies have been carried out into the operation of the scheme. We know that every one of those studies has concluded that providing incentives to people involved in increasing their exports has been very successful, and I think that the amendments that will be moved by my colleague the member for Cunningham will give every member of this House a chance to make sure that the government keeps it promise, that it does provide equal treatment for people involved in single service tourism operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I have to say that I do have one or two concerns about some of the measures that are in the detail of the bill. I think that the new requirements that provide for entry testing for future applicants will need to be watched very carefully. I was interested to note that the member for Dawson claimed that registration would be simple. I am not sure if everyone agrees that it will be as easy or as simple as the member for Dawson has claimed. You certainly want to make sure that we are getting genuine companies which are prepared to put in additional effort to increase Australia's export earnings, but at the same time there will be a concern amongst some people involved in industry that this will be additional paperwork, which might make it a little bit harder for the Minister for Small <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) to claim that he will achieve that target of a 50 per cent reduction in paperwork. If the amendments that are before the House tonight result in a heavier burden for people who are applying for export market development grants, that will put extra pressure on the government to cut back other paperwork burdens to ensure that they meet that target of a 50 per cent reduction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For my part, if the changes that are before the House at the moment mean that we are placing an unfair burden of bureaucracy on people involved in applying for export market development grants, I think that is another matter that should come before the House on a future occasion. If the promise from the member for Dawson that registration will be simple proves not to be true for the people involved in the tourism industry in her own electorate, she might like to join us on a bipartisan basis in future attempts to simplify some of the additional bureaucracy and paperwork burden which is being placed on small business in her electorate by her own government's legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

It is interesting also to hear the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) invoking the support of Premier Kennett from Victoria, who is, of course, an outstanding Premier. I would remind the gentleman from Dobell that one of the things that Jeff Kennett had to do when he came into government was clean up the mess of the Labor Party in the same way that we are having to clean up the mess in this place from the Labor Party. When Jeff Kennett came to power in Victoria he had to do a lot of things that were unpalatable and that were difficult and that he and I and a number of others on this side would have preferred that we did not have to do, but it had to be done in the cause of cleaning up the mess left by the Labor Party. And it is unfortunate that in this place we may have to do things on 20 August that will cause some pain that we would prefer perhaps not to do, because we <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2683"> have got to clean up the mess that was left behind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it absolutely incredible that we have the gentleman from Dobell coming in here and making comments about how we should be putting the tourism industry on the 50 per cent rate. I have some personal sympathy with that view, as did the honourable member for Dawson (Mrs De&hyphen;Anne Kelly), but I have to remind the honourable gentleman that it is barely three months since he was the minister in a government that was here for 13 years and failed to deliver. Now you want to stand up and pontificate and say that we should do it in five minutes, when we have got to clear up your financial shambles. I have to say to the gentleman from Dobell that that is absolutely rank hypocrisy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us just have a little look at this bill, the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. The bill was originally introduced by the previous government in the spring session in 1995 and was due for passage in the autumn session in 1996. It lapsed, of course, on the calling of the election. It makes a number of changes to the EMDG scheme, and I am not going to go into all of the detail because that has obviously been covered by many people before. Suffice it to say that at this stage we are talking about making sure that the money goes to the right people. We are trying to improve risk management and accountability; we want to make sure that the money is not wasted. That is an important thing which we should share with those on the other side of the chamber. After all, it was originally their bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is perhaps instructive to quote very briefly from the 1994-95 Austrade annual report in respect of EMDG. That report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Export Market Development Grants (EMDG) Scheme is non-discretionary and provides grants mainly to eligible small to medium&hyphen;sized companies.</PARA>
<PARA>The report talks about the size of the grants, the $250,000 now to be $200,000, and so on. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To be eligible, exporters must have export revenue of less than $25 million and have incurred at least $30,000 in expenditure in the year of claim. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>It is really interesting to note in this report that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of those claimants, 97% targeted a market in South East Asia . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very significant factor because there is no doubt that Asia in general will be a very important market for this country in the future. I think there are reasons why small companies in particular are attracted to the EMDG.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1994-95 period, there were 3,497 claims processed. It is interesting that over 70 per cent of the grants were directed to companies with 25 or fewer employees. An awful lot of those small companies are still struggling, even though we are supposed to be having a recovery, even though the previous government said it had done a great job economically. The reality is that a lot of small companies out there are struggling today. For many of them, the only way they will improve their lot is by exporting, and exporting into Asia in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday I had the good fortune to chair a vital issues seminar set up by the Parliamentary Library. These seminars are run on a number of occasions, and we had a visiting speaker, Dr Lee Tsao Yuan, from Singapore. She is a noted academic and bureaucrat and is now a member of their parliament. She actually gave some very interesting figures on Asia's significance and the opportunities that are there for companies in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To give you an idea, we will look at GDP and, effectively, at the three major trading blocs in the world that are now quite clearly emerging&mdash;the United States, Europe and Asia. In 1965, which is less than 30 years ago, the United States had 37 per cent of the world's GDP, Europe had 25 per cent and Asia had a mere nine per cent. In 1994, less than 30 years later, the United States' share was 28 per cent, Europe's was 29 per cent and Asia's had risen to 22 per cent. Asia's share went from nine per cent to 22 per cent of GDP in less than 30 years. That is explosive growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can look at it another way&mdash;that is, in purchasing power and parity terms. If you look at the purchasing power in 1994 in the ASEAN 10 countries compared with North <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2684"> America and the European Community 15, the ASEAN 10 had a purchasing power of $US7.7 trillion and North America had a purchasing power of $US7.4 trillion. In other words, North America was a smaller market in purchasing power terms in 1994 than were the ASEAN 10 countries. The purchasing power in the European Community 15, which we hear is making a tremendous economic impact, was $US6.7 trillion. Those are World Bank figures; they are not figures I have plucked out of thin air. The ASEAN 10 excludes countries like Taiwan and Hong Kong; it purely means the ASEAN countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of world trade percentages, we can take another measure. In 1970, Asia had 10 per cent of world trade; Europe, 44 per cent; and North America, 20 per cent. In 1994, less than a quarter of a century later, North America was on 18 per cent, Europe was on 38 per cent and Asia was on 19 per cent. In other words, Asia had gone from 10 per cent to 19 per cent: it had almost doubled its share of world trade in less than 25 years. So in a very real sense we are seeing the emergence of Asia as a major trading power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that situation, and given the economic difficulties in this country, it is necessary for our businesses to get into the overseas markets. Many of the large companies, the BHPs and the like, have the wherewithal to get over there under their own steam. They have the resources, the expertise, the manpower and so on. Many of them are overseas and have been overseas for many years. Many of the small companies in this country that need to go overseas&mdash;not only in their own interests but also in the interests of this country as a whole to start to redress our balance of payments problems and all the rest of it&mdash;need some assistance in terms of money and expertise to get them kick-started.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the 7,900 or so small businesses in my electorate see schemes such as the EMDGS as a very attractive proposition. We need to encourage those SMEs not only in my electorate but also right across the country. To give, if you like, a human face to some of those general statistics, I would like to quote from a couple of letters I have received from companies in my electorate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A company called Jardan manufactures high quality lounge furniture and distributes it throughout major retail outlets and markets in Australia. In addition, in May last year, in quite a recent exercise, it was successful in obtaining its first major export order to Japan&mdash;that represented a shipment of two 40-foot containers per month. That was not a large amount but it was a foot in the door. That move gave the staff of Jardan confidence in the product which led to a greater concentration of their efforts towards the development and expansion of potential export markets within South-East Asia. Jardan's Managing Director, Mr Steven Andreae, was pleased to report in his letter that `this has already resulted in orders from five new export customers in this past year'. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From an internal viewpoint this new export business has enabled us to employ an additional eight employees and this growth would be likely to continue. Our export business now represents about one third of our turnover which has provided a significant boost for our suppliers, most of whom are also Australian manufacturers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most significantly, this export development has been achieved through the support of Austrade and our eligibility for receiving the E.M.D.G.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The E.M.D.G. forms an integral part of our budgeting process and has allowed us to commit to expenditure associated with the development of export markets for the next two years that we otherwise would not have undertaken due to our limited resources.</PARA>
<PARA>Jardan, as I say, is a company in my electorate. I went to visit that company, had a meeting with its managing director and others who were there and toured the site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That company initially wrote to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), sending me a copy, at the beginning of May; it then wrote to me in the middle of May; and in late May I went to visit the company. Between receiving Jardan's letter and visiting the site a couple of weeks later, the company had had another huge order from Japan which almost doubled the size of its business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is good news for Australia&mdash;not just for Jardan, not just for Aston, but for Australia. It is jobs, it is export money, and it really <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2685"> does mean that we have the quality and the capability to go out there and compete overseas. That company feels that EMDG has been very worth while from its point of view&mdash;and I would agree with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Paton's Macadamia Plantations is another company in my electorate. At the table the shadow minister for defence, the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), smiles wryly wondering how they grow macadamias in suburban east Melbourne. We do not, of course. The company owns a bit of Queensland, where the shadow minister at the table comes from, where it grows its macadamias. It then brings them down to Melbourne for processing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The range that this company has is absolutely unbelievable. It has all sorts of chocolate&hyphen;coated and toffee&hyphen;coated products, and goodness knows what else. It has a high&hyphen;class product which it exports extensively around the world. That company has written to me and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You would be aware of the substantial foreign revenue generated for Australia in relation to every EMDG dollar spent. In fact, the EMDG scheme has contributed to Paton's Macadamias achieving over 50% of total sales being exported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We consider the further expansion of our export market as being critical to our long term ability to grow, invest and employ.</PARA>
<PARA>That company sees the EMDG scheme as being very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could go on. Kenman Kandy is another company&mdash;we appear to make a lot of sweets. There are other technical companies that have been to talk to me about this, companies that are in engineering, manufacturing and so on. I think the point is that we are not&mdash;and should not be&mdash;in the business of trying to support these companies on a long-term basis. But it is important that we give them some seed funding to get them into the market overseas. Of course, once they are established, then they are able to fly on their own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been speculation in the media and elsewhere about the future of the EMDG scheme. I am unashamedly a supporter of the EMDG scheme, as are many members on this side of the House. There is no question about that. But there has been some speculation, and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that is what the amendment moved by the other side is all about. Those opposite want us to stand up here today and say, `Yes, we're going to maintain the EMDG scheme on an ongoing basis.' As I started off by saying, the reality is that we would like, and fully intend, to do that. The realities of life are, however, that it may not be possible, and we will not know until 20 August when the budget comes down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the EMDG scheme has to be one of those things that in fact suffers, it will be the responsibility of those on the other side of the chamber. Those opposite are shaking their heads as though they have heard this message before&mdash;you have heard it before, and you will hear it again. The reality is like it is in Victoria, as was referred to by the honourable gentleman from Dobell when he talked about Jeff Kennett. As I said before, when Jeff Kennett came into power, he had to do some hard things that he did not want to do but which were necessary for prudent financial management&mdash;and that may well have to be the case here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, none of us wants to see that happen. But, if it does have to happen, we all know where the responsibility will lie&mdash;and that will be with the former Keating government and its then finance minister, now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). I commend the bill to the House because I believe it is a sound bill. I urge the House to reject the amendment moved by the Labor Party. I believe this scheme is generally a good one and I hope that we will be able to keep it in the long term. I hope also, much more importantly, that we will be able to get this country back onto a sound financial footing after the mess we have been left with by the Labor Party.</PARA></SPEECH>

What the government will do in the budget will have the impact of cutting exports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2686">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The export market development grants scheme is now 22 years of age and extremely successful. Firstly, I would place on record my support for the scheme and my congratulations to those businesses who have participated successfully in the scheme over the last 22 years&mdash;thus adding to Australia's long list of successful exporters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The export market development grants scheme, or EMDG scheme as it is known, has given the financial assistance needed by Australian small to medium sized business for entry into export markets. The benefits to our domestic economy have been enormous, including the many jobs that have been created. The overall increase in Australia's exports was an important achievement of the former government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the former Minister for Small Business and Customs, I visited a number of countries where I saw first&hyphen;hand the benefits of the scheme which is currently boosting Australia's exports. This has meant dollars for Australia and jobs for Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like other opposition speakers, I am deeply concerned about the scheme's future survival. The government, and in particular the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Fischer) and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), have much to answer for with the uncertainty they have created in the business community. Their commitment to the scheme's continuing has been non-existent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election, we heard the Deputy Prime Minister state that the government would not only retain the scheme but also expand and improve it. We heard that from the coalition's own trade policy document, `Meeting the challenge'. On page 30 it clearly states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . We will maintain the Export Market Development Grants Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>If the government do retain the scheme, we have to ask ourselves, in what form will it be? If they alter the scheme with staff cutbacks or by tightening eligibility, will this be the beginning of the end for this successful program? Why doesn't the Deputy Prime Minister&mdash;and, for the moment, the current Leader of the National Party&mdash;come into this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> chamber and give a commitment that the scheme is here to stay?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that the Deputy Prime Minister is under intense pressure from his colleagues, but the concerns about his leadership must not overtake the decisions regarding his portfolio. In the meantime, this situation does not help the many businesses which are unable to make export decisions due to the uncertainty of the future of the EMDG scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that almost $237 million will be paid out in 1995&hyphen;96 to successful exporting businesses. Approximately 90 per cent of the 3,500 applicants are small to medium sized businesses. The scheme has always been targeted at small business. It is understandable that many of these small to medium sized businesses feel betrayed by this government. I am sure that many voted for the coalition on the basis that they would help small business. Any substantial downgrading of this scheme in the budget will present a major breaking of the coalition's promise to maintain this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at what has been said in the media. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 24 April there the headline was `Business to carry cuts burden'. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 19 April: `Razor gang takes aim&mdash;export scheme faces abolition under the budget'. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 23 April: `Don't slash us, industry begs'. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 29 April the headline was `Moore signals cuts in business funding'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only comment about the continuation of the scheme we have heard from the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism is that the business community will have to wait until the budget on 20 August to find out the future of this scheme. This is just not good enough. As a Queenslander, Minister Moore owes it to the many businesses in his own state to come clean and state whether this scheme and other programs which assist small business are going to survive. Many businesses in Queensland, in particular in the tourism industry, feel let down and betrayed by this government already. My colleague the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) outlined the concerns throughout the tourism industry.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2687">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism ought to go and speak to the businesses in Queensland, which are sick and tired of his `wait and see' approach not only on this issue but also on all other issues affecting his portfolio. Based on pre&hyphen;election promises, many Queensland exporters have made commitments to promotional activities overseas. It is not just in Queensland but across the country where uncertainty lies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People like Philip Holt, the Managing Director of the Australian Business Chamber, have sounded warnings. The Chief Executive of the Hotel, Motel and Accommodation Association, John McKernan, has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Howard Government was grossly short-sighted if it believed budget cuts to the export scheme would benefit Australia's bottom line.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to further state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any move to scrap EMDG would also be a bad omen for this government's attitude to an industry that generates so much income and employment for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not the first time that the coalition has tried to remove the scheme. It was a plan by the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, during the 1987 election campaign. This led to the then President of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, Mr Peter Frankel, publicly resigning from the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following on from this, I have the same concern for another program under threat&mdash;the export access program. This program is for small to medium sized enterprises to develop international businesses. Since its inception, 1,490 companies have been accepted into this very successful program. The program was extended by the previous government in December 1995, with a further 1,500 companies to be admitted up until June 1999. The export access program, like EMDG, is a perfect example of how government and the private sector can work together, and every member of the coalition should acquaint themselves with these programs and ensure their survival.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In light of proposed cuts, we can only hope that the government will listen to the business community and not cut these vital schemes. This is the first test of the commitment of members opposite to the small business <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sector. These are the very companies that are creating jobs and exporting Australian goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I took some extracts from the exit questionnaires and evaluation surveys returned by firms involved in the export access program&mdash;and the same would apply for the EMDG scheme. Some 38 per cent of companies have experienced or expect job growth due to the export access program. Eighty&hyphen;six per cent of companies have indicated that they have been able to sustain their export drive or expect to maintain long-term export sales. Forty&hyphen;six per cent have already actually made sales or arranged long-term business relationships which include sales, appointing an agent or distributor and setting up a cooperative venture. A further 32 per cent are negotiating trade arrangements. Therefore, some 75 per cent of companies in the export access program are expecting to achieve successful outcomes. The same can be said for the EMDG scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of this shows that Australian exporters are benefiting from these programs. It is irresponsible to say otherwise. For over 20 years, the export market development grants scheme has served the small business community well. We have seen our exports doubled, jobs created and real gains made with our trading partners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To end business uncertainty and to honour their election promises, the coalition must give a clear commitment not only to the EMDG scheme but to the DIFF program and the export access program. All these need to remain so that Australia's small to medium sized businesses continue to expand into overseas markets and deliver the results which will benefit all Australians. An export culture needs to be nurtured. Australia's burgeoning export industries need these schemes for further success. Without them, our new found export culture will wither on the vine. I ask the House to support the amendment moved by the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith).</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendment proposed by the shadow minister, the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), to the motion for the second reading of the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill (No. 1). I will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2688"> not read the amendment into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> . However, it is very disappointing that a government which claimed that it was setting new standards of, I should say, good behaviour&mdash;in view of the events over the last two days&mdash;and probity in government and which made an election commitment to the tourist industry has introduced a bill that fails to reflect that commitment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also express my support for the remarks of those members that have expressed real concern about the longevity of this program. As you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, I think it was in 1974 that this type of program was established; that is, assisting people in their efforts to export goods and services from Australia to other countries, thereby increasing our own national wealth and increasing the number of jobs that Australians can aspire to or have. It is in fact a very worthwhile activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note from searching the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) asked a question of the then Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs regarding aid. The reason I am quoting it is that I want to demonstrate that when you are in the export business it really does take a long time to build up the market. You cannot expect Australian companies&mdash;small companies, medium companies&mdash;to place an ad in the classifieds, be it in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph</EMPHASIS> or the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, saying, `We want to export our product,' and anticipate that product orders are going to flow. Exporting is a long-term strategy by any company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting thing arising out of the McKinsey report is that there are a lot of small Australian companies who have got into exporting for the first time, have utilised things like the EMDG grants and have seen exports as a proportion of their business increase quite dramatically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I guess it is reasonable or perhaps understandable that some members of parliament want to score points on either side of the House, I think it is fair to say that the previous government really was the first government that tried in a very meaningful way to break out of our core export activity, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the things we have come to enjoy and very much appreciate as a nation: the exporting of our primary produce and our mineral exports. These are still very important today, but if we are to succeed as a nation, if we are to maintain and indeed improve our living standards, it is in the elaborately transformed manufactures and in the service industries that we need to really lift our game.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is interesting that when Mr Downer asked this question about DIFF funding in September&mdash;the answer was given in November 1995&mdash;there were expectations that for this financial year there would be some projects worth $267.9 million and it was anticipated that $60 million would be  funded during the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Often it is the case that exporters can first establish their reputation by bidding for projects overseas under the DIFF scheme. These are very worthwhile projects and they can vary in type from the one we are very familiar with&mdash;the patrol boats to the Philippines, which was going to be a `first in' order by the Philippines navy but with the expectation that, having gained that order, there would be many more flow-on orders&mdash;to projects such as rural power, education, water supply and water treatment. They are all listed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> in response to that question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be a real double blow to exporters in Australia, the small and medium businesses of Australia, if, having witnessed the abolition of a scheme that at least put them on par with overseas competitors&mdash;that is, the DIFF scheme&mdash;the government of the day not only breaks a promise made solemnly in the election to incorporate the tourism industry but in fact hacks into or even abandons the scheme itself in August.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So concerned was Wonderland, located in my electorate, about the possibility of this scheme being cancelled that they wrote to me and expressed their utter and extreme disappointment that this should even be contemplated. I must confess that I have very much a vested interest in this because Wonderland provides employment opportunities for lots of young people in my electorate. Whether they are at high school or studying at university, they are able to supplement their incomes by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2689"> working at Wonderland. Of course, they have a vested interest in seeing Wonderland develop and grow, to get even bigger. Whilst it is very popular, the key to its longevity and expansion is the ability to attract tourists to Wonderland from overseas. They saw the threat very directly and wrote to me. I have to confess that I am standing up here trying to represent their views, particularly those of the young people who have such a large stake in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, one of the amusing things about the western suburbs of Sydney, particularly the area I come from, is that we do not tend to think of ourselves as a tourist area, but in fact we are. We have Featherdale, which is now located just outside my electorate. Up to the redistribution I used to represent it. It is one of the Japanese tourist hot spots because they can get to see, and until recently handle, koalas there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Rooty Hill RSL, which is known to people even outside my electorate, had the great courage to build a motel, which is part of the Country Comfort chain now. They built a four&hyphen;storey motel. They fitted out two floors, and I am pleased to say that the other two floors are now open. They enjoy an occupancy rate of between 70 per cent and 80 per cent. They have packages associated with Wonderland. We used to have packages associated with Eastern Creek until that was lost to Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There are quite a number of other features&mdash;Parramatta, being a very historical part of Sydney; and the lower mountains and the Nepean River, et cetera, in the neighbouring electorate of Lindsay. We see tourism in my part of the world as one of those areas where, if we can tap into that market, we are going to be able to increase the number of jobs and job opportunities available to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As an urgency motion has been carried on the Export Market Development Grants Bill I cannot say all the things that I wanted to say. But I want to repeat that there is no joy for the opposition in seeing the government fail to live up to its commitments. Unfortunately, members of parliament are not held in high esteem by the Australian public. We have all got a stake in lifting the standards, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and I think that is why everyone initially welcomed the statements made by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Speaker of the House (Mr Halverson).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be no more devastating blow to credibility than when you fail to live up to promises. I make no apologies about expressing concern about that possibility. Paragraph 3 of the amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . condemns the Government for its failure to meet its election commitment to extend the Scheme by making full Export Market Development grants at 50% available to the tourism industry.</PARA>
<PARA>This is an absolutely diabolical blow to the tourist industry but it is also a diabolical blow to the credibility, standards and status, if you like, of all members of parliament. The  government members are the ones who are breaking the commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We worked very hard when we were in government to actually develop an export culture, to get Australian management and Australian business thinking about the opportunities that were available in our region and the wider world. There is a long way to go. I think we made an impact, but there is a long way to go. For the life of me I do not understand why, when other countries have much more generous schemes to encourage their companies, we would want to contemplate&mdash;after cutting out DIFF&mdash;cutting out this scheme. It is just too horrible to contemplate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Certainly, the Australian public is going to mark the government down for its failure to live up to its election commitments. It will mark it down again if the government abolishes this scheme or, indeed, attempts to hack or truncate the scheme. In marking the government down severely, it will indeed also mark us down, as members of this House, for failing to have made the government accountable for its words, accountable for its election commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott), who is at the table, to use his undoubted influence within the government to point out the high costs that the government will pay, given its handsome majority and the way in which it won the trust and confidence of the people of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2690"> Australia, and to ask it to think again before breaking these election commitments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in support of the second reading amendment moved by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith). The export market development grants scheme is without question a great success story in Australia's attempts to create export growth. The Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill (No. 1) is the reintroduction, with some minor amendments, of a bill introduced by the previous government. Therefore it has the support of the opposition in the type of refinements to the program that it is trying to achieve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Hawke-Keating Labor governments were extremely committed to the EMDG scheme. Since the inception of the scheme in 1974&mdash;an initiative of the Whitlam government&mdash;around 80,000 grants have been made. Some $273 million was provided for the scheme in the last budget, with an expectation that about 3,700 applications would be lodged. The amount of money allocated to the program was forecast to grow to $292 million by the financial year 1998-99. It was envisaged that the export market development grants scheme would provide assistance to approximately 5,000 exporters per annum by 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government's commitment contrasts greatly with the confusion and disarray now surrounding this successful scheme. To satisfy its ideological ends, the Howard government is attempting to rush through the sale of Telstra and smash Australia's industrial relations system with undue haste, but the government refuses to give clear direction in many other areas. The export market development grants scheme is one area where it has abdicated its role as the government. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Repeatedly at question time, we get the glib answer `Wait until 20 August' to many legitimate questions. This is not good enough. The government's lack of direction is having a detrimental effect on business&mdash;a cause they claim to hold so dear. While awaiting a decision on the future of this scheme, many businesses had to put their plans on hold, effectively jeopardising many <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> millions of dollars worth of exports. This export uncertainty is definitely something the coalition did not promise before the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> On the contrary, the coalition's statements on the future of the export market development grants scheme were clear and explicit. On page 30 of the coalition's trade policy document, `Meeting the challenge', it states:</PARA>

<PARA>I repeat: `We will maintain'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the export market development grants scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>One cannot get much clearer than that, yet businesses are now being subjected to uncertain and ambiguous statements by the government regarding the future of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A small business on the border of my electorate operating in Greensborough, Mi&hyphen;Sporting Products, trading as Blades Sports Footwear, has raised with me its concerns about its future under this government. Blades employs six people, but its economic significance is far greater than that. It provides the core business for about 14 subcontractors and has a turnover of several million dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a contribution to this debate the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) highlighted the tale of Blades Footwear. It should be remembered that this is a very innovative company that has developed a type of footwear that has great advantages to the users in many of the contact sports that we have in Australia. This company fought long and hard to get a toehold in the domestic market because the interests of multinational companies tried to squeeze them out. These multinationals, which used deals with organisations such as the VFL/AFL to ensure that their footwear could not be used, had to be beaten. Now, slowly but surely, they are getting that success. At least one club in the AFL has a contract with the company to supply footwear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The letter I received from Blades makes two important points about the EMDG. Firstly, it indicates the damage that would occur to its business as a result of the abolition of the export market development grants scheme. The letter says:</PARA>

<PARA>that is, Blades Sports Footwear in Greensborough&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">developed this innovative program on the basis that the EMDG scheme would be continuing because:</PARA>

<PARA>Secondly, the letter indicates that this vibrant small business is being paralysed by an inability of their business to plan while a country drifts in neutral and ministers chortle, `Wait until the budget on 20 August.'

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot wait until then; our program is being launched within weeks, and we have already made binding commitments for the next 12&hyphen;18 months on the basis of the express coalition promises.</PARA>
<PARA>The government is prepared to allow innovative and export oriented businesses such as Blades to flounder rather than make a commitment to a program that it promised it would maintain before the election.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many such potential disasters developing. The so-called friends of small business are putting small business on the rack of their indecision by their determination to impose ideologically motivated cuts. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 27 May there is a report that the Australian Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers Association has stated that the rumoured abolition of the development import finance facility will have serious consequences. The report quotes from a submission to government to the effect that the scrapping of DIFF `could see loss of up to 10 per cent of the industry's exports, worth around $200 million'. This mindless vandalism is a pathetic excuse for public policy. The Australian people did not vote for this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I quoted in the House recently, eminent economists are warning that it is neither necessary nor desirable to seek to reduce discretionary spending by $8 billion over the next two years simply because the economy is forecast to grow more slowly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of Blades' letter, I wrote to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade urging him to show some resolve and clarify now whether the government intended to honour its promises to keep the export market development grants scheme so that business in this country can get on with the job and not wait for an arbitrary date in August. His answer to me was as unsatisfactory as the answer that Blades received. But it had a striking difference. Instead of emphasising the so-called $8 billion black hole, it was given only very scant mention in the letter to me. In the letter to me the minister says that the coalition's overall approach is to address the shortfall in the deficit that was created by the previous government. Of course, in the letter to Blades he hides behind this $8 billion black hole, which is a con created by the Treasurer (Mr Costello). I think that the response by this company proves that they do not believe the contention that is being put by the minister. They want straight answers. They want confirmation of what was quite clear policy at the time of the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2692"> The majority of beneficiaries of the EMDG scheme are small to medium sized enterprises&mdash;the so-called SMEs. These are the busi nesses that the coalition continually refers to as the engine of the economy and whom the coalition continually purports to want to help. Export market development grants to SMEs account for about 70 per cent of all the grants under the scheme. It is an effective way to encourage the small and medium enterprises to seek out export markets and orientate their business around developing goods and services for export. It is creating an important export culture within this section of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee examined this bill some of the comments of those testifying illustrated the enormous effect that this scheme has had. The Australian Publishers Association claimed that there has been a 100 per cent increase in exports in its industry over a four-year period. Furthermore, it claims that this export growth is directly attributable to the export market development grants scheme. The Australian Institute of Exports said before the committee hearing that independent research showed that, for every $1 paid in grants, $2.60 resulted in additional export marketing expenditure and between $15 and $25 in additional exports. That is a benefit from this scheme of between 15 to one to 25 to one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A survey conducted by the Australian Business Chamber of its New South Wales members at the end of last year found that the export market development grants scheme was the most used program by its 509 members. These are very powerful statistics which clearly show the value of this program to the Australian economy as well as to the individual exporters applying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been two comprehensive reviews of the EMDG scheme: the Auditor-General's efficiency audit in 1993-94 and Austrade's own review in 1994. Both reviews found that the EMDG scheme was effective and efficient. The previous government ensured that the recommendations of the efficiency audit were implemented, making the scheme even more accountable. The results well and truly bear out the effectiveness of this scheme.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Austrade review entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Helping to meet the export challenge</EMPHASIS> found that the scheme is achieving its objectives in assisting Australian business to develop new export markets. It found this to be particularly true of the small and medium sized firms. It found that returns to the Commonwealth from taxes on grants and additional exports resulting from the grants scheme were calculated to recoup approximately 42 per cent of the entire scheme, which ratchets up the cost benefit ratio by another factor of two. This makes an already highly economically efficient scheme even more efficient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most pleasing aspects of the review's findings was that around 45 per cent of the exports created were in the services industry. With increasing emphasis on the burgeoning service economy, it is important for the future that exports be in these expanding sectors rather than in sectors whose importance to the economy is diminishing. Thus the scheme contributes not only to creating exports now but to establishing a basis for future exports by creating them in growing sectors. This review was an endorsement of the export market development grants scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The constant speculation about the future of the scheme is hardly encouraging to other government programs. What does it mean for other programs of industry assistance in the run-up to the budget, particularly the ones that do well and are economically efficient? Even if a program fulfils its obligations, is found to be efficient, is able to return part of its cost to budget and contributes to improving our balance of trade, it is still not immune from this government's ideological obsession with cutting. The government is not being asked to do anything to the EMDG scheme that it did not expressly undertake to do prior to the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry assistance must be recognised for the substantial role that it plays in strengthening the Australian economy and export potential. The government cannot afford to reject the notion of industry assistance out of some blind ideological obsession with small government or reject intervention in the economy per se. As has been stated continually in this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2693"> debate, what this scheme is about is partnership&mdash;partnership between industry and government to achieve new export growth. The government cannot afford to because the EMDG scheme is proof of the value to the economy in providing strategic assistance. For the thousands of innovative and creative export orientated firms who have been thrown into confusion by the decision, it is time for the government to come clean on its plans for the EMDG scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst this debate has been truncated, which is disappointing and against what we were promised&mdash;to see the supremacy of parliament over the executive&mdash;the opposition would not have had to enter into this debate with as much gusto, given that in principle we are in agreement with the main points of this bill, if the Minister for Trade, the Leader of the National Party, the Deputy Prime Minister of this government, was able to come into the House and guarantee the continuation of the export market development grants scheme. It is a promise that was in the platform of the coalition before the election. It is a promise that, if it came out now, would give certainty to the many companies that are willing to take on the challenge of creating new export growth.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was particularly interested in the introduction of the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill (No.1) 1996. I actually came into the House to listen to the contribution of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), who, as most members would be aware, has been particularly garrulous on anything remotely connected with overseas. In the last few months he has made a number of rather infamous contributions, rushing off to assure the world that President Suharto would be regarded as the greatest statesman of the late 20th century. It was an obvious message to that government because a few weeks later they rejected UN, Portuguese and, basically, world pressure in regard to Timor and announced that there would be no compromise ever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, as we have seen in the last week or so, this brilliant prediction of his has been followed by the interference of Indonesian <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> authorities in the internal affairs of the opposition PDI Party. He then galloped around to comment on Myanmar, noting that it was drifting towards democracy only a few days before the international focus on further suppression there. On other occasions, we are aware that he has attempted to basically trade Australian security in regard to the US bases for some deal with some farmer or ranch senators in the US system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I came down hear to listen to him because he has a record of intervention in anything so remotely connected with overseas affairs. But his contribution was perfunctory. It was brief. It was totally lacking information. I think it is very clear why his contribution to the debate was essentially, `This is a Labor bill. It's your bill. I am here to move it, but I am not going to say very much about it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should digress for a moment to say that this was in stark contrast to the contributions of members opposite in regard to another one of Labor's bills&mdash;the hazardous waste legislation. We are also participating in that debate. I noticed great interest and great support from government speakers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here, of course, the contribution of the Deputy Prime Minister&mdash;the man who is ready to comment on anything in the foreign policy trade area&mdash;was very brief. I all the more expected a major contribution, given the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> article on 23 May this year entitled `Ministers at odds over budget cuts', which spoke of, essentially, a war between Mr Downer and Mr Fischer over this policy area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2694"> I thought he had the opportunity to put something on the record about what he actually thought in this field. But, as I have said, he gave a very brief and very uninformative contribution. I think the reason for this is quite obvious: he essentially has a very major area of guilt in this policy area. If you listened to the Senate committee hearings on this matter and noted the contributions of some of the witnesses, and if you looked at the public record, you would know he is certainly a person who was a lot more talkative and a lot more prepared to make a contribution before the election. On 15 February 1996, in one of his typical to&hyphen;the&hyphen;point com ments, he said, `EMDGS stays.' Can anyone be any stronger than that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, the past president of the Australian Publishers Association and Peter Campbell, the current president, have individually commented that he gave them `his personal assurance' and, what seems even stronger, `his personal and unequivocal commitment'. So we have Mr Fischer coming in here and giving the government's total commitment to the EMDGS, which before the election was something they thought was the greatest thing since sliced bread. In the document `Meeting the challenge' the coalition said that they would be looking towards:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">providing more effective access to export assistance programs, EMDGS . . . and examine how access to assistance packages can be improved.</PARA>
<PARA>If we did not want to stay with that comment in `Meeting the challenge', the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) released the coalition's commerce policy in February 1996. Part of that policy stated that they would `maintain the existing range of general export assistance programs, including export market development grants'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have a situation where the Deputy Prime Minister made sure he was up there, prominent, in the big time, before the election saying, `EMDGS stays.' We had the policy document. There was no equivocation, there was no doubt; there was a firm commitment. As I said earlier, the contribution of the Deputy Prime Minister, at the start of this debate this week, indicates that very little faith can be had in the preservation of this system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is clear evidence that the EMDG scheme has value. I could cite a few of the witnesses from the Senate hearings on the matter. The Australian Institute of Exports (NSW) Ltd stated in its submission that it `opposes, in principle, any amendment which reduces the certainty of committee exporters being able to access grant support'. The Australian Information Industry Association elaborated on a statement they made earlier in the year&mdash;which I will come to in a minute&mdash;when they said it `should be available to assist medium sized exporters who need to expand their overseas marketing rapidly or <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> who must undertake costly activities such as the establishment of overseas officers'. They noted that we currently earn $3 billion in exports in the IT field. They indicated that perhaps by the end of the decade that could reach $10 billion, but they noted that any attempt to assault the EMDGS, any attempt to undermine it, would put that at risk. They instanced a company which, after eight years, now raises 90 per cent of its revenue offshore. It received $600,000, but it had earned $4.4 million last year and expected to earn $7 million this year. They quoted that company's representatives who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without the grant, I doubt whether a small privately owned company like ours would have the financial resources to continue.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Business Chamber stated that it `supports the need for Commonwealth expenditure cuts, but also supports the EMDGS'. They said it was `a legitimate tool of industry policy'. I should say that they came up with some rather inventive maths in their submission. They said that, when the government said they wanted everyone to sacrifice in this country, they thought a $4 billion reduction in the deficit out of a $119 billion budget meant that their reduction should be only 3.4 per cent. The main point is that the government have said that there is a need for this scheme. The Australian Business Chamber elaborated that undermining it was not good for the Australian economy, was not good for exports, was not good for small business and was essentially a step in the wrong direction. Jim Hart, the Director of Lonely Planet Publications, on 5 June said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Support is needed beyond the start&hyphen;up stage . . . One factor which encourages us to maintain most of our production onshore is the EMDGS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without the grant we would still be exporting, but our development of markets would be at a slower level. </PARA>
<PARA>I referred earlier to the Australian Information Industry Association. In their May bulletin they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The EMDGS is the only financial support available for most IT&amp;T exporters. Small exporters will be particularly affected as 70 per cent of EMDGS grants go to companies with fewer than 25 staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is disappointing, as the Government made an election promise not to cut EMDG. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2695"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Abolition seriously threatens the spectacular growth in IT&amp;T exports in recent years . . . We are unlikely to reach our target of $A10 billion in export reserves.</PARA>
<PARA>As I noted earlier, they have said that again in recent documentation and recent evidence given before the Senate investigation into this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Besides industry representatives making comments, there has been a plethora of comments in the press. Every financial journalist has assailed this slash and burn policy. Without thought, the government has said, `We have to cut this; we have to cut that. Let's just do it&mdash;$8 billion. Bang, bang, bang!' However, evidence from industry and Australian exporters has shown a growth resulting from the EMDGS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been a number of inquiries into the EMDGS, and they have led over the years to a number of amendments to the scheme. One of them, of course, was in the tourist industry. There is an amendment from this side of the House, which I will come to in a minute. But, essentially, there has been a variety of investigations into this scheme, some of which have been referred to by previous speakers&mdash;the Industry Assistance Commission in 1978 and 1982, the Ferris committee in 1985, Price Waterhouse in 1988 and the Bureau of Industry Economics in 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I happened to be a member of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology when it looked into the relationship of this grant to the tourist industry. The committee commented that the scheme had been `instrumental in encouraging firms to commence exporting and enabling established firms to enter into difficult markets. They have been of benefit to other Australian firms wishing to enter these markets'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From my recollection, the committee's recommendation was unanimous. It was not that we get rid of the EMDGS or limit it. Those now in government were actually drooling at the possibility of extending it to those sectors of the tourist industries which operated in only one sector. For instance, they thought that Hertz Rent A Car and the Hyatt hotel chain should get EMDGS. They thought <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that the previous government was too restrictive about whom it applied to in the tourism industry. They said that the EMDGS was too narrow. I must admit that at the time I had doubts as to the credibility of the argument that many people come to this country attracted by the Hyatt Hotel alone. Those opposite were extremely enthusiastic, and I guess that I was carried away by their enthusiasm. That inquiry indicated that as many as 390,000 people in this country were employed by firms that had received EMDGS. The report indicated that nearly $2.7 billion in export earnings were related to these grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill before the House essentially seeks to ensure that there are tighter controls in the field. It attempts to bring about rational reform to the procedures. Certainly, I support the opposition amendment with regard to the tourist industry. Whilst there might be some arguments as to whether one-off companies providing only one service should receive the grant, there is no question whatsoever as to the need to end discrimination against those sectors of the tourist industry which do attract people to this country in what is essentially our major earner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had quotes from the private sector, from those people with a commercial self-interest and from financial writers. We also have one from Ralph Evans, the former head of Austrade. On 29 May he joined the chorus by indicating that if he was in the cabinet he certainly would not be abolishing it. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"They'll make their decisions about EMDG I suppose, and I'm sure the Minister . . . is supporting it very strongly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"But it is a program that works. It's been refined many times&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>as in this legislation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It can be refined some more, but it is a well established program that does actually work."</PARA>
<PARA>The contribution of the Deputy Prime Minister was certainly indicative of an attempt within the government to abolish this scheme. His evasion, his refusal to make a major contribution and his throwaway comment that he did not need to do anything about it because it was a Labor bill are a telling indication of the debate that is occurring. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2696">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a telling indictment of the breaking of very serious commitments to Australian industry, to those Australian workers who depend on these export advancing fields. It is an indictment of a government which has essentially decided on slash and burn, an ill-considered policy which stretches from abolishing EMDGS on the one hand to attempting to save money by apparently depriving Comcar drivers of coffee and tea. It indicates the lack of analysis of what can be done and what should be done in this country to overcome our problems.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to rise to speak in support of the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill (No. 1) this evening, as it serves as a stark reminder of the many popular and highly successful programs that the previous Labor government introduced to support Australia's small and medium size businesses. It also serves as yet another example of the Howard government's duplicitous and misguided treatment of our small business sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is substantially the same as that which was presented by the previous government in November of last year, a bill which modified arrangements for the export market development grants scheme arising from the 1995 to 1996 budget. The export market development grants scheme was introduced by the Whitlam government back in 1974 to encourage both small and medium size business to seek out new export markets for Australian goods and services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Approximately 70,000 such grants were awarded under the scheme between 1974 and 1991, with the average value of these grant being around $65,000. In the last financial year, some 3,400 such grants were awarded, worth a total of $211 million. The scheme is expected to grow to around $292 million by the financial year ending 1998-99.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note that both small and medium size businesses are the major beneficiaries of the scheme, making up 70 per cent of grant recipients. The Keating Labor government had announced in 1994 the extension of the EMDG scheme for a further five years, as part of the Working Nation <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> initiatives, which would result in an expected 5,000 exporters receiving assistance under the scheme each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should take the time to point out that both small and medium size exporting firms in my electorate of Isaacs have received $700,000 funding through the EMDG scheme over the last two financial years, which has assisted these firms with their export efforts and has aided in the creation of badly needed jobs for the Isaacs electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the time available to me this evening is somewhat limited, and as many of my colleagues have already spoken in some detail about the benefits of this legislation, I will not take up the time of the House by going through those matters once again in detail. But I would like to point out&mdash;and you would be well aware of this, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;that the main point of contention regarding the EMDG scheme is not the specific amendments to the bill but rather that we on this side of the House join with both industry and financial commentators in expressing our fears for the long-term prospects of the scheme in the face of the government's often repeated intention of massive budget cuts across the entire range of government activity in the form that my colleague the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) has just alluded to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A submission from the MTIA, presented to the Senate committee considering the EMDG bill, said that there was a great necessity for government and government programs, such as the EMDG scheme, to pursue these schemes as a matter of course and that the implications of cutbacks in funding were too heinous and too severe to countenance. The MTIA in its submissions to that Senate committee said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any reduction in funding for export assistance schemes would be short&hyphen;sighted in the extreme, particularly given the level of Australia's current account deficit, and would have the inevitable result of reducing the export promotion activities which industry is able to undertake.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is imperative that Australia increase both the number of exporters and the level of exports by existing exporters. While Australian industry has achieved substantial increases in exports in recent years, this growth has been from a low base. It is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2697"> essential to Australia's economic future that growth in exports, particularly of high value added exports, is accelerated.</PARA>
<PARA>The MTIA continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government assistance programs and in particular the EMDG scheme are vital to this process. Funds allocated to these programs should be seen as appropriate investment in our economic future and not as non&hyphen;essential expenditure to be cut simply when budget conditions are tight.</PARA>
<PARA>The MTIA concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has taken Australia many long painful years to build up an export culture and improve our competitiveness on world markets. These achievements are all now at risk given the government's short&hyphen;sighted decision to abolish the DIFF scheme, to increase costs through recent changes to the tariff concession arrangements simultaneously with the final tariff phase down and all combined with a substantial strengthening of the Australian dollar.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To now contemplate adding to these major imposts on ability to export through abolishing the EMDG scheme is folly in the extreme and will unquestionably result in fewer exports and heightened import penetration with a consequent adverse impact on the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA>Such were some of the sentiments in the submission provided by the MTIA to that Senate committee of inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having as recently as last night taken part in the debate on the taxation amendment bill, where the opposition is in the unusual position of trying to keep one of the government's promises to small business regarding changes to the provisional tax uplift factor, I am not greatly surprised to find another situation where the government is trying to worm its way out of one of its election promises to its much cherished small business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's often repeated position on the EMDG scheme during the last election campaign was that not only would they maintain the scheme but that they would look to expand and improve it as well. This was made perfectly clear in the coalition's trade policy document entitled `Meeting the challenge', which stated that the coalition:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . will look at ways of providing more effective access to export assistance schemes, including EMDG . . . and will examine how access to assistance packages can be improved. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>I must add the public comment of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) that `EMDG stays'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was a position that was made perfectly clear by the coalition in its election campaign. Yet since that campaign the minister has had many chances to reaffirm these commitments given during that same campaign. In response to the questions in this place from my colleague the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) and the shadow minister's representative in the Senate, Senator Sherry, the minister and other members of the government have run away from their promise at a million miles an hour&mdash;perhaps, after today, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) has limped away at one or two miles an hour.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Condemnation of the Howard government's treatment of small business has been widespread, coming from all sides of the political and philosophical spectrum. The member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) has alluded to what some of the financial journalists have had to say&mdash;notably Alex Kennedy, who wrote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">BRW</EMPHASIS> on 10 June:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's lack of support for the scheme since its election in March has confounded state governments and business groups because it is almost unanimously considered one of the most successful of any export&hyphen;support programs.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on at some length in that same vein. Furthermore, aside from Treasury officials having a well&hyphen;known and long held dislike of schemes such as the EMDG program, which do not fit into their dry, economic rationalist view of `leaving the market to its own devices, and hang the consequences', there is yet another agenda behind the threat to this worthwhile scheme. Michael Dwyer, writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  on 23 May this year reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Internecine warfare has broken out in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio, as its <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2698"> three core agencies battle it out to protect their key programs from savage budget cuts.</PARA>
<PARA>Relations between the offices of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the late and great Mr Alexander Downer&mdash;the member for Batman has just interjected that he will soon be relegated to the backbench&mdash;started poorly and have deteriorated. It appears that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been trying to quarantine itself from substantial budget cuts, and has instead been offering up sacrifice programs run by AusAID and Austrade. Michael Dwyer went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is understood Mr Fischer has written to the Prime Minister, Mr John Howard, requesting that all expenditure review committee meetings dealing with the DFAT budget are held at times when both portfolio ministers can be present.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In light of this information, and the general knowledge that the new Deputy Prime Minister is having a tough time settling into his new job&mdash;what with his backbenchers revolting over the gun control measures and whispers of leadership challenges permeating the corridors and back rooms of parliament&mdash;I think the honourable minister has been provided with an ideal opportunity to address this and, in doing so, to restore some meaning to the National Party in a policy sense. If the Deputy Prime Minister is able to achieve this, in one fell swoop he will re-establish the philosophical differences between the National Party and the Liberal Party. As Minister for Trade, he will have restored some of the faith and trust that both small and medium sized businesses and exporters have placed in this government to do the right thing by themselves and Australia. I commend this course of action to the Deputy Prime Minister and I commend the bill, as amended, to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to have the opportunity to briefly join in this debate and to support the remarks put by the shadow minister for trade and the shadow minister for tourism in this matter. In so doing I am pleased to speak after the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton), because I remember during the election campaign, when he was candidate for the seat of Isaacs, attending functions in what is now his constituency and dealing with this very <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> issue of how we could get more small business in his region into the export business with the assistance of Austrade and AusIndustry. They were very effective programs, and I was very pleased to receive his assistance in doing that at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly concerned not only about developments in relation to the EMDG scheme but also about the pattern of developments which is being displayed. We are seeing under threat every government program that has, at its core, the enhancement of Australia's economic engagement with Asia. One has already gone; that is, DIFF&mdash;a very important scheme that has successfully brought many companies into the export business in our region and has formed a base upon which many of them have built ongoing, successful businesses in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know from first&hyphen;hand experience about putting forward what one thinks are very effective submissions to ministers in the countries in our region on behalf of Australian companies&mdash;successful, efficient, competitive Australian companies. The example most vivid in my memory&mdash;but not unique&mdash;is where I spoke to an Indonesian minister on behalf of an Australian company. His response was, `What terms can you offer?' If there had been no DIFF scheme, we would have been off the list. That company would have hit the wall and failed to achieve a contract which it could otherwise have won, and Australian jobs would have been at threat. As a consequence of the unwise decision of this government, that will now happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This matter has sometimes been dismissed lightly. It has more recently become the subject of all sorts of political controversy about issues to do with misleading the House. But the core question about whether Australia should have abolished the DIFF scheme has been brushed aside. I suggest to those people who think this is not important that they attend the factories and offices and other workplaces where the DIFF scheme has generated employment opportunities and sustained jobs and explain to people&mdash;the executives, the middle managers as well as those on the shop-floor&mdash;why this scheme is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2699"> not important and why all their competitors should have it but not them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Alcatel is looking to fill a contract around the region they can look at any of their subsidiaries except their Australian one. Their French subsidiary will have access to soft loan finance, all their other subsidiaries will have access to soft loan finance&mdash;but not their Australian subsidiary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian infrastructure consortium program&mdash;a new, emerging scheme&mdash;was earlier suggested to be under threat. I hope that does not continue to be the case. I saw directly significant potential for that to assist Australian companies too small individually to compete for major contracts to form Australian based consortia and win substantial parts of them. There is a trillion dollar infrastructure business in this region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most vivid example was the development of an Australian consortium pursuing the second Guangzhou airport&mdash;a very important project involving billions of dollars. Australia will not get all of it, even with this scheme. But, if the Australian infrastructure consortium program goes, we will get none of it. That will be a tragedy for many fine architectural firms, many fine engineering firms and some of the construction firms&mdash;those very successful Australian firms which are developing hi&hyphen;tech capacity for input into major airport projects. If they cannot form a consortium, if they cannot be part of a bigger project team, they will not win bits and pieces; it will go to some other consortium, funded with assistance like this from a host government in Europe or North America.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the AICP's case it was essentially a revolving fund. There were not the great outlays by the Australian government, which is also the case for the international trade enhancement scheme. I cannot believe the rumours that that is under threat because, in effect, there is no appropriation for the ITES scheme. It is a revolving fund, but I have seen practical examples of companies in every state in Australia building on their export performance, enhancing their export performance, as a result of ITES loans. I remember particular grants made in Western Australia to Bates Saddlery and in South Australia to some of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the big wine companies, enhancing export performance and winning trade opportunities for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people tell me the export access scheme is under threat. It is directly run by industry organisations particularly to assist small business into some of the key export markets, including Japan and the United States. There are also the overall cuts to Austrade itself. Those five examples&mdash;the cuts to DIFF and the AICP program; the threat to export access, to ITES and to Austrade&mdash;are the background against which one could look with alarm at the EMDG reports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Initially it was speculated that the scheme was to be abolished. I have to say I never found that credible. I find it incredible that there is even now serious consideration that the scheme might be halved, but that seems to have the ring of authenticity from the Expenditure Review Committee. As someone who has been through an Expenditure Review Committee on behalf of EMDG, I thought, `How could you halve expenditure on a program that is not appropriation based but which is application based?' If people fulfil the criteria, they get the money. It is not a share of a fixed pool; it is determined by the quality and number of the applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me there are only three ways. One way is to reduce the 50 per cent grant to 25 per cent. Quite obviously, all other things being equal, that will halve the outlays. I think that is probably going to form the category of `too smart by half' and is not likely to be proceeded with. If it were, it would, I suppose, achieve the perverse effect of bringing tourism up to the top rate, because everybody would have come down to the tourism rate. But that is not my expectation. I think that is not likely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second way is to convert the scheme into a capped grants and application scheme. In other words, you do not get your entitlement by meeting certain legislative criteria, but there is a capped amount of money and you apply. It is a process similar to ITES, by which the board of Austrade, or someone else, makes decisions to make grants against that capped amount. The problem with that is it would take much too long to get that scheme <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2700"> established, you would not get any savings in the first year and there are significant administrative costs. So I think that is unlikely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I looked to a third alternative&mdash;the one I think is the most likely&mdash;which is to devise a program to cap the outlays: not dissimilar to the way that it is done, for example, at the Australian Wheat Board, where a fixed pool of money is allocated and the amount that each applicant gets is determined by the number of successful applicants divided into the total pool of money. Perhaps you would get an initial grant&mdash;not unlike an advance to the Wheat Board&mdash;at the 25 per cent level and then a top up, depending on how much is left in the pool and on the number of other successful applicants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That seems to me to be the most likely, but what does that mean for exporters? It means, firstly, as a matter of definition less support and, secondly, less certainty in the amount of support. When you make commitments and you are measuring your annual budget, you cannot be sure how much support you are going to receive under EMDG&mdash;you have to speculate. It may be that, after five years operation of a scheme like that, you could pretty well assess what your chances were of getting support. But certainly in the first few years there would be a high degree of speculative risk activity, exactly what we tried to avoid with EMDG: reducing the risk of making financial commitments in exporting, particularly for small companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be concerned if any of those three schemes are developed and their net result is that the funding to EMDG is halved. I think the third one&mdash;which, I suspect, is the most likely&mdash;has a significant downside for small business and for Australia's export performance. That flies in the face of any rational assessment of economic and social objectives that any government should be setting down for Australia. Any rational assessment of Australia's future says that what we should be focusing on is increasing manufactured exports, increasing high technology services and increasing our economic engagement with the fastest growing region in the world at our doorstep&mdash;Asia. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To move through that way&mdash;moving to the higher growth path that the report which I released in January established was possible&mdash;so that Australia can sustain about a one per cent higher growth performance than it has traditionally been able to do without starting to run into the constraint of the current account deficit will enable us to establish and maintain that level of economic growth at about four per cent, and that will mean unemployment can come down. It would be a tragedy if that capacity which we have generated in the last decade were to be turned around by short&hyphen;sighted policies&mdash;particularly in relation to the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996&mdash;and by cuts to EMDG.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cuts in outlays are one thing. We have debates about our preferred views of fiscal policy, and we disagree with the government's fiscal policy and with this artificial requirement that they have generated that, somehow or other, they have to cut $8 billion. It does not matter if the starting point shifts; they still have to cut $8 billion. They have to move a predetermined amount from wherever the starting point is. But, if they must make those cuts, let us approach it with some strategy and purpose. Do not make the cuts in the areas that maximise our engagement with Asia and our manufacturing and high technology service exports. Do not interfere with that boom in our exports of high technology goods and services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2701"> This is a scheme that has been measured time and time again, reviewed time and time again, and found to be effective. The most recent reports say that typically mature exporter firms in most industries will generate 15 to 25 times the grants paid to them in additional exports. Less experienced exporters will achieve a lower level. The survey suggests the scheme also has some effect on encouraging firms to accelerate their planned development in new markets, a significant impact on improving firms' business practices such as quality management and best practice production technologies, and a moderate impact on improving firms' overall competitiveness in the domestic market&mdash;that is, developing to meet the international competi tive market enhances domestic performance also. And it is not surprising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was also assessed by Tim Colebatch on Thursday, 2 May when he was looking at the cut options this government might be addressing. In a long article, from which in other circumstances I would quote extensively, he said that if they must cut the budget:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . one of their priorities . . . should be to choose savings options that will have least impact on future growth.</PARA>
<PARA>Later in the article, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The trick now is to keep the momentum going to take us to the higher part and the biggest rewards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To do that, the Costello razor gang must abandon the soft option of slashing funds for business to grow and export.</PARA>
<PARA>In the course of a debate with me during the last election, the now Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) said, `EMDG stays.' Everybody who was listening did not think he meant just the title; they thought he meant the scheme. I hope that my worst apprehensions, that now we will have the title but not the scheme, are not fulfilled.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking this evening on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996, I want to clearly indicate that I very much agree with the sentiments expressed by the shadow minister for industrial relations. I know from my experience in industry that EMDG is a success and it must stay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that note, I want to strongly outline my opposition to a proposed reduction or even a potential outright abolition of the export market development grants scheme. More importantly, in my contribution I want to deal with, and in doing so highlight, the importance of the EMDG scheme to the question of jobs and training, which I thought was the No. 1 priority confronting Australia as a nation at this point in time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, this government's instinctive urge is to slash spending and leave everything to the market. If you have any doubt about that, I can only say that in the short time this government has been in office it has, unfortunately, put a number of key programs which intervene to help firms invest, export and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> develop better products onto the chopping block.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This evening a number of speakers on our side of the House have correctly raised the decision by the government to abolish the development import finance facility, which has seen the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) in so much difficulty over the last two days, and so he ought to be. DIFF is one of the successes with respect to our endeavours as a nation to promote opportunities that result in additional opportunities in Australia for jobs and training. But the government's decision with respect to DIFF is just plain wrong. I say that because, for every dollar spent on DIFF by the government, $5 of export income is generated for the nation&mdash;and that is through the provision of infrastructure overseas by Australian companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the last 10 to 13 years, our No. 1 priority has been to get Australian companies not only to develop but also to rigorously pursue an export culture. DIFF has been central to the development of such a culture and, if anything, to a final decision by more and more Australian companies to face up to the fact that they should not just concentrate on the domestic market but seek to develop opportunities beyond Australia so as to maximise our employment and training opportunities as a nation. Unfortunately, the government has also taken away the tax incentives for research and development by Australian businesses and with it the prospect of many new innovations for exports from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the sake of a tiny amount of money&mdash;and that is what it is&mdash;the government is looking to cut the export market development grants scheme. It is to be condemned and exposed for what it is: a narrow government that is not prepared to develop and pursue a vision which is about the future development and economic prosperity of Australia as a nation. The government truly knows the short-term cost of everything but knows the medium&hyphen; and long&hyphen;term value of nothing. That is really the culture that permeates the government at this point in time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not just my view. I also suggest that it is the view of many in the business sector <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2702"> across the length and breadth of Australia. If you have any doubts about that, I refer in passing to one of Australia's leading business representatives and his view with respect to this matter. I refer to the views of Bert Evans, the head of the Metal Trades Industry Association, who has said the trouble with this government is that `bookkeepers have got hold of the budget'. That is the view of Bert Evans. He is not a person of any insignificance in industry but one of Australia's leading business representatives, and his view is that `the bookkeepers have got hold of the budget'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, Bert Evans has been on the record suggesting that in the eyes of the current government `everything is a cost; nothing is an investment'. We believe, as I have said, as do many in the community at large, especially those in the business community, that Bert Evans is right. This government does not understand that sometimes you need to spend a little bit in order to create something much bigger for the future, and that is what DIFF and EMDG are about. They are about this nation investing for the purpose of developing better opportunities in the future, opportunities that will take Australia forward and, in doing so, create opportunities not just in metropolitan Australia but also in all regions of Australia for the purposes of the development of industry and training and employment opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to raise in passing tonight that it is no longer just about the manufacturing industry and export potential; it is also now of great significance to the service industry. I have responsibility in that vogue with respect to jobs and training and the potential export of education and training opportunities. The scheme was first introduced by the Whitlam Labor government in 1974 and numerous Australian exporters are to be congratulated because they took up the challenge, and Australia and their individual companies have benefited from this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recently had the opportunity to see the continuing value of the scheme when I paid a visit to Queensland and saw at first hand the work of a business academy called The Office in the service sector of Australian industry. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> That sector is one of the areas that will grow and continue to grow. In doing so, it will create more and more employment opportunities which are of the utmost importance for the future economic and social development of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This international college provides accredited English language courses. From time to time the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) talks about literacy training and accredited English courses. But these courses are not just provided for Australians; they are also, importantly, provided for overseas students. They are a major export earner for Australia. As well as providing courses in accredited English, the college also provides courses in business, commerce, hospitality, travel and tourism&mdash;all industries of major importance to the future growth and development of Australian industry. In other words, in economic terms, the college exports education and training services to our Asian neighbours to the benefit of Australia's revenue base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You know that all important issue: we as a nation must earn additional revenue on the trade front. I thought that was of some importance to the new government. But I am beginning to seriously doubt its commitment to that objective when we consider the issues before the House this evening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The school itself had humble beginnings. In 1979 it had an enrolment of nine students. It has grown since then to be a major institution in the centre of Brisbane, with over 1,000 Australian and international graduates each year. I think we ought to be proud of its achievements&mdash;and we ought to be guaranteeing the future of schemes such as the EMDG scheme to encourage businesses to continue to build on the successes they have achieved time and time again, success such as this school has achieved since 1979.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A vital factor in the growth and success of this academy, as I have said, has been the support provided by the export market development grants scheme. According to the college president, Sarina Russo, cuts to the EMDG scheme would be `unbelievable and tragic'&mdash;yes, unbelievable and tragic not just for her college but for any person or business <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2703"> wanting to export education and training services to our region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ms Russo says that the scheme helps to open up new markets in places such as Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Indonesia&mdash;all countries that we have pursued over the last decade for the purposes of opening up sales to achieve export opportunities and, in doing so, to create long&hyphen;term meaningful employment and training opportunities in this country. The scheme gives to Ms Russo a huge incentive for the creation of English language schools run by Australians overseas which would never otherwise get off the ground because of the enormous capital required with so little certainty of outcome. The EMDG scheme encouraged Ms Russo to develop her school not just within Australia but also in the international arena.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the shadow minister for employment and training, I want to see more education and training services exported in Australia, so that more jobs can be generated here&mdash;so that we can guarantee, to the best of our ability as a nation, the greatest availability of jobs, irrespective of where you live across the length and breadth of Australia. That is one very good reason why the export market development grants scheme should be not just maintained but also further developed and strengthened. That should be a matter of priority for any government that is interested in the further development and encouragement of industry in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In passing, I now would go briefly to my own electorate in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, an area that is unfortunately experiencing a high level of unemployment&mdash;an area where the firm of Howe Leather is located. Howe Leather, I have discovered, is another potential victim of this government's short-sighted approach to trade policy. Howe Leather is an outstanding business. It now supplies leather to major German motor companies and has increased the percentage of its products which are exported from Australia from the low level of seven per cent in 1988 to more than 95 per cent now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly, Howe Leather has continued to create additional jobs as a result of those export developments&mdash;jobs for ordinary <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> working people in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. I know that might not be of much importance to the government of the day. But it is of the utmost importance to a person such as me who wants to do everything possible to ensure that all Australians get access to decent jobs and training opportunities in life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently the company of Howe Leather scored yet another coup because of the support the previous government had given it over the last decade. What did that company win? It won a $25 million contract to supply leather to General Motors in the United States. That is not a bad achievement. It was achieved because of the support given to that company, and other such companies, by the previous government&mdash;support which is now to be strangled by the government of the day because that government does not have a real commitment to the needs and aspirations of industry, let alone the needs and aspirations of Australia at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real issue is that we now have a government that is prepared to risk&mdash;yes, risk&mdash;the opportunity for success of Australian companies such as Howe Leather to break into export markets. That is what it is about. This government is prepared to risk the future business and employment opportunities of companies that have faced up to the all important issue of looking beyond Australia and developing an export culture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can tell you this: it was not easy to ensure that such an export culture was developed out there in industry over the last decade. All too often too many Australian companies were inward looking, merely dependent on the Australian economy, without being prepared to face up to the opportunities that exist beyond Australia to export and develop employment opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would say in passing that it is for these reasons I will be pushing to make sure that the government does not capitulate on this vital issue. Bert Evans is right, business at large is right&mdash;and so is the Australian Labor Party. The EMDG scheme is one of our successes. We ought to be proud of it. We ought not be considering the strangling of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2704"> opportunities that in the end are about the future of Australia as a nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless this government is prepared to properly defend the trading interests of Australia, then thousands of jobs&mdash;yes, thousands of jobs&mdash;in the automotive and textile, clothing and footwear industries could soon be lost. It has been estimated, for example, that the combined effect of the cuts to trade and industry programs could be as high as 80,000 jobs. That might not mean much to the government of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government of the day does not have a wages policy and it sees unemployment as the key to controlling the issue of wages development at this point in time. But I can tell you this: I am opposed to further unemployment and the use of workers to keep wages down because, in the end, all you will create is an underclass in Australia and a series of little Chicagos all around this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, the government should hang its head in shame because that is the end result of the policies that it is pursuing across a range of portfolios at the moment, be it in respect of employment and an attack on Working Nation or its failure to really develop and pursue a decent industry policy which supports businesses that are about the future of economic and social prosperity of Australia. Unfortunately, the government is not just doing this in respect of major companies, such as Howe Leather in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. It is also walking away from its responsibilities with respect to small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time and time again we hear lectures from the other side of the House about the fact that smaller business will be the engine room of job growth in Australia. The attack of those opposite on the EMDG scheme will seriously undermine the capacity of small business not only to develop in the local market but also to face up to the challenge that it wants to pursue, be it in the service sector, such as health, education and training services, or in the important manufacturing industries, such as the food, automobile and textile, clothing and footwear industries. Those businesses demand support and they should be given support.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to say on behalf of the opposition that we will go out of our way to raise the concerns of the business people of this nation who are vitally concerned about creating opportunities&mdash;opportunities to earn export dollars and opportunities to create additional jobs and training&mdash;while ensuring that, in doing so, we do not create a nation that resembles the US or the United Kingdom with a permanent underclass. Yes, it might suit the coalition government to have a permanent underclass as their answer to the question of wages policy. But I tell you that is a very short&hyphen;sighted approach and the government will rue the day that they decided to pursue it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, our language might be strong but so it should be because there is a hell of a lot at risk this evening for Australia as a nation. As many as 5,000 companies each employing under 25 workers would lose aid to set up in export and import competing areas unless the government backs off. That is not a bad point to raise: up to 5,000 companies providing major employment opportunities are being undermined by the government of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We support the bill but we warn the government in no uncertain terms that we will pursue a campaign across the length and breadth of the country to defend the EMDG scheme. So we should, because that scheme is vital to our future economic prosperity. It is vital to trade opportunities. It is vital to export opportunities. It is vital to our capacity to develop decent employment and training opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, the government should hang its head in shame. It has made yet another mistake, another broken promise. It is a bit flippant about that&mdash;it is just another promise. I say to the government that this promise is more important than a lot of other promises it has broken, because it is about jobs, training and ensuring that we do not divide this country in the manner in which the US and the UK are divided. I thank the government for the opportunity to speak to this proposition, because it is vital to the future economic and social prosperity of Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Labor oversaw a transformation of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2705"> Australian economy during the 1980s from one based principally on primary exports to one with a more diversified range of exports, particularly in manufactured goods and services. Had our training base not been so diversified, we would have seen, in the words of the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), the `economy vaporise' because of diminishing returns from primary exports and a long&hyphen;term decline in returns from agricultural products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were able to diversify, and a growing proportion of our exports of manufactured goods has been through small and medium sized firms&mdash;for example, the firms identified by McKinsey in his 1993 report titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Emerging Exporters</EMPHASIS>. McKinsey identified that many of the small and medium sized firms discovered their export markets as a consequence of local production, but the critical step towards sustainable and increasing exports depended largely on government assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That assistance has taken several forms. We have had contact within foreign markets, and the former government built up Austrade as a principal aid to businesses entering foreign markets. We had the 150 per cent research and development taxation allowance. We had the development import finance facility scheme, the DIFF. Finally, we had the subject of this bill, the export market development grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The small and medium sized firms that find capital raising and lines of finance hardest to secure need the greatest assistance from government to overcome the vagaries of the market. The EMDG scheme has helped to provide this valuable assistance. The roll call of the EMDG scheme is impressive. In 1994&hyphen;95, some 3,279 companies participated in the scheme. They did so in recognition of the fact that the scheme was a valuable contributor to the nation's export development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is now great concern within business circles about what is seen as the Howard government's triple whammy. First, there is the proposal to abolish DIFF. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) wants us to believe that DIFF is a lightweight matter of little consequence. I think that has been comprehensively demonstrated in recent days <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not to be the case. It matters a great deal to our trading partners, as it does to companies like Transfield Defence Systems, which, until the minister's announcement, had reasonable prospects of building warships for the Philippines navy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, research and development taxation deduction applications have been effectively frozen for months. Many companies across Australia have utilised these programs at critical phases of their development. How many of these will falter with the reduction in support proposed by the government? How many companies that could follow that path will be denied the opportunity as a result of these cuts?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, we have the export market development grants scheme, with which the opposition is greatly concerned. I will give the House an example from my own electorate of the impact of the triple whammy. Farley Cutting Systems, a company located in Glenroy, employs 80 highly trained workers. It is concerned about the situation in relation to research and development. It is concerned about export market development grants. It is also concerned about the impact of reductions in bounty and, in particular, the recommendations of the Industry Commission, the now Productivity Commission, that the bounty disappear as of 30 June next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People in the company have indicated to me that small to medium sized businesses such as theirs cannot have the grants radically withdrawn all in one hit. It could make their company unviable. Their company has had no consultation with the government. They have written to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and received no response. The value to them of export market development grants is in the order of $130,000 for this financial year. The value of the bounty to them is of the order of $300,000 this financial year. As I have said, it has been proposed by the Productivity Commission that the machine tools and robots bounty be withdrawn as of 30 June next year. The value of research and development to this company is of the order of $600,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Changes on all fronts would be very damaging for this company which employs many people in my electorate and also provides <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2706"> exports dollars for this nation. Some 50 per cent of their product is exported. The bounty enables them to employ better skilled people. They can differentiate their product. It provides them with an important competitive advantage in world markets. Without this they will be less competitive. Farley Cutting Systems is most concerned about the government's proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Southcorp Whitegoods received an EMDG of $16,900 in 1994-95. This company is based in Brunswick and is a major  employer in my electorate. Yakka Industrial Wear received an EMDG in excess of $9,000 in 1994-95. Yakka has established itself over many years as one of the world leaders in industrial work wear manufacture. It has invested in warehousing and storage facilities in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. It has introduced EDI, cartonisation, bar coding, carousel picking and garment management systems. They have all helped make the Yakka distribution centre one of the most efficient and modern facilities of its type in the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw the attention of the House to an example outside my electorate&mdash;Vision Systems. This company is in the electorate of Chisholm. It specialises in video based and other security systems. It has indicated that it finds the changes to research and development, tariff concessions, EMDG and DIFF, and the retrospectivity that may come with them, counterproductive to its future operating plans. I suggest that the Minister for Health and Family Services, the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), as a participant on the Expenditure Review Committee, might have a difficult time explaining to Vision Systems the government's moves in terms of industry policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is being small minded. It needs to do more rather than less to promote exports of manufactured goods and services. This is the second time the Prime Minister has tried to fiddle with this scheme. The first time was back in 1987. That resulted in the very public resignation from the Liberal Party of the then President of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, Mr Peter Frankel. I believe that the Prime Minister can expect <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> similar reactions if the August budget sees the demise of the EMDG scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government needs to recognise that it is precisely the small and medium&hyphen;sized businesses which have benefited most from this scheme and that the record shows that in excess of 70 per cent of the 1994-95 grants went to companies with less than 25 staff. It concerns me to hear the pejorative expression `business welfare' going around. Some believe that we need to cut back on business welfare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a pity that some people think that by invoking the expression `welfare' they can label something in an adverse way. I think we all have an obligation to provide for those who are less fortunate than us. I am disappointed that that expression is used. It is also disappointing to hear it because the manufacturing industry earns export dollars and provides jobs for this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned about the fact that this represents, if the export market development grants scheme is indeed abolished, a breach of yet another coalition promise. From a government which has made such a virtue of honesty, we have seen a procession of promises jettisoned and abandoned. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), for example, indicated to the National Press Club on 15 February that EMDG would stay. We had numerous coalition statements saying, `We will maintain the export market development grants scheme.' Finally, in the area of tourism, we had the coalition promising to extend the export market development grants to that industry. It said in one of its documents:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition will end Labor's deliberate discrimination against the Tourism Industry and its operators under the Export Market Development Grants (EMDG) scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>What a piece of monumental hypocrisy it would be for a government that promised to extend the scheme and made much of its proposal to extend the scheme to now abandon the scheme. I support the position taken by the opposition. Export market development grants have worked well in this country and they should be maintained.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a depressing spectacle to yesterday witness the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) give his second reading speech on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. It is sad to see a leader of a political party being undermined by his own colleagues and shot to ribbons in terms of his support base. It was also depressing, in terms of the interests of the nation, to watch the Deputy Prime Minister give such cursory attention to such an important piece of legislation. The second reading speech was one of the shortest second reading speeches I can remember. I think that is disgraceful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was certainly depressing that such cursory attention should be given by the Deputy Prime Minister to this bill. He had the opportunity to put to rest once and for all the very damaging speculation that has been allowed to run for too long about the future of this scheme. He added to that speculation by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I would like to make it very clear that this step does not provide any indication about what may or may not be the subject of ongoing budget discussions.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Fischer in fact continued to fuel the speculation about the fate of this particular scheme in the government's deliberations. Of course, that is immensely destabilising to businesses that need to make decisions for the future. Businesses have lead times in terms of their financial planning and other aspects of their activities and they need some certainty about the continuation of this scheme. The failure of the Deputy Prime Minister to add to that certainty is, I think, depressing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is depressing because this scheme is an important part of Australia's export position. It is important, as we all know as members of parliament, to address in whatever ways are  possible problems that Australia has on the current account, with the balance of payments and in relation to continuing to diversify our trade. Failure to take opportunities is something we all ought to condemn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The media speculation about this program has been allowed to run for a long time. Back in April the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> was carrying <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stories that the Department of Finance was gunning for the export market development grants scheme. On the same date, 19 April, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> indicated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government is turning its guns on exporters, with a plan to abolish the $237 million Export Market Development Grants scheme . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That speculation continued to run in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  into May where there was a story&mdash;with a particularly unflattering cartoon of both the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and the Minister for Trade&mdash;on Austrade and AusAID's campaigns within the realms of bureaucratic politics to save both DIFF and the export market development grants scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> also carried stories at the end of May about the departure of the managing director of Austrade. Mr Evans said, perhaps a tad tongue in cheek, that the assault on the programs of his organisation had not been part of his decision to depart. But the article makes it quite clear that the export market development grants scheme continues to be under sustained attack from areas of the bureaucracy that are inhabited by the economic fundamentalists of Canberra, the economic fundamentalists of Treasury and Finance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally in terms of media coverage on these matters, we have Mr Fischer in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> reported whilst in Japan as fuelling speculation about the future of the scheme. When asked about it he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, that creates its own pressure on exporters. It can wipe out the assistance given to any particular scheme overnight.</PARA>
<PARA>There is quite a concerted campaign in the media to undermine this scheme as part of the process of leading up to this budget. The government has been prepared on other important issues of public policy to clarify its position before the budget. The failure to do it on this is not acceptable. I have already referred to the importance for business&mdash;for their own planning and their own activities&mdash;of getting some early advice in relation to this matter. Of course, the government's own election commitments have been referred to elsewhere. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2708">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we were speaking about a program that did not have a high recognition rate, a high credibility rate, one could perhaps be a little less concerned. But the facts are that this program has been reviewed on a number of occasions. For example, the 1994 review undertaken by the Department of Finance and by consultants Price Waterhouse, amongst others, found that the scheme was achieving its objectives of assisting Australian businesses, especially small and medium sized firms, to seek out and develop new export markets. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> revenues from taxes on grant receipts and profits on additional exports were estimated to return 42% of the cost of the scheme to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> most of the growth in the EMDG scheme has come from the services sector</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the minimum level of qualifying expenditure . . . number of grants performance test are largely appropriate</PARA>
<PARA>And the positive findings go on. The scheme has a multiplier effect on average of $9 for every dollar granted. Anecdotal evidence puts the multiplier effect as high as 30:1 in some cases. We are not talking here about a scheme that has not been thoroughly and appropriately evaluated in terms of the contribution it makes to the economic wellbeing of Australia and Australia's economic strength, particularly against the background of some of the fundamental problems of our economy in relation to our external performance. To attack this is, frankly, crazy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did take a bit of note of the speeches of the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) and the member for Aston (Mr Nugent). Both were supportive of this scheme in relation to the contribution it makes. So one has to speculate, I suppose, on where the pressure comes from for this scheme to continue to be under some sort of a cloud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would suggest that that relates to those economic fundamentalists I referred to before. The member for La Trobe referred in his speech to a number of other industry schemes. He referred to the 150 per cent tax benefit for research and development, the computer bounty, the factor F pharmaceutical scheme <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and the industry plans in the automotive industry and TCF areas, as well as the export market development grants scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All those interventionist activities in support of manufacturing industry in this country are very much at risk if the sort of view that prevails in some sections of the government about the nature of the government's relationship to the management of the economy and intervention in the economy were to prevail in this particular matter. I suggest to the member for La Trobe and others that some of those schemes which, by and large, have been successful in positioning Australia's successful economic performance in the international community are similarly at risk if this particular issue is not fought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not to say that, ultimately, there are not more fundamental initiatives that need to continue to be taken to address our current account problems. We would all agree that the issue of savings and the rate of national savings is clearly the most fundamental of those factors. This is not the time for that debate. Even in that area, this government is already showing some alarming signs of backsliding on some of the areas of achievement of the former government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that it is vitally important for members, particularly those on the government side&mdash;members such as the members for La Trobe and Aston, who have come into this House and defended the scheme&mdash;to have the courage of their convictions within their party room, to take the fight up in defence of this scheme within their own frameworks and within their own structures and to ensure that this important scheme in terms of Australia's economic wellbeing is protected from the sort of vandalism that is quite clearly being proposed for it.</PARA>

<PARA>These amendments affect schedule 1A, the amount of grant. In effect, this series of amendments simply puts into the legislation the policy and the promises of the coalition when in opposition in respect of extending the full grant of 50 per cent under the EMDG scheme to the tourism industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the House of the coalition's policy before the last election. The policy headed `Destination Australia', the coalition policy on tourism, was prepared and released by Warwick Parer, the then shadow spokesperson. I refer to pages 11 and 12 of that document. That document says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition will end Labor's discrimination against the tourism industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tourism operators will be eligible to receive the full grant under the EMDG scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition will change the EMDG legislation to extend the scheme to cover the cost of bringing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> buyers to the product, and allowing joint venture applications.</PARA>
<PARA>It can be no clearer than that. The coalition pledged before the last election that, as far as the tourism industry was concerned, the 25 per cent grant that Labor had put in place was not good enough. They pledged and they promised to the people of Australia and they promised and they pledged to the tourism industry of this country that they would extend that EMDG scheme to tourism fully at the 50 per cent rate. They said, again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition will end Labor's discrimination by removing the provision that discounts applications of tourism operators to give them equity with all other EMDG applicants from all other industries.</PARA>
<PARA>It can be no clearer than that. That is their policy. In effect, they extended that by talking to industry leaders in tourism and saying that they would do that. In a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>  of 14 February 1996, under the headline `Howard woos tourism: industry tax break incentive', Warwick Parer is quoted as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The tourism industry contributes over $12 billion a year to our exports income and employs 500,000 to 700,000 people," Senator Parer said, "yet, the Labor Government declares it is only worth half the refund for international promotion costs under the EMDG scheme . . . A Coalition government is committed to ending this discrimination. Successful EMDG tourism applicants under us will get a full 50c in the dollar refund on international promotion the same way as any other applicant from any other industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"A Coalition government would also allow EMDG applicants to cover the cost of bringing overseas tourism buyers to Australia to see their product because it could not be taken to them. There would also be a joint venture provision to allow a group of tourism operators to come together to meet the minimum expenditure of $30,000 to seek a refund of international promotion costs under the EMDG scheme."</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Earlier, Mr Howard&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the then Leader of the Opposition&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">admitted to the breakfast that he had a "near obsession" with creating a climate providing the right incentives for small business to get going and employing people. The tourism package shows he meant it.</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing could be clearer than that.

Every member of the coalition is duty-bound to support the extension of the EMDG scheme to the tourism industry. It is a minor amendment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here is their chance to live up to their rhetoric, to live up to promises delivered not only by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) but also by the then tourism spokesman. They should deliver on their promises. When they make promises, they should keep them when in government. Let's just see if they do that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) has pointed out quite clearly that this seeks to implement a coalition election promise. In the coalition's policy on tourism entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Destination Australia "A national priority"</EMPHASIS>  released by Senator Warwick Parer, who was then the shadow minister for tourism, and dated 13 February 1996&mdash;which was in the midst of the election campaign&mdash;the coalition committed itself under the heading `Export market development grants' to this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Tourism operators will be eligible to receive the full grant under the EMDG scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Coalition will change the EMDG legislation to extend the scheme to cover the cost of bringing buyers to the product, and allowing joint venture applications.</PARA>
<PARA>What the amendment proposed by the member for Cunningham will do will be to implement that express promise contained in the coalition's tourism document. Tourism operators will be eligible to receive the full grant under the EMDG scheme. At page 11 of that document, in bold type&mdash;because it was a bold commitment&mdash;the coalition asserts this: </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition will end Labor's discrimination by removing the provision that discounts applications by Tourism operators to give them equity with all other EMDG applicants from all other industries. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>It was not just the tourism document itself. In the policy costings statement released in the last couple of weeks of the campaign by the then shadow Treasurer, now Treasurer, (Mr Costello), the `Meeting our Commitments' document refers to extending full EMDG to single service tourist operators. So it was an election promise expressly made by the coalition, and it was an election promise which was costed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, it was not as if those opposite, members of the government, did not have the opportunity of pursuing this particular approach and line in the previous parliament. In committee stage in the Senate in the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 Senator Parer, who in the last parliament was the opposition shadow spokesman, had this to say about an amendment that he moved:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this amendment is to allow tourism operators exactly the same facilities as are available to every other exporter in this country. It is worth pointing out that in 1993 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology unanimously concluded that not only was it inequitable to have one sector of industry eligible for assistance through the export market development scheme and others not but it was inequitable that exporters of manufactured goods and other services were eligible for assistance while certain exporters were not.</PARA>
<PARA>The report to which Senator Parer referred went on to recommend that tourism be given full access to the scheme. A subsequent report of a House of Representatives committee, the august Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The availability of export market development grants of 50 per cent to any other industry but not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2711"> to tourism is inequitable.

<PARA>Members opposite have the perfect opportunity. There we have it from their spokesperson in the last parliament. But, much more importantly, handcuffed to every member opposite in the course of the campaign&mdash;a commitment to extend the EMDG scheme to the tourism industry. It was not just a little policy document slipped out by a shadow minister but it was an important policy document slipped out by a shadow minister, backed up expressly by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and expressly included in the policy costings document released by the shadow Treasurer.

Why should there be an objection when the vote is taken on this amendment later this evening? We on this side of the House anticipate absolute support.

If he doesn't, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) surely will. On 27 June last year, the then shadow minister for trade said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are seeking to give the tourism industry a fair go. We do not want the tourism industry to be subject to the 25c or 25 per cent rate; we want it to be subject to the standard rate that is applicable to other industries under the export market development grants scheme. We want that reflected in a sensible approach to the amendments that are before the chamber at this time. Single&hyphen;service tourist providers are entitled to promote their products worldwide. I do not think the government <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2713"> would disagree with that. The opposition says that they are entitled to do that with the application of the standard rate of assistance under the EMDG scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>Minister, now is your chance&mdash;vote for it. You were handcuffed to it at the election, committed to it in the parliament last term. Now is your big chance&mdash;support the amendment moved by the member for Cunningham. It was not as if Mr Fischer was by himself. He was not out on a limb on this one. On the same day the member for Pearce, Mrs Moylan, the then shadow minister for small business, now the Minister for Family Services, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill we are debating today proposes that the export market development grants scheme be extended for a fifth time, from 1994-95 to 1998-99. The coalition will support this extension but not before proposing some very sensible and important amendments to the government's bill to, as usual, improve the outcome for the business community and, I might say, deliver fairness and equity. I think it is quite wrong to make benefits available to some sections of the commercial community and not make them available to others. In this case, the tourism industry will miss out unless the government takes notice of what the coalition has said in relation to this and accepts the coalition's amendments to fully include the tourism industry.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope I see my neighbour in Western Australia the member for Pearce come into this House on the division, together with the Minister for Trade, and vote for the amendment moved by the member for Cunningham to extend the EMDG scheme to the tourism industry at the full rate, as they promised the tourism industry, and the Australian people, in the course of the election campaign.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank all members who have participated in the debate on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996, both in the second reading stage and the consideration in detail stage. I am upset to see the mace on top of the table, but I understand that is the new convention applying to that which operated previously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That aside, I acknowledge that the tourist industry will bring some four million international visitors to Australia in the calendar year 1996 with some $12 billion worth of export earnings. The tourist industry today is an <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industry of great substance. It is a very decentralised industry&mdash;including in the electorate of my colleague the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek)&mdash;and it makes a great contribution to the economic wellbeing of Australia. It continues to set new benchmarks for which it can be very proud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is about ensuring that the measures the previous Labor government introduced to achieve certain budget outcomes last year are enacted. In other words, the bill we present on this occasion, except for the change of title and one other very minor alteration, is the Labor government's bill. The Labor government did not, in fact, draft a bill which provided for the lifting of the tourist industry from the 25c in the dollar rate to the 50c in the dollar rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a bit too smart by half that the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) and the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) have come in here seeking to score some cheap points in this regard. I understand where they are coming from. I have sat in the shadow cabinet for years. I have sat in the shadow cabinet as the shadow minister for veterans' affairs. It is a very noble portfolio&mdash;one which some people regard as a dead&hyphen;end portfolio. That is wrong. It is a challenging portfolio and one of great import. The member for Cunningham has the special challenge of being linked with veterans' affairs, tourism and the Olympics. He will soon go to Atlanta to look at some of the Australian seats people will be sitting on, which were built by Comatic of Melbourne and supplied for the Atlanta Olympics stadium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know what you do in the shadow cabinet meetings. You cast around and think, `How can I have a bit of a go at this bill? How can I amend this bill to score a couple of points in the process?' It does not matter that it was your bill. Your bill, in its original drafting, made no reference to boosting tourism from 25 per cent to 50 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendments relate to a budget matter. The government will announce its budget on 20 August and not before. That is the appropriate time for us to deal with this, one way or the other. We are anxious to bed down the Labor government's legislation <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2714"> on this rare occasion, because it does provide&mdash;and is provided for in the forward estimates&mdash;certainty to those companies which are completing their applications based on the expenditure during the financial year 1995-96, finishing on 30 June&mdash;a few days time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is giving a very certain framework of rules to the export market development grants scheme and to the tourism industry. Many tourist applicants will succeed under the EMDG scheme in this financial year, which finishes shortly, in respect of which applications are lodged between July and November next and the pay-outs will follow from that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reveal to the House that, as a consequence of this legislation, we are committed to over $200 million worth of EMDG expenditure for the next financial year, relating to applications arising from this financial year, including applications from the magnificent Australian tourist industry which continues to go from strength to strength. I reject the amendments moved by the member for Cunningham and, after his trip to Atlanta, I invite him to return to this place on or about 20 August.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) for his comments. I would be interested to know whether his comments are shared by his colleague the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore). We are talking about the tourism industry policy, which the coalition went to the last election with. We do not disagree with much of what the minister has said. We agree that the tourism industry is one of the most vital industries in this country and is probably now our largest export earner, which I said during the second reading debate, which I certainly said in a matter of public importance in this place some weeks ago, and which I may have said in the consideration in detail stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> We do not dispute any of that. What we are saying to the minister is that we are not declining to give this bill a second reading at all. We think it is a good bill because, as he rightly pointed out, it was something which we on this side started. What we are con cerned about&mdash;and what we are trying to assist the government with&mdash;is that the government keep its promise. For a change, we are simply trying to help you keep your promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You trade on this question of honesty and integrity. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said, `I would much rather keep my promises than reduce the budget deficit.' Here is your chance. I noticed that when the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) was making his contribution a moment ago the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Marek) was interjecting occasionally. He, along with many people in this building and certainly within this chamber at the moment, would know of the value of tourism to his own area and to North Queensland. He, I am sure, would know many of the 620 members of Tourism Council Australia or of the 30,000 affiliates which represent the diverse elements of the tourism and travel industry. Some of those would be located in his electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is he going to say to them when this bill goes through? I gather from what the Deputy Prime Minister was saying that you are not going to support our amendments. He will go back to his region and report&mdash;in his local newspaper, on WIN TV or on Prime and whatever else is up there&mdash;`Look, I know we went to the last election promising to extend the EMDG scheme to the tourism industry, but I'm sorry. No&mdash;well, yes, the opposition did move amendments to this which would have done that and which would have helped us out in delivering our policy, but we didn't support the amendments. We probably should have, but we didn't.' It was you on the other side that went to the election with that as a policy. We are just trying to help you out and you are going to turn around and vote it down. I cannot believe this.</PARA>

<PARA>You would have said that to your lot, surely. You would have been up there against Marjorie Henzell saying, `That terrible Labor Party; they have not extended the EMDG scheme to the tourism industry. But we will. We will give you the full 50 per cent.' Brother, here is your chance. When we go to the vote, we expect to see you with us, and we want to see the member for Dawson, who represents Mackay, and indeed the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, Mr Moore. He has got to be with us on this one. After all, he represents the tourism industry&mdash;I think he does; they tell me that they do not see a great deal of him. But that is another story for another day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister and a number of other people in this place purport to represent tourism. They talk about how fabulous it is, about the number of jobs that are created in this country and their own electorates and so on. How can you then turn around and say, `We are not going to support what the opposition is putting up'? It is an extraordinary circumstance. The opposition is actually moving an amendment to get the government to put in place its own policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Normally we would be out there fighting because we would probably think it is not a real good idea. But we happen to agree with you now. We happen to think that this is the way to do it. It is a simple thing. It is only a matter of four separate little amendments that go to the schedule. It is easy to do. All you have to do is say aye when the Deputy Speaker puts the amendment. But I would guarantee from the way that they are looking at me and smiling that they are not going to do it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth of the matter is that the tourism industry is extremely important to Australia. It has come from nowhere to everywhere. In recent years it has involved a great deal of inbound tourists from countries such as Korea, whereas 15 to 20 years ago there were almost no inbound tourists from Korea or Malaysia. Today there are very significant numbers from those and other Asian countries.

I must say that, as the 35th speaker, or thereabouts, speaking on the government's Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, there is very little new matter I can introduce into the debate. It is, however, interesting to note that the contributions made by so many members opposite have been made by people who have had a very longstanding connection with the trade union movement. In fact, when one looks at the CVs of members of the opposition, it is interesting to note that just under half the Labor members, senators and senators&hyphen;elect have had direct links with the trade union movement, having used the union movement as a stepping stone into this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One must therefore discount substantially the contributions made by many of those members and senators in this debate, because obviously they come from a biased position. When one looks at the employment history of a large number of those opposite, in many cases they have had no jobs at all other than working for the trade union movement.</PARA>

He has worked for Gough Whitlam and as such must be partly responsible for the disastrous policies of the Whitlam government. He worked for a Labor Premier of New South Wales.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation that we are debating tonight, when carried, will give new opportunity to about 800,000 unemployed people in this nation. We perhaps have two million people unable to find sufficient work. After 13 years of Labor government, these people simply had given up until of course 2 March when we were elected to office. This legislation, which we are now debating, will give new opportunity; it will give these people the chance to put one foot on the employment ladder. They will have an opportunity to contribute to the future advancement of this nation as well as an opportunity to provide for their families. This legislation aims to free up the labour market. It aims to encourage employers and employees to sit down and talk. What is wrong with that? It aims to have workplace agreements. These workplace agreements will be subject to provisions that ensure that workers will not be any worse off.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, Labor members have run around masquerading as champions of the underprivileged. But, when one looks at the sad legacy of 13 years of Labor government, it is pretty obvious why the Liberal and National parties were elected to office in such a way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current account deficit is the worst in the OECD, worse even than Mexico. Under Labor, foreign debt increased sevenfold from $23 billion in 1982-83 to over $180 billion today. Interest rates are amongst the highest in the world. Inflation is now 3.7 per cent, one of the highest in the OECD region&mdash;higher than the USA, the UK, Germany and Japan&mdash;and the former Prime Minister Mr Keating claimed that he had `broken the back of inflation'. If one looks at any economic indicator, it is pretty clear that the Labor Party has failed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we seek to bring forward an industrial relations system that will free up the labour market. We will have protections for workers. We will encourage workplace agreements. We aim to create a situation where the unemployment tragedy that has befallen Australians over the last 13 years will be removed and people will be given a chance to get back into the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to support this legislation. This legislation is not draconian and does not turn back the clock. This legislation is fair and reasonable. If you want further proof as to how this legislation is fair and reasonable, why do we not go to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> and look at a comment made by one of the most eminent industrial relations commentators in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2721"> the country, Professor Judith Sloan. She is moderate and reasonable and said in summing up the bill:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The minister can claim with justification that the Bill has been drafted to balance the two considerations of flexibility and protection. He should therefore stand his ground when substantial amendments are suggested. The "shock horror" brigade&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, those opposite&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">needs to recognise that there is very little "shock horror" in the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>That says it all. Professor Judith Sloan, universally respected throughout Australia, said that there is very little `shock horror' in the bill. She has endorsed the approach of the government. Perhaps the only criticism she has is that the legislation does not go as far as she would like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation implements the coalition's policy. We went to the Australian people and said exactly what we were going to do. This bill does not go beyond our policy. It simply implements one of the policies that we took to the people of Australia on 2 March. Those opposite are so used to broken promises. They are used to getting into office after being prepared to promise anything to win government. Yet this legislation we are debating seeks to implement the coalition's industrial relations policy. So, instead of criticising us, those people should be praising us.</PARA><!-- <ERROR>Class: 1

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Late in the life of the last parliament, in connection with the Horticultural Levy Act 1987 and the Horticultural Export Charge Act 1987, a levy of 0.05 per cent was imposed on a number of vegetables. The levy was to be calculated at the first point of sale of the produce. This levy was imposed to provide funds for research and development within the vegetable industry. The levy was imposed by the previous Labor government, following representations by the Australian Vegetable and Potato Growers Federation, known as Ausveg.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only a few days after the bill was assented to by the Governor-General, I received telephone calls from vegetable growers of the MIA, the Murrumbidgee irrigation area, saying that they were totally opposed to the levy and neither they nor any of their vegetable growing colleagues had been consulted on the levy. They did not believe that Ausveg was speaking on their behalf when asking for a research and development levy to be imposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since those telephone calls, there have been various gatherings throughout Australia debating the issue of the levy and, in most cases, expressing concern that growers were not informed about the proposed levy before its implementation by legislation. At a meeting of vegetable growers I attended in Griffith, it was made clear to me that the local growers and those from Hay totally opposed the levy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2723">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At other meetings held throughout the country many growers expressed the belief that the legislation would be hard to remove and suggested that other forms of obtaining research and development levy money could be imposed. One suggestion was that growers be registered and the money obtained go towards the levy. Another was that a levy be placed on vegetable seed. But, as I have said previously, in my electorate growers are totally opposed to the levy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would point out that one of the main reasons for vegetable growers opposing that research and development levy at the point of sale is that, besides being an additional cost burden, it adds further to the paperwork of micro-business at a time when governments say they are trying to remove that problem. Many vegetable growers are of non-English speaking background and they would find it extremely difficult to complete the paperwork that would enable them to meet the requirements of the levy being imposed at the point of sale&mdash;and I think both the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) and the member for Macquarie (Mr Bartlett) would back me up with that statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a great deal I could say, but time does not permit. I acknowledge the difficulties the government faces because the legislation has already passed through the parliament and is in operation. However, most growers throughout Australia believe that money is required for research and development but, significantly, do not wish the levy to be placed at the first point of sale. As I said before, other ways of imposing the levy have been suggested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Growers want a say in where the money is raised and spent in terms of research and development. They are still very angry at the lack of consultation before the levy was imposed by the previous government. I must thank the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) and the parliamentary secretary, Senator Brownhill, for the work they have done in contacting vegetable growers throughout Australia and explaining the levy. I must make it clear, however, that the growers who have contacted me from throughout the Riverina are opposed to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> levy and consider it another cost impost on production.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I urge the government to reconsider its cuts to skillshare funding and to end the uncertainty about the future of skillshare by guaranteeing that skillshare funding will continue at sensible levels after September this year. The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) recently made the short-sighted announcement that the government will cut skillshare funding from September this year by 33 per cent. Despite recently amending the cut to 20 per cent, the minister has refused to give any guarantees that skillshare will receive any funding after September.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate, the federal seat of Perth, there are currently eight organisations which provide valuable support to local long-term unemployed people through the skillshare program. These organisations are Centrecare Skills Training Centre, Perth ITeC and Step 1 Skillshare in Perth, NERTA Skillshare and Employment 2000 in Morley and Midland Skillshare and Maylands Skillshare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is outrageous that the government has made such a major cut to a program that assists long&hyphen;term unemployed people overcome barriers to employment, and appalling that the government is refusing to give any guarantee that the program will continue after September. Skillshare successfully assists long&hyphen;term unemployed by providing vocational training, individual counselling and support. It also links in strongly with the local business community to place people directly into employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Western Australian director of Skillshare, Mr Allen Blanchard, has pointed out recently that skillshare assists some 30,000 unemployed Western Australians each year. Almost 60 per cent of skillshare clients have either found employment or gone on to further training as a result of their contact with the program. The minister has described skillshare as one of the most cost effective labour market programs around. There seems <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2724"> little justification for destroying the skillshare program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The local Perth community does not see any justification for the funding cuts or the lack of certainty about the future of skillshare. There has been widespread concern not only from local skillshare providers but also from local business organisations and the long-term unemployed who have utilised the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The President of the Midland Chamber of Commerce, Mr Ian Wright, is reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hills Gazette</EMPHASIS> on 8 June as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Midland Chamber values the service SkillShare has provided during many years, and is concerned at the potential negative impact on the local labour market that could result from a reduction in services.</PARA>
<PARA>A student of the Wearne Training Centre in Morley and a constituent of mine recently stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to voice my disappointment at the recently announced decrease in funding the SkillShare Training Programme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . The courses offered at SkillShare are offering people a chance to become an active participant in the work force again. Closing these opportunities can only mean more dependence of people on welfare benefits and less chance of being able to make a contribution of their own.</PARA>
<PARA>A constituent of mine who went to Maylands Skillshare wrote to me saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Maylands Skillshare has consequently been of enormous benefit to me since the Commonwealth Employment Service referred me there. Maylands Skillshare is accommodated at the Royal Institute of the Blind which I find particularly appropriate because my head injuries have severely impaired the sight in one of my eyes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a beneficiary of the significant long-term assistance I can proudly submit to you that the Skillshare program has provided some of the most significant employment focused rehabilitation which I have been the beneficiary of. . .</PARA>
<PARA>I have received, as no doubt many members of the House have, many similar letters of concern from skillshare groups, local business providers and individual constituents since the funding cuts were announced. There is no doubt that the cuts announced by the government will make it impossible for skillshare to maintain services at the current level. The people who will suffer most from these cuts are the long-term unemployed. The failure of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the minister to give a commitment to continued funding after September is a worrying signal for the local community in Perth who are concerned about the future of skillshare. I urge the government to make a commitment to the long-term unemployed by guaranteeing the future funding of skillshare.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, as you are aware, each year I bring two students to Canberra as part of an ongoing scholarship scheme held within the electorate of O'Connor. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ansett Australia Airlines for its kind assistance in supporting this scholarship scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This week I have brought the 39th and 40th students to Canberra and I am pleased to say that they are both in the Speaker's gallery tonight. The students are Jessica Carmody, a year 11 student from Nagle Catholic College in Geraldton, and Glen Brayshaw, a year 11 student from Narrogin Agricultural College. Both Jessica and Glen have written short speeches about the area in which they live and/or the school they attend. I wish to read these speeches to the parliament. Jessica writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Geraldton is situated on the Batavia Coast, 400km north of Perth. So named after the famous wreck in 1629 of the Dutch east Indian ship Batavia that foundered on a reef on the Abrolhos Islands sixty kilometres west of Geraldton.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Geraldton was settled in the late 1800's where it has become a regional centre and port for diverse industries including wool, wheat, beef, sheep, gold and mineral sands mining, wet line and rock lobster fishing and more recently, tourism. It now has a population of over 24,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All this makes the mid&hyphen;west of which Geraldton is the centre a major contributor to the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nagle Catholic College was commissioned in 1994, however the history of the college dates back much further. Stella Maris College was founded by the Presentation Sisters in 1891 and in 1926 the Christian Brothers opened St Patrick's College.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the ensuing 68 years the two boarding schools catered for the education needs of the young men and women of the Geraldton and surrounding areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the late 1980's the religious congregations agreed combining the efforts and resources of the two schools would enable them to better cater for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2725"> their students. The care taken in planning the co&hyphen;educational school has now borne fruit in the opening of Nagle Catholic College which is built on the rich history and traditions of its founding schools.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a past student of Stella Maris and now at Nagle Catholic College I have witnessed the exciting and innovative first years of the amalgamation of the two schools under the guidance of our principal Brother Warwick Bryant. This year the college campus has undergone many changes with the construction of the new technology centre, classrooms, administration and the introduction of the great court, a central plaza within the school which has greatly enhanced the aesthetics and atmosphere of the college.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our school is a valued and respected part of the Geraldton community. The school motto "for others" reminds us that the challenge of all education is to prepare young men and women for their mission in life to develop their talents and abilities and use them for the good of others. Nagle Catholic College caters for all the needs of its students; academic, social, physical and spiritual. I am proud to be a student of Nagle.</PARA>
<PARA>Glen Brayshaw writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Narrogin is situated 190 kilometres south east of Perth and has a regional population of some 23,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the centre for many and varied agricultural industries including wheat, sheep meat, wool, beef and dairy cattle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Narrogin is also the home of innovative light industry including the construction of purpose built fire trucks for Western Australian Fire Brigade Services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Narrogin Agricultural College resides in a beautiful setting with a number of small creeks flowing through its 1000 ha area and is in a 500 millimetre rainfall area. This college is a boarding school catering for 125 year 11 and 12 co-ed students. Some students then go onto the Muresk Agricultural University located 100 kms east of Perth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The school concentrates on agriculture both in class and as practice on the farm. The school has a 2 week rotation between&mdash;one week in class, half of a week on farm and half of a week in manual arts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Class subjects are animal husbandry, crops, pastures, senior English, farm economics as well as metal work, wood work, building construction and mechanics for farm vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Students rotate around each section of the farm over a season. The sections are pigs, poultry, workshop, sheep, butchery, general farm, cattle and dairy.  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Students are trusted to use all types of farm vehicles and machinery, including two state-of-the-art tractors used for the seeding programme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By the end of the course students can weld, do precision driving, and mechanical repairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The school promotes sport in and around the region competing in local leagues. The school also competes in country week, the Blackwood River Marathon, the Quit Cup football, winning in 1995, and in agricultural school carnivals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The school has 3 classrooms, a library and a 22 terminal computer network system . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In house dining is supplemented with the school farm produce . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The school participates in the local shows such as the Wagin Woolarama, Dowerin Agricultural Show and Perth Royal Show.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The other day in the Senate, Senator Boswell sought to attack me. Senator Boswell has tried to make a name for himself as a man battling what he sees as the Far Right influence in the National Party. Senator Boswell is one of those unfortunate people with very little real substance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his wide-ranging attack, he attacked a member of AAFI, Denis McCormack. I know Denis McCormack very well. I do not resile from that; he is certainly a friend of mine. Denis McCormack, unlike Senator Boswell, has on two occasions gone to China to teach in rural areas, an occupation that certainly is not financially rewarding. As a result, he speaks fluent Mandarin. Senator Boswell would never bother to get that far involved in anyone else's culture. In the course of his diatribe he talks about a statement he attributes to AAFI and he infers that it comes from Denis McCormack. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My policies on refugees and illegals is to reopen the second Yallah meatworks, creating up to 500 local jobs, and convert them to blood and bone. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2726"> </PARA>
<PARA>This comes as a result of a statement to the local immigration and ethnic affairs committee when it sent out a questionnaire. A response came from a fellow called `Zero'. It was black humour and it was quite clearly facetious. It was shown to be so. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission would not tackle it. The immigration department did write to AAFI and were quite embarrassed about it and said that they considered there was no problem there. I add that in that letter `Zero' also suggested he himself be converted to blood and bone to help fertilise a barren continent. It was clearly a facetious thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Boswell also links me to a Jack McLamb. I have never heard of this gentleman. He also says that Mr McLamb had a seminar in Melbourne which was attended by AAFI in Denis McCormack. I have checked with Mr McCormack. At no stage was he there and to his knowledge no-one else from AAFI was ever present at that meeting. Senator Boswell's authority is Adam Indikt from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia Israel Review</EMPHASIS>. I suggest to the good senator that he check his references in future because the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia Israel Review</EMPHASIS> is in my view one of the grubbiest, most racist organisations in the state and certainly is extremely unreliable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Boswell might also have mentioned in his diatribe that Don Veitch was at one stage very much involved in the Citizens Electoral Council and was a long-time employee of Senator Short. Andrew Campbell, ex-ASIO, worked for Ken Aldred. It is from Andrew Campbell that I believe Senator Boswell got most of his information on the League of Rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been very critical of LaRouche. I did sign a petition for LaRouche because I am, at heart, a civil libertarian. I told the LaRouche organisation that at that stage I thought they were fruit loops. I now believe they are extortionists and probably worse. I point out to Senator Boswell that the only people countering the evil activities of the Citizens Electoral Council in the bush are in fact the League of Rights and not Senator Boswell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I did try to call the member for Longman (Mr Brough) to say that I would be mention ing him in passing. I could not get the call after he attacked me in the parliament the other day. I would just like to point out to Mr Brough that 38.74 per cent of the primary vote is not a safe seat any more. He might feel that with 61.59 per cent of two&hyphen;party preferred he is safe. I can assure him that there will be a drift back to the Labor Party.

<TIME.STAMP>(10.52 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) introduced to this House a novel account of the pre-war period. Until the member's 90&hyphen;second spiel, I thought I had heard all of the Labor myths. You know the ones: that the Australian constitution was written in Whitehall, or that Doc Evatt was robbed in 1954 by the Petrov affair, or that Harold Holt escaped from Portsea in a Chinese submarine, or that Gough Whitlam, one of the member's predecessors in Werriwa, was sacked by the CIA.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what I heard today usurped all of the above. What I heard today, if we are to take it seriously, surely stands as the biggest Labor myth of them all&mdash;that Robert Menzies was a Nazi sympathiser. I am amazed that a member would come into this House and make such an offensive allegation. To suggest that Robert Menzies was a closet Nazi, a collaborator, a quisling, is not only over the top but is also deeply offensive to the memory of a great Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, it does not surprise me that anyone in the ALP still believes this stuff. After all, they were brought up on this rubbish, a melancholy view of Australia from the `we wuz robbed' school of thought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main objection of the member for Werriwa to my speech on the adjournment was that I somehow distorted E.M. Andrews' account of the pre&hyphen;war period and that I should apologise. If we are looking for distortions, surely there could be no greater distortion than to suggest that Sir Robert Gordon Menzies was a closet Nazi. After starting out a few weeks ago with what seems now to be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2727"> a modestly offensive remark&mdash;that the conservatives signed up for a bit of fascism in the 1930s&mdash;the member for Werriwa today proceeded to go way over the top.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member would have us believe that Robert Menzies was Australia's Kurt Waldheim, that Robert Menzies was Australia's Francois Mitterand, that Robert Menzies was the man in Australian politics with a dark, secret Nazi past. Paul Keating might be gone but it is good to know that someone over there is still serving up the same old Labor myths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In marshalling his hysterical, historical revisionism, the member has cited as an authority for Menzies' life the Marxist historian Humphrey McQueen. Having once relied on McQueen to support his outrageous thesis, I am surprised that the member did not invoke John Pilger as well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that is about to come. It seems as though he has dragged out and blown the dust off a collection of 1970s undergraduate essays.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that Menzies was a democrat who, during those years, consistently publicly upheld parliamentary democracy. Menzies highlighted the failings of totalitarian rule and consistently argued that it would be unacceptable to the Australian people. Hitler did not believe in elections; Menzies won eight. It is ridiculous to paint a democrat as a tacit fascist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the member for Werriwa wants to continue this debate, let me point out the first rule of rebuttal&mdash;to address the facts. Last week, in the debate on the adjournment, I outlined the factual history of the Lyons and Menzies foreign policy in the pre&hyphen;war period. The member for Werriwa conveniently ignored every point I made, namely: during the Italian&hyphen;Abyssinian crisis it was Lyons and Menzies who put sanctions on Italy; when Poland was threatened by Germany, Australia was one of the countries which guaranteed them; and when Hitler wanted the mandate back for New Guinea it was Sir George Pearce from the Lyons government who refused to return it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member made much of Menzies' study tour of Germany in 1938. That was the exhibit A of his spiel. He did not mention that Menzies criticised Germany for executions without trial and for the suppression of criticism and the press. Rather than being a Nazi sycophant, Menzies had the foresight to tell the President of the Reichsbank that, ultimately, suppression of criticism would destroy Germany. That does not sound like a closet Nazi to me. It sounds more like this latest myth needs to be put to rest.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first rule of rebuttal is to check the facts. When the member for Boothby (Dr Southcott) cited the book by E.M. Andrews called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Isolationism and Appeasement in Australia</EMPHASIS>  as a reliable source I thought I would read the whole book. I was surprised to learn that the book he referred me to was so damning of Robert Gordon Menzies. On page 211, speaking of Menzies, Andrews said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But he also felt that he had to see good things in the Nazi regime. Its very order and discipline were bound to appeal to his legal mind. Its reputed opposition to all on the Left appealed to his own sentiments. He thus fell into the trap of defending it.</PARA>
<PARA>Far from being a democrat&mdash;according to your own source, E.M. Andrews&mdash;Menzies fell into the trap of liking the way in which the Nazis put down the Left. They put down the Left in Germany, and I think he took that to be a model of his own politics in Australia, a model for his own attempt to ban the Communist Party in Australia. So much for being a democrat, so much for being a liberal in favour of freedom of speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Menzies myth has been spread far and wide throughout the parliament. Those on the other side never talk of the way in which E.M. Andrews&mdash;the reliable source, the noted authority used by the member for Boothby&mdash;talked of Menzies' pro&hyphen;German tone, his study tour of Hitler's Germany, and how he returned with eulogies of Nazi Germany, talking of the spiritual quality of Hitler Youth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Beyond that, those on the other side have always maintained that Menzies led the charge into Asia; that it was Menzies who <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2728"> introduced racial tolerance into Australian politics. While I am puncturing some of these myths about Menzies, I will quote a fairly reliable source. Surely you would concede that a book by Alexander Downer is a reliable source on Menzies&mdash;not the Alexander Downer in so much trouble here, but Alexander Downer I. Let me turn to page 31 of his book where, speaking of Menzies, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On immigration policy he usually gave me his blessing but not without growls of disapproval about the stream of Italians and Greeks we were attracting. Settlers from Asia were even less acceptable.</PARA>
