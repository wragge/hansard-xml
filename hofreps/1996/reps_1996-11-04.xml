<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, I present the committee's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Managing Australia's World Heritage</EMPHASIS> , together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GT4">Mr TRUSS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report I table today follows the inquiry by the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts into the management of Australia's world heritage areas. The terms of reference for this inquiry focused the committee's attention on the management of existing world heritage areas. It did not require the committee to consider the relative merits of sites or the processes leading up to the nomination of new areas or cultural sites to the World Heritage List.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has 11 world heritage properties. They are scattered across Australia&mdash;only the ACT and Victoria have none. All of the properties were nominated for their outstanding natural values and some, such as Uluru and the Tasmanian Wilderness, were also nominated for their cultural values. In addition to being physically separated and diverse, the world heritage properties differ with respect to their management. Some of the properties, like the Northern Territory parks&mdash;Kakadu and Uluru&mdash;are managed by the Commonwealth. Others are the responsibility of the states, and yet others, like the Great Barrier Reef, have combined state and Commonwealth management systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While in many cases it is the states which manage the world heritage properties, it is the Commonwealth government that has the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> responsibility to protect them under the terms of the world heritage convention. The inquiry on which my committee is reporting today dealt with the extent of the Commonwealth's responsibilities for world heritage protection and also considered the adequacy of funding for the world heritage areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Considerable controversy has been associated with the world heritage listing of many of Australia's world heritage areas. The Queensland and Tasmanian governments challenged the Commonwealth on listings in the High Court, and deep divisions have been created in many communities. It was therefore important for the committee to examine the effectiveness of the consultative arrangements that have been established for world heritage areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the witnesses to the inquiry were agreed that the World Heritage Convention confers on the Commonwealth responsibility for Australia's world heritage areas. There were, however, differences of opinion about the extent of the Commonwealth's responsibilities, as distinct from those of the states. The committee considered that it is the Commonwealth's prime responsibility to ensure that high standards of management are established and maintained in all world heritage areas. The committee identified a number of ways in which the Commonwealth should meet these responsibilities:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> it should ensure that all world heritage areas have management plans which are based on the areas' world heritage values;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> it should ensure that, where appropriate, world heritage values are respected in regional and strategic plans;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> it should ensure that the values of world heritage areas are redefined as new knowledge about the areas accumulates and the concept of world heritage evolves, and that these values are incorporated into any updates of management plans;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> it should ensure that consultative bodies are established for each world heritage area;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> <TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> it should sponsor research into world heritage management, and collect and disseminate information about best prac tice, for example, in relation to consultation, monitoring, managing the impact of visitors, and the use of user charges to recover some part of the cost of managing world heritage;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> it should assist with educating the public and displaying world heritage;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> it should provide funding for world heritage areas on the basis of financial agreements with the states for all state managed world heritage areas to provide long&hyphen;term certainty to world heritage managers; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> it should retain legislation that can be used to protect world heritage if other measures fail.</PARA>
<PARA>In many of these areas, a good start has been made. However, it is important that the momentum so far achieved be maintained and new initiatives&mdash;like establishing systematic monitoring of all world heritage areas&mdash;be pursued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has also recommended that, in the future, issues such as the development of management plans and funding arrangements be determined before an area is nominated for the World Heritage List.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Funding is one of the critical issues for world heritage areas. Some sites, especially those administered by the Commonwealth, are reasonably well treated and some state managed areas receive sizeable additional funds from the Commonwealth. However, other state managed areas have received very little from the Commonwealth&mdash;for example, Fraser Island and Lord Howe Island. This is an inequitable situation which can only be resolved from the Commonwealth's viewpoint by distributing Commonwealth funds through a consistent approach based on the needs of the individual world heritage areas. It is important to stress, though, that the Commonwealth should not be regarded as a bottomless source of funds. The committee considered that the Commonwealth should only provide funds as a supplement to state funding, and state funding should continue at least at the level that existed before world heritage status was conferred.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6364">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to Commonwealth funds being distributed inequitably, funding is insufficient to establish and maintain high standards of world heritage management. On the basis of the information available to the committee, it is estimated that an additional $20.6 million are needed immediately and then an additional $16 million per annum if world heritage areas are to be managed adequately. The Natural Heritage Trust is expected to make $12 million available to world heritage areas over four years; this is welcome but inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee noted that user charges, such as entry fees, have been introduced in many world heritage areas. It supported user charges as an appropriate way in which to supplement the funds available for world heritage management, provided that the revenue from such charges is returned as extra funding to the area from which it is collected and does not simply return to be added to consolidated revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee considered that user charges should be more than a token amount and approved, in principle, the recent decision by the Commonwealth government to increase the environmental management charge on visitors to the Great Barrier Reef. The committee was very concerned, however, about the manner in which the recent increase in fees was introduced on an inequitable base, without consultation and without adequate lead time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee also noted the plethora of different charges applied by different levels of government in the Great Barrier Reef region, and recommended that the Commonwealth, with state cooperation, review these charges with a view to devising a more appropriate way of levying fees. With increasing pressures on world heritage areas and reduced funds with which to manage these pressures, there is a role for the private sector in providing works, services and infrastructure, though any private sector activity in world heritage areas will need to be very carefully controlled by government managing agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is obviously preferable that the Commonwealth and state governments cooperate in protecting, conserving and presenting world <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> heritage areas to the public, as the world heritage convention requires. However, if world heritage values are threatened and state governments fail to act to protect these values, the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act empowers the Commonwealth to intervene. While the use of this legislation has proved contentious, the committee considers that its retention is essential for the protection of world heritage values. The committee recommended that the legislation be strengthened, but did not agree with the suggestion that additional legislation should establish a general framework for world heritage management by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is other legislation that needs examination if we are to be sure that Australia is meeting its world heritage commitments&mdash;for example, the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. In addition, an overall review of the range of state and territory legislation would be useful to identify whether there are deficiencies. The committee also considered the legal aspects of administering the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and in particular possible solutions to the problems that arise from the fact that the boundaries of the marine park and the world heritage area do not coincide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of the recommendations in the report are of a general nature, referring to all world heritage areas. But there are a few recommendations which refer to specific areas&mdash;for example, the Great Barrier Reef, Fraser Island, the Riversleigh Fossil Mammal Site, Kakadu and Uluru. The committee was concerned about the ineffective community consultation on Fraser Island. It was also concerned by reports of poor relations between the then Australian Nature Conservation Agency and the Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory, and recommended moves to improve the cooperation between the two agencies. I was pleased to note the very recent decision to have the Commonwealth's Director of National Parks and Wildlife and the Director of the Northern Territory's Parks and Wildlife Commission sit on one another's boards of management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, it appeared to the committee that much has been achieved through the listing of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6365"> Australia's world heritage areas. But it is also obvious that much remains to be done, some of it urgently. It is the committee's hope that the report I am tabling today will assist in the process of improving world heritage management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report is the result of nearly two years of work by the present Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts and its predecessor in the last parliament. Most of the work of the inquiry was carried out by the previous committee under the chairmanship of Mr John Langmore, and it has fallen to the current committee to finish what was an almost completed task. I would like to acknowledge the work of Mr Langmore and all of the members of the committee, both past and present, who have contributed to this inquiry. I particularly would also thank the committee staff: Ian Dundas, Dr Sarah Hnatiuk, Susan Cardell, Marlene Lyons, and the many others who have assisted with this considerable work. This is a significant report and it certainly gives me very great pleasure, on behalf of the committee, to commend the report to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia is privileged to have 11 of the world's 469 heritage sites. All of these sites are of such outstanding universal cultural or natural significance that, after a rigorous process of nomination and evaluation, they have been declared a world heritage area or monument. The inquiry, the report of which we are just tabling, found that Australia's management of world heritage sites has been uneven and often inadequate. Only three&mdash;Kakadu, Uluru-Kata Tjuta and the Tasmanian wilderness&mdash;could be described as well managed and just barely adequately funded; even in those, the rangers and attentive visitors would have no difficulty with suggesting improvements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> In all the others there are some serious inadequacies in the structure or implementation of management and of funding. In all of them dedicated staff, with a sense of the significance of the task in which they are involved, are struggling to cope with insufficient political recognition, unresolved intergovernmental conflict, incomplete man agement structures, incomplete or poorly maintained infrastructure, inadequate funding and insufficient staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These difficulties were readily apparent to the members of the environment committee. The seriousness of these inadequacies contributed to enabling the committee members to reach agreement about our report. I would like to express warm appreciation to the Chair, the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), and to other members for seeking and finding compromises which all members could support. Given the diversity of the membership of the committee, this is a significant achievement and must be recognised as adding weight to our recommendations and urgency to the importance of their implementation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amongst the main recommendations are recognition of the urgency of complete management plans for those sites which do not yet have them and the crucial importance of building tourist infrastructure adequate to cope with all visitors and to give them a significant educative experience. This is both the best way of minimising damage and of ensuring that tourists' appreciation of the natural environment is enhanced by their visit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every world heritage area should have an excellent tourist information centre, informative signs, viewing points, pathways and, where appropriate, boardwalks, lighting or floating barges. The world heritage emblem should be used throughout the areas. Training programs for a range of staff, particularly for private tour operators, often need to be upgraded, as well as there being the need for an increase in the number of ranger staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Funding agreements between the Commonwealth and Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australian governments must be quickly completed, in particular with the Queensland government about Fraser Island and Riversleigh fossil site and the Western Australian government about Shark Bay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, and most important of all, the Commonwealth should provide an additional $20.6 million next year and a further additional $16 million a year thereafter. These figures are the total of reasonable estimates of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6366"> needs of each area prepared in consultation with people who know each area well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were great pleasures for those involved in this inquiry for we had the opportunity to visit and be guided around most of Australia's beautiful world heritage areas. This was a privilege. With the help of outstanding staff, a comprehensive report has been prepared which makes concrete and practical recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would particularly like to thank the staff&mdash;Ian Dundas, Sarah Hnatiuk, Susan Cardell and Marlene Lyons, as the chair has just mentioned. They did a particularly fine, effective and rigorous job. The thoroughness and openness of the inquiry and rigour and logic of the report give authority to the recommendations. I hope that the government will consider them quickly, endorse them and act on them promptly.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(12.46 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The inquiry into the management arrangements of world heritage areas is  certainly very timely given the controversy of listing and general management problems associated with a number of world heritage listed areas. Because of the significant areas of world heritage listing in my electorate and their impact on the general community of Leichhardt, I was pleased to be able to play a small role in the formulation of this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that I have limited time to discuss the report, I will restrict my comments to what I see as some of the key recommendations. First of all, it was very evident that funding, with the exception of Uluru and Kakadu, was extremely inadequate. I was pleased to see we were able to recommend that significant funding be made available if we are going to maintain the integrity of these parks. We believe that the amount of $20.6 million should be provided and $16 million per annum thereafter. If we are going to set these areas aside as world heritage areas, then it is absolutely critical that funding be provided for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Another area in which I was pleased to see recommendations was community involvement. There were very strong recommendations to look at ensuring that local people are involved in the process right from the begin ning and all the way through. I think this is absolutely critical. We have seen incidences in my own electorate where the local community has been excluded from the process. As a consequence, there has been a tremendous amount of hostility and concern with regard to listings of world heritage areas and a lot of conflict within the community. With a little effort and significant involvement of the community you are going to suddenly have community ownership. I think that is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also recognised the need for compensation for the loss of use of an area. I think this is another important recommendation given that once these areas are listed in some cases there are restrictions for the land-holders in what they can do. I think it is very important that we acknowledge the right for compensation for these people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the previous speakers mentioned looking into a user pays system. I think it is absolutely critical given the controversy that we created through the increase in the environmental management charges with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park operators. I think we need to look at that sensibly to make sure that we are totally aware of the impact of that. Knowing that we have to move into a user pays system, it is absolutely critical we put this on the agenda and have a look at it over all the world heritage areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also need to look very closely at defining the boundaries of world heritage areas. I think it is a mistake to have some form of agenda that we are going to take a quota of land. The land has to be determined on its world heritage values. When we are doing these assessments it may well be that there are additional amounts of land that can be taken. There may also be land that does not meet world heritage value and it should be excluded or removed from world heritage areas. These areas do cost a lot of money to maintain and it is important that money is spent in the right areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of recommendations though in which, while I support their general thrust, I believe we could have been much stronger. One of those is in regard to the Northern Territory government's involvement <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6367"> in the world heritage areas of Kakadu and Uluru. I feel it is important they have a stronger involvement. I also believe that private enterprise, while it is great to see that we are looking to them to provide vital infrastructure, should also have a role in management. They have a lot of knowledge. We do have ANCA, which is the broader umbrella organisation&mdash;the watchdog so to speak&mdash;but I believe private enterprise could play a much greater role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The adoption of the 54 recommendations contained in this report will go a long way to addressing the current problems in improving and preserving the quality of our world heritage areas. Therefore, I commend the report to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, would like to congratulate the people who have been involved in the development of this report. As a recent member of the committee, I have to say that most of the work was done by my predecessors and other members who have made a contribution who are no longer here. But it is important too that there is a level of general agreement about what needs to be done in the management of our world heritage areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to draw to the attention of the House today a couple of the recommendations which I think are critical if a report like this is to have any weight in the long term. I think there is always a suspicion on the part of committee members, and indeed the public as a whole, that these reports are not necessarily used later by government as a basis for action. I would certainly urge the current Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) and ministers who have a role in development to look very closely at the report's recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things I would like to draw to the attention of the House is the recommendation by the committee&mdash;and it went to some trouble to get these figures fairly precisely&mdash;of the need for increased funding for the protection, conservation and presentation of world heritage areas. In fact, the committee recommends that the Commonwealth government&mdash;and this is not to exclude additional contributions from user pays and from state <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> governments&mdash;should provide an additional $20.6 million immediately and $16 million a year thereafter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context, I would like to draw attention to the fact that, in this budget we have been debating in recent weeks, the world heritage budget in particular has been cut by 39 per cent. Some $16.3 million was previously allocated and that is down to $9.3 million. That is a very significant reduction in funding available for environmental protection of world heritage areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When asked in the estimates committee how they thought the funding should be allocated for the various world heritage areas that are described in this report, the minister said that they needed to negotiate it with the states rather than look at some basis in need, as is indicated in recommendation 46, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, in consultation with world heritage area management authorities, identify and quantify specific additional funding needs in each of the world heritage areas as a basis for allocating the additional funds.</PARA>
<PARA>While it is important to negotiate with the state governments, it is really also a question of identifying what needs to be done and how much funding needs to be spent in each area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the difficulties when the Commonwealth government cuts funding, as it has in this budget, is that the states move very quickly to match those cuts. That has certainly happened in the case of the Queensland government. So you have a compounding effect of reductions in funding. For example, there were significant cuts to the Wet Tropics Management Authority budget, from $4.7 million to $2.8 million&mdash;a reduction which we understand will again be matched, unfortunately, by the Queensland government. So the funds available there, in a recently declared area, will make it extremely difficult to bring up to speed not only the conservation and protection of that area but also presentation to the public of that world heritage area. I think all members of the committee were very keen to ensure that it was not left to the privileged <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6368"> few to have access to these areas but that it be managed carefully and appropriately funded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also draw attention to the fact that the government did make an explicit promise in their pre&hyphen;election policy to provide, quite apart from the heritage trust, an additional $4 million to heritage management. Not only has that not been provided but, as I say, cuts have also been made. The Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, acknowledged in the estimates committee that managing world heritage areas is a major challenge&mdash;something that is clearly underlined by the committee report&mdash;and yet we have seen these reductions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also seen some significant problems in relation to the approval of activities which may well diminish the world heritage values of very important areas. I draw attention in that respect to the committee's deliberations in recommendations 7 and 8 on the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. The committee recommends that the EP(IP) Act be amended to provide:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> an environmental assessment be required where there is the possibility that a proposed action will damage the world heritage values of a listed world heritage area.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not need to remind members of the controversy that has erupted over the approval for the Port Hinchinbrook resort. It has been against the advice of the government's world heritage unit and a raft of serious scientific concerns, yet there has been no provision for an assessment of the impact under the EP(IP) Act of this very significant development. Similarly, in relation to Kakadu we have very significant proposals yet to be properly fleshed out, both in relation to the environmental impact and the impact on the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Finally, something that I think the committee did not draw attention to was the fact that the government has changed its policy in relation to the listing of world heritage areas to require that in future they will proceed only with the agreement of the relevant state and territory governments. Given their reluctance to do that in the past, I think this means that the list we are dealing with at the mo ment may, in the foreseeable future, be the list and that we are not likely to see any further additions.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the recommendations in this report of the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts, brought down by the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). Indeed, I would like to acknowledge the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), who was the previous chairman of this committee. It is a shame that the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) is departing this chamber because there was bipartisan support to this inquiry. There was a lot of negotiation. Certainly the member for Fraser gave some very useful input, as did many of his colleagues. Regrettably, though, the member for Fremantle was not available for many of those dissertations. That obviously partly explains some of the statements she just made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are 11 world heritage parks, as was clearly mentioned by the previous speakers. We are very lucky in this country to have such a diversity both in cultural and physical attributes. Where I live, in northern New South Wales, the central eastern rainforest reserve has over five subregions of world heritage status. So I do have some affinity with those particular parks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The terms of reference of this inquiry were to look at the Commonwealth responsibility and its international and national obligations to look at the effectiveness of the consultative arrangements with relevant stakeholders and at the funding adequacy for management of those national parks. Indeed, the key recommendations that came down were looking at the management structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There certainly has been a lot of controversy over the management of a number of these parks, but I am pleased to note that some of the recommendations in this report, I believe, will go to alleviating those concerns, particularly in relation to stakeholders, and encouraging the local community, particularly the indigenous people and the private sector, to have a role in the management plans. This was clearly demonstrated as a further need with some of the parks being managed in the Northern Territory. Certainly, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6369"> the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is a very good yardstick for future parks and some of those existing parks which are totally funded by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other recommendations I would like to quickly brief the House on relate to the management plan and looking at a regular review&mdash;every five years&mdash;so that if there are changes in circumstances with land management and with the stakeholders they will be reviewed on a five&hyphen;yearly basis, along with a redefinition of the plan. Other recommendations relate to looking at managing the impact, particularly from the tourism angle, looking at areas of sustainable usage and at encouraging further education, through persuasion and adequate addressing of permits, to allow a more flexible usage within those parks, for both the park proprietors and, of course, the public. That was also demonstrated as a need in Kakadu.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The role of the private sector was also looked at in the report. It is critical to have a greater interface between private enterprise, between those locals earning the income from or participating in those parks, and the role that the Commonwealth and states have with relevant agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noted that the member for Fremantle mentioned that funding was not an issue raised in our committee meetings. Indeed, there was much discussion, and that is why there was universal agreement that there needed to be an extra $16 million per annum going to the parks and also a one&hyphen;off payment of $20 million. Obviously, a large section of this will come from our Natural Heritage Trust, which it is absolutely critical to get through this House, and part of it of course is going to maintaining, preserving and enhancing our world heritage parks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, this report should be seen as a landmark report for the management of our world heritage parks&mdash;for better management and better structures and, obviously, to protect the very assets; and that is why they were listed by UNESCO. Obviously it is looking at areas in which to recover costs through user charges in a sensible way and to give ownership back to the local communities, particularly to the indigenous people.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are 54 recommendations in this report. I hope that the Australian media, and no doubt the government agencies, will take time in reviewing this report. I would also like to commend the staff who were involved with this committee and the two previous chairmen, as mentioned, for the work that they have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, what this is all about is preserving our natural world heritage assets and getting a better management structure. It is pleasing that, with the exception of one speaker today, we had universal support amongst our committee for a bipartisan approach to managing our assets so that we can pass them on to future generations.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth government of course has the obligation under the various agreements that it has entered into, but, like much of our federal system, the success of our abilities to fulfil those obligations requires a great deal of cooperation between the federal government and the states and territories. Importantly, as other speakers on this report have said, doing the right thing by ensuring the preservation of world heritage listed areas not only requires the action of government but also requires the action of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The diversity of the 11 sites is of great interest because it brings up different challenges for each of the sites. If you compare areas such as Kakadu and the Tasmanian wilderness to areas such as the more recently listed Australian fossil mammal sites at Riversleigh and Naracoorte and to Lord Howe Island, you will understand that what we are talking about in this report is something that is very complex.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In formulating our recommendations, we have made some important observations about the requirements of management plans. Much <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6370"> of the controversy that we have seen in some of the areas would have been solved if, in fact, as we have recommended, management plans had been in place well before properties were nominated. The observation has been made that there must be not only a great deal of consultation with the communities concerned in the formulation of the management plans but that consultation must continue after the listing. If you look at the success of some of the arrangements to do with some of the properties, you will see that that success has been as a result of the continuing consultation with the various stakeholders that are involved. That is one of the most important aspects that we would like to put across about the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other important recommendations go to funding. My colleagues have made mention of the recommendation indicating we believe that $20.6 million should be provided immediately and a continuing $16 million a year after that. That funding goes towards the requirement of important infrastructure&mdash;infrastructure required for visitors' amenities and infrastructure required for proper information through such things as signage and information centres&mdash;measures which will all protect the world heritage values themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect I should touch upon is that the Environment, Recreation and the Arts Committee of this House has had a tradition of producing documents on the basis of consensus. This is such a document. There were many areas in which listeners to this debate would have got the impression that there was a tinge of controversy. But, in the end, we have produced in a bipartisan way a report to which not only this government but also a new government&mdash;when there is a change of government, hopefully sooner rather than later&mdash;would be committed to on both sides of the chamber. That is a very important aspect of the way in which the environment committee has always operated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of those areas of controversy was whether the two properties in the Northern Territory should be handed across to the Northern Territory government. I think there will probably be continuing debate about that, but the view of the committee is in the report. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> There was also controversy about the contribution of private enterprise to management, and our position is clearly stated in the report. We believe that, at the end of the day, whilst we would encourage private involvement, the decisions are properly in the hands of government and have to be done in a cooperative way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank not only the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), as the present chair, but also the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), who was the chair for the bulk of the inquiry in the previous parliament, for the way in which they have led consideration of this report; and the secretariat, who have once again done a fine job, as we now always expect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important aspect of this report is not that it will lie on a bookshelf somewhere; it is that the government will see its way clear to respond within three months, and I hope those responses will be very positive. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report is one of the most wide&hyphen;ranging and significant reports for the long-term care of our precious world heritage areas. Of the 469 properties on the world heritage list, there are 350 cultural sites, 102 natural sites and 17 mixed cultural and natural sites in 104 states or countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's 11 sites&mdash;all natural&mdash;are easily amongst the most pristine and beautiful of the world. They have met the detailed criteria of UNESCO and it is easy to see that these areas meet the pinnacle criteria: namely, to be of outstanding universal value. Of course, there are in Australia other areas which are deserving of world heritage status which will no doubt be nominated in the future. We have, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6371"> however, focused our attention over the last two to three years on our existing sites.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having scuba dived on the Great Barrier Reef and seen the other world which lives and thrives beneath the sea&mdash;the vibrant colours of the many strange and beautiful fish and plant life which we living on the surface tend to ignore&mdash;having experienced the changing colours and terrain and the raw natural beauty of Kakadu, having walked in the wet tropics of Queensland and having spent time in the central eastern rainforests, I count myself as having been most fortunate to have witnessed the outstanding natural value of our most beautiful, biologically significant and fragile natural jewels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report's 54 recommendations offer a framework for the better management of these valuable sites. These recommendations centre on issues such as funding obligations between the Commonwealth and the states, some of the current problems in the management of existing areas, nomination and listing practices and the need for thorough and early consultation with relevant stakeholders as nomination is considered. This report has also unearthed some very significant ongoing obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that other committee members share the view that all governments really have significant financial responsibilities as well as the moral and conservation obligations of maintaining our world heritage areas. But, in current circumstances, the committee has identified an immediate shortfall of $20.6 million next year and $16 million recurrent after that. We are also offering a solution through the increased use of private sector support and the increased use of user charges, where appropriate, for that funding shortfall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In successfully nominating areas for world heritage status, it is crucial that the Commonwealth and state governments work together, that the Commonwealth meet its financial obligations, that governments ensure that areas are managed and maintained in accordance with the needs of those areas and that management plans are both considered and thoughtful. Unfortunately, not all of these obligations have been met in the past. Amongst some of the findings, we have found <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that there are incomplete management plans for existing sites, at times there is poor monitoring of environmental risks, at times there are poor management structures and there is an underutilisation which seems to be consistent across the public sector of private sector support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all very well nominating areas for heritage listing, but it has not been good enough to then fail to provide sufficient resources and to implement clearer operational guidelines to ensure their management and protection. The report's recommendations, as stated in the summary, are `to build on the strengths and contribute to the establishment of better ways of managing world heritage'. As Australians, we must not take lightly our duties to shelter our natural environment. As custodians for the present and architects for the future, our environment is one of our most critical responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must shield our natural environment from the ravishes of modern living and the encroachments it seems forced to endure. We must strike a favourable balance between the trade, tourism and commercial demands on our land and the protection of pristine environmental assets for the generations beyond. Finally, I would like to thank the members of the previous committee and the committee secretariat for all their efforts in putting together this report. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How appropriate it is that I am introducing the Sydney Airport (Regulation of Movements) Bill 1996 on 4 November, for it is two years to the day since the third runway was opened at Sydney. That opening led to a disaster for residents all around the airport, and I was elected to do something about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am bringing this bill forward on behalf of my constituents, and the tens of thousands of other Sydney residents, who are tired of the uncertainty that clouds KSA. This bill would place a legislative limit on the number of aircraft movements during any one&hyphen;hour period at Kingsford Smith airport. This bill fulfils a promise I made during the election campaign&mdash;that is, to introduce it regardless of who formed a government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill sends a clear message to the people of Sydney: this parliament believes there is a limit to the capacity of Kingsford Smith airport. It also sends a clear message to those who oppose a second Sydney airport that this is not an option but a necessity. This clearly rebuffs those groups whose real agenda is to entrench Kingsford Smith airport as our only airport&mdash;an airport whose operations would destroy the lives of thousands of Sydney residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Kingsford Smith airport is growing at a rate of over nine per cent per annum. For residents under the flight path this is alarming. At the moment, there are over 280,000 aircraft movements through KSA. Already the noise levels are intolerable for many. The decision to allow take&hyphen;offs to the north from runway 34R without an EIS has significantly increased the capacity of the airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are serious proposals to increase the number of flights to over 350,000 per annum as well as a proposal for a fourth runway. In addition, a bizarre coalition of the Greens, the No Aircraft Noise Party, the aviation industry and members of the Howard government, including the member for Hughes (Mrs Vale), <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have formed the No Second Airport in Sydney Alliance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need for legislation is highlighted by the hostile response of the Tourism Council of Australia to my bill. Bruce Baird said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Restricting the ability to lift the cap on movements at Sydney airport at peak times will be bad news for the tourism industry.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that the capacity would not be enough for the Olympics. Well, let the Olympic planners be put on notice. This bill would send a clear message to those who would excessively increase the capacity at KSA to the detriment of thousands of Sydney residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to the increased aircraft noise, there is increased traffic from the airport through streets that were not designed to take it. There is also air pollution. Following sightings by a number of Marrickville residents, Airservices Australia have confirmed that, at 12.59 p.m. on 15 October this year, a US registered Evergreen Airlines aircraft dumped fuel over Marrickville. This occurs when tanks are overfilled or aircraft suddenly change altitude&mdash;and residents suffer. Mr Deputy Speaker, my point is quite simple: more aircraft movements equal more noise and more air pollution and a greater chance of a minor or major disaster over the most densely populated area of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it has to be said that there are many in the community who would have expected this measure to have been brought into legislation by now. The government took only 10 days to direct Airservices Australia to re&hyphen;open the east&hyphen;west runway. It seems bizarre that we are here eight months later waiting for them to legislate on one of their other key election promises&mdash;a cap on aircraft movements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their election commitment was clear. Page 8 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Putting people first&mdash;the coalition's policy on Sydney airport</EMPHASIS>, of 29 January 1996, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition will cap aircraft movements at 80 movements per hour by implementing a slot system.</PARA>
<PARA>It was with some disappointment that I read the response of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) to this bill. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6373"> I had hoped for a more positive response. Since then, I have had a productive discussion with the minister, and it has been agreed that I and the seconder of this bill, the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), will meet with the minister within a week to discuss the government's response. It should be positive, just as the response of the shadow minister and the Labor caucus has been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by responding to those who say that it is not necessary to have this legislation. I want to quote someone who said last year during a similar debate on his private member's bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would make it the law of Australia, a law that could not be altered, except by another act of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the then opposition leader, now Prime Minister, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, the people of Sydney need the strength of legislation, not the whims of ministerial discretion, to provide certainty and some direction over the future of airport operations at KSA. I am pleased that my bill will be seconded by the member for Watson, who has an outstanding record, first as the member for Grayndler and then for Watson, in standing up for residents against the vagaries of noise. I strongly urge all members to support this bill. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this House calls on the government to strengthen the pledge of commitment as a citizen of the Commonwealth of Australia into a pledge of loyalty to acknowledge the primacy of the interests of Australia and its people above all others.</PARA>
<PARA>I rise in this House today to call on the government to strengthen the pledge of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> commitment as a citizen of the Commonwealth of Australia into a pledge of loyalty to acknowledge the primacy of the interest of Australia and its people above all others. I am convinced that the present pledge of commitment given by all new citizens of Australia is now due for an overhaul. I think that Australia's existing citizens expect a firm promise by those who come here to join them as citizens of this great nation to be willing to give a clear and unambiguous commitment of loyalty where there can be no room for higher loyalties to other nations or people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people may ask, and there will no doubt be speakers today who will question, whether we need to change the pledge of commitment. Many people in this country do not even know what it says or who says it. It is a statement of commitment to be made at citizenship ceremonies and reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">From this time forward, under God,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">whose democratic beliefs I share,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">whose rights and liberties I respect, and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">whose laws I will uphold and obey.</PARA>
<PARA>A person may choose whether or not to use the words `under God'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a pretty piece of prose, but we should not forget its importance or what it symbolises. This is how people who are to become Australian citizens promise to uphold our laws and traditions. I think that we all should expect an unequivocal promise of loyalty and allegiance. The pledge as it now stands is not such a promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you now that anything written as loosely as this pledge, more for its aesthetic appeal than anything else, can and will be interpreted differently by different people. Some individuals will take it to mean whatever they want. The pledge as it stands is a symbolic statement of motherhood principles and seems designed more to make us feel good than to make a real commitment. This is not a bad thing, but I believe that it is only a starting point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At any ceremony for granting of citizenship, you can see a number of migrants from a widely diverse background. They have decided to make Australia their home, and we have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6374"> accepted them here. They will bring with them many fine things that will make Australia a better place, and I think that most will look back on this ceremony as one of the defining moments in their lives. To be asked to acknowledge the primacy of the interests of their new nation over all others should be no difficult task. I believe that most would expect it to be so. A strong pledge of loyalty and allegiance is also an important symbol to those who are already Australian citizens. At no stage should, or do I expect could, anyone fail to see the importance of the fact of changing one's nationality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been accused of wanting to prevent certain people from coming to this country as migrants. This accusation oversimplifies the situation and has allowed some to throw a neat label of `racist' at me. The simple fact is that the people of this nation have the right to choose who we want to join us&mdash;in fact, we have and will continue to do so as matters of government policy. Part of this choice involves making new citizens aware of what they are becoming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does, however, emphasise that what we have in our pledge must be clear and not open to interpretation in ways we do not intend. I believe that our pledge of commitment needs to become one of loyalty to Australia and its people above all others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are at least two good reasons for this. Firstly, anyone coming into the country, being accepted as an Australian citizen, must take upon themselves a clear and unequivocal promise. There can be no misunderstanding, no room for error. They must accept their obligations without reservation or qualification. There can be no `core' or `non-core' promises here. Secondly, the people of Australia must see that new citizens are prepared to make that ultimate pledge. Exchanging allegiance from one's country of origin, with its history, values, laws and customs, to another is an important step. These people have chosen to do so and share our future. I have been accused of lacking detail or substance in what I have said on other occasions, so I will spell out my proposal here. I believe that the current pledge of commitment should <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be strengthened into a pledge of loyalty which says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">From this time forward, under God, I pledge my loyalty&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pride in one's country and a true sense of nationhood can be enhanced by a better understanding of citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Citizenship is the ultimate expression of a person's commitment to a nation. It involves a two-way reciprocal commitment between the citizen and the nation. It is a unifying symbol, especially in a multicultural nation like Australia. It is a genuine bond to a way of life.</PARA>
<PARA>These are not my words, they are the printed words of the coalition policy document. The document refers to the privilege of citizenship and the corresponding responsibilities. It also notes that a citizenship ceremony should be a memorable event and should be dignified and meaningful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">True to its election promise, the government allocated $700,000 over three years to the Australian Council on Citizenship to undertake a comprehensive review of citizenship in Australia. The government is committed to enhancing the national significance of Australian citizenship. The review will also look at issues such as residency, fluency in English, the pledge of commitment and dual citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The oath has been amended on a number of occasions since the act first came into effect in 1949 and has been the subject of examination by various committees and conventions, et cetera. Renunciation in various forms has been in and out. It has been accepted that many migrants found difficulty in renouncing `nationality', as to them it was synonymous with family and race, and renunciation therefore implied permanent dissociation from relatives, personal friends and cultures. Commitment to Australia is important. One's <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6375"> birthplace and the spoken word cannot be the only measuring sticks for such commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A very good Australian, and a constituent of mine, who was born in Greece, told me recently that on a return visit to Greece he had recited loudly <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Clancy of the Overflow</EMPHASIS> at the Acropolis just so that everyone there would know he was an Aussie. What is significant is that there are some matters to do with citizenship that Australia has no power over. Loss or retention of former citizenship depends entirely on the laws of the person's former homeland. A Greek citizen remains a Greek citizen under Greek law and an American ceases to be an American citizen under American law when they become an Australian citizen, irrespective of what they say at our citizenship ceremonies. Countries like Canada, Cyprus, Egypt, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, New Zealand, Portugal, Switzerland, Turkey and the UK, to name but a few, allow dual citizenship. Others such as China, Malaysia and Vietnam do not. This must be of some relief to the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). But she should know that the Joint Standing Committee on Migration stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee rejects the arguments that one cannot owe allegiance or commitment to more than one country. It is estimated that three million Australians currently possess dual citizenship. There is no evidence to suggest that these persons are disloyal or lack commitment to Australia simply because they chose not to relinquish their former ties and heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tolerance of diversity is a cornerstone of multicultural Australian society. The ultimate expression of such tolerance would be the recognition that while Australian citizens owe their primary allegiance to Australia, they can also show a commitment to their country of origin or the country of which they are resident.</PARA>
<PARA>The member for Oxley in recent months has shown herself entirely ignorant of the many issues of which she has spoken. She has spoken fiction, not fact; she has preached division, not cohesion, and bigotry, not tolerance. I would recommend to the member for Oxley that she get to know the seven per cent of her electorate who were born in a non-English speaking country.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proud to say that I represent every person in my electorate of Adelaide, including the 16.4 per cent from a non-English speaking background who add to our cultural diversity. I am privileged to live multiculturalism through the Australian Greeks, Italians, Cypriots and Vietnamese who have shown themselves to be such hardworking Australians. I have learnt that loyal Australians can still feel keenly for their country of birth&mdash;especially if that country was Cyprus, as it is still divided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was absolutely right when he said in the chamber last week:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . people should always be judged on their individual worth and merit, on their character and behaviour, and on what they do for their fellow man and not on the basis of their ethnic origin, the colour of their skin, their religious beliefs or their lack of religious beliefs, or where they may happen to have been born.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member who has just spoken, the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), has quite clearly completely misunderstood the intent of this motion. This motion is to strengthen Australia's pledge of allegiance. I believe it is time that such a move is undertaken and this is made more important. I understand the government is to review the concept of citizenship. The irony of all this is that the majority of coalition members would support this motion if they were being consistent with their own policy document and discussions that have been held ad nauseam within the coalition's own backbench committees about the value of Australian citizenship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To be an Australian citizen is something to be valued. As a citizen who was not born here I can attest to that. It is no mistake that many hundreds of thousands of people want to come here every year. Those that are able to become Australian citizens guard their associated rights and privileges closely. The current pledge is one of commitment. The mover of the motion, the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), started to read it out. If we ask <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6376"> ourselves what the origins of such pledges or oaths are, we find that allegiance comes from the old French `liege' meaning pure and absolute, with `liege homage' meaning unconditional. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was developed in our culture from the English feudal system where unconditional allegiance was sworn to a sovereign. The four kinds of allegiance generally accepted are: natural allegiance, due from all people born in a domain; acquired allegiance, obtained by naturalisation; local allegiance, from aliens, so long as they remain in a domain; and legal allegiance, created by the oath of allegiance. I contend that these do not represent old and outdated concepts but, as a matter of security for the traditions, laws and institutions of a nation, the concept of allegiance remains just as valid in our society today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our society is in the midst of change and, generally, change for the good. We have a tolerant, liberal society that has grown in strength, value and diversity due to the contributions made not only by its own citizens but also by those new citizens who have come from all around the world to become Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyone who comes to Australia with an expectation of becoming a citizen should be prepared to accept this country and its people, to the exclusion of all others if necessary. I believe that the Australian people would expect nothing less. As their representatives, we have an obligation to support their view. A step in this direction was taken in 1993 with the introduction of the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill, which introduced the previous oath with the current pledge and removed reference to a monarch. We know that at the time there was a great deal of debate over whether this was a precursor towards a republic. However, there is a view that this has generally been seen as a modern Australian approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal act&mdash;the Australian Citizenship Act 1948&mdash;requires anyone wanting to become a citizen to make an oath or affirmation of allegiance. This is a long&hyphen;accepted and, I think, important condition that we have placed on all people wanting to become <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> citizens. If we are to continue to go to these lengths to pledge commitment to what Australia stands for and is, I think we are also bound by duty to ensure that the pledge actually means something real. The debate on citizenship cannot be undertaken separately from the debate on immigration and multiculturalism. In the previous government's own prescription of the bounds of multiculturalism, it noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . multicultural policies are based on the premise that all Australians should have an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia, to its interests and future, first and foremost,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is from the coalition's document; the member for Adelaide would do well to reread it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">multicultural policies require all Australians to accept the basic structures and principles of Australian society&mdash;the Constitution and the rule of law, tolerance and equality, parliamentary democracy, freedom of speech and religion, English as the national language and equality of the sexes; and multicultural policies impose obligations as well as conferring rights: the right to express one's own culture and beliefs involves a reciprocal responsibility to accept the right of others to express their views and values.</PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, it is my view that the new pledge of loyalty should read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people above all others,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whose democratic beliefs I share,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whose rights and liberties I respect and promise to uphold, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whose laws I will uphold and obey before any others.</PARA>
<PARA>It is simple and straightforward and, in my view, the vast overwhelming majority of Australians would accept it, as would most of the coalition members, amongst whom are a number opposing it today.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must thank the member for Moore (Mr Filing) for reconfirming the coalition's policy on multiculturalism and also our commitment through the Australian Council on Citizenship. I was wondering which side he was actually debating for on this motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not particularly easy for those of us who have actually pledged our loyalty to Australia or witnessed our parents pledge their <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6377"> loyalty on our behalf to face those who say we lack commitment to this country. Let there be no mistaking what the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) is suggesting: ethnic Australians are agents of foreign countries out to destabilise Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 29 January 1965, in the Fremantle Town Hall, at the age of 9&half;, with my sister I stood by my father's side as he recited in his far from perfect English his commitment to this country. No-one forced my father to become an Australian citizen; he chose to become one. Unlike the member for Oxley, I stood by my father and we pledged allegiance to this country. I have before me evidence of my pledge to this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like other members of this House, such as the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou), the member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash) and the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit), we came here as children. I for one am extremely proud of my immigrant heritage. Since then the oath has changed on more than one occasion. It has undergone reviews and amendments. Despite these changes, members may be interested to know that entire sections of our immigrant community have not turned into racial, radical, anti-Australian revolutionaries simply because they used one formula of the oath rather than another. They have maintained their rock solid commitment to this country and the values we hold dear, while simultaneously maintaining a precious bond with a culture, a language and a religion of their past. This has been possible in Australia and we should all be proud of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am convinced that the motion put forward by the member for Oxley today is, above all, unnecessary. It pre&hyphen;empts the work of the Australian Council on Citizenship, as announced by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) on 20 August. Our minister announced the process of reviewing comprehensively the issues of citizenship in Australia with a view to advising how best to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Australian citizenship on 26 January 1999. The council would deal with issues such as the meaning and value of citizenship; residency, language, age and other requirements; reviewing the current pledge; dual and multi&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> citizenship issues; and several other issues. The aim of the review will be to make citizenship more meaningful for all Australians, something which I fully support. The council deserves a chance to make inquiries and reach its conclusions without being pressured or pre&hyphen;empted by politicians on demagogic campaigns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the centenary of Federation approaching fast, it is important that we openly examine the symbols and values which we as Australians see as important. There is always room for change and progress in this area, but it is just as important that these changes be undertaken in a mature and responsible way. The Australian Council on Citizenship will ensure that the concerns of all Australians, not some, are heard. This motion is just another example of opportunistic policy on the run.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no political imperative to strengthen the oath of allegiance. To think otherwise is to imply that people simply swan into Australia, become citizens without even thinking about what they are doing and are somehow less committed than their Australian born counterparts. I point out that there are many countries in the Asian region&mdash;those countries which the member for Oxley believes are swamping us&mdash;which force its citizens to renounce their original citizenship once they become Australians. The member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) pointed out some of these countries, and I wish to repeat some of those. China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Brunei, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and Nepal are some of the countries in this category. This would imply that people would not simply come to Australia and decide to become citizens lightly. They would do it because they believe it is the best thing for themselves, their family and their future, fully aware that there is no going back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also reaffirm my belief that it is not the oath itself that makes us good Australians or this piece of paper which I am holding now, even though I am extremely proud of it, as most immigrants to this country would be. What makes us Australian is our basic commitment to values of equality and justice, our commitment to tolerances of all types&mdash;tolerance of diversity, tolerance of those who <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6378"> have endured hardship and tolerance of those who seek a helping hand by a compassionate society. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot do more than express my general agreement with the remarks of the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) and the member for Deakin (Mr Barresi). I think it is unfortunate that the member for Moore (Mr Filing) has associated himself with what I think was called in the newspaper this morning, and an accurate reflect of its motivation, `dog whistling'. That is saying something which has an ostensibly overt purpose but is intended to send subliminal tones to others that convey an entirely different message. That message is, as the member for Deakin has said, that some of our fellow citizens have not given a commitment to this country in a manner which we would expect when they become citizens of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Might I say that the Labor Party has no diffidence about defending the terms of the pledge of commitment as a citizen. In the term of our government we made an expressly Australian act of affirmation to become a citizen. We removed reference to a pledge of loyalty to Her Majesty. We made it clear that when somebody does become a citizen of this country they are pledging their commitment to this nation. I can do no better than refer to the words that former Senator Tate used when he was referring to its genesis through the words of Les Murray, with whom he consulted in developing this. He referred to it this way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then it says, `I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people'. This is the affirmative, positive act indicating a solemn commitment, an allegiance to Australia and its people. `Australia' is used there in a very simple expression but it has various levels of meaning. Obviously, there is the political entity, the Commonwealth of Australia. Loyalty is being expressed to that political entity, the name by which we are known amongst all the nations. But there is also a geographical and physical sense, which should not be totally discounted&mdash;the place. There is a commitment to Australia as the place where we are fortunate to be, the sunburnt country, the land abounding in nature's gifts of beauty rich and rare.</PARA>
<PARA>He concluded by saying:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So the loyal commitment is meant to evoke obligations to Australian society, the political entity and the land itself, the place where we are.</PARA>
<PARA>And it does that. No pledge can detail every particular of a citizen's ongoing obligations. But this demands of a person a commitment of loyalty to Australia and its people and a respect for Australia's democratic traditions. It says that those democratic traditions are to be shared, rights and liberties respected and laws obeyed and upheld.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What could be more clear&hyphen;cut? What could be more expressive of the obligations we expect of somebody joining the Australian community? What could be less properly characterised&mdash;as it has been this morning&mdash;as something which is merely a pretty piece of prose? This is something that is strongly Australian, but it is not jingoistic and it is not resentful of the fact that, when some amongst us come to Australia and take citizenship, they do not leave behind other of the sentiments that we would expect them to hold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that to become a member of this place one must renounce all other citizenships. Perhaps that is appropriate for a member of the parliament but, notwithstanding that, there are members of this House, including the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), for example, who felt great unease in being placed in a position where he had to formally renounce his United Kingdom citizenship. There are many who have previously held dual citizenship and who feel that when they come to this place the constitutional obligation is one which places them in a situation which they ought not to be placed in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a matter which this House and the parliament will have to deal with in due course. But respecting the rights and entitlements of all of us who have made a commitment to this nation is a foundation stone for where we would wish to be. I do not believe that this House is in any way ready to accept the unspoken message of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson)&mdash;who was, I believe, unfortunately joined this morning by the member for Moore&mdash;that we do, in some sense, not demand of people coming to this nation a loyalty and commitment to Australia, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6379"> a primacy of that loyalty and commitment, and that we are in any way short of asking of them the mutual respect that citizenship requires of us a nation and as citizens pledging themselves to it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

I have to confess that I have not gone looking in the words of the motion for some sinister or dark objectives or motives or meanings. But perhaps it is my naivety and the simple lawyer's training which simply says you take the words at face value and go from there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regard this issue as important. The question of citizenship is an appropriate and important subject for our consideration in this place. I do not find anything in the motion especially offensive or objectionable. I note that our government has moved to highlight and underscore the importance of citizenship and has established the Australian Council on Citizenship to look at the issue in its widest possible context.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that subject, I take from the motion concerns about citizenship, about nationality, about allegiance and about identity. I regard all those issues as being appropriate and important subjects of debate in this place. In that regard I know that there is a view that the whole concept of nationality is becoming passe, that it is no longer of great relevance. The great exponent of that view in our region would be Kenichi Ohmae, the famous business strategist. He argues that, in view of the emergence of the global economy, the global village and the borderless world, the whole concept of national identity is no longer of any great relevance; that the combined influences of capital, corporations, consumers and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> communications suggest that we ought to dispense with the notion of nationality altogether.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What sort of government would short&hyphen;change pensioners in residential aged care? The Howard government would. What sort of government would be lousy enough to take $350 per annum from some of Australia's most needy and deserving citizens? The Howard government. When rental assistance was paid directly to age pensioners in residential care, they were able to retain 15 per cent of the assistance for cost&hyphen;of&hyphen;living expenses. Now the Howard government has ripped away this amount&mdash;approximately $7 each week&mdash;and bundled it into recurrent subsidies to cover the cost of administration in nursing homes and hostels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an appalling double standard and injustice. Why should other Australians, including age pensioners renting accommodation, receive rental assistance directly, while people in aged residential care are discriminated against?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The No. 1 priority of the Howard government has been to put the right building blocks and linkages into place to facilitate this process.

If it is really the intention of the state government that all share in the benefits of the Olympics, then the best way for the Shoalhaven to benefit in the short and long term is for this long&hyphen;time commitment of rail electrification to be honoured.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of the severe financial strain still being felt by many farmers as a consequence of the drought? Will the government take steps to alleviate this strain on regional Australia?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="6383" SPEAKER="Howard, John, MP" NAMEID="ZD4" ELECTORATE="Bennelong" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the case, as implied in the honourable gentleman's question, that, although many areas of Australia have experienced bumper seasons as a result of very heavy rainfalls and in some areas of Australia some of the best seasons in living memory, it is also paradoxically the case that other parts of Australia are still in the grip of a severe drought or are still experiencing the after effects of having been released from the drought but still not, so far as the farmers are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6384"> concerned, receiving any income of any substance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had the opportunity a couple of months ago, accompanied by the Queensland Minister for Primary Industries and also by Mr Don McGauchie, the President of the National Farmers Federation, to visit one such area in outback Queensland near Winton. Nobody could have visited that area without being quite moved by the extent of family hardship, the aridity of the terrain and the very severe strain that five years of drought had placed upon the people of that district.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that, although many of these farms have now been out of drought declared areas since June of this year, the primary producers are not receiving any income. Their cash flow is absolutely negligible and under present arrangements it is quite unrealistic to contemplate that those people will lose the assistance they are now receiving come the early part of December. That is now only a little more than a month away. To take the assistance from those people, given what they experienced and what they continue to experience and the hardship they suffer, would be absolutely unreasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of weeks ago I received a delegation led by the Queensland Premier, Mr Borbidge, which included representatives of industry. They put a case to me, which I found very compelling, for some change in the existing arrangements following the lifting of a drought declaration. As a result of those representations, the government has decided to extend, to a period of 12 months from the existing six months, the time within which the drought relief payments, currently restricted to only six months, can be paid. This is essentially a family support payment to help meet day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day living expenses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other special assistance from Austudy through a relaxed assets test will also continue for the extended period as will special access to health care cards, family payments and the parenting allowance. As part of this package of measures, an extra $10 million for farm recovery, particularly to help with herd rebuilding and pasture re&hyphen;establishment, will also be made available.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an entirely appropriate response to an ongoing area of very great need. The farmers of Australia over the last five years have suffered many things. They have been ravaged in many parts of our country by one of the worst droughts experienced for decades and this range of additional assistance measures is entirely appropriate. It is relevant. It is defensible. And I hope it is something that will draw the support of all members of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that there are still many Australian farmers, although they have been out of drought now approaching a period of six months, who have no real prospect of a viable cash flow for some months into the future, and that is why the government has decided to double the period from six months to 12 months. It will not only apply to those people who have just come out of a drought declaration in June; it will apply in future to all people who have been in drought declared areas. Instead of having the assistance continue for a period of six months, that assistance will continue for a period of 12 months. It is estimated that these measures will cost over a full year an extra $81 million.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister advise the House on what action the government will take in response to the recommendations made by the Small Business Deregulation Task Force to reduce the red tape burden on small business?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="6385" SPEAKER="Howard, John, MP" NAMEID="ZD4" ELECTORATE="Bennelong" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to the honourable gentleman, can I say that one of the hallmarks of the coalition government will be an unswerving commitment to the role of small business in the Australian economy. It remains the case that, as we move towards the next century, more and more Australians will be employed by small business, fewer and fewer proportionately by large corporations and fewer and fewer by government instrumentalities. That is a trend that all Australians must understand and accept. It follows from that that all governments have an obligation&mdash;an absolute obligation&mdash;to create as welcoming a set of circumstances for small business as is consistent with the responsibility of governments to the employees of small business and to the consumers of the products and services of small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the reason why I committed the coalition in the election campaign to the goal of reducing red tape by up to 50 per cent in our first term of office. To help achieve that goal, I appointed the Small Business Deregulation Task Force that was chaired by Mr Charlie Bell, managing director of McDonald's foods. On behalf of the government, I want to thank Mr Bell and the other members of his committee for delivering a first&hyphen;class report, delivering it in a very readable, digestible form and delivering it well and truly on time. I can say in reply to the members of the task force that the government will give a comprehensive response to the recommendations of the task force by mid&hyphen;February 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have already implemented a large number of the commitments we made in the election campaign. We have reduced the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent. That is worth $160 million a year&mdash;let me say again: $160 million a year of extra cash flow injected into the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6386"> activities of small business, partnerships and firms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Treasurer's budget we foreshadowed legislation that will come into effect on 1 July next year that will provide capital gains tax rollover relief to the tune of $200 million. This will fulfil an election undertaking made by the coalition. It will be of direct and very considerable benefit to the small business sector of Australia. We have legislated, and we await the passage of the legislation in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now that an arrangement has been reached with the Australian Democrats, the Labor Party almost alone will remain opposed to freeing the small business sector of Australia from the unfair dismissal laws. I want to say that again: every time a small business man or woman complains about the unfair dismissal laws that actually discourage thousands of small businesses around Australia from taking on more staff, there is only one group of people they have to blame&mdash;and that is the men and women of the Australian Labor Party. It is the men and women of the Australian Labor Party who were responsible, without a mandate, without warning, without any electoral authority, for introducing the unfair dismissal law, a law described even by the sole remaining Labor Premier in Australia, Bob Carr, as a law that is destroying the job opportunities of young Australians. Nowhere is that happening more intentionally than in the small business sector of the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report of the Bell committee made a number of sweeping recommendations about the operation of the fringe benefits tax. The terms of reference of the committee were that consideration should take place on the basis of revenue neutrality so far as recommendations were concerned, but there is little doubt that the complexity of the fringe benefits tax is one of the main complaints of small business wherever you go in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fringe benefits tax cannot be abolished. I do not pretend for a moment that we hold out the prospect of abolishing it or getting rid of it in any substantial way. We are not arguing that. But we are arguing, and we welcome the proposals that have been put <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> forward by Mr Bell's committee, that there are ways and means of making that tax operate in a less burdensome fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a recommendation that government agencies should develop a single registration form for small businesses, that the Australian Taxation Office develop a single registration form for all taxes, to allow employers to issue all group certificates at the end of the year unless required by an employee, to extend the voluntary payment system for provisional tax to ease the cash flow burden on small businesses. I have already taken action to place small business deregulation on the agenda for the meeting of the Council of Australian Governments to take place in November.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, this is a first&hyphen;class report. All of the recommendations will be treated seriously by the coalition government. I will announce a comprehensive response by not later than the middle of February next year.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would interject very loudly at this stage, if I were you, to try to drown this out. Affordability is at its highest since the Commonwealth Bank&hyphen;Housing Industry Association index began in late 1984. That is the delivery to the Australian family of housing affordability at the best rate since they started taking this index in late 1984. There is no better benefit that can be delivered to the home buyers of Australia than lower interest rates, particularly to those families which struggled under the punitive interest rates of the failed Keating regime when the failed Keating regime took housing interest rates to 17 per cent and business rates to 21 and 22 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It gives this side of the House great encouragement to see that we are delivering housing affordability to average Australians. The HIA&hyphen;CBA housing report recorded a 10 per cent <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> increase in housing affordability in the September quarter. Housing affordability has been increasing over the last year and this is the biggest quarterly rise since March 1992 when interest rates fell by one percentage point to 12 per cent. All of the variables that affect affordability are working in the same direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The loan repayment needed on a typical first home mortgage fell from 20.7 per cent of household income in the June quarter 1996 to 18.9 per cent in the September quarter. The level of housing affordability is one factor, together with the unwinding of stocks, which points to a recovery in the house building industry starting next year. These are direct benefits to the Australia home buyer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also take this opportunity to point out that margins&mdash;that is, the margin for banks between the interest paid to depositors and the interest rate charged to borrowers&mdash;have been traditionally high in Australia and there are opportunities for those margins to still fall further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We saw earlier this year that the major banks were, as a result of aggressive competition in the home mortgage market and as a result of competitive pressures, able to reduce the variable home loan rate by 0.75 per cent in advance of a cut in official interest rates. That proves the benefits of competition, and the benefits of aggressive competition for mortgage originators, who have now taken their rates below eight per cent, also puts the pressure on banks to see if they can compress those margins further in relation to the variable mortgage rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the government is concerned, it is competition which will drive the compression of those margins. It is competition which will deliver those kinds of benefits to borrowers. It is sound economic policy which has made housing affordability so great for the average Australian family. This is the delivery of the program that the coalition holds dear&mdash;to families and to children in relation to mortgage rates. This is the way in which average Australian families will see the benefits of good economic policy.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the report sets out the litany of bureaucratic madness built up over the last 13 years by Labor. If Labor was ever wondering why small business cast them aside on 2 March, they should read the report. Even Labor's shadow minister for small business is reported as saying on 28 October:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In hindsight the Labor federal government could have done more to raise the profile and importance of small business in the community.</PARA>
<PARA>How right he was in that particular case. It is a pity that small business had to wait for the election of a coalition government to address these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to inform the House that the state and territory governments, as well as the local governments, are committed to the government's endeavours to free small business from the red tape and compliance burden. They pledged their commitment at the small business deregulation summit held on 12 June and I am meeting with state and territory small business ministers, as well as local government representatives, on 16 December to discuss the report's recommendations and agree on strategies to address the task force recommendations.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. A number of funds have applied for increases since 29 August, and currently there are three applications for premium increases under consideration. I will not confirm or deny any reports about a particular fund because this information is commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence, but I think it is worth telling the honourable member about the process that these funds go through. Firstly, they are referred to the Private Health Insurance Advisory Council for its advice as to whether or not the premiums are required for statutory solvency levels. In some cases, my department has approached funds and asked for additional information, asked for figures to be reworked or, particularly, asked <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to clarify assumptions under which some of the calculations have been made. Once this has been done, the department forwards notification details and the council's advice to me, together with any other information that it might think relevant. I make recommendations then to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, keeping in mind the basis on which premium increases can be disallowed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To date, no applications have been disallowed because all the premium increases have been justified on the basis of the funds' requirement to maintain solvency levels under the law. However, I am making it very clear to the funds that there is no more rubber stamping of premium increases. The public is not expecting that premium increases will never go up, but it does expect the health funds to act responsibly with full reference to the environment in which they operate. I am taking these expectations into account before considering premium increase proposals. I would also remind the honourable member that the previous government over a period of 13 years allowed 174 premium increases and knocked back none whatsoever, and that was about one premium increase per fund per year. So that rubber stamping has certainly stopped.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

When it is considering monetary policy, the Reserve Bank will look at the inflation performance and at the indicators I have enumerated over quite some time: namely, the inflation target of two per cent to three per cent underlying inflation over the course of the cycle. In relation to wages figures, we saw figures that were quite consistent. They will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6391"> be the matters on the mind of the Reserve Bank.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every time there is a good inflation figure, Senator Sherry runs out and says, `It's all Labor's doing.' Every time there is a retail figure, you run out and say, `It's all the coalition's doing.' One of the things you will have to try to do is get some consistency. You have to actually understand. The trouble is where there is no understanding there is no conscience. That is what illustrates Labor's economic policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You run out and say we should be balancing the budget over three years and then you oppose every measure to do it. When asked the day after the budget what you would have done differently, you said, `We'd have balanced over three years.' That is what we did in the budget. That is what we actually did. You came out the day after with absolute ignorance as to what had been announced the night before and then when it went to the shadow cabinet we found this proposal to balance the budget over three years but to knock back $19 billion worth of savings to get there. Where there is no understanding, there is no conscience, and that is the situation the Labor Party has got itself into.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to jobs and employment growth, the employment growth in the September quarter was 0.5 per cent. It was right on budget target, which is two per cent over the year&mdash;0.5 per cent in a quarter, two per cent over the year. It was right on target, bang on target. That was the outcome.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question and for his interest in the subject. It is very important for Australia that we have a modern industrial relations system. The reason we want to do it is that it will be good for the average Australian. For people at work, whether they are an employer or an employee, in the last 13 years they have been deprived of the opportunity and the encouragement to sit down at work and say, `What's good for this business which, therefore, will be good for both the future investment in this business and the wages of the people who work in it?'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the positive developments we have seen in the last few days has been the passage of the objects of the workplace relations legislation in the Senate. That is of symbolic importance as well as practical importance because the objects of the act really underpin the direction in which we want to encourage the system to move in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal object of the bill reflects the government's intention to establish a framework for much more cooperative workplace <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6392"> relations which will lead to improved productivity, high employment, low inflation and international competitiveness through higher productivity and a flexible and fair labour market. It also emphasises agreement making as the principal means of the determination of wages and conditions above the award safety net standards and really enables employers and employees to choose the most appropriate form of agreement for their particular circumstances. So you can end up with tailor&hyphen;made arrangements to really facilitate the better management of our businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The object gives primary responsibility for industrial relations and agreement making to employers and employees at the workplace level with the award system acting as a safety net of fair minimum wages and conditions. It is employers and employees at the workplace level who really are best able to determine what is in the best interests of that particular business and of the personal needs of the employees themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is also consistent with another underlying value in our system. That is, the government is saying to the people running our businesses, `Subject to that reasonable set of minimum conditions, it is really your responsibility at work to take advantage of that system which best suits you.' So the legislation is properly enabling as opposed to being proscriptive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting that, contrary to the claims of some of the critics of the bill, the needs of women and young people and the role of the unions are also addressed. The principal object, amongst other things, includes ensuring freedom of association and democratic, accountable and effective trade unions and employer organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The one which I dubbed the Howard object is the object which encourages the parties at work to allow employees to better balance their work and family responsibilities. There has been such a big social change in our country in the last 20 or 30 years. It is a great shame that in the last 13 years those who have wanted to better balance those responsibilities have been denied that opportunity. The last and interesting point to make is that, whilst we put up what I think are very sen sible and practical objects to the proposed legislation, the Labor Party has been opposing them at absolutely every turn.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even that proposition was assented to by your current leader when he was minister for employment and the former Prime Minister when he was both Prime Minister and Treasurer and it has been assented to by leading political figures on both sides of politics over a long period of time. If you really want to destroy jobs in this country, you first destroy the country's creditworthiness, and that is what the former government was doing by running up such a large volume of debt.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wonder why it is that the opposition is so sensitive about these matters. It is particularly important, when discussing issues in relation to immigration, to address factual questions. One of the issues which I think needs to be addressed in a factual way relates to unemployment in particular. It is an area of frequent misunderstanding. The longitudinal study that my department has undertaken demonstrates that family migrants have a significantly less satisfactory employment experience in Australia than skilled migrants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In July, after the government announced its program for this year, the Leader of the Opposition made some comments about employment. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . bad news for Australian jobs. . . Mr Howard has increased the category that directly competes with Australians trying to get jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>On Friday, on a program on Sydney radio, he said about employment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact of the matter is that the current immigration levels do not impact on that at all.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The impact of immigration probably on all of that is slightly to the good in terms of opportunities that are provided in building industries and the opportunities that are provided for business migrants coming in to create employment chances here in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>He was recognising that the skilled categories, particularly in the business migration program, were going to play a very positive role in building the Australian economy and in providing job opportunities for Australians. I have no quarrel with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the economic benefits that can be derived from immigration are going to be there only if the program is balanced. What the opposition want to do is to attach <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6395"> themselves to our overall target of 74,000. Then they want to expand family migration, which is essentially unskilled in its character, and to take away opportunities for independent migrants, for business migrants and for skilled migrants&mdash;the very people that they acknowledge themselves, and that the Leader of the Opposition acknowledges, provide the impetus and justification for an immigration program.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. There has been a lot of interest in Aboriginal health in recent weeks, as there always is, with comments by the Fred Hollows Foundation, by Mandawuy Yunupingu and also by the member for Dobell on Sunday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make a few comments about Aboriginal health. The first is that the budget, overall, is very positive for Aboriginal health. The Aboriginal health specific budget was not subject to any savings; in fact, the efficiency dividend is being ploughed back into new Aboriginal health services. There are 200 Aboriginal communities in Australia without any access to health whatsoever, even the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6396"> most basic nursing post. We will be able to address 35 of these communities' needs because of decisions in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also allowed Aboriginal medical services to have access to Medicare billing. Not all did. This provides an income stream that many of them did not have. We announced funding for the third national HIV-AIDS strategy. This will run from 1997 to the year 2000. Within that, Aboriginal sexual health will be taking a greater priority. I have had discussions with organisations interested in HIV-AIDS matters. They accept that it is time that Aboriginal people got a greater access to this funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of other initiatives that will specifically benefit Aboriginal people. The diabetes action plan that we promised before the election will be implemented. It will affect Aboriginal people because they have a particularly high rate of diabetes. We are trying to get GP and specialist services into rural and remote areas. We committed $215 million to that in the budget. That will help Aboriginal people. We have a joint initiative with the AMA, which is very well progressed, to try to get specialist services into rural and remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would not want to see Aboriginal health just in terms of money, because we would be making the mistakes of the past if we thought that was all it was. One thing I have been working very hard on is framework agreements with state and territory governments. I was able to announce to the House a couple of months ago that we had signed the first one with South Australia. I have now signed five such agreements, with South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, the ACT and Queensland, the last being on Friday with Victoria. I am confident that we will soon have every state and territory in the country signing these agreements. Of themselves they are not going to make a dramatic difference, but they are an important building block to make sure that two things happen. The first is that all tiers of government are trying to work in a coordinated manner. The second thing is that we bring Aboriginal medical services and ATSIC in around the table as part of the joint planning process so that never again do we <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> get the overlap and duplication that have bedevilled this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would say to the honourable member that the task is still immense, that honourable members should reflect that in 1996 there are still 380 Aboriginal communities with no access to running water and there are still 200 Aboriginal communities with no access to a health service, no matter how rudimentary. The task is not an easy one. It has had many overblown hopes before. It is certainly not something I want to do. I would say to the honourable member for Dobell and to any other member of this House that if they have serious ideas as to how we can do more and how we can make a greater impact, I make the offer that I am very keen to hear from them. I would be happy to make my department available. In the end, this is something in which, if we can all work together in a slow, hard slog, we might make some improvement over time.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the question from the honourable member for Cook, I am pleased to advise the House that the recent meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys&hyphen;General held in Canberra took an important step towards Australia's participation in international arrangements for the transfer of prisoners. With the exception of the Northern Territory, and subject to final confirmation from one jurisdiction, all state and territory Attorneys-General endorsed a legislative scheme for the transfer of prisoners. This endorsement paves the way for participation in transfer of prisoner schemes with other countries. Such schemes have significant humanitarian, economic and social advantages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once enacted, the proposed legislation will allow Australians serving prison sentences overseas and foreign nationals serving prison sentences in Australian prisons to return to their home countries to complete their sentences. Before any prisoner transfers can take place, this legislation will have to pass through the federal parliament and through the relevant state and territory parliaments. A number of administrative steps will also need to be taken, and transfer agreements will have to be made with other countries. We will be working to have the scheme operating as quickly as possible, and to that end I intend to introduce the Commonwealth legislation in the near future. I expect the participating states and the ACT will enact complementary legislation promptly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Cook also asked about Thailand. The conclusion of a prisoner transfer agreement with Thailand has been a high priority because of the comparatively high number of Australian prisoners in Thai prisons. Thai and Australian officials conducted preliminary discussions on this matter in April this year. The endorsement of the legislative scheme at the recent SCAG meeting will enable the commencement of more substantive negotiations. Any agreement reached with Thailand will not be able to enter into force until Australia's legislation&mdash;that is, the Commonwealth, states and ACT <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6398"> legislation&mdash;is in place.

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>I am speaking again today on Badgerys Creek because I refuse to let the issue slip quietly away into the night. I refuse to let it be put on the political backburner where certain people, for reasons known only to themselves, will keep it in the hope that it slips from the collective minds of the public in Sydney's west.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have many concerns in western Sydney. We worry about employment&mdash;or the lack of it&mdash;business growth, family dislocation, social <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6406"> services and welfare. When we have time, we also worry about the spectre of an international airport operating at Badgerys Creek. The people of western Sydney are deeply concerned about Badgerys Creek, and similarly with Holsworthy. After the third runway debacle at Kingsford Smith, they view any talk of EISs with a thoroughly jaundiced eye.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government assurances of environmental safety, whether they be from a Labor or a coalition government, are seen as admissions from the powers that be that they know something is wrong. It is cynical, but true: this is the reality as I find it in western Sydney. When the decision was made to build Sydney's second airport at Badgerys Creek in 1985, a few people, like me, raised their voices seeking answers to what troubled us most about the development. That number has only grown larger over the years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were wary of what toll such an airport would take on our lifestyles and on our family's lifestyles. However, we were informed by the authorities that nothing would go wrong at Badgerys Creek and that all the relevant steps would be taken so that the airport's environmental and social impact on our communities would be kept to a minimum. The Kingsford Smith third runway debacle did nothing to alleviate our fears, nor did it instil in us any confidence in what the authorities were telling us. In western Sydney we felt from both sides of politics a genuine lack of understanding of the way people were feeling in Sydney's west about Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the same time it became apparent that Sydney's capacity for absorbing air and water pollution had reached its limit. Asthma rates were up in Sydney's west. Scientific models show how the air pollution of the entire city travels west each day, settling on our heads causing the health problems we know about and heaven knows what else we do not know about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of western Sydney know in their hearts that a fully&hyphen;fledged international airport of the kind now being envisaged by the coalition&mdash;360,000&hyphen;plus flight movements and 13 million passengers per year&mdash;can never operate on their doorstep without <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> devastating social and environmental effects. They felt the same way about an airport of the magnitude suggested by the Labor government when it was in power&mdash;270,000 flight movements per year. They know this to be the case whether the airport is situated at either Badgerys Creek or Holsworthy. The question now is: what can be done to make those in control of the decision making process sit up and take notice of our fears and concerns?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition came to power promising to listen to the people of Australia. They spent the entire campaign in Lindsay talking about how they were a government which listened to the people of western Sydney. Yet the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the member for Hume (Mr Sharp), is not listening to the people of my community and the people from the western Sydney area who are saying, `No, we don't want an international airport built next door to us. No, we don't want to have jumbo jets screaming over our homes 24 hours a day.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If he were listening, he would be acting. If the member for Hume and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) really wanted to listen to the people and if they really wanted to act in the best interests of the voters from the west, they would swallow their pride and take a serious look at what other opportunities there are in relation to Sydney's second airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea of building an international airport at Goulburn seemed ludicrous in 1985. To put forward the notion of constructing Sydney's second airport close to two hours drive away with little or no transport infrastructure to support it would have been to invite ridicule but, over the last 11 years, the story has changed somewhat. Spiralling pollution levels in the Sydney basin combined with our burgeoning population should signal to any sane individual that the time for building an international airport within 50 kilometres of Sydney's city centre has passed. We missed the opportunity 10 years ago and there is no chance that we can reclaim it now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The story has changed in that we now also have the prospect of the very fast train link going into operation between Sydney and Canberra some time in the near future, which <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6407"> could be easily routed to run through Goulburn. That would negate the strongest argument against that town being chosen as the general site for Sydney's second airport. That argument at the time was its distance from Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whichever fast train option is decided upon&mdash;be it Speedrail's TGV model or Transrapid's Maglev train&mdash;we are looking at a transport system which would cut down the travelling time between Sydney and Goulburn to 45 minutes. Forty&hyphen;five minutes is the time it presently takes to travel from London's Heathrow Airport to that city's centre on the tube&mdash;a journey made by thousands of people every day, day in and day out, and hundreds of thousands a year without any hiccups whatsoever. Forty&hyphen;five minutes is less time than it would take an individual to travel on City Rail from Badgerys Creek to the centre of Sydney&mdash;we have not got a line there at the moment. It takes more than 45 minutes for my constituents to travel from my electorate office in Fairfield to the Sydney CBD.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Distance and travelling time from an airport at Goulburn to Sydney is therefore no longer an issue with the operation of the very fast train. In the process, the argument against Goulburn being at least considered&mdash;and that is what I am asking for, consideration&mdash;as a site fades into the ether, and that is what we should be on about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That people can still continue to be so short-sighted and single-minded as to insist that either Badgerys Creek or Holsworthy are reasonable options for an international airport faced with what information we have is not only frustrating but downright dangerous. It is an admission they do not care about inflicting an environmental disaster on a section of the Australian population which has already borne and continues to bear more than its fair share of social and environmental inequities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Goulburn has the capacity for site development as the airport's demand grows in the future. Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy do not. Goulburn has none of the population pressures associated with Badgerys Creek or Holsworthy. Goulburn is a safer environmental alternative than either Badgerys Creek or Holsworthy. Goulburn can be operated 24 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hours a day without the devastating effects that such an operation would have on the people surrounding Badgerys Creek or Holsworthy. Lastly&mdash;and this is really the killer point&mdash;Goulburn, as a site for Sydney's second international airport, has the widespread public approval of people living in the city of Goulburn. Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An airport at Goulburn would mean jobs, infrastructure and economic development for the people of the Southern Highlands, just as the very fast train would mean the same. If the government can consider Holsworthy, one of the least attractive options in the original 1985 EIS, when faced with the information we now have and faced with the population and pollution problems that besiege us now in Sydney, then surely it can show enough judgment to carry out another EIS into the Goulburn site&mdash;an EIS based on the premise that the very fast train service will be in operation by the time the airport is finally built.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time as an EIS is being carried out on Goulburn we should look into the capacity of the very fast train to act as the main conduit for passengers and freight between the airport there and Sydney. The very fast train project has received warm approval from both sides of politics at state and federal levels. Now all we need is the political will and the political courage to take the next steps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I may be accused of parochialism in my stance on Badgerys Creek, but once again I make it clear to this House that I am just as vehemently opposed to an international airport being built at Holsworthy. I expect to be accused of being a NIMBY by the same people who have the small-mindedness to insist that an airport at Badgerys Creek or Holsworthy can fly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want not only what is best for my community but what is best for Sydney and what is best for our region as a whole. Can those who follow me speaking on this motion today say the same? Not only do I not want an airport in my backyard, I do not want an airport in the backyards of the members for Werriwa (Mr Latham), Hughes (Mrs Vale) or <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6408"> Banks (Mr Melham). I want an international airport where it should go&mdash;outside the Sydney basin, where it will alleviate the concerns of my constituents and the concerns of the constituents of the members for Grayndler (Mr Albanese), Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton) and Barton (Mr McClelland), just to name a few.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An airport at Goulburn built in conjunction with the very fast train is a win-win situation. It will avoid the further environmental degradation of our biggest city while injecting a much needed economic shot in the arm for the Southern Highlands. Why can we not see that? Why are we just so short-sighted in this regard?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Goulburn is the place for an international airport 25 to 50 years down the track&mdash;not just for the Olympics, not just for the short term. Forty&hyphen;five minutes is a short time now. In 25 or 50 years time it will be even less. In 25 to 50 years time Goulburn will be less of a satellite city to Sydney than it is now becoming. It will be an outlying suburb, for goodness sake. In 25 to 50 years we will be patting ourselves on the back for having the foresight and the fortitude not only to make the hard decisions, but to make the right decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this House we talk about leaving economic debts to our children. Let us not leave them the environmental and social debts of our actions by making a mistake over our choice for Sydney's second airport. We have made too many errors on airports over the years. Let us not repeat this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call on all members concerned with this issue to join in the spirit of bipartisanship that has entered this House over the last few days, especially with the previous debate with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). Let us put away the political knives. Let us take off the blinkers and inject some clear thinking and reason into this debate while we still have the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why I have said in the motion I have moved that, if we are going to take any account of where a future airport in this great nation should be sited, particularly in the state of New South Wales, then let us give consideration to where growth is going to be, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> where environmentally it will be a sound a decision and, most importantly, where the people of the area would welcome it and we will not be forever polluting the Sydney basin, which now has reached its capacity.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The underlying intention of the motion moved by the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) is, without doubt, to limit Sydney to the one international airport&mdash;that is, KSA&mdash;which will soon be approaching maximum capacity. I am astonished that the honourable member for Prospect was able to get this motion through her caucus. At least I am assuming that she got the motion through caucus. If she has done it without caucus approval, then I expect all her Labor colleagues whose electorates are currently noise affected to publicly dissociate themselves from this motion. If not, then I will make sure that their constituents know of their acquiescence to this motion that is intended to limit Sydney to one international airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is the case that the honourable member put this forward without caucus approval, I would expect the ALP members whose electorates are noise affected to rebuke their colleague the honourable member for Prospect as part of their contribution to this debate. No matter whether the former or the latter is the case, the fact is that the Labor members on the other side will definitely have to be into each other about this motion. It will be a very interesting half hour indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that this parliament notes, once again, the fact that half a million Sydney residents, if not more, are being subjected to intolerable levels of aircraft noise and pollution because of the prevarication for more than 10 years by the former Labor government in getting on with the task of building a new international airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More than 10 years ago, the Hawke government selected Badgerys Creek as the site for the new international airport. I will not go into all the details in the short space of time <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6409"> available to me. However, what I will say is that the bumbling delays by the former government would be almost comical were it not such a serious matter affecting the health and wellbeing of more than half a million Sydney residents who have continued to suffer and who, regrettably, will have to continue to suffer because a new Sydney international airport is still some years away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government is getting on with the job of selecting the most suitable site and building the new airport as soon as possible, as soon as feasible. The land at Badgerys Creek has now been purchased and Badgerys Creek remains the government's preferred site subject to a satisfactory EIS. The land at Holsworthy is Commonwealth property and the government has actioned a parallel EIS for Holsworthy in the event that the EIS for Badgerys Creek proves to be unsatisfactory for whatever reason. Both EISs will be transparent and in keeping with the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work on the two EISs is well advanced and the cost is very substantial&mdash;some $21 million has been allocated in this year's budget.</PARA>

It is therefore astounding that the honourable member for Prospect comes into this parliament and puts forward the motion we are now debating, which is intended to cause further delays in the choice of, and commencement of the building of, the new international airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Prospect plucks a place out of the air and says, `Why not a new international airport at, say, Goulburn?' Why does the honourable member stop at Goulburn? Why not throw in Wilton, Richmond, Newcastle and Wollongong? I have rarely come across such confused thinking <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and continual shooting from the hip as the honourable member for Prospect has exhibited and continues to exhibit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 29 May in this House, the honourable member said, `I am particularly concerned by the announcement that a second EIS will be done.' These are her exact words taken out of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. Four months later, she gets up in this place and says, `Never mind a second EIS. I want a third EIS, as well&mdash;and you pay for it, and pick Goulburn as an example!'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Prospect seems to be claiming an expertise in the issue of picking a suitable airport site or, at the very least, she knew or she should have known that Goulburn was considered in 1985 with nine other sites but was quickly rejected as unsuitable for several reasons, not the least of which was its great distance from Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member mentions in a motion that a very fast train service will solve the distance problems to Sydney. What she does not say is that the cost of the VFT is in the vicinity of $2&half; billion&mdash;that is $2,500 million. On top of all that, she says absolutely nothing of the cost involved for that return trip from Sydney to Goulburn&mdash;in the vicinity of $170 per person return. A family of three will have to pay more than $500 to see someone off and to come back to Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Additionally, the honourable member knew or should have known the fact, as was stated when Goulburn was looked at as a possible site, that the Goulburn area is fogbound for 50 days of the year. In other words, if there is to be an international airport&mdash;which just will not happen in Goulburn&mdash;she will be restricting the use of Goulburn airport by one-seventh of the year because it is fogbound.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that, if Goulburn were picked, it would quickly fall into disuse. The airlines just will not go there, for all the reasons that I have mentioned. That will cause a tremendous pressure to fall on Sydney airport which has a cap now of 80 movements a hour. The pressure will be such that a government, no matter what government, will have to consider lifting the cap, otherwise Sydney airport will just close down. How many movements an hour at Sydney airport does the honourable member for Prospect want&mdash;80, 100, 120, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6410"> 160? Is that what she wants to subject the people of Sydney to?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that, if Goulburn were to be picked as the second international airport, the pressure of these delays on Sydney airport&mdash;if it were to be considered, after which no doubt it will be rejected&mdash;will force Sydney airport into being a 24&hyphen;hour airport, otherwise we in Sydney will not be able to cope. That is just unacceptable to the residents of Sydney. The honourable member for Prospect has not thought through the implications of her motion. I am certain that members of both sides of the House will treat this motion with the disdain it deserves.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Mitchell scoffs at the idea that under this government there will be a 10-year delay in the construction of the second airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) throws his head back with surprise. But what he should do right now is march up to the office of the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, Mrs Bishop, and ask her why she issued the following letter to a constituent of mine who resides in Minto Heights. That constituent was writing to the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel asking, if the government were to proceed with an airport at Holsworthy, what would happen to the $30 million construction <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the new army hospital at Holsworthy&mdash;a hospital that has been relocated out of Ingleburn in my electorate to the electorate of the member for Hughes (Mrs Vale). This is what the office of the minister replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Holsworthy is selected as the site for the second airport, then the hospital would be relocated.</PARA>
<PARA>She went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This would not be necessary until the airport was operational, which would not be for about 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA>There it is from a minister in this Howard government, saying to one of my constituents that, if the airport is to be built at Holsworthy and the hospital needs to be relocated, it will not happen `until the airport was operational, which would not be for about 10 years'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a 10-year delay under this government in the construction of the second airport. So, if the member for Lowe has a concern about aircraft noise for his constituents, if he has a concern about aircraft noise around Mascot, he should go back to his constituents and tell them that there will be no relief under the policies of the Howard government for 10 years and the source of that is the office of one of the ministers who has responsibility. The Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, who has all those Holsworthy considerations on her plate, has announced in this letter, which I will seek leave to table, that the second airport will not be built for 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During that decade there will be time to have another five studies into Holsworthy, another five studies into Goulburn and another five studies or more into Richmond. With a 10-year delay, there is time for study after study after study. So why the rush to put the fix on to have this airport constructed at Holsworthy in the electorate of the member for Hughes or, in the event of the government still being keen, at Badgerys Creek? Why the rush? Why the haste? Why the fix to do all this so quickly if you have a minister out of her office announcing that it will be 10 years until it is built?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I challenge the member for Lowe to take this letter back and letterbox it throughout his electorate and surrounding constituencies to let them know that government policy is not to build the second airport for a decade. I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6411"> challenge the member for Hughes, who is in the chamber, to take this letter to her constituents and ask why there is a need for an EIS within the next six months if the airport will not be operational for another 10 years. Why the rush into Holsworthy if government policy is not to do anything about this for 10 years? I challenge the member for North Sydney to go back to his consultative committee&mdash;his gerrymandered, rigged consultative committee&mdash;and ask them how serious the government is to do something about aircraft noise in the inner city, when Mrs Bishop has announced in this letter to my constituent that nothing will change for a decade?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mismanagement, the cant, the hypocrisy, the misguided fools on the government side who cannot get their thinking and their policy straight on this issue! This is, of course, a government led by someone who conned the people of Holsworthy. There was a 12-month debate about aircraft noise in Sydney, and not for a moment did the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) mention, in a word or a whisper, Holsworthy. A few weeks after the election, all of a sudden there is the need for an EIS into Holsworthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Prospect has put the very sensible proposition: if it is good enough for Holsworthy, it is good enough for Goulburn. If it is good enough for Holsworthy, it is good enough for the other eight sites that were considered in 1986. There is no rush; there is no fast tracking. We have 10 years to get this right, under the schedule announced by Mrs Bishop. So the motion is a good one in the context of this government's delays.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it somewhat ironic that the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has got up to second the motion put forward by the member for Prospect. The old right&hyphen;wing mates are coming in again saying, `We're standing right behind you when it counts,' in exactly the same way the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton), the former member for Barton and the other right&hyphen;wing mates stood right behind the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) and his predecessor and the member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin) when it came to the new flight paths over Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They put the flight paths, they put the planes, over the people who vote Labor in the first instance, not the people who vote Liberal. They did them over. This is a classic case of an issue where the right wing of the Australian Labor Party is doing over the left wing of the Australian Labor Party in factional battles.

<PARA>Before I speak to the motion, I would like to mention Abdul Jannil Albaf at whose initiative the Kuwait&hyphen;Australia Parliamentary Friendship Group was formed. I congratulate Abdul on his efforts to keep us up to date on developments in Kuwait and to ensure that the plight of the Kuwaiti people, still suffering from Iraq's aggression, is not forgotten.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Long after war is over the horror continues. The horror of the Gulf War is still vivid around the globe, nowhere more than in the homes of thousands of Kuwaitis, but the aftermath of Saddam Hussein's aggression is far reaching and tragic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The United States authorities are only now trying to track down 20,000 US soldiers who unknowingly may have been exposed to Iraq's chemical weapons during the war. The Kurdish people in northern Iraq are still literally fighting for their very existence. Many Iraqi civilians continue to mourn the loss of loved ones and suffer under Saddam Hussein's oppressive regime; but, as I said, nowhere is the pain of the aftermath of Iraq's aggression felt more than in the homes of the Kuwaiti families whose fathers, sons and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> brothers have simply vanished&mdash;vanished because the Iraq government refuses to comply with UN resolutions 686 and 687 and disclose their fate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During their retreat in February 1991, the Iraqis took several thousand Kuwaiti prisoners and used them as a human shield. Many were later released, but there are about 630 Kuwaitis who have not been accounted for. The Kuwaiti people will continue to suffer for as long as the Iraqi government refuses to disclose either the fate or the location of these innocent people. They remain prisoners of war held by Iraq, and it is now 5&half; years since the fighting in the gulf ended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point I think it is appropriate to allude to Australia's involvement in the Gulf War. We committed Royal Australian Navy warships and supply vessels to the gulf in 1990. We openly condemned the invasion of Kuwait and the taking of hostages by the Iraqis. Following the liberation of Kuwait, Australian Defence Force personnel took part in mines disposal and Australian companies contributed to the postwar reconstruction of Kuwait. We must continue to offer support, continue to condemn Iraq for its actions and seek the release of these innocent Kuwaitis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no hesitation in moving this motion condemning the government of Iraq and particularly Saddam Hussein for his continued aggression against the Kuwaiti people. I believe the hypocrisy of Saddam Hussein and his government has never been fully exposed. Only this month&mdash;again, 5&half; years after the Iraqis were forced to retreat from the sovereign nation of Kuwait&mdash;Iraq has told the UN that economic sanctions threaten its society with a horrendous disaster that may lead to its collapse and has accused the United States of attempting genocide. In a memorandum to UN Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Iraq claimed that the economic sanctions which ban the export of all and import of most goods except food, medicine and humanitarian items were part of a US plot to cripple Iraq. The memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Iraq holds the United States fully responsible for the sufferings of the Iraqi people through its insistence on maintaining the economic embargo . . . there is no room for doubt that the United <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6414"> States is intentionally endeavouring to annihilate the Iraqi people.</PARA>
<PARA>It added:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the civilised world has determined that genocide, whether committed in time of peace or war, is a crime under international law that must be prevented and punished.</PARA>
<PARA>Iraq is claiming that the sanctions are no longer justified since it has discharged its obligations under the relevant Security Council resolutions. Iraq is yet to satisfy a special UN commission that it has provided all details of its weapons programs. Let us not forget that it has failed to meet the requirements of the two UN resolutions I referred to earlier and disclose the fate or location of the Kuwaiti POWs. We must not forget these POWs. This House should urge the international community to pressure Iraq to ensure the safe return of these 360 innocent Kuwaitis to their homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Too often our focus on international incidents is limited to that which the media of the day deems newsworthy or good copy. Often we as governments and nations are prompted into action by overseas news reports of famine and war, but as each new atrocity is exposed governments and people unintentionally shift their focus. Let us not forget, therefore, the Gulf War, which was sparked by Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. Let us not forget the horrendous crimes which were committed by the Iraqi soldiers under the direction of Saddam Hussein. I quote George Bush in March 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Newborn babies, thrown out of incubators and the incubators then shipped off to Baghdad. Dialysis patients, ripped from their machines and those machines then too, sent off to Baghdad. The story of two young kids passing out leaflets&mdash;Iraqi troops rounded up their parents and made them watch while these two kids were shot dead, executed, before their eyes.</PARA>
<PARA>George Bush went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hitler revisited, but remember, when Hitler's war ended, there were the Nuremburg trials.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, let us not forget the Kuwaitis still being held as prisoners of war by Iraqi forces. I urge the parliament to support this motion.</PARA>

I always remember my old Irish grandmother was in a terrible state, and the fact that he was missing was more of a blow to her and caused more anguish in the family than the fact that nobody was aware of what became of him. It is the same with these people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Iraq is playing a silly war of nerves with Kuwait at the present time. On numerous occasions they have said that those people do not exist, and yet at other times they say, `Yes, they do exist, but not in the numbers that you say.' To add more confusion to the matter, in December last year, for some <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6415"> unknown reason, they released to Kuwait the dead body of one of the prisoners listed. On the one hand, they deny that prisoners exist; and the next thing is that they deliver the body of a prisoner who died in detention. And as recently as 15 May this year they actually released one prisoner. Confusion has been caused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, Saddam Hussein is still smarting over the terrible hiding he got from Kuwait and her associate countries during the war. Of course, we should all be proud of the fact that Australia was involved in that terrible war.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that even as recently as 16 October 1996, at a meeting in Geneva regarding the missing people of the Kuwaiti war, the Iraqi delegation did not know anything. This is the stock answer that they keep giving. So it is confusion all round. Obviously, those people are there somewhere, and some of the information from people who have escaped from Iraq over the last four to five years has confirmed that yes, there are Kuwaiti prisoners of war there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Getting information is not always easy, and that is where I would like to give my congratulations to Abdul Jannil Albaf. As the chairman of our committee meant to say, he formed the Kuwait&hyphen;Australia Friendship Group in Australia. Through association with that group, I became friendly with him and he encouraged me to form the parliamentary group of the same name here in Canberra, of which I was the inaugural chairman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without people like Abdul Jannil we would not get any information at all. He has been a great source of information to both myself and the group. A couple of years ago he initiated a program whereby Australian parliamentarians went to Kuwait to see first-hand the damage done to the country by the vandals from Iraq. That was a very good trip which was arranged by Abdul Jannil. He was also instrumental in inviting Sheikh Salem, who is now the Deputy Prime Minister and defence minister of Kuwait, to Australia 18 months to two years ago; and that was a very successful trip.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Personally, I think that Saddam Hussein should not be let off the hook under any circumstances whatsoever in his obligations <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to conform to the United Nations sanctions. As a matter of fact, we have gone a long way in allowing Iraq to sell some oil to alleviate some of the poverty in his country, but that is as far as we should go. As parliamentarians in Australia and as friends of Kuwait in the friendship group, we should never miss an opportunity to inform everybody we can through the world on our visits overseas of our position. When delegations visit Australia, we should never miss an opportunity to advise world politicians, and anybody who is willing to listen, of our position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the parliament would be aware, every year we have two parliamentarians attending the United Nations sessions in New York for a three&hyphen;month period. This year we have from the government the Hon. Bruce Reid and from the opposition the Hon. Ralph Willis, two very prominent politicians in Australia. I took the opportunity to advise them on the up-to-date situation in Kuwait and pleaded with them, while they were in New York, to lobby anybody that was in easy reach of them and to inform them of Australia's point of view. I also asked them to point out to anybody who might lobby for Saddam Hussein Iraq's responsibilities in conforming to the UN resolutions that have been passed on him over the past four years. I take great pleasure in seconding this motion and recommend it to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with the strongest conviction that I rise to support this motion put forward by the member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) and seconded by the member for Fowler (Mr Ted Grace). I certainly commend them both for their action in this matter. Most of the world deplored the actions of the government in Baghdad for its 1990 act of aggression against Kuwait, and having visited Kuwait after its liberation I was still amazed at the wilful destruction that had taken place. It is a credit to the government of Kuwait that, in a short space of time, it has been able to restore most of the damage that was done and thus enable its citizens to continue their lives as they would wish, even allowing for the continuing threat of the regime in Iraq.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6416">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In September this year the actions of Saddam Hussein in attacking the minority Kurd groups in the safe haven set up after the 1990 conflict brought about quick retaliation from the United States. The most recent incident was reported overnight with the revelation that a United States F16 fighter fired a missile at an Iraqi anti&hyphen;aircraft battery whose radar started tracking the plane while it patrolled an allied no&hyphen;fly zone over southern Iraq. The incident occurred south&hyphen;east of Kut&hyphen;al&hyphen;Hayy, which is between the 32nd and 33rd parallels. It has been some time now since the invasion of Kuwait by the Iraqis under Saddam Hussein took place and still little is known of the fate of the 625 Kuwaitis taken by the invaders as prisoners of war.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in December 1994 following a visit to Kuwait, it is important that Australia, as a middle order democracy, continues to join other nations of the world in seeking the release of those Kuwaiti detainees. While ever since their capture the Iraqis have denied the existence of those prisoners, there is a strong rumour that in talks between Iraq and Jordan comments have been made by the Iraqis that would indicate they admit to having Kuwaiti prisoners. How much information has been conveyed in these discussions is uncertain, but at least it gives some hope that the Iraqis are now prepared to talk about the existence of the prisoners. Possibly in the near future negotiations may be instigated, even if they are through a broker like the Jordanian government, to have them released at an early date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very interesting thing about Kuwait is that it is the only Gulf state that presently has a form of democracy. It allows the people of Kuwait to have a say in the process of government and Kuwait, under His Highness the Emir, is a leader in this regard not only in the Middle East but in the wider world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Sheik Salem Sabah Al&hyphen;Salem Al&hyphen;Sabah on his elevation to the office of Deputy Prime Minister of Kuwait and Minister for Defence following the recent Kuwaiti elections. Over the years and in various capacities, he has been a wonderful advocate for Kuwait and few people have worked harder <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for the release of the Kuwaiti detainees than Sheik Salem. Sheik Salem is highly regarded not only within Kuwait but within the wider forum of the Middle East and other parts of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like also to mention Mr Abdul Jalil Albaf, who is well known to many people in this parliament on both sides of the House, particularly those in the Australia&hyphen;Kuwait Parliamentary Friendship Group. Mr Albaf has been a constant promoter of contact between Australia and Kuwait in both cultural and trade terms. For a long period, with the former government and now with the present coalition government, he has pressed for an air transport agreement between Australia and Kuwait.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the coalition government was elected, Mr Albaf has had meetings with the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) and, more recently, with the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) on all occasions promoting Australian&hyphen;Kuwait relationships. Mr Albaf has also played a key role in informing members of the Australian parliament of the 625 Kuwaiti prisoners of war and is always reminding us of the impact their incarceration has had on a nation whose population is approximately only 1.4 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The political situation in the Middle East is very complex, and I am aware those politics are not confined to that part of the world. However, I cannot understand how a nation like Iraq that has the potential for wealth, for providing a higher standard of living and quality of life for its people, can have a leadership so intent on committing aggression. This leadership has led to disaster for the people of Iraq, including its minority groups, has caused great suffering to its neighbour, Kuwait, and has also added to the instability of the Middle East.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I strongly support the motion put forward by the honourable member for Fairfax today. I urge not only members and senators of the Australian parliament to keep up their campaign to have the Kuwaiti prisoners of war released but also the international community, especially through the UN, to press for their speedy release.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to speak on the motion on Iraq. I might just correct my good friend the member for Fowler (Mr Ted Grace). I thought it was Kuwait, not Iraq, that the member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) said but, nonetheless, we will not argue over a minor detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I may, I will make an observation: not quite five years ago we were in this chamber for two days debating Australia's involvement in the Gulf War. That was a significant debate because for the first time in many years we were sending Australian troops&mdash;Australian servicemen and servicewomen&mdash;to a foreign place to participate in a conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, we were faced with the prospect that, for the first time in a major conflict, there could have been the use of chemical weapons. I am sure that played on the minds of a lot of members when they debated the matter at that time. Here we are five years or so later speaking on the same matter to all intents and purposes and still seeing the continued aggression against the people of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein and the government of Iraq.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, tomorrow is the United States presidential election and, of course, we have seen George Bush participate in the election campaign. I am sure that to his dying day George Bush will say one of his greatest disappointments, probably his greatest failure, was the fact the allies failed to destroy the regime of Saddam Hussein when they forced his troops out of Kuwait and back into Iraqi territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly wish to condemn the flagrant violations of human rights by the government of Iraq, which is continuing to illegally hold hundreds of Kuwaiti citizens as prisoners of war since its abortive invasion in 1990. It has been over four years since the conclusion of the military operations in the land and air campaign in the Gulf War, and we do well to question what we have achieved. Saddam Hussein is still in power, still threatening his neighbour and still threatening and oppressing his own citizens&mdash;and, for that matter, murdering his own citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Kuwait is now free from Iraqi occupation. That is true. Oil is now flowing to the economies of the world that have become so de pendent on it, and a message has been sent to all aggressors about the limits to which the international community will tolerate aggression and violence against, in particular, the small, apparently defenceless nation of Kuwait.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are, however, some negative effects that arise and may grow so that they diminish all the positive elements achieved in the Gulf War unless they are addressed. The first thing is that Saddam Hussein continues to threaten his neighbours, including Kuwait, despite international condemnation and sanctions. This must constitute the greatest failure of the pre-war, war and post-war policies of not only the United States but also all the allies. The Iraqi nuclear, chemical and biological arsenal has not been destroyed and, by some accounts, continues to grow. It remains a significant threat, not just to the region but to all nations on this planet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Iraq continues to hold an estimated 625 prisoners of war, taken during its abortive invasion. Iraq does this despite international condemnation and sanctions. As has been indicated by the member for Fowler on other occasions, the number of prisoners is a substantial tragedy for Kuwait. On a per capita basis, it would be equivalent to 15,000 Australian, 50,000 British or 220,000 American citizens being held by Iraq. I cannot emphasise enough the enormity of this tragedy to a small nation like Kuwait.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia played a very important role in the international efforts to reclaim Kuwait. It is a role of which we can be justifiably proud. We must remember, however, that the job is not finished, and it will not be completed until Saddam Hussein's ability to threaten his neighbours with impunity is destroyed, the Iraqi nuclear, chemical and biological arsenal is destroyed, and all Kuwaiti prisoners of war are returned safely to their homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must recognise that, unless we are able to carry this issue with Kuwait and Iraq through to its proper conclusion, we will indirectly contribute to the ongoing tragedy. Further, we expose other nations and other people around the world to the risk posed by aggressors who may be encouraged by any <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6418"> failure to deal with Saddam Hussein or the government of Iraq.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I join the other speakers in their condemnation and call on the international community, through its representatives at the UN, to increase their efforts to achieve a lasting solution to the aggression of Iraq against its neighbours and to ensure the safe and speedy return of all prisoners of war held by the government of Iraq.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The maintenance of a viable car and components manufacturing industry is essential to Australia's manufacturing future and absolutely critical to the economic survival of the Geelong region, which I represent in this parliament. The car industry is at the core of Australia's manufacturing activity. It is a driver for other key manufacturing industries, such as glass, chemicals, plastics and steel. It makes an important contribution to skills formation and world best practice manufacturing. It is a significant vehicle for research and development and for the application of new manufacturing technologies and is a critical contributor to the survival of regional economies such as Geelong and others across the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of the automotive industry to Geelong cannot be understated. Geelong's largest private employer, Ford, employs 2,800 people at its Geelong operation, and its suppliers employ a further 1,000. According to Ford's submission to the Productivity Commission, its work force generates $136.5 million in wages and salaries to the local economy, and the automotive sector accounts for 25 per cent of manufacturing employment in Geelong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The city has had to bear a heavy burden in social and economic terms from past structur al adjustments to this industry. It has done that in the hope that the creation of an efficient, productive and best practice manufacturing facility in Geelong would guarantee the economic survival of the city beyond the year 2000. To put it simply, the closure of Ford would have a devastating effect on all private businesses in Geelong and would create an industrial wasteland that would stifle economic development of the region for the next two decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the federal government announced the Button plan in 1984, it set out several objectives for the industry. One major objective was to increase efficiency across the industry to enable it to compete with imports and in the international marketplace at lower levels of government assistance. Another was to provide better quality cars to consumers at lower prices. These objectives were to be achieved by a combination of gradual tariff reductions, better economies of scale through rationalisation, and productivity and quality improvements through massive investments in new technology and human resources. Today the overall success of the Button plan in achieving these objectives is not in dispute. However, that success has not come without considerable cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry has registered significant increases in productivity. For example, by 1995 labour productivity in car manufacturing was 47 per cent higher than in 1988. The quality of Australian cars has improved dramatically, and efficiency gains have enabled Australian manufacturers to compete successfully in key car categories. Two important car manufacturers&mdash;Ford and GMH&mdash;have returned to profitability after several difficult years, with all four manufacturers committing investments of around $2 billion in new models and plant upgrades. In addition, exports from the car and components industry have increased from around $383 million in 1984 to over $1.7 billion today, with the most promising increases coming from the car components industry, reflecting price and quality improvements all the way down the supply chain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite these advances, there has been a significant drop in employment in the car and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6419"> components industry, from 63,000 in 1985 to around 45,000 in 1995. Total output of vehicles has fallen from 383,000 in 1985 to around 286,000 in 1995. This falling local output has been accompanied by increased import penetration of the Australian market, to the point where imported vehicles now make up 50 per cent of the passenger car market and nearly 100 per cent of the commercial vehicle market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today the Australian car manufacturing industry faces a unique set of challenges, having come through a period of restructuring, and having cemented its place as an efficient producer of quality products in our extremely competitive global trading environment. The entrance of Australia into the global automotive market is a reflection of the fact that Australia can now supply to the world cars and components at a competitive price and quality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, at this point in its manufacturing history, the industry finds that its future does not just lie in its own internal capacity to become more efficient and productive. Its future will be shaped by the further globalisation of the industry along with Australia's trade liberalisation commitments and by the car industry assistance arrangements that will be set in place for the industry beyond 2000 by the Australian government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is these industry assistance arrangements that I wish to address in this House today. The Howard government must make a strong commitment to the preservation of a viable car and component manufacturing industry in Australia. Fortunately, the electoral defeat of the Liberal Party in the 1993 election forced upon the current government an abandonment of its near zero tariff policy and an acceptance of a base level of tariff assistance of 15 per cent by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we know that Fightback is alive and well in this government and in its disposition to accept dry economic advice from its economic rationalist advisory bodies, such as the Productivity Commission, which is now considering the future of the industry. Indeed, the Productivity Commission inquiry process is quite irrelevant to the car industry's situation today and what the government must do <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to ensure the car industry's survival in Australia's trading environment beyond the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is simply this. Firstly, the globalisation of Australia's car industry means that critical investment decisions on its future are made by international car companies in a global context. They must be sent a clear signal by the Australian government that it wants a car and component manufacturing presence in Australia. Secondly, it is clear that the long-term survival of the industry is linked to the expanding of its export capacity, and that is inextricably linked to gaining access to new markets, particularly in Asia. The international trading environment of the Australian car industry will be increasingly hostile in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of our Asian and APEC trading partners have both tariff and extensive non-tariff mechanisms in place to protect their automotive industries and to foster further industry development. For example, Malaysia imposes tariff levels of up to 200 per cent, Indonesia 100 per cent, South Africa 61 per cent and India 50 per cent, while Taiwan imposes a ban on vehicle imports from Australia. Our traditional trading partners in western Europe and the USA have voluntary trade restraint agreements with their major trading partner, Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, if every other country in the world provides some degree of assistance to support their car industry as a core manufacturing industry, why should Australia be any different? To successfully retain a viable car industry presence in Australia, the government must provide an industry assistance regime that will stimulate market demand for locally produced cars in the short term and expand exports so that the production of Australian cars can return to historically viable levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be naive of me to suggest that a Liberal government, wedded still to Fightback and Thatcher experiments in industry policy, would alter the current phase&hyphen;down of tariff levels to 15 per cent by the year 2000. But it should call a halt to any further tariff reductions at 15 per cent by 2000 and link any further tariff cuts to substantial actual reductions in tariff and non-tariff barriers by our <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6420"> trading partners whose markets Australian manufacturers seek to access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To create a viable domestic market, the government needs to lower current taxes and charges, such as sales tax, to effectively stimulate demand for Australian cars and to seek ways of overcoming the old age of the Australian car park. The government must also provide appropriate support for the industry's efforts to export and restore its incentives to invest and engage in research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that the industry's great success in recent years has been due to the massive skilling of its work force, the development of a new workplace culture and the application of advanced manufacturing technologies. The government must make sure that this process continues and that management is included in the skilling process. It must ensure that the current export facilitation scheme continues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This industry's future does not lie in the zero tariff rhetoric of Fightback or in an obsessive preoccupation with micro&hyphen;economic reform and labour market deregulation to guarantee its future. The great gains of this industry have been achieved by redefining the workplace culture and in extensive cooperation between management and progressive unions. Its future lies in a practical realistic framework of industry assistance that continues enterprise improvement, builds upon the great skills of the work force and provides a secure level of tariff protection which sends the signal to car companies that they are welcome in Australia's manufacturing environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this industry were to close down, it would cause a loss of direct employment in the car and components industry of around 22,000 with devastating consequences for key manufacturing regions such as Geelong, and it would cause a massive blow-out of the automotive trade deficit to $11 billion at a time when the government is making great play of the necessity to reduce the nation's current account deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the Australian government and the community cannot let this situation happen. So I challenge the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) to come out and support <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Geelong's car industry with a clear, unequivocal commitment to the preservation of car manufacturing in our city. The people of Geelong remember that the member for Corangamite and the Geelong branch of the Liberal Party were strong supporters of the Hewson zero tariff policy&mdash;a policy which would have seen the stagnation and demise of car and component manufacturing in Geelong. It is clear that if that policy had prevailed in 1993 Ford would not have made the $1 billion investment in its Australian operations in 1995 and Geelong would not have a car manufacturing facility. If he does not, all of Geelong will know that the spots on the Corangamite leopard have not changed since 1993. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance today is with the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), who has unleashed in our nation a debate which is on the one hand laudable and on the other abominable. I will make clear the differentiation between the two in my remarks today. Of the many issues she has raised, I wish to address in my brief time, firstly, multicultural and Aboriginal affairs and, secondly, immigration. Let me say at the outset that I believe deeply and passionately in the philosophical concept of freedom of speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Among those basic rights which I hold dear to the foundation of a democratic society are freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of assembly and freedom of religion. Foremost among those is freedom of speech, for if the state or others take from us our inherent right to express freely our views, our opinions, our thoughts and even our prejudices we become a society of oppression where the views of the many are dictated by the few. Woodrow Wilson once said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have always been amongst those who believe that the greatest freedom was the greatest safety, because if a man is a fool the best thing to do is to encourage him to advertise the fact by speaking. It  cannot be so easily discovered if you allow him to remain silent and look wise. But if you let him <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6421"> speak the secret is out the world knows that he is a fool.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Charles James Fox said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Opinions only become dangerous to a state only when persecution makes it necessary for the people to communicate their ideas under a bond of secrecy.</PARA>
<PARA>Lewis D. Brandeis, in a concurring opinion in Whitney v. California in 1927, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fear of serious injury cannot alone justify suppression of free speech and assembly. Men feared witches and burned them. It is a function of speech to free men from the bondage of irrational fears.</PARA>
<PARA>While I champion the right of free men and women to assemble, join and practise whatever religion they will and speak openly and freely, it is important to recognise that those freedoms come with a price, which is responsibility. If our speaking would hurt or harm others, then we must learn to moderate our speaking in support of a cohesive and tolerant society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am told by a learned friend that witches can dance around raindrops. But rather than viewing that dance as a marvellous ability which they did not possess, men and women, through fear and ignorance, burned witches at the stake. While we now live in more enlightened times, it seems we still have need to guard against fear, ignorance and intolerance where such attitudes bring hurt to others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In reflecting on the community debate in Australia today following some overly publicised comments by the member for Oxley, I think we are having two debates. The first, which is about race, creed, culture and religion&mdash;in fact, difference&mdash;seems to me to be through lack of tolerance based on fear and lack of understanding. The second is, I think, a genuine intellectual debate about, firstly, how best to help those of us who from whatever circumstances cannot or will not without community help lift themselves from positions of deprivation and, secondly, the level, but not the composition of, immigration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Former American President, Abraham Lincoln, in his famous Gettysburg Address, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure.</PARA>
<PARA>Our nation of Australia was, of course, conceived at a different time and in different circumstances, but we have never been any less committed to the democratic concept that all men, and indeed all women, are created equal. Lincoln's question was answered in the affirmative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley has said that a truly multicultural country can never be strong or united. She has also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the member for Oxley is just plain wrong. Our nation is a nation of immigrants, even including, tens of thousands of years ago, our Aboriginal citizens. I am an immigrant, as are many of my colleagues who are representatives of the people in this House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that Australia has become one of the greatest melting pots, if not the greatest, of the world's humanity and that we have done it better than any other nation on earth. We have managed to bring together cultures, creeds and ethnicities from all points of the globe without the racial and religious intolerance and hatred leading to violence and physical acts of desecration which are so prevalent in so many other and older societies in both the developed and the developing world. Any debate which denies that fact is just plain wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand that many in our community feel insecurity because of change to the largest extent forced on us by a rapidly changing world&mdash;change we can no more ignore than we could walk to the moon. Too high levels of unemployment help feed that insecurity. But immigration has built this nation and immigration has provided jobs, not taken them away. Fear of difference and fear by individuals of being unable to control events outside themselves always make it easy to blame others for our particular circumstances. But fearing people who look different, speak differently or dress differently is addressed by education and tolerance, not bigotry or racism. I have said before in this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6422"> place that I grew up in one of the most racist societies on earth, but I grew up to deplore the intolerance and belief in superiority of one race over another. Adolf Hitler fanned underlying fear, greed and hatred to bring on the Second World War and the Holocaust. His views of racial superiority failed the test, and so they should.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the second of my major issues today, I think the member for Oxley has kicked along a debate we are starting to have, which I have described as an intellectual debate, on how best to help those in our society who today we term `disadvantaged'. It is a reasoned and rational debate which has surrounded modern concepts of the welfare state for a very long time. In recent years it has become all too frequently the habit of those who believe in an ever expanding safety net to denigrate those of differing views as heartless, unthinking, racist or lacking in sympathy and understanding. It is a political correctness argument. In my view it is intellectually sustainable to argue that increasing social welfare can lead to increasing dependence and that dependence breeds upon itself, locking those encompassed by it into a life void of happiness, ambition or fulfilment because of that dependence. The member for Oxley has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The majority of Aboriginals do not want handouts because they realise welfare is killing them.</PARA>
<PARA>I suspect that is not true. I believe that we have a compelling need to help our Aboriginal brothers and sisters lift themselves through effective education, urgent attention to demonstrably poor health outcomes and dramatically improving their access to an acceptable standard of housing. It is not only appropriate but also incumbent on us to do everything possible to help those in our society who are in need and to give them a chance to help themselves. How we go about this is a legitimate debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But to argue that Aboriginals, particularly those in regional and outback Australia, are not the most disadvantaged of our citizens is an absolute nonsense. The member for Oxley has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To survive in peace and harmony, united and strong, we must have one people, one nation, one flag.  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>At first glance, that sounds like the ultimate national motherhood statement, but if it is code that we must all be the same to meet that objective, then the honourable member misses the boat well and truly. We will never be all the same. Trying to put us into boxes defined by race, creed, colour, hairstyle or dress is both impractical and undesirable. It is our differences that make us learn, think, expand and grow&mdash;and that, my colleagues, is for the good of us all. Mark Twain said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is by the goodness of God that in our country we have those three unspeakably precious things: freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, and the prudence never to practice either of them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this grievance debate to express my concern about events in recent months. I would like to start by quoting from an article by Peter Robinson in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun&hyphen;Herald</EMPHASIS> :</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we have seen reflected in the mirror of the past few weeks is a nation that is lost. Its pride and self&hyphen;esteem, the very soul of nationhood, have been transmuted into a whine of self&hyphen;doubt.</PARA>
<PARA>Those words, I think, are very pertinent and go very much to the nub of what has been happening in recent months. I think it is important to probe some of the issues that are involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are increasingly aware of the internationalisation of economies, trade and values, and of the globalisation of companies and businesses. Almost daily the communication revolution ensures that we watch events live, whether it be elections or debates or whether it be major catastrophes like those in Zaire or in other parts of the world. In that process there has been a tendency for people to become more tribalised. This has been spoken about to some degree, but it is perhaps less understood. It has become more and more difficult for people to relate closely to each other in large numbers. We are seeing the breaking up of nations in the USSR and in Yugoslavia. We are seeing a move toward smaller units and smaller groups, to identification for self&hyphen;awareness. That is understandable and it is human, but it carries with it a great <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6423"> danger. Mr Robinson's words are very pertinent when people, as a country, begin to doubt who they are and whether they are a country. In that context it is quite predictable that people may seek to appeal to the simplistic and to the emotive. That is what we have been seeing in the last year or more. There has been an increasing appeal to prejudice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prejudice has always been around and it always will be. It is a part of human nature. It is based on fear, insecurity, paranoia, very often ignorance and, of course, the matter of self&hyphen;doubt, particularly at national levels. Prejudice in my youth was about the then incoming waves of migrants, about religion, about where people lived and about what state you came from. We see it being expressed in football games in all ways and in all forms. We must not pretend that it is something new. It has been used by politicians and leaders of all kinds since man was man. The previous speaker, the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), spoke about the demagoguery of the Nazi regime and its appeal to prejudice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We understand that prejudice is there and we understand what it means. We also understood, or thought we did, that civilisation and social cohesion were predominantly about understanding our prejudices and recognising them for what they are, and about respecting the fact that one person's prejudice is another person's offence or insult. We understood that recognising and refraining from expressing our prejudices in the more extreme forms was a part of being civilised. It was a part of being educated. It was a part of recognising our individual acceptance of some sense of social norm, social mores and social cohesion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are being told now is that that was all wrong, that it was actually political correctness that prevented people from insulting each other. Manners had nothing to do with it; politeness and respect did not matter. What really mattered was that people were not allowed to speak because of some supposed notion of political correctness. That is a very limp excuse and a very limp explanation of a much more serious matter. The idea of labelling it with some new trendy label does not solve the problem and does not answer the question. I think the efforts of the Prime <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Minister (Mr Howard) in this regard in the last six or eight months have been incredibly destructive of any sense of manners and politeness in our society.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FI4">Mr ALLAN MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will tell you how if you also interject afterwards. For the Prime Minister to suggest that people should be free to speak and then, after they have spoken, to say, `There's an example or a demonstration of free speech,' effectively means that he is condoning the insulting of those who are insulted, the offending of those who are offended and the enraging of those who are enraged. That is what he has done, and he has done it very carefully and very precisely. That is why, in his opening remarks in that same article, Mr Robinson said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">John Howard, still unable to confront the racism issue head&hyphen;on, now says that the whole thing will be forgotten in a month or two anyway.</PARA>
<PARA>Throughout that article Mr Robinson points out that this is actually avoiding the issue. The idea that the answer is that somehow it will be forgotten is not the answer, because it needs to be challenged head&hyphen;on, not in terms of censoring people and not in terms of saying people can't talk but in terms of saying that social cohesion and social responsibility mean that we accept and recognise our prejudices and that we recognise the harm they can do others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are seeing is a licence to vilify, a licence to offend and a licence to insult under the guise of freedom of speech. Freedom of speech has never had such licences attached to it. It has always been there for those who want to do it. There has never been a legal restraint on those who want to act in that way, and nor should there be. But there always has been a social recognition that that causes other problems. Effectively, what we are talking about is social anarchy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a country we often hear about law and order. We do not often talk about the boundaries of black letter law or law in terms of social mores and social standards, which in many ways is the more important law, the more important judgment. What we are seeing now is an expression of anarchy by not just some parliamentarians but by the Prime <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6424"> Minister as well, in condoning that. There are those who think you can restrict expressions of prejudice simply to matters of race, religion or culture. No, you can't. We will be seeing similar expressions of prejudice to older people, to people with disabilities, to all kinds of people who are different in any way, because prejudice is basically about difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The condoning of this so&hyphen;called freedom of speech and this so&hyphen;called debate is actually an encouragement to those who will seek to express their prejudices as and when they wish&mdash;and to hell with the consequences. Those consequences are widespread and profound. The fact is that we have been hearing some examples, particularly in the first speech of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), about the supposed special help and special programs that some people get. I presume that also means special programs for pensioners, based on age. I suppose we also have special programs for people with diabetes, people who cannot read and write or people with particular medical problems. All those special programs should obviously go, because in the context of a program based on a special need&mdash;whether it be a disadvantage, language inability or age&mdash;where do you stop? Where do you draw the line? Once you start that approach&mdash;and that approach has already started&mdash;where do you stop? I suggest that what we are seeing is leading to a serious breakdown of our social standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This should and does concern all of us. We are seeing now that suddenly there is a concern because it may affect the economy. The fact is that that has always been there and we have always known that, if we insult people often enough, eventually, if they can, they will shift their business. More importantly, the trade between countries is undertaken by people of goodwill, between people who speak the languages and know the cultures. If they are the ones who are being insulted, then the people at the forefront of trade are the ones who are being wounded and damaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The more important concerns should be the concerns about our society and its make&hyphen;up&mdash;the questions of respect, recognition of each other's differences and the acceptance of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> benefit of that. I had an example just the other day&mdash;I am sure we are all getting phone calls now&mdash;of a mother of Asian extraction whose son came home one day and said to her, `Mum, at school they asked me today why I don't go back to where I came from.

<ELECTORATE> (Wannon)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(4.48 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to bring to the attention of the House the shameful situation that the coalition government inherited from Labor after 13 years of neglect of the rural and regional areas of Australia. In particular, I want to highlight a report, recently released by the Liberal Party's regional and rural committee, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Striking a Balance</EMPHASIS> . This shows that over 13 years, from 1983 to 1996, Labor effectively completely left out of the policy process many parts of the services to regional and rural Australia. This report is the voice of the country. It is the voice of the anger of the people, not only in my electorate of Wannon but also right throughout regional Australia. I think it shows just why there was such a huge swing in so many parts of the country against the Labor Party on 2 March. It demonstrates that over 13 years the Labor Party really had very little interest in the concerns of people in the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the time available, I want to quickly go through a number of areas which highlight just how serious this neglect really was by the Labor Party. We start by looking at unemployment. Many people are aware how serious the problems of unemployment have been in the country. Not only is there a limited variety of occupations available in the country but also, in many cases, there just simply weren't any jobs. In fact, while we are all well aware that unemployment, particularly amongst our young, exceeded one in four, higher than 25 per cent&mdash;in fact, in many cases as high as one in three could not find work&mdash;we find in some parts of Victoria that it went even higher. For example, in western Victoria it climbed to 36 per cent, while in the Mallee it climbed as high as a staggering 66 per cent of our young unable to find work, at one stage, under the Labor administration. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6425"> These are only the official figures. Often they hide an even more serious situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area I would like to highlight today is health. Many people think the country is a nice, healthy place to live. In some ways, the lifestyle is very healthy. But, unfortunately, when you look at some of the statistics, we find a very different picture. For example, heart disease in the country is up to 18 per cent higher than it is in the city; strokes are up to 29 per cent more prevalent than they are in the city; pneumonia or influenza can be as high as 95 per cent higher than in the city; and the incidence of traffic accidents can be up to 61 per cent higher. I could go on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rural children are now far more prone to ailments than those in the city. The death rate for rural girls is 15 per cent higher than in the city, while rural youth suicide, which is one of the great tragedies that has crept up on us, is now the highest of any Western society. Despite this, one would have thought that the availability of services might at least have been shared, but in figures which I got from the former Labor minister for health we found that people in the country, on average each year, get between $100 and $200 less in Medicare rebates than those in the city. This could be up to 30 per cent lower. In other words, the availability of services in the country is such that people just do not have access like those in the city.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> You might say, `What did Labor do about it?' I cannot say they did absolutely nothing. In the past four years we saw the national rural health conference, we saw the national rural health alliance and we saw the national rural heath strategy, and the Australian Rural Health Institution was set up to study the program&mdash;just form another committee. Despite all this, the Department of Human Services and Health had stated simply what the problem was, that is, that country Australia needs another 300 to 500 GPs. What you might say is that Labor might have been seen as the government of perpetual announcements and really, when it came to health, the government of perpetual inaction. We ought to contrast those examples with some of the work that is already being done by the coali tion government, when we see the work that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has already undertaken in the setting up of a number of private health initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third area I want to touch on is education, something we all know is so important for our young in this current age. It gives them the means to get ahead. But if you look at what is happening in the country, the sad fact is that, as a percentage, fewer country students are completing secondary education and even fewer are going on to tertiary education. It is really very disturbing to find that rural retention rates for year 12 have seen country students fall behind their city cousins, with a rate of 52 per cent compared with 66 per cent. If you look at those going on to tertiary education, you find that the number of country students is actually falling, down from 25 per cent in 1989 to just 16 per cent last year. This means they are 60 per cent less likely than city students to undertake tertiary education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite these chilling figures, despite what was so obvious, we saw a government that continued to refuse to even face up to what is basically one of the major causes of the problem and that is that it costs more to get education for country students than it does for city students. Yet they failed to address this in any meaningful way. The statistics show very clearly just how seriously they failed that test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth area I want to touch on is transport. To see what has led to the growing disparity between the city and the country, you only have to look at what Labor did to transport costs. What better example is there to show this than the change in fuel excise which increased a staggering fivefold under Labor. Yet at the same time the amount of money that the federal government was spending on roads under Labor fell from $850 million to $840 million over that period. At the same time the amount of fuel excise collected by the Commonwealth rose from $3,000 million to a staggering $10,000 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fifth area I want to touch on is drought. Nothing shows more clearly the stark contrast <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6426"> between the coalition government and Labor in the response, the understanding and the concern for people who suffer horrendous costs and losses and suffer personally as the result of drought. We saw an example in Victoria where in 1992 many farmers had their entire crops wiped out by flood only to find that just over a year later they faced drought. But, according to some little formula that Labor had concocted, they did not qualify for any drought assistance even though they had suffered such devastating losses. If you look at the criteria Labor was applying in the 1967&hyphen;68 drought and in the 1982&hyphen;1983 drought, nobody in Australia would have qualified for any drought assistance. I want to contrast that with the announcement the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) made today. He showed that the coalition government really does have an understanding of drought, not only while an area is drought declared but also in the subsequent period with the costs and the difficulties that people have in getting back on their feet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of other areas that I would like to touch on but given the limited time available I would like to come back to the key point that I think 13 years of Labor neglect of the country has created a devastating situation and it has left rural Australia very much the poorer. Professor Lindsay Falvey from Melbourne University put it very eloquently when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The image of rural Australia and in particular agriculture and related industries in Australia has been neglected and in some cases denigrated amongst the city base where electoral power largely rests. It is a responsibility of Government that all Australians be made aware of the benefit of strong agricultural, food, horticultural, forest and related industries to the well being of all Australians in economic and lifestyle terms. Similarly, the image of agricultural and similar industries and those working in them needs to be updated significantly so that the diverse skills in terms of environmental and use of appropriate high technology are appreciated.</PARA>
<PARA>Hear, hear, I say to Professor Falvey. And I think it was the  Labor Party more than anyone else that set about to downgrade that image of rural Australia. So the report that the Liberal Party's committee put together, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Striking a Balance</EMPHASIS> , not only outlines these <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> problems but also looks at some of the initial solutions that the coalition government has already put in place. But the coalition's commitment to rural Australia has again been reinforced by the release of our Budget document, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rebuilding regional Australia</EMPHASIS> , which shows that clearly we are starting down that track. But the election itself highlights just how much the electorate woke up to what was happening in Labor and if you look at the regional and rural seats today Labor holds just five whereas the coalition parties hold 49. That shows clearly how disillusioned rural Australia was with Labor. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to enter this grievance debate to grieve not merely as the member for Melbourne Ports, a genuinely multicultural community, but as a former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and a former Minister for Immigration. I rise to condemn the semi&hyphen;illiterate, prejudiced and biased statements of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). I believe there has been a level of tolerance extended to that member which belies the kind of nonsense which she has perpetrated in this House and which I believe is doing great damage to the nature of our Australian community. There is no minister for immigration or ex&hyphen;minister for immigration who will not tell the Australian people that it is always the last group of migrants getting off the boat that cop the flak. It has always been thus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One only has to look at the history of immigration immediately after the war to see the way in which the late Arthur Calwell, the founder of our immigration policies, was subject to abuse, vilification, turgid comments and cartoons. Why? Because he brought to Australia people of Jewish religion, many of whom were holocaust victims. That criticism of Calwell came not simply from the more conservative sections of Australian society but also from people who have had former associations with the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there has always been this problem in Australian society. I thought we had overgrown it until I heard the member for Oxley condemning people because they have their own culture and religion. So what! Which <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6427"> Australian citizen cannot claim to be a product of his own culture and his own religion?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She also says they form ghettos. If you visit any community in Melbourne, you will find areas where Italians, Greeks, Chinese and Vietnamese have settled. Why? Because, if you are arriving as an immigrant without much wealth, you will seek out cheap housing and, if you do not speak fluent English, a neighbourhood which is sympathetic and, hopefully, contains some of your fellow former countrymen. You will seek their views and their advice. You will seek to live near the place of your religion and hope that you will also find a place to educate your children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the history of the major centres of Melbourne and it is a history which up until now has produced, I think, one of the most remarkable multicultural societies to be found anywhere in the world. I, for one, am not prepared to sit and listen to the kind of nonsense talked by the honourable member for Oxley, who is long on rhetoric and long on slander but short on detail and chooses to use what she describes as fact without any real basis at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She wants to abolish ATSIC. I have heard that argument before. She is the only member of this parliament or of any parliament&mdash;and I have been in two&mdash;who has said they will not represent people in their electorate on the basis of their ethnicity, and she is referring to our indigenous Australian people. I have always operated on the basis that, after an election, it does not matter how many votes you win or lose, as a member of this parliament, you represent all of your constituents. If the chairman of the local Liberal Party is having difficulty with his bureaucracy and he is one of my constituents, he has a basic right to have me argue for him and do my best for him. That is a view that I believe runs through this parliament as part of our tradition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I hear the member for Oxley read out a speech written for her&mdash;usually she cannot get through it without making all sorts of mistakes&mdash;and say that there is one section of people that she will not represent, I condemn her. She does not understand the workings of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> our parliament. She does not understand the policy that has been formulated and administered by ministers for immigration over the years of different political complexion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are plenty of things to argue about in immigration. All ministers have had to face the question of how you balance the immigration intake, how you deal with that in economic terms and how you deal with it in terms of regional capacities to absorb people. That has engendered many important debates in this place and so it will continue to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is no significant contribution to this debate coming from the member for Oxley&mdash;oh, no! She could have been here when a very important motion was passed by this House, but she chose to absent herself because she had business in Melbourne. If she feels as deeply as she obviously does and if she is wanting to express a view on a debate of that kind, one would have understood if she had absented herself from any previous engagement to be here to put her point of view. But that is not her methodology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She chooses carefully where she will make her statements and she does that under the privilege of parliament. She will not be interviewed by the ABC&mdash;no reason given&mdash;and she will only go to select audiences. Let me say quite frankly to this House: if you want to run a racist agenda and if you want to run an exercise in vilification of certain groups in this community, there are organised groups in Australia which will be only too happy to provide you with an audience. I find it no accident that she has now been adopted by the League of Rights. Why would she not be?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She says all she wants is equality for all Australians. From the very birth of this nation, all Australians were not equal and they are not equal. No government can legislate to produce some kind of odd equality. What does she want? She has claimed John Howard, the leader of the political party that disendorsed her, as her leader. He will do her. I sympathise with the Prime Minister on that matter. There is not much he can do about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What she says is one leader, one nation and one race. We have heard it all before and the world learnt the tragic result of that concept. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6428"> If she says she still wants to debate this matter, then, I for one, as a former minister, will meet her anywhere in Australia at a time and place of her choosing&mdash;and I believe there will be other members of this House who will do the same&mdash;because you cannot let this argument run on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not just a question of damaging our economy. I have read the very important statement of a former political colleague and friend, John Brown, a leader in the tourist industry, commenting on the damage being done to that industry&mdash;and that is true. But more important than the economic damage, let us get this right: it is a question of national morality; it is a question of how we see ourselves as a people; it is a question of saying, `The one thing we will not abandon'&mdash;and it has not been abandoned by any minister for immigration&mdash;`is that, irrespective of your colour, irrespective of your religious beliefs, irrespective of your background, you will face a test, which is a uniform test, for whatever class or category you choose to enter Australia. You will not be told that, because of the colour of your skin or your religious beliefs, you will not be accepted.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time that we stopped being gentle with the member for Oxley. As far as I am concerned, I will debate with her any time, any place, anywhere&mdash;and she can bring her League of Rights goons with her. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the notice of the House a case that I believe is tragic and that, to my knowledge, has been running for over seven or eight years. It concerns Mr Christopher Mann and his wife, Christine, who are constituents of mine. I would inform the House that I have been seeking to assist Mr Mann since 1988. His case has advanced and, despite some positive rulings and reports, he is now no nearer to realising finalisation of his London case than when he first began eight years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have appealed to a wide range of authorities to help me resolve this matter because it <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is complex. It is not always within the powers of the bureaucracy or the Attorney-General to resolve such matters, but I have appealed to attorneys and bureaucracies of all political persuasions to assist in this matter. We have even had hearings of the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee where Mr Mann appeared and gave evidence in the examination and report on privacy, completed by that committee some time during last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Mann, due to a series of circumstances, brought proceedings in the High Court, London, against a former employee of his, Mr John Eccott; a journalist, Dianne Fernyhough; and a medical journal, called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World Medicine</EMPHASIS>, for publishing a defamatory article. Mr Mann was successful in the case and, due to the defendants' apparent protraction of the argument, his costs were substantial&mdash;over &pound;900,000 accumulating over a period of some 10 years or more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The case came about because Mr Mann was made aware of the defamatory article in a London journal. In the process of seeking to defend himself, he pursued his opponent in the British courts. In order to gain information for the case being brought by the Medical Defence Union, who supported Dr Eccott's litigation, that union employed a solicitor, a Mr Rubinstein. Mr Rubinstein, solicitor for the union and other defendants, I believe, may have misused confidential information which he obtained through Commonwealth and state government departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a visit to Australia, Mr Rubinstein was able to gain access to the department of health in New South Wales and the departments of health and immigration and ethnic affairs in Australia. Over a period of time I have seen freedom of information copies of file notes and comments by departmental officers. From those, it is patently clear that there was an understanding in the public service that Mr Rubinstein was acting on a matter of highest principle and had the support of the then Solicitor-General in making his inquiries here in Australia. He was provided with a range of documents, files and statements from state and Commonwealth records&mdash;documents, files and statements <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6429"> which were of a confidential nature and should never have been supplied to an outsider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Rubinstein, after being supplied with this information, then proceeded to go back to Britain to prosecute Mr Christopher Mann using the documents that he had obtained here in Australia. These documents, when produced in court, were used by Mr Rubinstein to prove, or attempt to prove, to the court that Mr Mann had not conducted himself in the best manner and that he was regarded as a person of some doubt by Australian authorities. When asked in the London court to produce all of his documentation, Mr Mann was not able to produce the documents which had been obtained by Mr Rubinstein.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems strange to me that we have an instance where an Australian citizen, born and bred, is not able to obtain from the bureaucracy documentation about their own records and behaviour, but that a foreigner coming into Australia on a visit, by using officers and contacts, is able to gain complete files which he then takes overseas and uses to prosecute that Australian citizen. When these matters were first raised with me by Mr Mann, I did not believe that Australian government departments would be party to such a process. But I am absolutely certain that they have been and, whether inadvertently or by design, they have supplied documentation that allowed Mr Mann to be prosecuted to the extent that he has lost his own home, the home of his mother and that of his mother-in-law. He is now enjoying very poor health, due to the great physical strain he has had to undergo over the last 10 or so years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a normal individual to pursue these matters a lot of money is needed and the court costs are extreme. Mr Mann long ago ran out of the capacity to pay for QCs and barristers and has in fact been basically successful in pursuing this matter himself. He has become extremely well read in the law. He is an intelligent man and he is able to pursue these matters himself. He has had to do so if he is intent on restoring his good name.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An examination on three occasions by the Australian Ombudsman first found there was <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> no fault on the part of the Australian government departments. But, with persistence, the Ombudsman has established that there has been a misuse of confidential files by Commonwealth public servants. The files were improperly released to a London based solicitor who acted for the defendants against Mr Mann.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Attorney-General acknowledged these facts, as do the current office holders, but says that the case of Mr Mann was not affected by the Commonwealth's release of confidential information because that confidential information had already been made available by a similar process by public servants in New South Wales. So we have had two lots of public administrators saying that they were not to blame&mdash;the administration in New South Wales blaming the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth blaming New South Wales. In this process we have a man who has been done a grave injustice in my opinion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Mann, as I have said, has suffered greatly. It would not be such a serious matter if the London courts had not found Mr Mann right in all his claims and awarded him costs of &pound;900,000. It would not be so serious if Mr Mann could not go through the taxing process of that &pound;900,000 because he cannot afford to. It would not be so serious if there were other public servants, other than Commonwealth public servants, involved in this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What appears to be happening to Mr and Mrs Mann is a process of attrition. Eventually the public administration in this country feels that if they hold out long enough the Manns will give in. The Manns have not given in. Despite the Commonwealth refusing to allow Mr Mann and his lawyers access to his own files, despite the fact that he has had to fight his own case unaware of what was on Commonwealth and state government files about him, he has been successful in prosecuting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have found that there have been a number of extraordinary and deceitful excuses made by public officers surrounding these breaches of privacy, which they at first denied. Then after representations by me they attempted to justify their conduct by claiming that Mr <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6430"> Mann had failed to conduct his litigation in a proper manner. That is clearly refuted on reading the comments reported by Judge Sir Michael Davies. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I grieve for the double standards of the coalition parties. I grieve for the way in which they talk about most issues in code&mdash;that is, stating policy for the consumption of one audience but then adding a qualification to satisfy the prejudices of another audience. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is the best example of this code of doublespeak.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister claims to be sympathetic to the cause of Aboriginal people but not by learning any of the lessons of their history. He claims to be sympathetic to cultural diversity in Australia, yet he talks the language of one monocultural Australia. He claims to have taken a stand in the race debate, yet perhaps he alone in our nation refuses to mention Pauline Hanson by name. He claims the priority for Australia's future in the Asia-Pacific, yet he declares our closest bonds to be with Britain. He claims to be a micro reformer, yet he is only interested in reforming the labour market, not product markets. He claims to be an economic reformer yet also a social conservative, as if the two come from different planets and can never collide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">None of this doublespeak makes for national leadership. It only makes for confusion and drift&mdash;the type of confusion many Australians now feel about the race debate and our national identity; the type of drift now being felt on employment policy, the nation's economic growth and our place in Asian markets. Confusion and drift&mdash;the hallmark of Howard leadership then and now. Confusion and drift&mdash;the defining features of the Howard government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just the Prime Minister. The full extent of coalition doublespeak is revealed in the publication the<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Australian candidate study</EMPHASIS> released just last week. This was a survey of the views of candidates who stood at the last federal election conducted by academics from three universities. It is a reliable, candid and quite stunning insight into the world view of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the coalition's candidates, most of whom now sit in the House of Representatives. It reveals the full extent of the coalition's doublespeak&mdash;the conflict between its public policies and private prejudices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me run the House through the key findings of the study, which I shall also seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. I will provide six instances in this study of coalition doublespeak. The first instance of doublespeak relates to multiculturalism. The public policy of the coalition is support for cultural diversity and racial tolerance in Australia. The private prejudice revealed in this study is that 35 per cent of the 115 coalition candidates surveyed believed that Australia had gone too far in giving equal opportunities for migrants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second instance of doublespeak relates to the rights of women. The public policy of the coalition&mdash;and their female members use this in the House quite frequently&mdash;is support for the rights of women and active female participation in our society. Yet in the anonymous survey distributed to each of the coalition candidates who stood at the last election 33 per cent of the 117 respondents believed that Australia had gone too far in providing equal opportunities for women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even worse, 40 per cent of the coalition's candidates, two&hyphen;fifths of their membership, disagreed with the proposition that government should increase opportunities for women in business and industries. That is hardly a radical proposition; and hardly a statement of attitude which accords with a party which says that it believes in equal rights for women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third instance of doublespeak relates to Aboriginal Australians. The public policy of the coalition was that governments need to improve the living standards and opportunities of Aboriginal people in Australia. Yet the private prejudice revealed in this survey is that 54 per cent of coalition candidates believed that governments had gone too far in helping Aboriginal people. More than half of the candidates who stood for the coalition at the last election believed that governments had gone too far in trying to help Aboriginal people.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6431">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth instance of doublespeak is on relations with Asia. The coalition's public policy, stated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and the Prime Minister, is that the coalition gives priority to a relationship of trust and cooperation with our Asian neighbours. The private prejudice revealed in this study was a stunning finding: 61 per cent of coalition candidates believed that China is likely to pose a threat to Australia's security. Even more amazing, even more out of step with their public pronouncements, is that an even higher number, 76 per cent of coalition candidates, believed that Indonesia, Australia's closest neighbour, is likely to pose a security threat to our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fifth instance of doublespeak is on trade policy. The public policy of the coalition was a belief in an open economy and a free trade agenda for the Asia Pacific. Just today, there was quite an excellent article by the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> echoing that attachment to free trade. Yet the private prejudice of coalition members and candidates is that 49 per cent, almost half, of the 114 coalition candidates surveyed agreed with the proposition that `Australia should limit the import of foreign products in order to protect its national economy'. No wonder the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) is wincing. No wonder he is trying to hide from these quite stunning and revealing survey results telling us so much about the private prejudices of the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It gets even worse. The sixth instance of coalition doublespeak&mdash;indeed, the mother of all doublespeak&mdash;was on help for battlers. The public policy of the coalition was that they would spill blood to try and assist the so-called Howard battlers. Yet there was an interesting response to the question in the survey conducted just a few months ago: would candidates agree with the proposition that income and wealth should be redistributed towards ordinary working people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One would have thought that a party, the coalition, that declares so much support for battlers would readily agree with the proposition that income and wealth in Australia should be redistributed towards ordinary <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> working people. Seventy&hyphen;five per cent of the Australian Labor Party candidates agreed with that proposition. Three&hyphen;quarters of Labor candidates surveyed agreed with that proposition. For the coalition? Sixteen per cent. So much for a party for battlers. So much for a party that states its support for ordinary working people. Only 16 per cent of their candidates at the last federal election thought that income and wealth should be redistributed towards those battlers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This just goes to show that the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) may have left the coalition but her views linger on. They are revealed fully in the private prejudices of coalition members in this stunning survey. It is all there in black and white. It is all there in the survey results: the perceived threat from Asia, the economic isolationism, the strong suspicion about equal rights for migrants and women, the suspicion about helping Aboriginal Australians and, of course, not really doing anything positive for battlers&mdash;not wanting to do the positive thing of income and wealth redistribution to ordinary working families. Only 16 per cent of the coalition candidates believed in that element of redistribution in public policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought that, while I am on the subject of coalition cant and hypocrisy, I might say a few words and single out one member, the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson). During the adjournment debate on our last sitting day, the member for Bradfield, with all the elitism expected from a medical professional, spoke of mediocrity passing for debate in the House of Representatives. One of my little hobbies is to hold sanctimonious Tories to their own standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask, therefore: did the member for Bradfield mean by mediocrity someone who changes political parties the way most people change their underwear? Did he mean by mediocrity someone who presents himself as a saviour on all issues without advancing any new ideas? Did he mean by mediocrity someone who supports debating life and death issues in the non-controversial side chamber of the House? Or did the member for Bradfield mean by mediocrity the asking on notice of the following question to the head <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6432"> of Australia's central bank and monetary authority:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Between 1972&hyphen;1975 Australia had a fixed exchange rate. What in your assessment would be the effect on the value of the Australian dollar now if the budget outlays increased by equivalent proportions as they did in the early to mid 1970s and in particular, if the Government of the day announced a 14.6% increase in budget spending in one year, as the Whitlam Government did in the 1974-75 Budget?</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, between 1972 and 1975 Australia did not have a fixed exchange rate, if by that the member for Bradfield meant that it could never move. What Australia had was an exchange rate determined by government rather than determined, as it is now, by the market with, from time to time, some intervention by the Reserve Bank of Australia. This was a government&hyphen;determined exchange rate, but it could move, and it did move, over that three-year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just for the edification of the member of the Bradfield, I point out that when the Whitlam government was first elected in December 1972 the Australian exchange rate was US119c. By the time of the coup in November 1975, the exchange rate was US127c. The Australian dollar had appreciated, in fact, by 8c against the American dollar. So there was an appreciation over time reflecting, of course, the mediocrity of the member for Bradfield. What a silly question to ask Australia's head of the Reserve Bank, especially when he didn't know the basis of his own proposition. The answer was to the credit of the Whitlam government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am going to introduce a slightly different thrust to this grievance debate because I am going to rejoice. I am going to rejoice on behalf of the Surfing Australia team which represented this country at the world titles at Huntington Beach, California, last month. They did extremely well indeed. There were 18 competitors consisting of men and women, juniors and seniors. Board riders competed in events for stand up, traditional long board, kneeboards and bodyboards. The team as a whole won the bronze medal from 680 competitors from 43 countries, so it is an absolutely outstanding result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two people in particular I have to mention are from the electorate of Cowper. Nerida Falconer from Scotts Head won the gold medal for the open women's event, a fantastic result. Craig Ashdown, who also happens to be one of my staffers, and I am very proud of him, won the silver medal for kneeboarding. Of course other team members won the silver for the long board and the men's bodyboard. It is a tremendous result and one which the parliament should be advised of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Still on the issue of sport, I would like to raise the issue of the need for a bicycle velodrome at Macksville in the Nambucca Valley. The Nambucca Shire Council is prepared to donate a suitable piece of land&mdash;a natural amphitheatre&mdash;and this would be a regional facility managed by the local committee with support drawn throughout the whole of the mid&hyphen;north coast, Australia's holiday coast. Although velodromes are not cheap to construct, once they are built they are very cheap to maintain. So the investment of funds into this will be very significant and a very long-term thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6436"> It will be a focus for cycling in the region for road racing, recreational cycling as well as track racing. As we have found with the recent Olympic Games, cycling is becoming a more accepted sport. It is one that creates a lot of spectator interest. Having made representations to the Minister for Sport, Territor ies and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), I am taking this opportunity of reinforcing the need for some special funding to get this going. It is something which would benefit an enormous number of people. There is no velodrome between Newcastle and the Queensland border, and I believe that this would be a very sensible injection of funds from the federal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also need to bring to the attention of the parliament the fact of bananas being sold, somehow or other, illegally in Brisbane at a food fair held, I believe, about three months ago. Apparently, dried bananas from the Cook Islands were brought in and sold. They were wrapped in banana leaves, and of course the minister at the table, Mr Jull, will know that the spores of the disease black sigatoka are carried in the leaves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The banana industry in Australia, both in Queensland and New South Wales, and to a lesser extent in Western Australia, is very significant. It is a family activity of horticulture and it ends up creating an enormous amount of employment and big contributions to the economies of the banana growing areas. In actual fact, the Australian Banana Growers Council has spent more than $1 million trying to keep black sigatoka out of Australia. I have seen it in the Torres Strait. It has come in from New Guinea. The last outbreak was at Weipa, on the western side of Cape York Peninsula, where every banana plant was infected. The authorities believed that the spores which infected the bananas at Weipa were either brought down in a cyclone or by people from Pascoe River, where there was an outbreak two years ago. I stress to the House that the quarantine regulations that are in place are essential. They are necessary and they are absolutely vital to protecting the Australian banana industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to head back for a moment to another sporting area, on Saturday afternoon I had the very great pleasure of attending the opening of the Leon Adams Lawn at the Sawtell Croquet Club. I know the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who is in the House, is one of those of us who acknowledges the pleasures of that game. It is very interesting <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to note that the Sawtell Croquet Club was founded in 1948. It was founded by wonderful people. One of those founding members, Islet Faichney, is 93 years old and she was there playing on Saturday.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Good for her indeed. I just wanted to bring this to the attention of the House because they opened their second lawn. They are only a small club&mdash;33 members. They had Rex Hardaker from the Coffs Harbour sporting group to do the official opening and name it the Leon Adams Lawn. Leon Adams is the club captain and has provided coaching. Probably the most outstanding year was 1992 when they had finalists in five state championships. So I thought it was appropriate to place on record the great success of the Sawtell Croquet Club.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also concerned about a number of Vietnam veterans in my electorate who have approached me. They were under the impression that, with the funds being allocated by the Australian Vietnam War Veterans Trust, there may have been some discrimination against veterans who were also TPI pensioners. I wanted to make this issue clear, and I have been in touch with the trust. I will just refresh the minds of those members present. In an out of court settlement after the class action, a sum of $5.5 million was provided to the trust to allocate to those Vietnam veterans who had been affected by contact with agent orange. I must say, too, that when they received that $5.5 million they invested it. Until June this year, over $6 million had been handed out to veterans in need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say too that I am aware the staff of the trust have been very severely overworked. I pay tribute to them for doing an excellent job. They assure me there is no policy of discrimination in the allocation of funds from the trust against veterans who are TPIs. All applications go before a committee of five, and that committee is made up of delegates from Vietnam veterans, Legacy, RSL and AVADS and one female. The distribution of the money is determined on the individual circumstances. There is no means test. Each case is looked at individually.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) comprises two groups of measures. The first group of changes relates to limiting Medicare access for new medical practitioners. The second group of changes is a series of alterations to the medical benefits schedule. The majority of the budget changes to Medicare rebates took place with the issuing of the new schedule, which took effect last Friday. This bill contains a number of other changes which have to be made to the legislation itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to turn, first of all, to the changes which the government is seeking to introduce in limiting access for new medical practitioners to Medicare provider numbers. The opposition has grave concerns about the effect of the government's proposed changes to Australia's medical work force. The Labor Party certainly understands the importance of seeking to manage the medical work force, in particular of managing access to Medicare to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ensure that the taxpayer and the Australian people get the best possible value for money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party also understands the need to ensure that those practising medicine in Australia are of the highest possible standard and are appropriately trained. In recent years it was the former Labor government which took a number of decisions aimed at limiting the number of overseas trained doctors coming to Australia and it was the former Labor government which worked with the medical profession to improve the standing of general practice and to develop a system of postgraduate training for general practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Labor Party did not do in government was to put in place a system which would retrospectively prevent existing Australian medical students and interns from having the opportunity to practise medicine. In our opinion, the government should have paid greater attention to reducing the medical school intakes and worked hard at restricting access for overseas trained doctors rather than simply attacking Australian trained medical students and interns who are currently halfway through their degrees. We do not believe it is right to disadvantage these students after they have put in years of study and training and after the taxpayer has invested in some cases more than $100,000 in their training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to turn to the element of this bill that seeks to retrospectively change the rules. Retrospectivity, as we all know, is a very blunt instrument in legislation. This legislation is highly retrospective. It significantly changes the career opportunities of a large number of young Australians after they have started their training&mdash;for some of them, seven years have passed since they made that career choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I imagine that most honourable members would be deeply disturbed by the fact that this legislation, if passed, will take effect from last Friday&mdash;that is, it will take effect from 1 November 1996. I would like to remind the House of some remarks which the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) made when discussing the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill in 1983. In the committee stage he made the following remark, and he is referring to the legislation:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6438">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it is a matter of some substance because we are dealing with a fairly dangerous animal when we are talking about using retrospective legislation in any circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>So the Prime Minister certainly considers that any retrospective legislation is a dangerous animal. In fact, the current Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith), who in 1987 was the then opposition spokesman on legal matters, made some very impressive remarks about retrospective legislation. I would like to quote some comments he made at that time. The current Minister for Industrial Relations said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the common justifications for retrospective provisions is the claim that any criticisms are met by the fact that a prior ministerial statement has outlined the proposed law. This practice is very much a common feature of this Government.</PARA>
<PARA>That was Mr Reith attacking the then Labor government. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems that Ministers are oblivious to the fact that it is Parliament that makes the law and not Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to quote a speech by Sir Anthony Mason to the Australian Legal Convention in July 1975. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministerial edicts do not change the law&mdash;contrary to the belief of some. There is first the risk that the proposed alteration will not be made by Parliament and there is secondly the possibility, sometimes unfortunately realised, that the law, when enacted, will not correspond exactly with the antecedent announcement.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Reith goes on to make the statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a practice which holds the Parliament, and thus the people, in contempt and it is wrong in principle in that it encourages retrospective legislative provisions.</PARA>
<PARA>There we have some views of the former Chief Justice&mdash;at that time he was a judge on the High Court, I understand. We have the current Prime Minister and the current Minister for Industrial Relations making it clear they thought it was wrong for the former Labor government to use retrospective legislation to close tax loopholes to tighten up the tax act, yet this government announced in August changes which were to take effect on 1 November.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been unable to obtain the legislation until a few weeks before it takes effect. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> In fact, the first opportunity that the opposition has to respond to the minister's second reading speech is three days after the legislation, if passed, takes effect. We all understand that it is quite possible that, with the current parliamentary backlog, it could be Easter next year before this legislation is debated and finally determined in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difficulty that the government faces is that when it was in opposition it altered the Senate standing orders. It did that in a deliberate way. In opposition, the Liberal and National parties argued that governments should only be entitled to introduce legislation in one session and have it determined by the Senate in the following session, unless the Senate gave agreement to a variation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We certainly are concerned that the government thinks that it can introduce legislation which will be retrospective and will have a serious effect on the careers of many young Australians, and expects to have it debated within a few weeks before the parliament rises by the end of the year. That might have other consequences for the government that I will go into in a few minutes. As I say, any government that uses retrospective legislation has to be very careful because it is a very blunt instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I imagine that people understand that the provisions of this bill were always going to be highly controversial, and it is our view that they should have been introduced immediately after the budget. While the budget was handed down in the third week or so of August the government and the ERC obviously made this decision some weeks prior to the budget's being publicly released. In the past governments have usually followed their announcements on budget night with the introduction of a whole package, a whole raft, of budget measures. This is on the very night that the Treasurer delivers the budget speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this occasion, very little of the budget legislation is before the parliament. Quite a large number of proposals were announced on budget night, yet the parliament has not had a chance even to see the legislation or been able to have some idea as to the detail of the government's plans. I have to say that it is inexcusable that the minister was not able to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6439"> introduce a bill&mdash;certainly a bill of this importance&mdash;into the parliament until four sitting days before it took effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difficulty that the government faces is that if the Senate does not discuss or finally determine this legislation until next Easter, 1,200 young Australian doctors will be issued with provider numbers in January when they qualify to register. If the government is successful in having the legislation passed next year then some time, perhaps at Easter&mdash;if the legislation is passed&mdash;1,200 young Australian doctors, having received their provider numbers in January, will have their provider numbers taken off them when the legislation receives royal assent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is no way to run a health system, and it is no way to determine the future of the careers of those 1,200 Australians. I have heard rumours that the government was considering gazetting regulations which would have prevented those 1,200 doctors being able to obtain provider numbers in the early new year. I am pleased to say that I received assurances from the department and the minister's office that there is no intention to attempt to withhold these provider numbers if the legislation is not passed until next year. I am grateful for that assurance from those concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week the minister made an announcement about his intention to introduce a 10&hyphen;year moratorium on overseas trained doctors. I did welcome that on that day, but I have to say that I do not think it goes far enough. The reason why we believe that this is only a half measure is that Dr Wooldridge's amendments to his own legislation affect only overseas trained doctors who arrive in Australia after 1 January 1997. I understand that to mean that Dr Wooldridge's current proposal, the moratorium, will still allow those doctors&mdash;as many as perhaps 200 a year&mdash;to register as medical practitioners and to compete with graduates from Australian medicals schools for jobs in public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition believes that the minister has also been too generous in allowing overseas trained doctors who are already in Australia open access to Medicare and other medical jobs once they pass the registration <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> exams. On current estimates, more than 500 of this group will pass these exams and compete with Australian graduates for places over the next five years. But the number will be higher if the Australian Medical Council does not accept the minister's request that they limit the doctors in this group to two exam attempts over five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to point out to the House that last Tuesday, when referring to overseas trained doctors who are already in Australia, the minister said, `They will have five years to have their skills assessed'&mdash;by the Australian Medical Council&mdash;`and they, too, will have two attempts to pass.' The minister gives the clear impression that this is going to affect the ability of overseas trained doctors to sit for the AMC exam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was only this morning that I learnt that it is actually only the minister's proposal to the Australian Medical Council. In fact, I got a clear impression, from the very strong words the minister gave to the House last Tuesday, of what the new rules would be for these overseas trained doctors. Yet we now learn that what the minister told the House would happen will occur only if the AMC agrees to the minister's suggestions. That is certainly a much weaker position. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we have been mugs to allow ourselves to be one of the last Western countries to allow unrestrained medical migration.</PARA>
<PARA>If the minister feels so strongly, why is he taking only half measures? Why is he putting this 10&hyphen;year ban on only overseas trained doctors who arrive after 1 January next year?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, if it is good enough for the minister to suggest to the Australian Medical Council that there should be new rules on how many occasions you can sit for the AMC exam, why will the minister not consider reimposing the limit on the number of overseas trained doctors who are allowed to proceed from the AMC's written exam to the AMC's clinical exam? I would like to spend a few minutes on that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government imposed a quota on the AMC exams which effectively limited the number of overseas trained doctors who could work as doctors in Australia. This quota was challenged and overthrown by the Human <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6440"> Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission but, on appeal, the HREOC decision was reversed by the Federal Court. I am not a lawyer, but it now appears to me that there is, therefore, no legal barrier to the reimposition of a quota on the AMC exams at a level which will ensure that the students already in the system are not disadvantaged by these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at what happens in other countries, such as the United States and Canada, we see that it is very difficult for Australian trained doctors to practise medicine in those countries. A number of people have pointed out that Australia allows many more overseas trained doctors to practise here than those countries allow. I offered the minister, in a private conversation, bipartisan support from the Labor Party if he was willing to impose tighter restrictions on the access of overseas trained doctors to the clinical exam which is set by the AMC&mdash;that is, the reimposition of a quota much lower than 200. Unfortunately, the minister has not agreed to pick up that suggestion. I think that is to be regretted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of the minister allowing overseas trained doctors after 1 January to compete for places at public hospitals, and as a result of the minister's refusal to suggest to the AMC a tough new quota on the overseas trained doctors who are already in Australia, on my calculations that means as many as 1,500 overseas trained doctors will register and practise in Australia over the next five years in direct competition with the students in Australian medical schools and this year's interns&mdash;that is, they will be registering and practising in public hospitals as well as in general practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a good example which can be used to point out why we think this is wrong. When the minister was copping some flak from the Australian medical students and interns about this decision, he broke his holidays and went on the John Laws program on 25 September. He claimed that 32 Sri Lankan doctors came into Australia via New Zealand&mdash;I think it was last year or the year before that. He was actually critical of the former government for allowing that to take place. As a result of the minister's decisions, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those 32 Sri Lankan doctors who came into Australia via New Zealand will be quite free to sit for the Australian Medical Council exams, whereas if the minister had taken up the opposition suggestion of a tough new quota we could have expected that it would have been more difficult for those 32 Sri Lankan doctors to be competing with the Australian trained medical students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main difficulty we have with this bill is that it is unfair to Australian medical students and interns. When the debate began the figures on which the savings were based assumed that about 200 Australian students and interns per year would miss out on provider numbers. Shortly after this, Dr Wooldridge, in that John Laws interview, said that very few Australian graduates would miss out on Medicare provider numbers. He claimed that the number would be fewer than 50 a year. More recently, I have noticed that Dr Wooldridge has become even more optimistic. In his press release last week he said that all Australian doctors and all Australian medical students and interns could expect to find a training place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These figures have been very rubbery. On 25 September, Dr Wooldridge claimed that there would be 430 overseas trained doctors coming to Australia. Last week he told the House that late amendments to his late legislation would result in 600 overseas trained doctors being stopped. In a similar way, Dr Wooldridge told the House on 12 September that there would be up to 600 specialty training places available and by 15 October, again in this House, this number had miraculously risen to 760 places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Minister for Health and Family Services believes his latest set of figures and if he really does believe that no Australian medical student or intern will miss out on a training place, and, therefore, a Medicare provider number, I simply ask: why has the minister refused to give those students and interns a guarantee that that will be the case? The reason why the minister is refusing to do this is that we know he does not have enough faith in his own rubbery figures to give this guarantee. If the Minister for Health and Family Services does not have enough faith <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6441"> in his own figures to give the guarantee, why should medical students have enough faith in him to trust him and these rubbery figures?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party remains concerned that the proposal will also have an adverse effect on the provision of medical services in rural areas and on the options available to young doctors, particularly women medical students, who may not wish to proceed immediately after registration to full-time training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had a chance to meet with a large number of the medical students and interns who will be affected by this legislation. It is not surprising that I have received contradictory advice from the claims the students and interns put to me and the claims put to me by officials from the minister's office and the department in the two briefings I have had with them, for which I remain grateful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The women doctors, in particular, that I have spoken to make the point that, while the minister might be right in claiming that many of the colleges now allow women to take time off if they wish to have children or allow women to carry out some of their postgraduate training in a part-time way, many of the colleges continue to treat women unfairly in allocating places. If women do ask for some time off or ask to do their postgraduate training part time, they seem to be the ones who are less likely to gain a training place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we have an opportunity to discuss this bill in its consideration in detail stage, I will be seeking to move that this legislation be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs to allow a more open and thorough debate on these issues. I think consideration by the committee would allow members of this House an opportunity to search for a fairer plan and one that is not retrospective. While I am not optimistic that a majority of the House will vote in favour of that referral&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, we had hoped that, with the power of our arguments, we could convince them. But unless the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) leads a mass crossing of the chamber, it is unlikely that that particu <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> lar proposal from the Labor Party will be successful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without wishing to be flippant about this measure, we do believe that this current plan, as it is currently proposed, is unfair. If more time were perhaps provided to allow additional pressure to be placed on the deans of the medical schools to reduce their intakes in the future and perhaps look at the full measures I have outlined to tighten access for overseas trained doctors, we might be able to come up with a package that could win the support of both sides of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to turn to schedule 3, which contains measures to ensure that temporary resident doctors who generally come to Australia to work in rural public hospitals on two&hyphen;year contracts will have to achieve the same standards with regard to post-graduate training before they are able to bill Medicare for their services. The date of effect of this element of the bill is, surprisingly, 1 November 1997, which means that those TRDs who are already here will be able to finish their contracts under the same conditions as when they signed them. This is appropriate and fair, but it also highlights that the government is prepared not to act retrospectively against certain groups of overseas trained doctors, but will not extend this same principle to students in Australian medical schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The explanatory memorandum for this bill says that the use of TRDs with lower qualifications `has been necessary in order to ensure access for patients in hospitals and in some rural and remote areas of Australia'. Despite this, the opposition has some concerns about the impact of Dr Wooldridge's plans for temporary resident doctors. However, I was pleased to note the minister for health's recent answer in the House to a question from the member for Dawson (Mrs De-Anne Kelly) when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is nothing in our changes on medical migration that will make it harder for rural communities to get a temporary resident doctor if they can find one.</PARA>
<PARA>We will be keeping a close watch on this particular measure to ensure that that commitment and undertaking is kept.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6442">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to schedule 2, which is the element of the bill that makes a whole series of changes to the Medicare benefits schedule. These changes include changes to the multiple services rule for diagnostic imaging, an increase in the greatest permissible gap to $50, and the removal of the Medicare Benefits Advisory Council's power to award higher than normal fees for unusually long or complex procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn first to diagnostic imaging. Two of the Medicare related measures in this year's budget which the opposition believes do have merit are the reforms to pathology and diagnostic imaging. The government has recognised, as did the former government, that the very high growth rates in benefits for these services require action. In some ways they have built upon the model used by the former government in seeking to limit the cost of providing pathology services. I commend the government for its negotiations with the various elements of the profession in seeking to limit the levels of growth to more reasonable levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The multiple services rule for diagnostic imaging is part of an agreed package with the relevant part of the profession and is similar to agreements in place for multiple surgical services and multiple pathology tests. The opposition's concern is to ensure that these changes do not achieve these savings by cutting the fees for doctors, who then pass these directly on to patients. As I have explained, the opposition supports the principle and the approach of these reforms but we think the government and the HIC should continue to monitor billing practices in this area very closely to ensure that the agreed reforms do not mean that patients end up paying substantially more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the maximum patient payment. The coalition promised before the election that `Medicare would be retained in its entirety'. The minister for health wrote to his own constituents, in that famous letter to the residents of Box Hill, specifically promising that Medicare rebates would not be changed. This measure, which would increase the patient's maximum payment&mdash;that is, the 15 per cent difference between the Medicare <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> recommended schedule fee and the 85 per cent Medicare rebate&mdash;from $30.60 to $50, is a clear example of a complete breach of faith on these two promises. It is a breach of faith on the Prime Minister's undertaking that Medicare would be retained in its entirety and the minister for health's undertaking to his own constituents that Medicare rebates would not be changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure is not small beans. It will raise nearly $60 million over four years. This money will be raised from those people who are seriously ill and require medical services with a schedule fee in excess of $200. It is hard to imagine how anyone could believe that this was a fair or reasonable measure. Even the minister does not seem to think so because neither the second reading speech nor the explanatory memorandum gives any reasons why it is appropriate to place an extra $60 million tax on those who are seriously ill. The minister is obviously not trying to defend the indefensible. This is also shown by his refusal to debate the atrocious decision to abolish the Commonwealth's dental health program last week. It is another example of a broken promise in health and it is a measure which simply ultimately ends up being a tax on the sick, and will be opposed by the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the removal of the MBAC's power to award higher fees for unusually long or complex services. This measure is an example of the new government's arbitrary approach to cutting Medicare. The government plans to save around $5 million in a full year by removing doctors' rights to claim for unusual items. The MBS lists thousands of items which are designed to cover all medical services, but occasionally unusual things occur which have not been foreseen. The reason that the MBAC was given the power to determine these fees was to cover this possibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps I could give the House an example of why it is important that this committee continues to retain this power. Imagine if a rural general practitioner is called to an emergency on a remote property. She drives for more than an hour to reach the property and then finds that the patient has had an <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6443"> accident with a piece of farm machinery and has sustained a serious injury. The GP treats the injuries as well as possible, treats the patient for shock, assists the family and then accompanies the patient to hospital. The whole episode could take four hours. There is no item which properly covers this afternoon's work by the GP, so under the current arrangements this GP would write to MBAC and explain the circumstances of the case and the committee would then determine a fair fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the same GP had instead done 16 quarter&hyphen;hour consultations in their surgery, Medicare would have paid them around $300. Under the minister for health's current proposal, these new arrangements mean that the maximum a GP could claim for this four hours of work is $70.30, the rebate for a long home visit consultation. This is not a reasonable fee in these circumstances, and the doctor is left with the unenviable choice of accepting this inadequate fee or asking the patient to make up the difference of up to several hundred dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is another example of arbitrary and unfair changes to Medicare which undermine our universal health insurance system and undermine the way that Medicare acts as a safety net to protect both doctors and patients in unusual circumstances. This measure will also be opposed by the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have some serious doubts about the way in which this particular measure was presented and the savings which are claimed for it. I understand that the amount paid out last year for unusually long or complex items was less than $&half; million. So I am a little confused about how he can save $5 million a year from this. Looking through more of the budget material, I did find reference to the abolition of previous principles and precedents set by MBAC. If the savings from this part of the measure are up to 10 times that of the part we are being told about, then that is something that is more than a little misleading. I would be grateful if the minister could clarify that matter in his second reading reply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> In summing up, in this budget we have seen a number of changes that begin the undermin ing of Medicare. Poor old Medicare&mdash;it is like that salami on the delicatessen's slicer. We have had reductions in rebates for women on the IVF program, we have had limits placed on rebates for people receiving psychiatric treatment and we have had reductions in rebates for knee and eye surgery. You may not now be reimbursed through Medicare for surgeons who assist in operations. Australians who seek to be trained as doctors are retrospectively having their careers affected by this legislation. We think many of these measures are ill thought out. In the detail stage, the opposition will be moving a number of amendments which will seek to express our concerns in some regard on these measures.</PARA></SPEECH>

We now have incentives for those who take out private health insurance or who remain in it. Labor never met its two per cent medical research target, whilst the waiting lists for public hospitals have soared. The Labor government got nowhere with COAG and would not even place health on the policy agenda. The current Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has done more in the last six months in that area than Labor did in the previous two years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Immunisation was left in a mess, but now we have public health common goals and targets put in place. Labor's neglect of Aboriginal health was also extraordinary and an international disgrace. We now, thankfully, have a minister who is getting on with the job and who has already secured agreements with the states, ATSIC and NACHO. The runs are going on the board, but there is much more to be done. The Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 that we are debating here today is about more positive change; change made necessary by the incompetence and failed management of the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6444"> The member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) tried to reduce the number of students enter ing medical schools but failed. The current minister will do this in a cooperative manner. The large number of overseas doctors accessing the Medicare system was recognised as a problem by Labor, but they failed to grasp the matter and do something about it. Another testament to  Labor's inactivity in this area was its inability and unwillingness to manage the problem of having an oversupply of doctors in some areas and an undersupply in others. This problem should have been addressed years ago. Labor's neglect caused this mess with a lack of ability to address the labour force issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A government can be expected to get work force issues and planning right when it spends $20 billion of taxpayers' money on health care. If it cannot, as is the case with the previous administration, costs blow out and the quality of care can be diminished. We need to get the balance right in various areas: hospitals, public health programs, general practice, various specialities and rural medicine. Labor got all this wrong. A healthy labour work force can never be entirely run on open market principles, and that is why good planning is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes in the bill relating to work force matters relate to the requirement for medical graduates to complete postgraduate education in order to gain access to Medicare benefits. In the transition period I have some sympathy with those young doctors who believe they will be affected. We believe, though, that there are enough training positions in the system to satisfy demands. I have no doubt that time will prove the minister right on this issue. In the meantime, I understand the fear and anxiety that change can bring about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past, the provision of Medicare provider numbers has been demand driven. This government is seeking to return to a more balanced situation. One of the major cost pressures on the health system in Australia is the chronic oversupply of doctors, already estimated by the Australian Institute of Health at 4,500 nationally, and simultaneously a dangerous shortage of 500 general practitioners in rural areas such as the Murray <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Lands in South Australia and other rural and remote areas of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation seeks to tackle both of these realities with four key strategies: reducing medical school intakes, reducing the numbers of overseas trained doctors migrating, reducing the need to bring in temporary overseas doctors to staff hospitals and, finally, getting a better distribution of doctors between rural and urban regions. The city of Adelaide, for instance, has one of the highest concentrations of doctors in Australia, with 194 practitioners for every 100,000 residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The slight reduction of intake levels at medical schools will be complemented by efforts to reallocate resources to the postgraduate level away from the undergraduate level. Given the timelag of six years for these measures to take full effect and the immediate crisis caused by the oversupply of doctors, however, the government must also reduce incentives for overseas trained doctors to migrate to Australia. The reality of the situation is that Australia has overly generous provisions for overseas trained doctors to enter Australia relative to other comparable countries. We have a situation where a large number of doctors are coming to Australia via New Zealand after only two years residency in that country. From 1 November 1997, temporary resident doctors will not be able to be deemed as medical practitioners for Medicare purposes unless they have the relevant overseas postgraduate qualifications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has announced a 10&hyphen;year moratorium on the migration of overseas doctors from the beginning of 1997. Overseas trained doctors who are already resident in Australia will be given five years with a maximum of two attempts from the beginning of next year to complete the AMC process. There are approximately 3,000 doctors currently in this country who have not passed the AMC exams, although some have not indicated a desire to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people will say these measures are tough, but others will say that we have been foolhardy to become one of the last countries in the world to restrict the supply of doctors coming to this country to access our publicly funded health system. I have heard Medicare <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6445"> called `industry assistance' in some of these situations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need for this legislation has been encouraged by the shortage of doctors willing to work in the public hospital system here in Australia. In the past, it has been just too easy for medical graduates to hang up a shingle and bill under Medicare whilst the states have been bringing in temporary overseas doctors. There were 606 such doctors brought into this country last year. It would be a dereliction of the Commonwealth's responsibility for this absurd situation to continue and a sad reflection on the mismanagement of former Labor health ministers that this situation exists for the government now to have to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would all like to choose our place of employment, but the needs of Australia's health system are such that doctors now have to go where they are required and this may not always mean the first choice of graduates. This may take some time getting used to and it will require careful management and consultation. A package of $20 million per annum, for example, has been provided by the government to assist in medical work force adjustments and in particular to provide key support in rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Graduates in other professions such as law, engineering and teaching, especially early in their careers, are expected to travel to find employment, and there are many in the community who cannot see why medical graduates should be treated any differently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation signals the beginning of the difficult but necessary structural changes to address a crisis in the Australian health system which will only begin to rectify the situation created by the inaction of Labor. Under this government's changes, 1,500 new doctors will enter the system in 1997&hyphen;98, comprised of 1,200 new Australian trained graduates and a reduced number of overseas trained doctors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Allowing for the 1,220 training places, with 100 of those being filled by overseas trained doctors, less than 100 medical graduates will be affected by the changes. As some graduates will want to move into other areas or take time out, the number is likely to be far less than that 100. There is more than enough <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> capacity for this shortfall to be absorbed by the public hospital system and, in doing so, to begin to ease the onerous workload currently expected of doctors in public hospitals and identified by health professionals everywhere as another crisis resulting from the inaction of the previous administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cutting the hours worked by hospital doctors to 50 per week would create, in itself, another 1,600 positions with minimum costs to the state governments as they would have overtime costs dramatically reduced. Surveys suggest that there are at least 400 such vacancies in public hospitals. Up to 150 scholarships will also be created by this government to enable medical students to spend some time training in rural areas. Nearly $4 million will be allocated to this initiative over the next four years. One million dollars in the next four years will also be allocated to improving the availability of locum services in regional areas to again relieve the overworked practitioners working in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through the additional allocation of $20 million per annum to rural hospitals and medical schools, the crisis in rural Australia has finally been recognised and is finally being addressed. The Australian government's health service has recently advertised for 60 new doctors at an attractive salary of around $75,000 per annum. Other opportunities exist within the Commonwealth government and various agencies. Fifty places were also made available in the army, navy and air force, which have suffered a shortage of medical staff in recent times. Other opportunities exist in mining companies, pharmaceutical companies and in academia in both teaching and administrative positions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that, whilst current graduates are caught in a difficult transition period, they should educate themselves about the many alternatives open to them, their relevance and ongoing worth to the Australian community and labour market, and the limited impact these budget measures will have on their futures or position. Any new doctor who wants to practise medicine will be able to do so. No doctor willing to work will be unemployed as a result of these measures. It is their right to unfettered private practice at <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6446"> taxpayers' expense that is being restricted to circumstances where they will have completed proper training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New doctors will still be better off than virtually any other profession where significant numbers of graduates are in the unfortunate position of not being able to find any employment in their chosen fields. These measures to give provider numbers only to suitably trained doctors will, in fact, enhance the perception in the community of the role that doctors play in society. Given the relative explosion in medical research, new techniques and alternative treatments, general practice must now be considered a specialty in itself. It should not simply be accessed by practitioners who cannot or will not obtain specialty training in other areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government must curb the critical and unsustainable growth in the use of Medicare funded services. In 1996 former Labor health minister Brian Howe said, `We believe we've got too many GPs out there in the field ordering up too many services.' It is this coalition government which, however, will do more than just recognise the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is not an assault on medical graduates or students. It recognises that a crisis exists which cannot continue. The minister has acknowledged that these are tough measures but necessary if Medicare is to survive. There are certain realities that cannot be ignored any more. There are too many doctors with too many of them setting up in urban areas. There is also an unhealthy reliance by doctors on government outlays, which is unsustainable if growth remains unchecked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is estimated that it costs the Medicare system $170,000 every time another provider number is issued to a practitioner. This government should be commended for this responsible legislation to address this situation, and I commend the minister for his dedication to tackling the legacy left by Labor. This legislation is part of the broader agenda of this government to put into place a sustainable and fair health system which returns some sense to the balance between supply and demand in the provision of health services. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to discuss the very important schedule 2 of this bill. This measure will allow negotiations to be made to reduce the Medicare benefits payable where multiple services are rendered. Multiple services rules recognise that there is an over-remuneration in the components of the fees where more than one service is rendered to a patient. These measures are sensible, are not random and are designed to keep pace with changes that have taken place in medical and surgical practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the minister, who has undertaken extensive consultation in areas such as pathology to work out ways that these costs can be checked but at the same time ensuring that patients in no way suffer or have to pay more for it. It does impact on the overall cost to the system and helps make that health dollar go that much further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation will also increase the definition of the greatest permissible gap between the Medicare benefits schedule fee and the Medicare benefit payable from $29.30 to $50. The minister has worked hard, as I have said earlier, on consultation. I know he recognises that there are challenges ahead. But if Medicare is to be sustained and the system not collapse, then these changes are necessary. I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, today I had the privilege of tabling a petition in the parliament. For your information and the interest of members, it reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain residents of the State of NSW draws to the attention of the House that we the undersigned are totally opposed to the restriction of issuing of provider numbers to registered doctors unless they have entered a recognised training program, are vocationally registered or are a qualified specialist. We consider that such an action would cause serious suffering, including a severe disadvantage to women and rural communities and medical research. We believe that it is the essential right of all Australian registered doctors to have access to provider numbers that allow them to provide services which can attract Medicare rebates. We believe that such restrictions are an attack on the most defenceless and vulnerable strata <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6447"> of the medical profession and will not achieve the projected savings which it purports to do. We consider it to be a denial of natural justice, an attack on Medicare and un-Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore request the House to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Call upon the Federal Minister for Health the Hon. Michael Wooldridge MP, to enter into meaningful discussions with representatives of those groups most affected by the harsh and unconscionable decisions of his government.</PARA>
<PARA>That petition was signed by almost 1,500 people from Newcastle, mainly from the Hunter area. It was collected in just one day, on Friday. My constituents advised me that they could have had literally tens of thousands of signatures if they had wished to demonstrate an exercise in numbers. What they were trying to show the government was the level of concern that there is in the community and the level of support that doctors and medical students have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This petition is particularly relevant coming from a place like Newcastle whose medical faculty has pioneered a community base for medicine which has seen a major shift in all the medical faculties towards a different set of criteria both for accepting students and, more importantly, as to how doctors and medicine are seen. Newcastle graduates are now quite famous for being more concerned about their patients and about wellbeing than necessarily about money. This bill in relation to provider numbers is most marked because it implies the opposite views of many of our doctors to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue is a difficult one. It is one that I do not profess to have all the wisdom on. I am puzzled by the fact that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) seems to be so confident of his position. I say that because I find it difficult to link up how they can evaluate the savings that are projected. I find it difficult to understand the shifting ground in terms of overseas doctors, registrations, quotas and the like. We keep seeing a constant shifting of numbers and conclusions as to what effects it will have. On the one hand the minister is saying to the students that it will not affect them very much yet at the same time he is talking about substantial budget savings.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is just one more chapter in the saga of making bad news sound good. It is essentially about cutting money. It is essentially about trying to find who you can soak next for some mythical conclusion. Yet we are being told constantly that it is about improving Medicare. The previous speaker, the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), talked about the bill improving Medicare, but that petition from doctors says that this is an attack on Medicare. That is the fact. It is an attack on Medicare; it is not a defence of Medicare, as the government keeps on pretending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are being told over and over that, unless this is done, Medicare will collapse. What a load of codswallop! What absolute nonsense! The only way Medicare will collapse is if those opposite keep on taking away its underpinnings so that there is nothing left. We know very well how that is done. We watched it from 1975 through to 1982&mdash;step by step, brick by brick. Medibank was still there in name&mdash;it became an insurance organisation&mdash;but the principles underpinning it and its essentials were white&hyphen;anted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So every time this government says that this is essential to protect Medicare, I say to people in the community, `Watch out,' because it inevitably is going to hide yet another sneak attack. The people who are more likely to know are doctors and medical students, particularly those from Newcastle. If they are saying in their petition that it is an attack on Medicare, we should believe them because they are the ones who will know. Every time I hear the minister and his acolytes talking about somehow this decision being essential to protect and preserve Medicare, the warning bells get even louder and stronger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that this government has retrospectively changed the rules seven years later. People who were contemplating enrolling for medicine or applying to do medicine around Australia seven or eight years ago, making their decision on what courses they chose in year 11&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the dinner break, I had been explaining to the House the concern that I have with the current govern <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6448"> ment constantly talking about improving Medicare, which is code for undermining Medicare. This has been emphasised very clearly by a petition presented to the House today on behalf of 1,500 people in the Newcastle area. Amongst other things, the petitioners point out that the amendments are an attack on Medicare. I think those in the medical profession in Newcastle who drafted the petition would be more accurate in understanding the impact of these amendments than the government itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a new form of social engineering that the government is proposing. It tells people to go to university and to spend seven years training and, after that, it rearranges the rules and decides whether or not they can work. It is social engineering: nothing more; nothing less. It is interference in the rights of individuals who have made their choice to follow a particular career.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has a number of consequences. The previous government had been successful in training young Aboriginals to become doctors. That program was started at Newcastle University in the mid&hyphen;1980s and has been successful. We now have doctors working in Australia of Aboriginal background, providing good medicine and good service to the community. They are also wonderful role models. They have shown that education was available and accessible. Young Aboriginals at school looking to their future as doctors see them as valid role models.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This new system means that those young people will have to find another way to become recognised in their communities because this impediment that is now being proposed will disrupt substantially what would have been their normal pathway. Young Aboriginals currently in medical faculties with the expectation of becoming doctors and servicing their communities will have to think again because of these changes. They are going to have to pass another hurdle to be accepted by the college. What that means, God only knows! None of us know and I am sure that the students do not know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point has been made very fluently by many doctors of the effect this will have on women. Many young women doctors do not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> work full time. They want to have families and share their child raising with their work. For them to go through this process is really going to be quite difficult and almost certainly untenable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young medical graduates undertaking research will be in a similar situation. We have relied very much on these people. They work part time as locums, while working in research. If there is no part&hyphen;time work, the capacity to be researchers will be taken away. We all know it is there. We have used that system very successfully, and it has been good for all of us. It has been good for them because it has meant that some of our best and brightest could go into the research field and not have to be paid up to the full scale because they could work part time and augment their income. In effect, they were not only doing research on the cheap but also getting experience in medicine and keeping up their skills. That will clearly change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are all the things that the government should have talked about. It is not unreasonable for a government to propose changes to the system. That is what governments are there for. This was not a proposed change. This change was announced as a fait accompli. I did not hear any members opposite discussing this over the last six months, during the campaign or before the budget. I did not hear it being canvassed or it being suggested that this was the outcome of a series of public discussions or debates of any kind. It was announced on budget night as a fait accompli not to improve the health system but to achieve a certain revenue objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said earlier that one wonders about and questions the validity of the numbers and the extrapolations. We, on this side, accept that there may be some validity. If you recall, in the previous parliament we looked at reducing the numbers of students going into medicine&mdash;not by restricting those who were coming out from being able to practise but by curtailing entrance into training programs, which would have an effect. It would be foolish of us to say that there may be no linkage. Certainly, in that discussion a couple of years ago a lot of people suggested that our <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6449"> data and our conclusions may have been faulty. But we were discussing it at the entry point, not at the exit point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we had heard those opposite canvassing this view with the community, with the medical fraternity, with their own backbench in some public way, then what would have come forward would have been the result of a process. What we have had is not a process at all; it has been a railroading. Those doing it are not doing it for the good of doctors, patients or the health system; they are doing it because of some mythical notion that they have on what can be spent on health vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis which part of health. The whole notion of how to apportion public expenditure is valid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard previous speakers talking about the effect of government spending and how the last government did dreadful things, and so on. The fact is that, during the time of the last government, the amount of public spending went down as a proportion of the country's wealth and capacity and the spending on health was maintained at a very regular level, and in world terms it was at a very respectable level. There has been no massive blow&hyphen;out in health costs. There has been no unacceptable surge or disproportionate spending on health vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis other issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea that this is somehow essential to save Medicare or to save the nation is just a nonsense. If the government had proposed this as a course of action for discussion, then we would have been happy to have discussed it. It would have been an interesting and perhaps useful discussion. If this was done, I do not doubt that at the end of the day the conclusion would have been quite different from what has been put forward now. If this had been discussed openly, it would have been found to be very unfair and very discriminatory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no reason why those young people who are currently embarked on a medical career of seven years duration or one year's duration should suddenly find the whole world changed without having had the chance to comment. The opposition, in proposing that these matters go to a parliamentary committee, is attempting to correct that failure.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that these amendments will not get through the parliament in this calendar year. They will sit in the Senate for months to come. That will be non-productive, anyhow. The fact is that these amendments were only brought in last week. They came in at the end of October, after being announced in August, and it is now November. That is appalling. That delay and that lateness by the government indicates that they consider this legislation to be of low priority&mdash;measures that came into force, supposedly, last Friday. The legislation came into the parliament last week, four days before it was to take effect. What a disgraceful performance. What an insult to these people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than having these amendments sitting in the Senate doing nothing, the idea of them going to a committee allows for there to be some public input. The government may well find that there are better ideas available. It may well find that there are other consequences or impacts that it has not thought about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the government has not thought about these amendments very much at all. To watch what has come forward and to watch the government attacking the messenger, if you like&mdash;and I notice that the remarks of the minister have been increasingly hostile&mdash;indicates that very little thought went into this. No cogent argument has been put forward in their support. There simply has been this mantra that `this is to save Medicare' somehow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6450"> The fact is that that does not wash with anybody with any depth of knowledge on this issue. It certainly does not wash with anyone with any sense of compassion if you are to save Medicare, supposedly&mdash;and that is a nonsense&mdash;at the expense of your own credibility and at the expense of the careers of many young people. Those young people, I can assure the government, are extremely angry&mdash;and not just angry, but well informed. They see this for the charade that it is and are offended at the way with which it has been dealt. They are offended that they were not given a chance to talk about it or even canvass it in any form whatsoever. Whatever they have put forward since the announce ment was made has been attacked by the minister and by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just point out that, in the Brisbane <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>, which is not known to be a radical newspaper or a supporter of the Labor Party in any form&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would have thought the member would have had different views. Most Australians, I would have thought, would consider the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>  to be a fairly conservative newspaper. An article in that newspaper quotes the minister as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . some young doctors had made wildly inaccurate claims about the effects of government policies on their job prospects . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Here he is, `on their job prospects', attacking them. This is the minister who will not give up his Medicare provider number for somebody else. If he had said, `Okay, I'll turn my number in and a young graduate can have it' he might have had some credibility. But this is two-jobs Michael: he wants to be both a minister and a practitioner. This is the guy who wants to lecture them about their job prospects, whilst having two jobs of his own. He is so committed and so confident of his future that he cannot turn in his provider number. What kind of message is that sending to these people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the minister then goes on to say that he would be disappointed if his comments were seen to be an attack on doctors. Sure, these people are not doctors yet&mdash;and a lot of them never will be now, in the real sense of the word. They may be able to call themselves doctors, but they will not be able to charge for their services because they will have to go through a whole stack of hurdles and hoops. If this legislation is passed, we will all expect&mdash;and with some justification, I think&mdash;the hurdles to become more and more complicated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once you get change into the first level, it is much easier to change the curriculum, the entry levels, the assessment&mdash;and who makes decisions as to who will be the 400? Is it done with marbles? Will we have a lottery for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them, as with the old conscription system back in the 1960s? Will it be done on birth dates? Will it be done on their sex? Will it be all males or all females? Who knows? Will there be another set of exams around Australia comparing graduates from Newcastle, Sydney, and everywhere else? What kinds of hurdles will be involved? Who will be the judges? Will the minister judge? He is drawing the rules up for someone else to administer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is social engineering of the very worst kind because it is blind. It has no social basis, no thesis on which it is founded and, therefore, no rules that will govern its operation. This is blind stuff&mdash;pick a number out of the air; quantify X million dollars and give it to someone else to administer. And you wonder why these young people are so angry! These people will stay angry. Whatever happens, they will stay angry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has done itself a great deal of harm in the eyes of some of Australia's best and brightest young people. What stupidity. Why has the government done this&mdash;to save Medicare? They say no; they say the opposite. I also thought some of the comments that have been made by some of the other commentators are interesting. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you yourself have time to go through them, given the debates of the last 13 years on health and Medicare, I think you also would find very ironic the situation in which you are being placed now as the latest and best social engineers par excellence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6451"> In the amendments other changes also are being proposed which are again sleight-of-hand&mdash;and they are changes to the complex procedures. I think we all understand that this has been a capacity which has been rarely used. A very small amount of money per year has been involved in that, but it did give a capacity for very special cases to be dealt with. That being wiped out is quite stupid, particularly for those of you with rural electorates where doctors may be toiling for many hours on what may end up being a very minor case but on which, because of isolation, complexity and access to transport, they could in fact spend a long time. I am surprised that you are supporting this. No, I am not sur prised. I guess I should know better by now. I am not surprised at what the government does any more. I may have been for the first few weeks, but not since the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the other part that is of concern is the question of how we are to work out the issue of overseas doctors.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will address some of the issues raised by the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) when I finish what I have prepared to say. The Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 is a piece of legislation that will not only secure the longer term viability of Medicare, contrary to what we have just heard, but with it the professional and financial base of general practice. It will do so through changes to the availability of Medicare provider numbers and measures to contain growth in two areas which have been of major concern to the previous government and also this one and that is in pathology and radiology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill introduces changes in three important areas, the first of which is Medicare provider numbers. From 1 November 1996 only those who have either trained, whether it be in specialist or general medical practice, or those who are in the process of training in a supervised training program will be issued with a Medicare provider number. A provider number, for those who do not know, is necessary before a service provided by a medical practitioner will attract a Medicare benefit. The estimated savings over the four years of the forward estimates are in the vicinity of $570 million. But I do accept the concerns of those who wonder how we may have arrived at that figure. Who knows? It may be higher. Let us hope it is not lower.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second major area of change is Medicare benefit restructuring, most notably in pathology where benefits will increase by six per cent in the next financial year but with a cap on the total funds available for pathology triggering a reduction in fees should the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amount of money being spent go over budget in the pathology area. This form of agreement is historic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As someone who has represented the medical profession in my former life I believe that people should not underestimate the importance of the arrangement at which the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has arrived with the Royal College of Pathologists of Australia, the Australian Association of Pathology Practices and also the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists in radiology restructuring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the first time we have an agreement in a fee for service system which will cap the total amount of money which the Commonwealth will commit to a particular program. There is provision for renegotiation of the agreement to take into account significant changes in the emergence of significant new tests and diseases. The savings there are not insignificant&mdash;$344 million are anticipated over the four years of the forward estimates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a similar fashion, radiology restructuring, including nuclear medicine, which will be implemented progressively from 1 November 1996, has been developed in cooperation with the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists and the Australian and New Zealand Association of Physicians in Nuclear Medicine. The measures will promote more appropriate, quality, cost-effective diagnostic imaging practice by introducing multiple service rules&mdash;similar rules apply in surgery&mdash;so that, if a radiology provider provides one service and then in conjunction with that a second one is provided, that second service and subsequent services may attract a lower benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, there are targeted changes to fee relativities, item restructuring and a move toward capital sensitive items, which has to be in the interests of everyone, particularly radiologists who are spending an enormous amount of money on capital and also patients who rely on the services being provided. The benefit needs to relate in some way to the capital intensive nature of the service being provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other important thing for which the minister has not been given specific credit&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6452">and I include the medical profession in that&mdash;is a review of the ultrasound arrangements in light of the forthcoming report by the Australian Health Technology Advisory Committee. Over the next two years an accreditation system will be developed in consultation with both professional bodies. I think that reflects a growing maturity at least in the pathology and radiology areas of the medical profession. Again, $241 million over the four years of the forward estimates is a significant contribution to turning the government's deficit into surplus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> However, the most contentious aspect of the bill is the decision to restrict Medicare provider number eligibility to medical graduates who have either successfully completed postgraduate training or who are in the process of undertaking such training. Given the complexity of modern general practice and the reasonable demands of community expectation, it is not unreasonable to expect someone who has completed an undergraduate degree to specifically train for family medicine. A six-year degree does not, even though it is long and arduous, prepare you for family medicine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember when I left the teaching hospital environment I spent six months working in a neonatal intensive care unit. When I went into general practice I could resuscitate a baby; in fact, I could do almost anything with a seriously ill baby, but the problems people bring their children to you for in general practice are quite different. These days, despite what some students may feel, it does require formal postgraduate training. As such, I think this measure is to be applauded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such training can only raise the professional esteem of general practice and, ultimately, secure the financial base of a discipline that will require a total of 10 years of rigorous training. When those on the other side, as they most certainly have done in the past and I am sure will continue to do, criticise the incomes of doctors, just remember that they have to get in the top one per cent to get in there in the first place. They will then have to take 10 years of extremely rigorous training. They will have to go through all kinds of hoops. We are now introducing the last of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them:  having completed their degrees, only a limited number will be able to get into postgraduate training. People ought to hose themselves down a bit when they criticise the incomes of these people once they finally get there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the government's perspective, there is also the pressing economic need for such a decision as there is a clear relationship between the number of doctors there are and the expenditure on the medical services. For example, in metropolitan Sydney the number of pathology services provided per head of population is seven times higher than in rural New South Wales. This year the Commonwealth will spend about $19.4 billion on health. In 1995-96 the Labor government allocated $18.4 billion. Of the $7.3 billion allocated for the Medicare benefit schedule about $6.1 billion is budgeted this year to flow directly to doctors who are billing services reimbursed under Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Outlays on Medicare services grew at 9&half; per cent a year between 1985 and 1994, mainly because of the increase in per capita number of services provided annually to patients. The member for Newcastle, who understandably is concerned about the sustainability of Medicare, ought to reflect on the fact that 9&half; per cent growth per annum over a decade and 5&half; per cent real growth per annum over the last three years is hardly a recipe for sustainability. Any responsible government, if it is committed to Medicare, has to do something substantial to address that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the past three years&mdash;it is worth focusing on that for a moment&mdash;there has been 5&half; per cent real growth per annum. Those in business, I am sure, would love to see growth of those proportions, but in a government expenditure program you simply cannot sustain that. Particularly, it is unsustainable in an economy with an underlying growth rate of between two per cent and three per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The number of providers&mdash;that is, the number of doctors&mdash;increased from 27,807 in 1984 to 39,812 in 1994-95. Over the same period of time, the Australian population increased 14.6 per cent. So there was a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6453"> disproportionately large growth in the number of providers when contrasted with the general growth in population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an environment where, by the very nature of medical practice, the consumer or patient is unable to know whether they really do need the service and providers have an obvious interest in providing it, the process is further skewed by the absence of a price signal to the consumer in over 70 per cent of cases, which of course refers to bulkbilling. It is little wonder, then, that doctors have at times powerful incentives to drive service provision to a level that meets income expectations. That is why we find that doctors working in overdoctored areas, particularly in inner Sydney and Melbourne, are able to sustain an income where one might reasonably question whether there is sufficient demand for the services they are providing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although I appreciate that this is a contestable statement, the recent Australian medical work force benchmark study, prepared by the Australian Medical Work Force Advisory Committee, estimated that on the basis of a reasonable patient workload there is a 19 per cent oversupply of equivalent full-time general practitioners in Australia, most of whom are in capital cities&mdash;930 in Sydney and 414 in Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provision of services seems to reflect doctor presence as well as patient need. In order to give members an understanding of that, looking at the Medicare benefits paid per capita in a number of electorates will illustrate the point. For the year 1993-94 for example in Kalgoorlie, Medicare spent $137 per head of population. In the New South Wales electorate of Parkes, $229 was spent per man, woman and child. In Wentworth in Sydney, $461 was spent per man, woman and child. In Melbourne Ports, $413 was spent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Morbidity and mortality figures are worse in rural areas, yet the per capita Medicare expenditure is lower. Every extra general practitioner practising full time generates 7,000 services annually and costs about $200,000 in Medicare outlays. At the moment, the net number of doctors billing under Medicare is growing by just over two per cent a year, or around a thousand a year. If these <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> doctors go into city areas, the net gain to the community is marginal, but the cost to the taxpayer is extremely high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real contributor to growth in the net number of active doctors, those who are actually using their provider numbers&mdash;the member for Newcastle, with this nonsense he is on about, ought to remember that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) is not practising at the moment; he is putting 200 per cent of his time into trying to turn around the mess we were left by the previous government&mdash;for billing under Medicare, which, as I said, reached 39,812 in 1994-95, was overseas trained doctors. In fact, the overseas share of growth each year for the last decade has averaged about 25 per cent each year. In 1994-95, for  example, 758 local graduates became active using Medicare provider numbers, whereas 303 overseas trained doctors commenced the use of provider numbers. In other words, the number of local contributors to Medicare utilisation was double that of those coming from overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the announcements by the government of new arrangements for overseas trained doctors, I hope that the government may be able, as we go along&mdash;this is a personal perspective&mdash;to reconsider a short program, perhaps over a period of a few years, to constantly keep under review the number of training positions which are available in general practice. If there is, as I hope will appear, a significant reduction in the number of overseas doctors taking up provider numbers, then perhaps if things are not working out for our current crop of medical students and interns we may still be able to come in well underneath the forward estimates in the budget, maintain the integrity of the budget and make sure that those who wish to have access to general practice training. I am confident that the minister will be keeping the situation under review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you examine the issue of overseas trained doctors, you see that there has been a sharp increase in the number of New Zealand doctors. For example, in 1994-95 there was a net increase&mdash;that is, those coming in less those going out&mdash;of 182 from New Zealand. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6454"> Most of those went to Queensland and New South Wales; however, when you look more closely, you see that many of the New Zealand registered doctors were actually born in third country locations. For example in 1994-95, 232 New Zealand citizen doctors arrived. Ninety-six were not New Zealand born. Of those, 39 were from Sri Lanka, 23 were from the UK and 10 were from India.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment there are up to 2,000&mdash;this is another major problem&mdash;migrant doctors living in Australia who are yet to begin the accreditation process. Of these, according to the census data I could see, there are 857 Chinese born. These are persons who claim medical qualifications at degree level living in Australia as at 1991, yet only 37 are actually practising as doctors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue this bill will be addressing is temporary visa doctors. The bill requires equivalence of qualification but, with the agreement of the minister, labour work force agreements will enable continued use where it is essential. I think that is a point worth making for those in regional seats and those who are, understandably, concerned about doctors getting into rural areas. Temporary visa doctors will still be able to come. The minister will be required to make sure they meet a standard which is acceptable here in Australia. But, importantly, the minister will be able to use discretion in making decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995-96, about 600 of the total 870 visas issued were to newly sponsored doctors entering from overseas, the great majority of whom arrived in the past year. They need to be sponsored by an employer, of which Queensland is the dominant source. Four hundred and eighty-one sponsors were approved in 1994-95 and 383 were approved last year, despite a labour market agreement of 65, hence the value, if you like, of labour market agreements for the medical work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The implications of this high dependence on temporary visa doctors is rather serious. Because visas can be renewed and a temporary visa doctor can stay in Australia potentially for up to four years, there may be as many as 2,000 temporary visa doctors in Australia. Although many of them are sala ried, many actually work, particularly in Queensland, as medical superintendents, with limited rights at private practice and therein access to Medicare provider numbers, and also as locums. These people are obviously adding significantly to the provider induced growth in Medicare outlays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So when we talk about the excess capacity of undergraduates who may not be employed in the private sector, it is worth keeping in mind the number of doctors coming from overseas who are currently providing services which Australians clearly need and which Australian graduates are unwilling or unable to fill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People need to understand&mdash;this gets to the heart of where the concern is&mdash;that young doctors and interns are not opposed to the idea of postgraduate training. What they are concerned about is the fact that there is a limit to the number of training positions that are available. For example, this year there were about 550 applicants for the 400 positions available for the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners training program. But as someone who knows these people inside out and back to front, I can also tell you that within that 550 will be a group who do not really know what they want to do. Their cut&hyphen;off date for application was in July. They do not really know what they want to do but, just to cover bases, they will apply for a training program, in this case general practice training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6455"> A summary of the picture that we now face is that we have 1,200 Australian graduates a year. That is down from around 1,500 in the mid&hyphen;1980s. In Australia we decided that we had a need to reduce the number of doctors, so we started planning to do that. At the same time we had an exponential growth in the number of doctors wishing to come here from overseas. The overseas trained doctors now, pre&hyphen;January 1997, will be able to sit the Australian Medical Council exam twice. I understand there may be a very small quota on those who will be able to then get access to the College of General Practitioners training program. After January 1997 there will be no limit, but they will not be able to get a provider number for 10 years. That is emi nently reasonable to say the least. In fact, personally, I think it ought to be longer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those 1,200 graduates we produce now in Australia&mdash;depending on which figures you wish to accept&mdash;the minister and the department are suggesting that the number of training positions in specialist practice may be as high as 760; some would suggest even higher. We also have 400 positions at the moment in the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and another 20 positions in subspecialties in family medicine&mdash;for example, sports medicine and venereology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the rural work force, this bill addresses things which are very important to people in rural areas. Young doctors will be able to get temporary provider numbers to go and do locum and relief work for doctors in rural areas. That work is to be negotiated, but those who go and work for, perhaps, three or four years in a rural or regional hospital will then get preferential access to the College of General Practitioners training program and 18 months credit for what they have already done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The temporary visa doctor labour work force agreements will be maintained and the minister will have ministerial discretion over that, which is essential. We still have $16 million a year going to the rural incentives program. We have put $20 million a year into a program to help the rural hospitals employ young doctors. We have provided $1 million a year to assist in employing locums in rural areas and $26 million over four years to establish university departments of general practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those 100 or so who miss out on training positions approximates the number who do generally pursue salaried, research, administrative and other non&hyphen;clinical positions. With the overseas trained doctor position, there is, I believe, within the confines of the budget, the option possibly available to the government at a later date to closely monitor and perhaps re&hyphen;examine the number of training positions which are, in fact, available in family medicine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst this bill deals specifically with the supply side measures, how much longer can we cling to the noble but, in my opinion, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unsustainable notion of a free health care service for all as often and as much as we want irrespective of the financial and social circumstances we are in? At some stage in the future the government of Australia will have to address that issue, but at the moment this government is very committed to maintaining the bulk&hyphen;billing arrangements&mdash;I think people know my views on this, but such are the disciplines of being in government, I will be supporting this bill and obviously supporting the policies of the government. This is a very important measure. Those students and young graduates who have portrayed the minister as being uncaring are completely out of order.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The introduction of Medicare was probably the former Labor government's most important social reform. It ensures basic medical and hospital cover for all Australians and we should all take an active interest in its survival.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those of us on this side of the House certainly share the government's determination to keep the costs of Medicare under control because we all know that coalition members do not really believe in it and we must be forever vigilant to ensure that they do not find an excuse to abolish it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that they resent its success. We know that they dislike its universality. We know, as I said when speaking to the national health pharmaceutical amendments bill, that members on the other side resent the fact that Medicare has been so overwhelmingly embraced within the Australian community. They resent the fact that Australians love  Medicare and they resent the fact that, as a consequence, they have been forced to put aside their ideologically driven feelings on Medicare&mdash;put those on the backburner&mdash;and at least appear to, at this stage, be supporting Medicare. We must beware of the wolf in sheep's clothing. When seeking to find the government's real attitude to Medicare, we really need to go back to 1993 and John Hewson's Fightback program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fightback was of course a blueprint for Medicare's destruction. It would have been a body blow to all those Australians with the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6456"> least ability to cushion the blow&mdash;low income families and the aged in our community. We do need to be forever vigilant to ensure that Medicare remains strong and remains financially viable in order to keep the wolves on the other side at bay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what a strange way to keep the costs of Medicare under control. What another arbitrary approach to the problem. The Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) will deny medical graduates a Medicare provider number if they have not completed postgraduate education. The measure will deny up to 400 Australian graduates the right to practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not challenge the concept that graduates should undertake postgraduate training prior to being allowed to practice as general practitioners. My great concern is the fact that this bill does act retrospectively and will hit medical students for six. Young Australians who have now spent up to six years studying to be a general practitioner will be absolutely devastated if this bill is adopted in this form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to provide honourable members with a real life example of the impact this will have on medical students, I want to read for the House a copy of a letter sent to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) from a constituent of mine who has a son in his final year at medical school. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition has through the election campaign, and its brief period in government, promoted its image as the paragon of sound and responsible economic management. Even the most junior manager knows that an organisation's most economic resource is the motivational and intellectual quality of its people. It is elementary management practice to demonstrate to the stakeholders in any system that they are highly valued.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is therefore incomprehensible to the logical thinking elector, that your Department intends to put on the scrap heap the aspirations of at least 400 + per year of the brightest young people the schools and universities are able to produce. I of course refer to the budget proposal to limit the number of Medicare Provider Places. It makes no economic or political sense to create a large pool of disgruntled and hostile young doctors within the Health Care System.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, we have seen some examples of that over the last few days&mdash;that is, the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> disgruntlement among students and young doctors. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both your training and experience as a practising doctor added to your political experience at a consistently high level must make you one of the best qualified Ministers for Health that this Country has seen. It therefore saddens me greatly that you have allowed the Public Service to lose the plot so badly on the issue of young doctors and the demographics of rural medical practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My own experience of dealing with and observing the Public Service culture tells me that the Government has induced a budget cutting fever into that culture. Regrettably the Public Service often behaves like an animal trained to perform useless tricks to please its political master. Quite clearly, on this issue the Public Service mind set has been to throw up any scheme to meet the imperative without spending the time or having the wit to arrive at a better solution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The virtual reality portrayed on the Public Service computer screens bears little relation to the real world. Fiscal measures resulting from a simplistic internal beam country exercise do not take into account the true financial cost to the community and individuals or the political consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your professional colleague and Parliamentary counterpart in NSW ultimately trusted his own professional and political judgement having been let down badly by the Public Service advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a medical consumer whose family has collected some pages of signatures to the AMA petition to the parliament, I urge you to consider this matter.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Graham Smith, the author of that letter, also provided me with a copy of a petition to the minister containing some hundreds of petitioners from my own home town of Cessnock. I want to say, without risk of embarrassing or offending my constituent, he is by no means a paid&hyphen;up member of the Australian Labor Party, but he does have a son in his final year of medical school. It has been suggested that the cost to the family of putting his son through medical school is in the order of some $400,000, and that is without taking into account the cost imposed on the government and the taxpayer. Mr Smith is very distressed about his son's prospects, and understandably so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the impact the move will have on female graduates? In recent years there has been a marked and healthy increase in the number of female graduates entering the field of medicine. A survey recently undertaken by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6457"> the New South Wales medical board showed that 36 per cent of medical practitioners working in New South Wales who are between the ages of 24 and 40 are female. In the range of 50 to 75, women make up just 13 per cent of the medical work force. This sudden restriction on the availability of Medicare provider numbers, I fear, will set back that healthy growth in the participation rate of women. In addition, postgraduate programs tend to be too rigid and are dominated by a male culture. Work needs to be done to change this culture before enforcing postgraduate requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My overriding concern is about the impact this bill will have in rural Australia where, as many in this place know&mdash;or all should know&mdash;we have a shortage of some 500 GPs. For me, it is perfectly logical and, indeed, simple arithmetic that, if you reduce the total pool of medical practitioners, you by virtue of that then exacerbate the shortage of doctors in rural Australia. Surely, that is incontestable.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government does have a good rural package. I am pleased to see that it has maintained the previous government's commitment to rural adjustment, but it is not happening quickly enough&mdash;nowhere near quickly enough. A lot more work needs to be done, and that work should be done before taking this very drastic action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at the extent of the problem in towns in my electorate. The parliamentary research paper on this bill tells us that the ratio of doctors to residents in New South Wales ranges from 183.2 GPs per 100,000 people in Sydney to some 67.9 per 100,000 people in the Murrumbidgee. I can break down those figures even further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the town of Merriwa in my electorate, the ratio is about one doctor for 1,175 people <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or, to work on the 100,000 population basis, 43 doctors for every 100,000 people. In the township of Singleton, we have one doctor per 1,428 people or, to use that same ratio again, 70 doctors per 100,000 people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the problem in my electorate is very real. Of course, the shortage of rural doctors in country towns has an impact on the local economy. A further reduction in the service of GPs may very well represent the final nail in the coffin of many rural towns. We have seen so many attacks on regional and rural Australia since this government was elected only seven months ago&mdash;the abolition of the division of regional development and the revocation of drought assistance in many areas of my electorate. Things like the sale of Telstra, cuts to labour market programs and cuts to skillshare impact disproportionately upon towns in rural Australia. This shortage of GPs represents another whack indeed. It is a real threat to rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At my final meeting as a councillor with Cessnock City Council, the council was actually considering a notice of motion, from one of my fellow councillors, suggesting that the council needed to somehow act to subsidise the rent of a GP practising in Greta, a town in my electorate, in order to retain that doctor. The councillor could see what a devastating impact the loss of that doctor could have on that town. While obviously it may have been a little bit foolhardy for the council to get involved in such practices&mdash;something outside of its jurisdiction&mdash;it was a very good example of how badly the shortage of a doctor can impact upon a town.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, equity in health implies that everyone should have a fair opportunity to attain their full health potential and, more pragmatically, that no-one should be disadvantaged from achieving this potential if it can be helped. It is so important that we make health services just as available in rural Australia as they are in our urban and city areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The approach the government has taken attempts to tackle the problems highlighted in the system in a very reactive rather than what I believe should be a pro&hyphen;active manner. As I said, the former government did have in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6458"> place a number of fine initiatives, among them the rural incentive program, to encourage a more equitable distribution of general practitioners across the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were negotiating with the universities to ensure that more places were given to rural students. At the end of the day, it is those people from rural Australia who are more likely to return to rural Australia. This is a very important area and one on which the government should be placing far more concentration rather than using this very blunt tool. As I said, I note that the government has maintained its commitment in some of these areas, but it needs to do much more, rather than simply use this very blunt tool of restricting Medicare provider numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at what some groups in my electorate are doing with some of those incentives introduced by the former Labor government. The University of Newcastle has used a $134,000 grant, funded by the Rural Undergraduate Steering Committee, originally as part of the rural incentives program, to develop undergraduate medical education in rural areas. Students now spend their general practice attachment in year 5 in a rural area, and that is compulsory. Fifty students from the first and second years will be doing electives in rural areas this year. More than half the second-year students have done population medicine research projects on rural health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Students from rural areas are now eligible for entry into the Newcastle University medical course with a TER of 85, whereas urban and city students are expected to achieve a TER of 90. They are trying to encourage more students from rural high schools to apply for entry into medicine at Newcastle. All of these initiatives were originally funded by the Labor government. Fortunately, it appears that the government is embracing them. But much more needs to be done, rather than turning to this very blunt tool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome Dr Woodridge's announcement about the 10-year moratorium on overseas trained doctors. But both the opposition and I are concerned that the proposals do not go far enough. I simply want to support what our shadow minister has had to say about the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> expansion in the maximum gap payable under the Medicare schedule fee. I think this is just another arbitrary figure drawn down. I think that what is happening with most of these measures is that the government works out what sort of money it wishes to raise, divides it among the services and works out what the charge should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, the pension co-payment for pharmaceuticals: work out a general revenue target and work out what you then need to increase the pharmaceutical co-payment by. The same applies to the $20 for non-concessional cardholders&mdash;another arbitrary figure. This is starting to be a clear mark of the approach of the government to many of its budgetary initiatives. I support our shadow minister in what he has had to say about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call upon the House to reject this proposal as an overreaction and a measure which gets it all wrong. It puts the cart before the horse. I implore the government to go back to the drawing board and start working very hard on addressing this problem we have in rural and regional Australia before it gets the blunt tool out and screws medical students to the wall. It is about time that this government realised that people should come before money. It really is out of control in its determination to wind the budget back into surplus. Really, if it put in place initiatives to promote economic growth, that problem would take care of itself.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) has raised this issue of the problem about rural doctors because that is precisely the reason why I support the measures in this Health Insurance Amendment Bill. He quoted figures from his electorate. I note that my electorate is mentioned in the same document. It has the worst figures in the state of Victoria in its proportion of rural doctors&mdash;70.7 per 100,000. So no-one is more conscious of the difficulty that rural hospitals and rural practices have in attracting Australian doctors than I am.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6459"> Given the member for Hunter's comments, the problem is that he does not really understand how this particular measure in this bill fits into a suite of policy measures being addressed by the government. The govern ment has recognised the serious nature with regard to the supply of rural doctors. I am pleased to have the support&mdash;finally, after three years&mdash;of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) and the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson). This is not something that has been decided in a hurry. We have spent quite an amount of time developing policy over the last three years. I am very pleased that some of my concerns are finally being addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me take a little time to explain why I am comfortable that this measure, coupled with many of the other announcements the government is making, is going to address my problem. There are a total of 24 hospitals in my electorate. In the three years that I have been the member for Mallee, I have been involved in the process of attracting doctors to 12 of them. Of those 12 doctors placed so far, only two have been Australians. The hospitals went through an immensely difficult time advertising locally, within the state, across the nation and then, finally, they had to resort to advertising internationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not something that a hospital or a medical practice chooses to do lightly. It takes 18 months. After the hospital has secured a suitable applicant who is keen, the applicant then has to satisfy the medical board on qualifications and then satisfy the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on all of those issues. It is a prolonged, tortuous process. As I have said, along with all the other measures being announced, I am comfortable that this decision, coupled with the announcement made by the minister in regard to overseas doctors, will finally address a desperate problem in my electorate, although it may be some time before these measures will have an effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the bill specifically relates to the requirement for medical graduates to complete postgraduate education prior to gaining access to the Medicare schedule and to allow regulations to be made to reduce the Medicare benefit payable when multiple services are rendered. The member for Bradfield has covered those broader initiatives quite well, so I will not take time addressing those.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of these arrangements are somewhat complicated to explain. I certainly have had a number of young graduates and their parents from my electorate approach me. After I have explained the broad objectives and vision that we have, they become comfortable. It is not about restricting the career path of doctors: there are so many other options available to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hospitals often complain to me that it is difficult to attract and keep doctors in the public hospital system because it is so readily easy for them to gain access to a provider number and move across into private practice. What this part of the bill does is to limit the sort of expected unfettered right to be underwritten at taxpayers' expense through the Medicare system, which has other flow-on benefits. I am quite confident that after a period the direction we plan these measures to take will have effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill results from the 1996 budget decision to restrict access to the Medicare system and is often referred to as a decision to restrict the number of Medicare provider numbers&mdash;which must be held for a doctor to assess Medicare benefits. The scheme focuses on what is an important aspect of this whole issue of rural doctors&mdash;that is, education&mdash;rather than on an ad hoc or arbitrary system of ballot for the availability of provider numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of this is strongly linked to the supply of doctors. It continues to amaze me that I have regular requests from medical clinics and hospitals across my electorate, so frustrated by the fact that no Australian doctor has applied for an advertised position. Other speakers have mentioned&mdash;and it is recorded in the Australian Institute of Health estimates&mdash;that apparently there is an oversupply of 4,500 general practitioners, mostly located in metropolitan areas, whilst electorates like Mallee and Hunter suffer a shortage&mdash;a shortage in total across the nation of 500 general practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time for some action on this. I am disappointed that we cannot get the support of those on the other side. It is not about dismantling Medicare at all. It is essentially budget related. But I am absolutely delighted <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6460"> because it is, once and for all, going to be part of a suite of measures to address my urgent problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me describe some of the experiences that I have had. Currently the city of Mildura, which has a huge base hospital servicing a metropolitan city population of 22,000 people and a regional population of about 45,000 people, is currently desperately short of nine practitioners. They have been advertising and doing all the right things to try to attract Australian doctors, but desperate measures drive people to desperation. They sent their executive officer overseas on a recruitment drive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can imagine the impact that the absence of nine practitioners has on the economics of a hospital. So far, only two of the nine positions have been applied for by Australian doctors. It is not just a problem for small hospitals out in isolated areas. Sunraysia and the city of Mildura are part of a very strong population centre with tremendous lifestyle and education advantages, yet it is still difficult to attract doctors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provincial city of Horsham down in the Wimmera, which has a city population of about 13,500 people and a regional population of about 25,000, is trying to attract two specialists&mdash;an anaesthetist and a gynaecologist. So it is not just the small hospitals that are having difficulties; it is the large provincial centres as well. The fact that doctors have such ready access to their provider numbers makes it far too easy for them to stay in a metropolitan centre and not be attracted to rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two modifications to the government's policy relating to the attraction of doctors in rural areas was announced in question time here on 15 October. The minister has made an even stronger statement about overseas doctors since that time. I received a phone call from one of my very small hospitals as a result of that announcement. It was from a community with a population of 300 people. Two and a half years ago their hospital was in desperate strife. It is a very small hospital. In the six months following my election to the seat of Mallee in 1993 their hospital <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> suffered a massive loss of $250,000. The future of the hospital was substantially at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An overseas doctor finally indicated an interest, after 18 months. He was British trained and at that stage was practising in Saudi Arabia. From the time he indicated his interest to the time he finally arrived in Manangatang another eight months had passed. Had it not been for his arrival, there would be no hospital in Manangatang. It has been very pleasant to see the hospital rise from its demise since that time. Two Sundays ago I went to their annual general meeting where an announcement was made that the hospital made a profit of about $144,000. That was the impact that having a good doctor committed to the small rural community had on that hospital. They were so inspired that they invited an additional doctor to the community at Manangatang. He arrived last Sunday. But he is a foreign doctor from Afghanistan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those members from the other side who stand up and champion the cause of rural Australia had a long opportunity to address these important issues. Their approach was to fiddle with the supply of GPs. Most notable was the attempt to restrict the number of people entering medical courses. That attempt involved a planned reduction of approximately 200 students per year, but it failed when the Vice-Chancellors Committee could not identify more than 20 places that could be removed in the long term. I think they were a little insincere, although I would not accuse the member for Hunter of that. I know him better. I think it is probably more that he does not quite understand completely and seems a little nonplussed why those of us who represent rural areas are so eagerly supporting this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am absolutely confident&mdash;and I am grateful for the support of the minister at the table&mdash;that what has been a very serious problem and one that has consumed an enormous amount of my time in supporting my hospitals is finally being addressed. I urge all members of this House to support this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6461"> I would like to put on the public record the efforts of the new doctor in the small com munity of Charlton, with a population of about 1,000 people. He is a doctor whose ethnic origins are the former republic of Yugoslavia. He is a Croatian by birth. You can imagine the difficulties we had with his immigration procedure. The hospital was beside themselves, having sponsored his residency application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a moment of desperation, Dr Nik, as he is affectionately referred to by the Charlton community because he has absolutely fitted in there and he is 100 per cent committed to that hospital, tried to express his appreciation for the effort that I was undertaking on his behalf with the department of immigration. But I could tell by the tone in his voice that he was expressing some lack of confidence in my capacity to finally win the argument. I simply said to him, `Dr Nik, they will send you back to Croatia over my dead body. I can offer you a consultancy if you need it.' His visa was finally stamped on 2 September this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After a period of probably 12 months of complicated wrangling with the department of immigration and satisfying the medical board, the ultimate indicator of just how complex we have let this system become in respect of those overseas doctors who want to make a commitment to rural areas was a request to supply to the department of immigration a letter from the Commonwealth Employment Service saying that no Australian doctor had applied for the position. I ask you, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, from your knowledge of the medical profession, how many doctors would actually apply for positions through the CES. But we supplied that letter in compliance. It is just a delight to have a committed doctor such as Dr Nik Kosanovic in the Charlton community making a contribution and ensuring the longevity of that hospital in that vital and very important rural area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the legislative measures in the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) and I urge all members to do the same.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank honourable members for their contributions to this debate so far. I wish to foreshadow that I will be moving amendments to the Health Insurance Amendment <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Bill (No. 2) 1996. The amendments have been circulated in the House. I take the opportunity to present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under these amendments, all overseas trained doctors who have not registered to practise in a state or territory or commence the Australian Medical Council assessment process by 1 January 1997 will not be eligible to receive a Medicare provider number for billing under Medicare for at least 10 years. New Zealand trained doctors and overseas students who are graduated from an Australian medical school are included in this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be asking the Australian Medical Council to ensure that all applicants for the AMC exam, including those already here in Australia, will only get two further attempts or two attempts in total if they have yet to commence the exam, at a maximum of five years to complete the process, as this is in line with the opportunity given to Australian students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This move is long overdue. Australia graduates 1,200 medical students a year. Australia has immigrating to it approximately 600 further doctors a year. It is absolutely ludicrous that we take another 50 per cent over and on top of our graduation by way of overseas trained doctors. No other country allows this. We have found that, as other countries have progressively tightened their immigration requirements for doctors, we have become a target for many countries overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is necessary to bring New Zealand into this measure because otherwise New Zealand would have become a staging post for doctors wishing to enter Australia. Indeed, there is some evidence that this is happening already. On the best information that I can get, 32 doctors from one country entered Australia last year: having been born and trained overseas and having moved to New Zealand and taken up citizenship, they used this to have right of entry and practice into Australia. Similarly, with 11 per cent of medical graduates now full fee paying overseas students, we simply cannot control our medical supply numbers if these people have the opportunity <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6462"> of marrying, changing their status and circumventing the original requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two elements here. The first is that these people have come from overseas countries, usually our neighbours and friends, with the express intention of returning overseas at the end of their training. It is unfair to those countries from where they came, when those countries have sponsored them, for them to lose some of their best and brightest young people. Should they marry and decide to stay, we are not saying they cannot work as a doctor. There are many opportunities open to them. What we are saying is, `You cannot add to our oversupply of medical practitioners in private practice. You cannot circumvent the immigration requirements for Australia. You have an opportunity to apply for one of the 400 vacancies in public hospitals around Australia. You have an opportunity to apply for one of the 50 vacancies in the armed services or one of the vacancies that currently exist in my department. You can work in academia, you can work in industry. But you cannot get a Medicare provider number.' So, should someone decide to stay, there will be enormous opportunities open to them, but there will not be the opportunity to add to our oversupply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 also deals substantially with the issue of who can and cannot access Medicare provider numbers. It has been interesting to listen to the debate. I would suggest that this is a debate that will be looked upon in the future because there is no doubt that what we are debating here tonight is a turning point for Medicare. The choice is very simple. You can have a Medicare that is unsustainable and that is doomed to failure&mdash;and that is what we have at the moment&mdash;or you can have a Medicare that has some prospect of being sustainable over the long term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason is simple. Health has a demand curve that is relatively inelastic. People will demand much of it, regardless of the price. The OECD estimates that between 40 and 75 per cent of health costs are generated on the supply side of health. If we wish to have an open&hyphen;ended fee for service system, which we do, and if we wish to keep that affordable, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which it is barely, then we have no option but to look at the issue of supply of medical practitioners. If you have uncontrolled supply of medical practitioners and an open&hyphen;ended fee for service, you have catastrophe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Brian Howe, former Labor Deputy Prime Minister and health minister, understood that when he said that the unrestricted access to general practice was a time bomb that would destroy Medicare. Graham Richardson, a former Labor health minister, understood that when he told the AMA in 1993 that the system whereby provider numbers were given as a right of graduation could not be expected to continue indefinitely. Indeed, the AMA understood it when, in 1992, they passed a motion saying that doctors entering medical school could not expect training as a matter of right and course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The choice here is very simple. You either have a health system that is sustainable, you either have a Medicare that we can hope to finance in the long term, or you have something that will collapse. Over the last decade Medicare has increased six per cent per annum real compound and, in the end, has a budget of over $6.2 billion, larger than the budget of the entire state of Western Australia. That is not something that can go on forever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is absurd to suggest that you cannot make changes in medical career opportunities after someone enters medical school. If you wait another six years, there will be another 7,000 doctors in Australia adding to the oversupply already of GPs, just in urban areas, of 4,500. Nobody can expect that career opportunities will not change over six or seven years&mdash;and why should doctors be any different? Medicine is a very rapidly developing field. Some areas, such as laparoscopic surgery, barely existed seven years ago. With this sort of rapid development in opportunities, our health system must change to follow medical practice. To suggest otherwise is, quite frankly, breathtaking in its hypocrisy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1989, the rules were changed by the previous government overnight to introduce a vocational register. The government at that time firmly rejected any suggestions that they should wait until the current crop of medical <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6463"> students finished their training. And then, over the last four years, the rebate for non&hyphen;vocationally registered general practitioners has remained unchanged. Last year, quietly, in the budget, the previous Labor government took out of the forward estimates any increase in rebates for non&hyphen;vocationally registered general practitioners for the next four years over the forward estimates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, they made non&hyphen;vocationally&hyphen;registered GPs ineligible for GP practice grants. They firmly fixed the number of GP training places at 400 a year. And so they set the seeds for a large number of young doctors to have no prospect whatsoever of a career. Nobody could claim that people going into medical school, and young doctors affected by this legislation, have not been aware of the possibilities. As I said, two previous Labor health ministers have made it utterly clear. The AMA itself, in 1992, made it utterly clear. And that just shows the intellectual bankruptcy of the arguments against it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you believe the claims made by some people&mdash;young doctors and medical students in their national day of action&mdash;then, quite frankly, it would be impossible to make any changes whatsoever in medicine. I do not want to see well-trained young people delivering the mail as young doctors are in Italy or Belgium. Quite frankly, unless we bite the bullet and do what should have been done years ago, and do what was inevitable after the 1989 changes introduced by the previous government, that will happen. In the meantime, the uncontrolled increase of medical student numbers, of general practice numbers, will continue unabated and will mean the Medicare benefits schedule will continue to go out of control. That will mean to the overall health budget that I am severely restrained from doing anything in public health, in preventative medicine, in Aboriginal health and in medical research, because the whole budget is geared towards controlling an insatiable supply side driven increase in the Medicare benefits schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation also looks at overseas trained doctors and a quota and excludes Medicare from all those overseas trained doctors who have not registered with the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian Medical Council from 1 January 1997. The opposition says it wants this to go further. By that it means that it wants those doctors who have already registered to do the exam turned away and denied the opportunity to do so or they want an artificial quota put on doctors who have already commenced the AMC exam to be applied halfway through the process. The vast majority of these doctors are Australian citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are about 1,200 doctors registered with the AMC. On past experience, we can expect 400 or slightly more to pass eventually. Of those who have already commenced the exams&mdash;the clinical exams are under way at this very moment&mdash;we can expect about 280 to pass. It would be unreasonable and unfair to put a quota on those who are in the middle of the exam process now. The only effect of putting a quota on now would be to put a quota on the difference between those who pass this time and those who are likely to pass eventually, which is the difference between 280 and 400, which is 120. Given the quota that is being proposed generally&mdash;previously it was 200 and it has been suggested it might be 150&mdash;the fact is there are probably only another 120 to get through anyway. So a quota would be not only pointless and ineffective but unfair and discriminatory against a large number of Australian citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I considered this point very carefully. Much as it might be difficult for this country to have a lot of overseas trained doctors wanting to go under Medicare, the fact is that the majority of them are Australian citizens. Some came here at a time when we were actively recruiting doctors from overseas. I think it is only reasonable that we give them a chance to have their skills assessed. If their skills are up to standard, they will have a chance to work; if they are not up to standard, they will face the same choices that an Australian medical student faces, that is, to try to find a university which will take them in to get further training or to choose another career.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6464"> Those who do pass the AMC exam will be subject to the same requirements as other doctors. They will need additional postgradu ate training, and that is not before time. The effect of successive changes over several decades in health, to be fair, have meant that general practice is the dumping ground for medicine. That has left a bunch of general practitioners who are deskilled and of whom, according to Bob Douglas from the ANU survey last year, one&hyphen;third would leave tomorrow if there were something else they could do. Given that general practice is the primary health care network in Australia, I think that is a tragedy. General practice is a specialty area that deserves special recognition and that requires special skills. Two years of training in brain surgery or cardiology equip you not at all to go into general practice. It is about time we were prepared to give general practice the recognition it deserved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This does not mean that doctors will be on the scrap heap. As best we can determine, there are about 1,300 advanced training positions available in Australia this year and there are 1,200 doctors graduating. The 280 or so doctors who pass the AMC exam will not all come on stream at once. They will filter through the system over several years because of the requirement to do residency years. The fact is that there will be training for everyone who wants it. There will be the capacity to train somewhere, and it might actually mean that we get some trainees going to psychiatry, rehabilitation or occupational medicine&mdash;something that should have happened years ago. I feel no obligation to give every 25&hyphen;year&hyphen;old, second&hyphen;year doctor a guaranteed income for life so that they can go and bulkbill their head off in Medicare clinics up and down the Pacific Highway and earn $100,000 a year. I do not think any of the 80,000 people I represent in the seat of Chisholm think any differently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Claims have been made frequently, but rarely supported by any evidence, as to the impact this will have on women. The truth is this will have no particular impact on women doctors whatsoever. This is important because women make up over 50 per cent of medical student intakes. There is no reason why women should be trained any less in general practice or any other specialty. One of the specialities that particularly attracts women <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> graduates&mdash;anaesthetics&mdash;will have a substantially increased number of training places available because of the work done by Professor Horvath through AMWAC, the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Issues around fairness and gender equity in postgraduate training are issues of genuine concern, but they are not directly related to this measure. They are issues that I have raised with every specialty college that has come to see me and they are issues which I have had a keen interest in for over a decade. I will continue to pursue them with medical colleges, unlike the previous government, which made little change here in 13 years in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Medical schools are another aspect that this legislation affects. It has been put that we need more time to put pressure on the deans of medical schools to reduce numbers. The last Labor budget in 1995 proposed a reduction of 200 medical school places in Australia. As shadow minister, I went to the then minister for health and said, `This is a correct decision. I will back you 100 per cent. I will guarantee the support of the opposition. I will give you my word that you will have no criticism from me on this issue whatsoever'&mdash;as close to a free kick as you ever get in politics. She delivered 30.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that this has been an area that has been incapable of resolution. The fact is that it is time there was some action here, not some talk. The fact is the previous government had 13 years to act on this. They had a political vacuum. With the solid support of the opposition, they could still not deliver. How much more time do they think we should take?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the talks that I have had with the deans of medicine they have been helpful and cooperative. They have some particular problems that I am willing to attempt to address, but there is an issue here of national interest. After having talked about it for more than a decade, it is time we got some action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has also been substantial talk about the effect on country doctors. All I say to this is that the RDAA, the Rural Doctors Association of Australia, supports this measure because it understands it will help country <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6465"> practice. The preference that will be given to young doctors going to the country, to country hospitals and to the GP training program will be one of the best things that has happened to country hospitals in decades. I do not pretend that it is going to fix things overnight, but it will help. Along with the four new initiatives that we announced in the budget, it has some real prospect of addressing the issue of rural practice over time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also addresses issues relating to the Medicare benefits schedule. Again I say this is a dynamic thing. The coalition is committed to Medicare. We have made our peace with Medicare. But, if you do not continually adapt Medicare, it will die. We are attempting to adapt it in a fair way. We are attempting to see that it is sustainable in the future. I regret that the opposition has not grasped this basic fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end, we were left with a Medicare benefits schedule, as I said, bigger than the budget of Western Australia, increasing six per cent real a year at a time when there was an $8 billion deficit. Something had to give. These changes are sensible.</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(9.39 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is certainly a pleasure to participate in the debate this evening on the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. This bill will give legislative effect to 1996 government budget decisions that discontinue the payment of an untargeted operational subsidy to community based long day care centres from 1 July 1997; apply a reduced rate of entitlement to the child-care cash rebate for families on higher incomes, while retaining the current rate for families on lower incomes, this change to take effect from 1 April 1997; and introduce amendments aimed at clarifying eligibility issues and compliance requirements consistent with the intentions of the Commonwealth child-care cash rebate scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nature of the operational subsidy that had been applied to community based long day care centres had its origins back in 1972, and then was changed in 1985. So from 1972 to 1985 the operational subsidy provided to community based long day care centres equalled 75 per cent of the salaries of approved qualified staff based on attendance of children on a particular representative day. The funding formula was based on one nurse for each 20 children over the age of three; one teacher for every 15 children over the age of three; and one nurse for every 10 children under three years of age. Then in November 1985 the funding formula was changed and the amount of subsidy paid per child, based on approved places and utilisation rates, reduced the amount of operational subsidy on average by approximately 50 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a bit of experience with community based long day care centres in my electorate. We have a number of them, although they cater for the smaller percentage of children who attend long day care centres in the electorate. In fact, in my electorate of Lyne there are 43 centres servicing the requirements of families with long day care. In the community based long day care centres, there are 251 children; in the family day care section, there are 205 children; and in the private long day care centres there are 602 children. So <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6467"> community based long day care, 251; and privately provided places, 602.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I probably have had more experience with the community based long day care centres than the private providers. It was in 1985 as an alderman on the Greater Taree City Council&mdash;and we were known as aldermen in those days, not councillors&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MORRIS" NAMEID="HI4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr Peter Morris</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It's a nicer term, isn't it?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SU5">Mr VAILE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is a much nicer expression. I agree with the honourable member for Shortland. So in 1985 an opportunity was presented to us, there not being much provision of long day care centres in the community, particularly in regional Australia. There were preschools but not long day care centres. The Commonwealth government of the day was providing assistance, along with state and local government, through capital funding, to construct long day care centres.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The council decided at the time to provide the land and build two long day centres, one in Taree and one in Wingham. Interestingly enough, the Taree community based long day care centre was called Snugglepot and the Wingham community based long day care centre was called Cuddlepie. My second child, Prudence, at a very early age attended the community based long day care centre in Wingham. I was on the council steering committee that was managing both centres. Then we handed the management of those long day care centres over to a community based committee. There was still administrative support exercised by council, but the centres were managed by a community based committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With that sea change, as it seemed, people in the community thought, `Shock, horror, we'll never manage this.' The income streams were the same. The support, as far as the attendance of children, was the same. But there went that safety blanket of having the local government body responsible for it&mdash;and, of course, from day one the council recognised that at some stage in the future the operational subsidy may not be there.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So those long day care centres needed to be able to get themselves fairly commercially viable in the marketplace, as it were, establish a good reputation and get themselves through the accreditation process. But I make the point that, in changing from a management structure where a committee of the council was managing those two centres to a community based committee at arm's length from the local government body, just as many concerns were expressed then as are being expressed today about this current move the government is making with regard to community based long day care centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the lead-up to the budget&mdash;we were assisted in heightening awareness of some of the possible changes by members of the opposition front bench&mdash;I received a lot of representations from people in the community about the operational subsidies. What were the majority of those representations about? They were about the operational subsidies for family day care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge that family day care with operational subsidies removed would collapse. Family day care provides a real alternative in the community for working families, single parents, who need those services. Without doubt the majority of representation I received prior to the budget about any changes to subsidies to child&hyphen;care arrangements were with regard to the operational subsidy of family day care. We know that the government maintained the level of operational subsidy for family day care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Community based long day care centres have moved on since 1985. Eleven years later they are operating on 50 per cent of the subsidy they used to and have gone through that process and managed very well. I have complete confidence in the management of the community based long day care centres I know about in my electorate that they will be able to manage this change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will note in this package of legislation there is also $8.3 million being provided to assist community long day care centres to overcome the loss of the untargeted operational subsidy. When these centres were set up, from memory there was never any process gone through to target socioeconomically <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6468"> disadvantaged sections of the community or sections within the community that provided that service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is like so many other things that the government gets involved in in Australia. To kick something off, the government needs to be involved in it. We are such a large, diverse, remote country geographically with a small population and a small economy in relative terms. So in many instances the government has to start these institutions so we can get those services up and going, get a system in place, to the point where it can and should be able to stand on its own two feet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The child&hyphen;care cash rebate is still available to families in that income bracket who most need it, but the operational subsidy that was provided or is still provided to community based long day care centres was not targeted at any particular group. My daughter went to a long day care centre in my community. I was obviously not eligible to receive any child&hyphen;care cash rebate but the subsidy the government provides partly subsidised that position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is debatable as to whether the partial subsidy is $20 a week or $4 a week. There are all sorts of figures floating about. I am probably more inclined to accept the lower figure, but I am sure opposition members would run with the higher figure. But it was untargeted. The government is trying to make all assistance that is provided to the community generally more equitable and better targeted to the groups in the community who do need support. That is what this bill is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Community long day care centres will no longer receive the untargeted operational subsidy. In order to manage this change a number of special measures will be introduced to improve access for families with additional needs and to assist the long-term restructuring of these services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government funding over the next four years for the child&hyphen;care sector will include $526 million to retain operational subsidies for family day care, occasional care and outside school hours care; $31 million to support children with high levels of additional <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> need, particularly those with a disability; $12.5 million to ensure families in severely disadvantaged areas do not lose access to child care; $10.9 million to provide capital funding for new places under the targeted new growth strategy; and, as I mentioned earlier, $8.3 million to assist community long day care centres to overcome the loss of untargeted operational subsidy and to assist in that transition to restructure their financial management practices to accommodate these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bear in mind that community based long day care centres are not dealing with any overheads or servicing any loans to operate. Those facilities have been bought and paid for either by the Commonwealth or the state or, in our case, the local government body in the area. It will provide a more equitable service. I know there are detractors in here and out in the community who take issue with that being the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly enough, currently 200,000 or 70 per cent of children in child care are catered for by private operators, leaving the remaining 30 per cent subsidised by the government at an average of $20, although it would appear that generally only $4 of that figure has been passed on to the parents in fee relief. Bear in mind that child&hyphen;care cash rebate for families earning below the threshold for the family tax initiative cut&hyphen;offs will still be receiving that child&hyphen;care cash rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be a change for those above that level. The arrangements under the child&hyphen;care cash rebate scheme will mean families with a taxable income lower than the family income cut&hyphen;offs outlined in the family tax initiative, which is $70,000 for one&hyphen;child families plus $3,000 for each additional dependent child, will have their benefit maintained at 30 per cent of their claimable child&hyphen;care costs, while families with a taxable income greater than the family tax initiative cut&hyphen;offs will be entitled to a rate of benefit of 20 per cent. I believe that is a fair measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One other issue I wanted to raise, seeing as we are debating the provision of child&hyphen;care services at the moment, is the issue of accreditation and the process of licensing. Although these measures that are being <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6469"> introduced by the government address the untargeted nature of some of the subsidies, I believe there is still a need to address the licensing procedures that are in place. There are no linkages, to my knowledge, between the Commonwealth, who funds the places through fee relief, and the states, who actually license the building of new child&hyphen;care centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There does not seem to be any research done in a community to establish need. The local government body in my area, the Greater Taree City Council, through their community development officer, Mrs Mave Richardson, undertook a study of the number of places available in that particular council area, the number of children attending child&hyphen;care centres and the prospective number of children that are going to attend in the near future. They did that to get some sort of a handle on the need for new centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a fairly strong and sometimes bitter debate in the media over the approval of licensing and a building and development application approval for a new privately operated long day care centre in the area&mdash;obviously from other operators, both community based and private establishments as this was another private establishment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Department of Community Services in New South Wales is only interested in the criteria it has laid out to establish a licence for a long day care centre; that is, the required qualifications of the staff per number of children there from nought through to five years. It will go ahead and issue a licence with no relativity to the need in the area and no relativity to the impact on the Commonwealth with the provision of fee relief. It probably makes the point that there needs to be a bit more research done in that area as well as stronger communication between the Commonwealth and the states in providing what is a much needed service in all parts of Australia. Otherwise, the industry can keep growing like Topsy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue I will quickly touch on is that of accreditation. There seems to be a lack of consistency across the board with some of the representatives of the department who undertake the accreditation inspections in my home state of New South Wales. Certainly, it <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is a matter the minister may pay some attention to in that process to try to ensure that there is consistency across the board in the accreditation process for all child&hyphen;care centres, be they private or community based. I just put that on the record as something that is very important. The previous government did implement an accreditation system, which I understand is still in place. It is certainly necessary, as far as the Commonwealth is concerned, to ensure that the child&hyphen;care places the Commonwealth provides fee relief for are of a quality standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note the history of the provision of the operational subsidy for community based long day care centres from 1972 right through until 1996. They have come from that position through to where we are today. As I said, when we changed the management structure of our two centres in the Manning in 1985-86, there were a lot of concerns. I took a very positive attitude at the time that the people who were going to be charged with the responsibility of managing those centres under the new structure then were quite capable of continuing to provide a good service under the system that was going to be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a couple of years I actually chaired the community based management committee that had the oversight of those two centres. Today I have confidence in the people that run those centres to adapt themselves to the changes we have before us this evening and to provide those services in those facilities to people in the community who do need that particular level of care. These measures are going to be better targeted to those groups in the community who need the support of the Commonwealth and the taxpayers of Australia rather than to some people who have had access to support from the Commonwealth but who we believe are at a level of income which takes them out of that category of those who deserve a level of support from the Commonwealth. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Community based child-care centres are not&hyphen;for&hyphen;profit centres generally operated by the local council, a community organisation or a religious or charitable group. Such is the mix <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6470"> of these centres in the electorate of Calare. Of the 33 child&hyphen;care centres in this electorate, 26 are community based, community operated. Seven are privately operated. Some of these community centres, particularly in the smaller towns of the electorate, have depended on amounts like $3,000 and $4,000 a year for their operational subsidy, yet that amount is vital.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although community based child&hyphen;care centres are located in urban and rural Australia, they make up by far the largest number of centres in rural and remote areas. Why? Because commercial operators do not see long day care centres in these areas as viable, and they are not. The operating subsidy received by community based centres is used to offset the greater expense of operating a long day care centre in these rural and remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not as optimistic as the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile). The government's rationale is that the marketplace will deliver, that the playing field must be levelled to offer the same opportunities to private providers that are available for community centres. The level playing field has now reached the playground and again it is not level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give the example of the Blinky Bill Portland Child Care Centre. Let me paint a pen picture of Portland, the town the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said gave him his first indication of the overwhelming win in the March election. This is an indication that remains a bit of a mystery to me since the town of Portland, hit by the closure of cement works, downsizing and privatisation of the electricity industry and the nearby Lithgow ADI factory, limited job opportunities and only the coal mines offering a valuable income, turned against both Labor and coalition in March and returned an Independent to this parliament because it felt that this local member understood the difficulties and heartache economic rationalism would bring to towns like Portland, whichever party took office. So a coalition member would certainly not be standing here tonight detailing the bleak outlook for Blinky Bill Portland Child Care Centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Portland is a town of 2,000 people. Its child&hyphen;care centre services 75 families and 100 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> per cent of long day care users are on child-care assistance. Why isn't Portland attractive to a private child&hyphen;care provider? Well, two major employers have been lost to Portland since the early 1990s. Four businesses have closed in the last 12 months and others are reducing their service level. The only remaining bank&mdash;which bank?&mdash;is rumoured to be closing, although with some foresight and determination Lithgow Council has put it to the Commonwealth Bank by depositing its funds in that very branch, calling the bluff of the banks who are saying to each other, `Don't be the last one out of town.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the business climate in Portland. It is pretty depressing. Forty-four per cent of the children who have gone through Blinky Bill since January this year have left town with their parents seeking employment elsewhere. The local population is steadily declining&mdash;not an unfamiliar story on the Central Tablelands, let alone the more struggling centres further west.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And what does the government do? It not only aids and abets the downsizing of banks and other government agencies like Tax offices and Medicare offices but also helps rip the heart out of other soft infrastructure like community child care. Portland's Blinky Bill centre is also a major local employer. It has seven staff&mdash;that is, seven families in the town relying on that employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sixty-six per cent or two&hyphen;thirds of long day care families use the Portland centre for work&hyphen;study reasons. If these families have no child-care centre, and there are no other options, these families, particularly women and single parent families, will have to move, stop their studies, stop child care or maybe leave the work force to look after their child and become a greater welfare burden than if that subsidised child care was available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a real fear that the cutting of the operational subsidy for Portland's Blinky Bill will result in three-quarters of the current clientele deciding to reduce their hours and that fees will be increased by at least $2.40 per child per day, which is almost $600 per full&hyphen;time child per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the story of Portland's Blinky Bill. I can repeat that story for many of the 26 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6471"> child&hyphen;care centres in my electorate. I have had meetings with child&hyphen;care operators and I have also inspected the excellent services provided by private operators. The Tired Teddies and Snug as a Rug centres in Orange are state of the art, providing the nought to two-year&hyphen;old service that is not a feature of many private operators because of the expense of this age group and the staffing numbers required. But no private operator would seriously look at making a profit in a Portland, a Kandos, a Canowindra or a Lithgow for that matter, so stagnant is that city's economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do not be fooled by the low inflation rate. Business is not in a position to extend overdrafts, let alone borrow, whether rates be lower or not. Take a look at some of the empty shops in country towns. They are doing it tough. Business is slow to dull. One shop in one major centre in my electorate took $20 last Friday. Low inflation in the bush at the moment means people are simply not spending. That is why price movements are slight to non-existent, and that is why private child-care operators will only pick up the market opportunities in the very big centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Might I precis part of a letter from Bathurst City Council about the likely impact of the loss of operational subsidy to the community long day care centres operated by that council. It believes the cuts will mean a funding shortfall of $40,000. It believes an increased fee of $25 a child per week will be necessary. However, the council says it cannot and will not charge this fee and will reduce services such as cooked meals and reduce its staff in order to trim back the $25 to the lowest possible increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This council's long day care centre and another community based centre are the only two in the city. The other five private centres in Bathurst make no provision for nought to two&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds because market forces have determined this kind of service cannot be offered in the city without a subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nought to two&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds require a nurse on staff for every 10 children under three years of age, compared with one nurse for each 20 children over three. Bathurst council tells me it is required to care for children with special needs and disabilities and children at <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> risk&mdash;factors which undermine their ability to compete with private providers without this subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Law Reform Commission study into federal child-care legislation found rural services are disadvantaged because services cost more to operate because of the need to offer financial incentives to attract staff and increase costs for food, services, building materials and so on. In essence, it is the penalty of isolation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is replacing $118 million of operational subsidies with an $8 million scheme Australia&hyphen;wide to help these community based long day care centres adjust to the loss of their operational subsidy. That is welcome, but not enough. There is money also in the budget for families in severely disadvantaged areas, but I do not believe it is anywhere near enough to pick up these people who will be set back financially by these moves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Commission of Audit report and the EPAC report into future child&hyphen;care provision in Australia did recommend the abolition of the operational subsidy. But, strangely, the information I have received from community based child-care centres in my electorate shows no contact with the EPAC report compilers in the course of that study. Stranger yet, the government has implemented these cuts long before the required response date&mdash;hardly a consultation process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other amendments in this bill propose a partial means test on the child&hyphen;care cash rebate. I believe the charge can be levelled that middle and high income earners will benefit at the expense of lower income earners in the battle for reduced child&hyphen;care funds. In fact, the hardship provisions of this bill will not apply until the estimated income is below $15,646 per annum for a one&hyphen;child family. I suspect the lower income families in rural areas will do it tough in the towns where no private operator will open up and where the present high and even quality could suffer through a re&hyphen;emergence of backyard child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome the amendments to allow parents to claim the child&hyphen;care cash rebate against two <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6472"> sets of child&hyphen;care fees in certain specified circumstances. But, as I pointed out at the beginning of this speech, the loss of operational subsidies for council and community operated long day care centres is likely to have a dramatic impact on families at a time they can least afford it&mdash;that is, when there is no alternative child care available or likely to become available in rural and regional centres where the marketplace has failed to deliver and will not deliver. When you lose other services such as Tax offices and banks, the slow downward economic spiral is well under way. The only problem with child care, though, is that you cannot access it on a 1&hyphen;800 line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bulk of this bill I can accept, but I urge the government to revisit the amendments affecting long day care operational subsidies. The loss of these subsidies could not only spell the end of community child-care centres in some rural areas, including mine, but also exclude from child care some families who could well withdraw from the work force and become a further burden on the taxpayer or, worse still, withdraw their family from the town, so increasing that inexorable flow of population from small to larger centres.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(10.09 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, which is before us, proposes the implementation of the following budget related measures. It proposes to discontinue the operational subsidy to community based long day care centres, to take effect from 1 July next year. Let me reiterate that long day care centres are centres that are open for at least eight hours a day during normal working days&mdash;that is, from Monday to Friday&mdash;and operate for at least 48 weeks of the year. The next measure is to reduce the child-care cash rebate from 30 per cent to 20 per cent for families with a taxable income in the current year lower than the family income cut-offs for part A of the family tax initiative, and that is currently $70,000 per annum for a family with one child.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Community based long day care centres are the non-profit centres, as other speakers have said earlier in this debate. They are usually operated by a local government authority, a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> community organisation or a religious or charitable organisation. The centres themselves, particularly in my electorate, are normally administered by a management committee consisting of parents and other members of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This method has benefits for the children, the community and the parents. The centres, I believe, are more responsive to the needs of the children and parents, with the parents being able to experience and observe the effects of any decisions they make or participate in. Again, it provides the opportunity for greater input by parents into decisions that can create a better level of satisfaction with the results of those decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the budget cuts and the changes in the budget. This budget cuts a total of $504 million from child care over the next four years. It will add between $14 and $20 a week to a parent's child-care costs in community based centres. That will take time to work through. This is a very clever budget. The cuts and the damage in the budget are cleverly staged but, nevertheless, they will hit. It is simply a matter of time as they work through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cuts take a variety of forms and include cuts to operating subsidies of $118.4 million over three years, benefits paid to families limited to 50 hours per week and reduced for second and subsequent children and, finally, a freeze being placed on the upper limit of benefits for the next two years. Community child care has carried a greater share of the more expensive areas of child care&mdash;that is, the care of the under two&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds, the disabled and the at&hyphen;risk children. That is a fact that is readily acknowledged by everybody who is in any way involved with the child-care industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The removal of the operating subsidies to community child care attacks its future viability. Many community based organisations will not consider it feasible to continue operating a long day care centre without an operational subsidy. Remember, these are community based organisations and I have outlined the kinds of organisations that sponsor the formation of these centres.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6473">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own electorate, it took quite some time for the councils, particularly the Lake Macquarie City Council, to become involved, to devote resources and to set aside a share of their annual fiscal resources to the operation of these centres. But, having done that, now the goalposts are being changed. The dilemma facing the councils will be how much of their resources they are prepared to devote to this area of activity, to this area of care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The centres themselves are sometimes the only option for people living in regional or remote areas who need child care. We have heard that fact from the two previous speakers&mdash;one an Independent and the other a member of the government. The decline in the competitive role of community child care within the sector also means there is a greater chance of unchecked fee increases. One can argue very easily, as is apparent to many people, that removing the operational subsidy and thus forcing up the revenue that has to be raised by the centre itself indirectly forces them to increase their fees. It also indirectly makes it easier for the privately operated centres to compete with the community based centres regardless of the quality of service they are providing or of the segment of the market they are catering to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Operational subsidies for community based long day care centres subsidise the cost of care for children who are expensive to care for, especially babies and children with special needs. The abolition of operational subsidies to these centres means that centres will have to charge higher fees&mdash;the fact I have just referred to&mdash;as much as $21 a week for a child under the age of three and $14 a week for a child aged three and over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all very well for government speakers and the minister to come back and produce some itemised amounts and present some hypothetical circumstances&mdash;they may or they may not&mdash;but inevitably the costs to parents who currently use these centres will rise if they are able to afford to keep their children there. That will happen, but it will also depend on whether the centre wants to continue caring for those children and babies with special needs.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government has said that it will provide a certain amount of money to help centres remain open in severely disadvantaged areas. But operators say that it will not be enough and that they will have to pass the cost on to parents. I come back to that point again: what this is about is pushing up the costs for parents who currently use those community based child-care centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The child-care cash rebate has been means tested. If you do not qualify for the family tax initiative, the rebate will be cut from 30 per cent to 20 per cent. So the rebate has been cut by some $34.7 million. The introduction of the child-care cash rebate by the Labor government recognised child-care costs as a work related expense. It recognised that child-care costs can be a significant disincentive for women thinking about taking up employment. Like other tax concessions for work related expenses, the rebate was not means tested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, despite their promise not to means test the child-care cash rebate, the Howard government is in the process of imposing a means test on it. We are almost seeing a continuing cycle of broken promises. In each item that comes before the parliament, we are dealing with what this government promised in opposition and the alternative&mdash;what it is doing now in breaking those promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Changes to the income test for child-care assistance mean that all parents will pay more for child care. The Howard government's so-called family budget cuts $282 million from child-care assistance. When we look at this in more detail, we see that 27,000 families will not get access to child-care assistance for more than 50 hours per week per child; 198,000 families will lose child-care assistance from tightening the definition of income for assessing eligibility; 30,000 families lose from the reduction in the income cut-offs for families with two or more children in care; and 650 families will get less help because of the inclusion of additional fringe benefits in the income test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the budget freezes the child-care assistance and child-care cash rebate ceilings for two years, while allowing the minimum fee to continue to rise. The combined effect of this set of measures is that some 330,000 families <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6474"> expected to qualify for child-care assistance in 1996-97 will have higher out-of-pocket child-care expenses averaging about $4.25 per week. So, far from maintaining the level of child-care assistance, what is happening is that 330,000 families in this current year are going to be worse off to varying degrees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 5,500 planned community based long day care places, worth $79.4 million, will not be built. In some parts of Australia, there are drastic shortages of long day care places. The coalition promised to support the creation of additional places to meet the unmet demand for child care. But, because of this budget, long day care places planned to be built between now and the year 2000 will not go ahead, making it even more difficult to get quality, affordable care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard one of the speakers in the parliament last week say that there is that core of opinion over there in government ranks, and it is really reflected in the view of the Prime Minister, that the place of women is to be barefooted, pregnant and in the kitchen in a single income family. I repeat to this parliament: the Prime Minister cannot go back to his mother's world.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Labor in government had a long history of achievement in child care: the introduction of child-care assistance, the child-care cash rebate and operational subsidies for community based child-care centres. So many new places were provided during our period in government that child care became the highest employment growth category over the past five years. As a result, child care was much more affordable and available. When we came to office back in 1983 there were a miserable, paltry 46,000 child&hyphen;care places. When we left office this year, that had grown to 270,000&mdash;a complete, stunning transformation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was a councillor with the City of Coburg during the 1980s, one of our proudest achievements was being part of that transformation in making child care accessible within our own community. I personally had the honour of opening the Pascoe Vale Derby St Children's Centre&mdash;two or three doors from where I grew up and where my parents still live. We were also associated with the opening of the Barry Beckett Child Care Centre in Coburg East, the doubling of the capacity of the Shirley Robertson Child Care Centre in Coburg and many others. All along, we were making child care more accessible and more affordable and making it easier for women and sole parents to participate in the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor paid something of a political price for that. If we had had the participation rate in the work force of a generation ago, we would have had much less unemployment. Nevertheless, we were committed to giving women opportunities to work and to giving families options about how they arrange their affairs by making child care affordable and accessible. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you have to laugh when you hear the Liberal Party talk about families and how keen they are to help families when you look at the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill before the House tonight. This might be an old-fashioned view&mdash;and I know there has been quite a lot of debate about what constitutes a family&mdash;but from where I sit families mean children. Any government which is fair dinkum in the slightest about helping families would be saying, `We are going to help parents in ensuring that their children are properly cared for if they need to work for a living.' Let us face it, most of us do need to work for a living. We are talking about the battlers here, ordinary parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor were supporting families with the operational subsidy. The Liberals, by comparison, are withdrawing it. They are attacking families.</PARA>

Let us not have any more of the cant or humbug about supporting families when you have a bill of the kind which is before the House tonight leading, in the cases of those families it impacts on, to increased fees of the order of $20 to $35 per week per child.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to draw to the attention of the House correspondence from the City of Moreland to the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) pointing out how this bill will impact on the City of Moreland and child-care funding within it. The letter makes the following point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently there are 27 long day child care centres and one Family Day Care Scheme operating within Moreland, providing a total of 1,473 effective full-time (EFT) places. Of these, fifteen are community managed services providing 644 EFT places.</PARA>
<PARA>The City of Moreland says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Removal of the operational grant&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which this bill will do&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will mean a total loss of $616,500 in child care funding from the municipality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this change will require an increase in fees of between $20&mdash;$35 per week. As up to 90% of the expenditure in these centres is for salaries there are very few avenues for cost reduction except for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6476"> reducing staffing levels or skills. These options would inevitably jeopardise the quality of the child care service provided.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The smaller centres under 35 places, of which there are ten in Moreland, are particularly vulnerable given their limited capacity to reduce costs. These centres will be forced to close or explore options for amalgamation.</PARA>
<PARA>The council also express concern about the proposed changes to child-care assistance. They point out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within Moreland there is a high percentage of parents receiving Child Care Assistance, ranging from 70% to 90%.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Families with more than one child will be particularly disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These fee increases will be exacerbated by limiting the CCA entitlement to 50 hours per week.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>according to their surveys&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will mean an increase of up to $11.50 per week per child for full-time care. This additional cost will generally apply even if families do not use the service for 55 hours per week.</PARA>
<PARA>The City of Moreland also express concern about the impact of this legislation on quality. They point out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has taken many years to build the impressive network of good quality child care services throughout this municipality. Parents have contributed countless hours of voluntary time to develop and manage these services.</PARA>
<PARA>With the changes provided for in this bill, all of that is in jeopardy. The council has urged the federal government to rethink its legislation. The response from the Minister for Family Services that they do not expect any child-care centres to be forced to close and that `there is no need for fees to rise at all if the inefficiencies in the community centres are eradicated' is both wrong and offensive to those involved in the management of those centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> It has already been reported that the Moreland Child Care Co&hyphen;op, which has 25 places and which will lose between $25,000 and $30,000 a year in federal funding through this bill, and the Brunswick Child Care Co&hyphen;op, which stands to lose some $37,000 per year, are involved in discussions about amalgama tion. No doubt, other child-care centres are similarly involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But right throughout there is great concern amongst these child&hyphen;care centres about the impact this bill will have on them. For example, the CARE Day Nursery in Broadmeadows has indicated that they stand to lose around $53,000. Ms McCrow, a director of that agency, has indicated that it is going to hit low income families very hard; in other words, the battlers&mdash;precisely the point I made earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the Derby St Children's Centre, the centre director, Mandy Canham, has pointed out that it costs $150 a week for full-time child care and that 78 per cent of the centre's 54 families receive fee assistance. A parent who sends her child to that centre, Carol Knight, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would not be able to continue working if I did not receive fee relief. I depend on it.</PARA>
<PARA>There are many other parents who are similarly impacted on by this legislation. I have received a letter from one of my constituents&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the many destructive decisions in the budget was to reduce funds allocated to the parliamentary departments by $10 million a year from a total in 1995-96 of $142 million. One way in which this huge reduction has been accommodated is by combining the staff of committees of the House of Representatives and those of joint committees staffed through the House of Representatives so that one committee secretariat and staff service two committees. The total number of committee staff has been reduced from an already inadequate 76 to 68. The effectiveness of committees of the House is being further constrained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inadequacy of staffing has been exacerbated by the establishment of two substantial <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6477"> new committees&mdash;Primary Industries, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs and Treaties&mdash;though the impact of this has been significantly offset by the abolition of two standing committees on televising the House and on long&hyphen;term strategies. Also, the standard committee membership has been increased from 12 to 14, which increases the complexity of arranging mutually convenient meeting and hearing times. The committees only began operating in June, so it is too early for all the consequences to be apparent, but some of the effects are already clear. The most important is simply that committee secretaries, and to some extent staff, have become schizophrenic, their attention being divided between the demands of two committees. Meeting and hearing times are restricted by those of the other committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The staff amalgamation will reduce the capacities of secretaries to be readily available for consultations with chairs and committees. Other cuts to the number of parliamentary support staff intensify the stress. The number of Hansard and printing staff has been reduced, increasing the amount of support work required of committee staff. Most importantly, all this will cause great pressure of work, particularly towards the end of inquiries, which occur simultaneously towards the end of parliamentary sessions. The heavy workload and stress at these times may well cause injuries such as RSI and the breakdown of health of some staff, as it has in other parts of the Public Service, despite attempts by management to prevent personal damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be necessary for committees to strictly limit the number of inquiries undertaken. It is quite likely that fewer public hearings will be held and probable that inquiries will have to be less comprehensive and reports less well researched. The funding cuts will also reduce the capacity of committees to employ consultants for technical aspects of inquiries. So the work of parliamentarians in committees is likely to be less effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The establishment of a comprehensive committee structure in 1987 was one of the significant achievements of the Labor government, undertaken following a caucus resolution and committee report which I moved and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> chaired. However, the new committees have always been relatively poorly staffed. A relevant comparison is with another inquiry organisation, the Industry Commission. In June 1995 that commission had a budget of $25 million and a staff of 247 compared with the House committee funding of $4.3 million and a staff of 76. Yet in that year the IC produced 17 reports, on a generous definition of a completed report, and the House and joint committees for which the House is responsible for funding tabled 48 reports. There is a case for privatising the Industry Commission, which is now the Productivity Commission, so that it would contest the conduct of inquiries with other research bodies. This would significantly increase the diversity of advice available to government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Department of the House of Representatives has commissioned KPMG to make an evaluation of the effects of the committee staffing changes beginning early next year. This will allow more time for the effects to become clearer. In the meantime, committee staff will continue to overwork, there will be some inconvenience and it is possible that the health of staff and the quality of work may suffer. So one of the best means of maintaining an effective communication between parliament and the community will be weakened and democracy will be undermined. This is damaging the effectiveness of the House.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, as you are aware, I am fortunate enough to represent much of the beautiful Sunshine Coast area of Queensland. We have a long and very beautiful coastline on the Sunshine Coast. Our nation has one of the longest coastlines of any country in the world and also one of the largest exclusive economic zones of any nation. In fact, our coastline covers 36,700 kilometres and supports 86 per cent of Australia's population and much of our nation's commercial and industrial activity. In addition, the  exclusive economic zone represents some 11 million square kilometres of marine waters and their resources double the size of our land mass. The value of Australia's marine resources, according to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6478"> CSIRO estimates, is around $17 billion per year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The executive summary of the state of the environment report released on 27 June this year highlighted the critical state of our environment and, irrefutably, the need for extra work to be done on the environment and the impact created by more than 200 years of European settlement. This report was prepared by over 200 independent experts and identifies major problems facing our environment, such as the soil erosion of agricultural land, degradation of waterways and loss of biodiversity. These problems must be addressed in an integrated and systematic way and will be as a result of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill, which we passed through the House recently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Specifically, the report does confirm that our coastline has suffered as a result of increasing urbanisation and population growth. Growth along the coastal areas is continuing at an unprecedented rate. In 1993 the coastal zone supported about 80 per cent of the Australian population, although around 70 per cent of Australia's coastline remains sparsely inhabited, which means that there are great pressures placed on local marine ecosystems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report also showed that the population of the non-metropolitan coastal zone is growing at an unprecedented rate&mdash;2.1 million to 4.1 million between 1971 and 1991. The Australian population in that period grew by only 32 per cent. The Sunshine Coast has shown a major growth. It grows at approximately six per cent per year. Over the next few years the population on the Sunshine Coast will grow to in excess of 300,000 people. That means that we have increasing pressures on our local environment. We need to address the major problem of urban dune encroachment and substandard effluent treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report I mentioned did indicate one area of particular concern and that is that coastal urbanisation has already destroyed much of the local ecosystem. Between 1974 and 1989, 33 per cent of the coastal bushland along the south&hyphen;east Queensland coast was lost. From the coasts and clean seas initiative <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which we propose as part of our environmental policy, we will indeed benefit. Indeed, all coastal electorates will benefit and, because they benefit, the nation as a whole will have an improved environment to pass on to future generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The electorate of Fisher is fortunate to have a number of national parks, two of them being the Bribie Island&hyphen;Pumicestone Passage National Park and the Glasshouse Mountains National Park. Pumicestone Passage water quality, though, is not all it should be. Tree clearance in the catchment areas of the passage in the Glasshouse Mountains is the worst in the state. Along with the destruction of wetlands, it has resulted in environmental damage. We have a situation where something needs to be done. The Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill 1996 has passed through the House, and I would like to call upon the Senate to accept that we have a mandate to implement our policy and to pass that bill as well. We need to ensure that the environment that we pass on to future generations is better than the environment which we inherited. After more than 200 years as a nation we have nothing to be proud of. We inherited a continent with a pristine environment and, over 200 years, through successive governments, we have found that our environment has continued to deteriorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government elected on 2 March is the only government to bring forward a detailed environmental package which will redress the 200 years of ignorance and neglect. It is about time that those opposite accepted that they were comprehensively rejected at the time of the last election. It is about time that they accepted that we have 76 Liberals and 18 Nationals, a total of 94 coalition members. There are only 49 Labor, of course, and they are going to seek through the Senate to reject our mandate. It is totally unacceptable. I would like to call on the Senate to pass this bill urgently.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

On Friday night I had the great privilege of attending the Apprentice and Trainee of the Year awards arranged by the Newcastle Vocational Training Committee for apprentices and trainees throughout the Hunter Valley. I want to pay my tributes to the organisers of the function, to all those who took part, including the sponsors and the businesses involved, and particularly to all the prize winners. They were a very impressive group of people. My particular appreciation goes to Joanne O'Malley, who is the Trainee of the Year for the whole area. That is an impressive achievement, and Joanne is a very impressive young woman.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Apprentice of the Year award went to George Saloum, a 32&hyphen;year&hyphen;old motor mechanic from Macksville. Some years ago George was injured when he was hit by a tree. He was injured to such an extent that he was offered a disability pension. He fought against that and spent three years recovering. Through Nambucca Valley Skillshare, one of the great success stories of the skillshare scheme, he happened to meet Bob Lindsay of Big Bob's Car Care at Macksville. He eventually became an apprentice. He is 32 years old, has three children and he is the Apprentice of the Year. That is a terrific story. It certainly was an impressive night. I extend my best wishes to all the young people who took part, particularly the winners of the overall awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second matter I wanted to mention relates to an incident that occurred on 6 May 1986 when a young woman was pushing a cart of coins up a ramp at a branch of the Commonwealth Bank. She slipped and was pinned to the wall by the cart. It was a minor incident in an otherwise happy and successful life, but that incident was to lead to a 10&hyphen;year nightmare. The nightmare ended on 23 August when that young woman and I appeared before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to appeal against a decision by Comcare, which claimed that the injury that had plagued her since that time was not work caused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that this organisation needs rethinking. It needs to examine what it is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> doing and what its responsibilities are. In this particular case, the tribunal did such things as send the woman to a doctor without producing the report. Despite the fact that the report was about the woman's medical situation, Comcare chose to keep it secret. This is not a private organisation; this a publicly funded body with a duty of care to people. In this particular case they failed their duty most dismally. In the Administrative Appeals Tribunal they refused mediation. They produced a doctor, a solicitor and a barrister against a young woman who could not afford any of those.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hearing before Senior Member Allen was a difficult one because neither the young woman nor I had ever been to a hearing there before, nor were we used to the processes that are involved, which are extremely intimidating. At the end of the day Senior Member Allen found in the woman's favour and upheld her appeal. In other words, an individual has been taken through the process by a government agency which spent a vast amount of money to try to deny her what was eventually judged to be her right. Senior Member Allen was both courteous and understanding of the situation, unlike Comcare, which was not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, as a result of that incident and that experience, I am in the process of seeking assistance from your staff to draft a private member's bill proposing that legislation affecting Comcare be changed to allow people to appeal to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal as a first appeal level. The fact that when the organisation makes a decision the only appeal available is to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal through an extensive and complex legal process is inappropriate and unreasonable. The private member's bill will seek to amend legislation so that the first level of appeal will be the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. It is a much more human and more personal service, and I am sure it will give a much better result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This action would not have been necessary if Comcare had adopted a process of mediation and other processes that were fairer and more reasonable. They chose not to do that, therefore the act must be changed to make <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6480"> them. The organisation and those responsible need to be examined and made accountable. That young woman has been blighted by the organisation. No thanks are due to Comcare for the fact that her appeal was upheld, and no thanks are due to Comcare for their duty of care, which was noticeably absent in this particular case. I trust that when my private member's bill comes forward the House will support this proposal.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Sunday, 27 October I attended the annual picnic day in Broken Hill. It was an event of great success due to the 500 volunteers who took part, the 80 community groups, the 60 business houses and, not least, the 8,000 or 9,000 citizens who participated. But I want to bring to the attention of the House this evening the memorial service that was held there to honour those 704 miners who have lost their lives on the Line of Lode, that famous ore body that has given Australia and the world immense wealth since it was first mined in 1883. I remind the House that another 1,500 have died outside the accident rate on that mine from other ailments such as dust on the lung.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Seven hundred and four people over the course of a little over a century is an average of nearly six or seven a year who were dying for the benefit of this country. What other centre has made such a sacrifice for Australia? The contribution that Broken Hill has made in lives alone has been immense and is long overdue for recognition. I am pleased to bring this to the attention of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What words can we use to describe such an immense loss of life? We are not talking about five people, 10 people, 20 people, 50 or 100, but 704 people. In per capita terms, it is equivalent to a loss of life in excess of 80,000 in Sydney, and that is not even including the 1,500 who died outside the accidents on the mine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not talking about a coalmine. Broken Hill is a silver, lead and zinc mine. It is notable that, of the 704, 702 of the bodies have been recovered. There are only two&mdash;Thomas Jordan and Leopold Campbell&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> whose bodies were never recovered, and of the latter his mother had lost another son on the mine and a son&hyphen;in&hyphen;law from a previous incident. To attend the service there that Sunday and listen to the Victorian Welsh Male Voice Choir perform, especially when they sang <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">It is a working man I am</EMPHASIS>, the lines of which talk about the dangers and the reticence of people to go underground, brought a tear to the eyes of many of the hundreds of people who were present at that service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Reverend Brian Nicholls, who gave the eulogy on the day, reminded everyone that $70,000 million worth of silver, lead and zinc has been taken out of Broken Hill, twice as much as Kalgoorlie has ever put together. He quoted from the book that R.J. Solomon wrote, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Richest Lode</EMPHASIS>, where he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the whole world, few population centres of 25,000 people or more have persisted in areas where there is no permanent source of water, where the annual rainfall is less than 250 millimetres&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is 10 inches&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">where summer temperatures are commonly high and where the seat of government is 1,200 kilometres away&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>referring to Sydney&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that Broken Hill has done so for over a century is probably its greatest achievement.</PARA>
<PARA>Today the population of Broken Hill has shrunk from 33,000 at its peak to about 24,000 today and the mining community is down to 800. The life of the mine will probably be 10, 12, 15 years, depending on metal prices, exchange rates, industrial arrangements and so on. This town has given us immense wealth over the last century in exports, royalties and better mining methods. It has founded the most famous company we have in Australia today&mdash;BHP&mdash;and it has given us a resilient spirit which has contributed to the essential Australian character. It is sad that Aboriginal claims around the town are hindering a full exploration effort to keep mining going in that town. It was great indeed to be able to attend the miners' memorial service, and I pay tribute to all those who have lost their lives on the mine over the last century.</PARA>

The final decision completely overturned the draft report recommendations for the Bankstown Taxation Office to be retained and for its staffing to be increased from 644 to 800. This decision crushes the very real expectations of the individual taxpayers and small business people of Bankstown that the ATO presence in Bankstown would be enhanced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This decision means that the local small businesses in Bankstown, dependent upon ATO staff spending their money in their stores to keep up their profitability, will be put under even further financial pressure. This decision means that the ATO's policy of regionalisation and decentralisation of its offices and services is directly threatened not just in Bankstown but elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This decision means that all the ATO's clients in Bankstown will be disadvantaged in terms of their access to the full range of services which was so readily and efficiently provided in Bankstown by the Bankstown Taxation Office. This decision means the contraction of ATO services in Bankstown and the contraction of the local economy. This decision means that Bankstown's individual taxpayers will be put to considerable expense and to a considerable waste of time because they will have to go to ATO offices at Parramatta or Hurstville to deal directly with ATO staff on matters relating to their tax affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government wants to abandon direct service provision by the Commonwealth Public Service and to drive towards those functions being provided by the private sector through outsourcing. The tremors of this drive are already evident in the ATO Business 2000 document. The overview of accommodation argues that:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Put another way, if we were to accommodate our existing staff at 15 square metres, we would need an average 8 fewer buildings than we currently have.</PARA>
<PARA>And, ominously, the document argues that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Into the new century our major leases expire and, with the benefit of our new experience over the coming years, we will be freer to develop new directions.</PARA>
<PARA>That can mean only more job losses and more taxation offices closing: a centralisation, concentration and contraction rather than decentralisation and regionalisation, where a full taxation office service is provided at the community level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Taxation Office envisages that, after the year 2000, it will have more flexible accommodation management arrangements. It will use external expertise in strategic management of accommodation holdings and its accommodation standards will be consistent with comparative industries. In all, the ATO sees accommodation as a major business expense. The implications of this viewpoint are that the ATO will decrease both its staffing levels and its regional accommodation after 2000. More jobs will be lost and more government services moved away from the individual taxpayers and industries it is meant to serve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the year 2000 we can expect greater contraction of ATO services, greater job losses and a rapid move away from the decentralisation and regionalisation of the past decade. This will be at a greater direct cost to individuals dealing with the tax office, which, having caught the gist of the National Commission of Audit and this coalition government's drive to make the people pay, expects that `the user&hyphen;pays concept is common practice in the Australian Public Service for non-core activities'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This drive towards a contraction of services and to the outsourcing of services from the Australian Taxation Office directly links in with what it perceives to be the drive of this Commonwealth government under the coalition towards putting pressure on the Australian Taxation Office to cut its staff numbers, to cut its accommodation and to cut its direct services to the public. It states specifically <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6482"> that it expects that the government is contemplating a smaller, more competitive Public Service, that the government has made an in&hyphen;principle decision about outsourcing IT&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TITLE>Second Sydney Airport</TITLE>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VK6">Mrs VALE</NAME>
<ELECTORATE> (Hughes)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.54 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A matter of grave concern to the people of my electorate was raised in this House today. I am gladdened by the discussion in which the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) agreed with me and my constituents in Hughes on the importance of exploring a further possible site, particularly Goulburn, as Sydney's second airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleagues on this side of the House will recall that on 21 May this year I requested that an EIS be undertaken at Goulburn at the same time as the EIS is undertaken at Holsworthy in my electorate. I attend many public rallies on this issue. An airport at Holsworthy is the consuming concern of my constituents and I am often asked: why Holsworthy when it was ninth on the list of airport sites back in 1985? Why are we not looking at other sites? Why are we not looking at Goulburn?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the topic of very fast trains in the media over recent weeks, the prospect of Goulburn presents a very real possibility to my constituents. Not only have the people of Goulburn reportedly expressed a desire to have an international airport located within their vicinity, but the development of very fast transport does lend a good deal of sense to a proper investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard arguments that Goulburn gets fog bound, but so too does Holsworthy. I have heard that the cost and difficulty of delivering the necessary Avgas to Goulburn is great. Yet since 1976 we have had a natural gas pipeline from South Australia which delivers gas to the people of the city of Sydney. With modern technology it is anticipated that as early as 2009 natural gas will be piped from Western Australia to the eastern states. So already in Australia the technology exists to transport gas over very large distances. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am totally and utterly opposed to any idea that a 24-hour international airport might be located at Holsworthy and so are my constituents. My position on this issue is all the more difficult because in taking such a stand one is against those on my side of this House for whom I have respect, high regard and even warm affection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps my position may not be conducive to a successful career in this parliament. But I did not come here for my career; I came here to do a job. I am mindful that I am here and that my colleagues now sit on this side of the House because of the faith of all the people all over Australia. But the people of Hughes also had faith for the first time since 1969, when the present boundaries for the seat of Hughes were created. The people voted for this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a heavy sense of betrayal, heavy enough to be tangible, angry enough to be expressed in unrelenting protest and it exists in my suburbs in Hughes. After all, we did make certain promises to all Australians before the last election. `For all of us,' we said. `For families,' we said. But my constituents are families too. These are substantially residential suburbs where mums and dads and young couples have invested their lives and their financial security in their homes and in their communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We promised for all of us. Yet my constituents are the only people in all of New South Wales who are bearing the burden of the prospect of an international airport. The bushland, environment and green spaces of these suburbs will be detrimentally affected if an international airport is located in their backyard. It is grossly unfair and it is obscenely unfair. There may never be an airport at Holsworthy, but the hardworking families in the suburbs of the west of Hughes already have lost at least $20,000 from the value of their family home, which in the majority of cases is the only asset that they possess.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ten years ago a decision to investigate Holsworthy would have made good sense, but today there has been significant and substantial extension of residential development in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6483"> the area. Over 500,000 people now have their homes here. It is also a fair observation that, had the Labor Party shown any political will and clout and completed Badgerys Creek years ago, none of us would be faced with this dilemma today. For today, the air quality and the water quality of the Sydney basin is shown to be under the increasing stress of the intensification of human habitation and activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is bad planning, bad policy and even bad politics to place an international airport in the midst of one of the fastest growing residential areas of Sydney. This may be an exercise in hard&hyphen;core economic reality, but it leaves little room for people in its ultimate outcome. Such a proposal is an abomination to family life. It would be a shattering experience to the families in my electorate, and I totally reject it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I fully understand that the airport at Sydney is also a shattering daily experience for the people of Sydney, but is it a solution if, in trying to correct one unbearable situation for one group of people, life is made unbearable for others? The people of my electorate see merit in many of the matters raised by the member for Prospect and, with respect, I believe such matters ought properly be explored.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr Costello</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) AFP members who served with the UN Multinational Force in Haiti will be entitled to tax concessions under section 23AB. Those AFP members who served with the UN Multinational Force in Haiti are not entitled to tax concessions under section 23AG, section 23AF, section 23ADA, section 23AD or any other section of the Income Tax Assessment Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 23AB provides a tax rebate to civilians who, with the approval of the Commonwealth, are serving overseas with an armed force under the control of the United Nations. Section 23AB will apply because the Government has decided to extend the provisions of this section to cover members of the AFP who served with the Multinational Force in Haiti between November 1994 and March 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 23AG exempts from income tax foreign earnings derived by an Australian resident individual from foreign service. This section does not apply where the earnings are exempt from tax in the foreign country only because of an international agreement to which Australia is a party and which deals with privileges and immunities in relation to persons connected with international organisations. As the AFP members were exempt from income tax in Haiti because of an agreement between the governments participating in the Multinational Force, authorised pursuant to UN Security Council <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6485"> Resolution 940, and the Republic of Haiti on the status of the Multinational Force in Haiti, section 23AG does not apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 23AF does not apply because this section only relates to Australian residents working overseas on projects approved by the Minister for Trade. AFP members who served in Haiti were not working on approved overseas projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 23ADA does not apply because that section only relates to AFP members serving with the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 23AD does not apply because that section only applies to Australian Defence Force (ADF) members performing eligible duty overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no other provision of the Income Tax Assessment Act that confers a tax concession on AFP members who served with the UN Multinational Force in Haiti.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)(a) Yes. Members of the AFP who served in Cambodia are exempt from income tax on pay and allowances if earned while the person was on duty with the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (section 23ADA).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Yes. Section 23AB provides tax concessions for Australian residents who are specified in the Income Tax Regulations. Those Regulations specify that the only persons who qualify for the concessions under this section are AFP members who are part of the UN peacekeeping force in Cyprus and AFP members who served with the UN Operation in Mozambique from 27 March 1994 to 10 December 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, as previously mentioned, the provisions of this section will be extended to those members of the AFP who served with the UN Multinational Force in Haiti.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) Yes. Pay and allowances received by members of the ADF serving in specified operational areas are exempt from income tax under section 23AC. As the only current operational area under this section is the former Yugoslavia, ADF members who serve as part of the UN peacekeeping force in the former Yugoslavia are exempted from income tax on their pay and allowances earned during a period of operational service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pay and allowances received by ADF members performing specified overseas duties are exempt from income tax under section 23AD. While this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> section serves the same function as section 23AC, it simplifies the process by allowing the Income Tax Regulations to prescribe what service is eligible for the concession. There is no eligible duty currently specified in the Income Tax Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Deployment allowances paid to ADF members who served in Cambodia, Haiti, Iraq, certain areas in the Middle East, Mozambique, Rwanda and Sinai are exempt from income tax under subparagraph 23(t)(iii).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A rebate is available to ADF members who serve in a specified overseas locality (section 79B). The total period of service in an overseas locality does not include any period of service in which the ADF member is entitled to exemption for income tax under section 23AC or section 23AD. A list of the areas that have been declared to be overseas localities for the purpose of section 79B is available from the Australian Taxation Office.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)(a) and (b) The Department of Treasury and Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Productivity Commission have been involved in work on the subject of competition policy in international fora. Treasury and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been involved in discussions of these issues in the OECD and APEC fora. Discussions in the WTO context are at a very preliminary stage. The interrelation between trade and competition policy encompasses such issues as considering how ineffective competition policies hinder market access, the effect of divergent competition laws on global business transactions,, the impact of trade remedies on competition, and the importance of competition law enforcement assistance. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has begun consultations with industry to ascertain its views on the potential  trade and economic benefits to Australia and, in particular, on the issues requiring further work. In 1995, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade published a paper on these issues <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6486"> entitled, `Trade and Competition Policy: A Survey of the Issues'. The Productivity Commission has undertaken analysis of the implications for Australia of the completion of the Uruguay Round, and of the commitment to free trade required under APEC. In September 1996, the Productivity Commission published a paper entitled `International Cooperation on Competition policy: An Australian Perspective'. It noted that a greater commitment to competition principles (including removal of tariffs) by APEC economies could raise Australian real income by over 6 per cent in the long run.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The Government is participating in discussions on competition policy in the WTO and APEC fora. It is in Australia's interest to support continued work in the trade/competition policy field. Australia has a `world class' competition policy, and efforts to improve competition policies and laws of other countries are likely to benefit Australia through increased access to overseas markets. The Government strongly supports the exposure of regional markets to greater competition, including through implementation of competition policy principles.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Neither the financial nor the economic viability of the Inland Marketing Corporation's (IMC) Parkes freight airport proposal have been established. At my request the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform is currently conducting an Air Freight Review Inquiry which includes consideration of opportunities to improve the efficiency of Australian exports, particularly perishables, through enhancing Australia's air freight services. The Inquiry is specifically investigating the need for, and viability of, additional international aviation infrastructure to cater for regional needs. Opportunities for improved coordination and linkages in the export air freight chain are also being considered. The IMC has made a number of submissions to the Inquiry and the Committee is aiming to finalise its work and report to Parliament by the end of 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Further assessment of the IMC proposal should await the findings of the Parliamentary Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Government is aware of the Environmental Impact Study (EIS) process in place, but notes that the scope of the EIS will only include a very limited financial analysis of the benefits and costs of the proposal.</PARA>

The level of a provisional tax uplift factor for a year of income after the 1996&hyphen;97 year of income, depends on the degree of positive change of a later calender year gross domestic product (GDP) over an earlier calender year GDP. These are the main factors in the formula in subsection 221YAAA(3).</PARA>
