Deputy Prime Minister saying that the dollar, at its current rate, is adversely affecting exporters

screen jockey hot trading? How does that compare with the Prime Minister's statement last night

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. It
was probably the last person who made a pretence of understanding economic policy for the Labor
Party. He was a very bad Treasurer, but he would be embarrassed by the performance that the Labor
Party is showing these days. The fact is that a rising currency has different effects. With all of
these things, there are mixed effects. I have said myself on previous occa <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> sions that, in those areas of the Australian economy where there is strong import
competition, a rising dollar makes it harder. I think you would not have to go far in mixing with
manufacturers in Australia to hear that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other
hand, of course, a rising currency will contribute to keeping inflation low. We have a low
inflation rate in Australia at the moment, and a rising currency will make a contribution to
lowering inflation as well. When I am asked about the level of the currency, I make it clear on
behalf of the government, as is the government's position, that we are not targeting a particular
value for the dollar. What we are targeting in relation to our monetary policy is clear and
transparent: we are targeting an underlying inflation rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we
are targeting in relation to wages is clear and transparent: we are targeting outcomes. Of course,
what we are targeting in relation to fiscal policy is also clear. We have laid down in the budget a
program to restore Australia's fortunes. That is what we are targeting: a program to restore
Australia's fortunes. A strong Australia with sustainable growth and low inflation and wages
consistent with that is the kind of outcome that the coalition loves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is only one minority sector of the Australian public that does not like low
interest rates, and it is the Australian Labor Party. They are the masters of the high interest
rate. They are the people who got them up to 21 and 22 per cent in 1989 and 1990. They are the
people who have still not recovered from the success of this government in lowering interest rates.
They have still not recovered. We unashamedly like low interest rates. They give opportunity to
business and they give opportunity to home buyers. It shows what an increasingly irrelevant and
frustrated minority the Australian Labor Party happens to be.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I
have already told the House, the reason why the Labor Party set a target and set it in the year
2000 is that, first, in the year 2000, they thought they would never be in government and never be
accountable for it, in relation to which you were right. Second, by setting the target, it gave you
the opportunity to try to rework the forecasts, in which matter you were unquestionably wrong. That
is why the Labor Party set that particular target.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having a target for sustainable growth and inflation, having a target in relation
to savings and having a budget outcome are what good policy is all about. It is almost impossible
to have an economic debate in this place. If you have an opposition with not one wit of an economic
idea, how can you debate it? How can you debate it, when all you see is this vicious attempt to run
around and popularise every inconsistent position that they can?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was the position that was announced by the opposition after the budget? It
was announced by the member for Holt the day after the budget, on 21 August. When he was asked what
Labor policy was, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The budget deficits were getting too big

Balance over a three-year period! One, two, three. You can't say this was ignorance before you had
caught up with economic theory&mdash;it was the day after the budget. It was the morning after when
you went out of there and you said that your plan was in fact our plan. Everything you have done
since has been to try to pull that apart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a worry to see the
Socialist Left now in complete control of the Australian Labor Party. All four factions of the
Socialist Left are in complete control of the Australian Labor Party. It is the task of the right
wing of the Australian Labor Party to try to keep some economic sanity around the place, and in

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not actually happen to think it is a matter
that lends itself to cheap interjections from the Labor Party. As I said, this was reported on the
front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  newspaper today, and just to say that
substantially the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  was accurate. The
American ambassador to Cambodia passed to our ambassador in Phnom Penh on the night of 1 December a
warning from the Second Prime Minister, Hun Sen, of possible action by unspecified hardliners
against several embassies in Phnom Penh, including the Australian embassy. Our embassy has not yet
directly received a threat, but it is taking all appropriate security precautions, and the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> embassy has alerted the Australian community living in
Cambodia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current situation in Cambodia is tense.
Events over the last few months have led to increased strain in relations between the main
political parties in Cambodia. There is also the possibility of further terrorist attacks by
remaining hardcore elements of the Khmer Rouge. Later this afternoon I will be meeting with the
Deputy Prime Minister of Cambodia, who is also responsible for police and the judicial system, and
I will make representations to him at this meeting to ensure that the Cambodian government does
everything it can to protect Australian citizens, including obviously those who work at the
Australian embassy. I also will take the opportunity yet again to seek assurances from the
Cambodian government that those responsible for the deaths of Australians in Cambodia will not be
given an amnesty and that continued efforts will be made to bring those people to justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian government's position on this is absolutely clear, and on
many occasions we have made these representations. In September, I discussed this matter with the
Cambodian foreign minister, Ung Huot, who is known to members of the House, and received assurances
from him that the Cambodian government would do all it could to bring these people to justice. I
again wrote to Ung Huot in late November in response to suggestions in the media that General Noun
Paet, who is one of the murderers implicated in the death of David Wilson, might seek an amnesty. I
underlined our position that we did not wish him to be granted an amnesty and that the Cambodian
government should fulfil its obligations to bring a murderer to justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are continually making representations on this matter. Let me say we have
continually been given assurances by the Cambodian government that they will bring anybody
responsible for the abduction or murder of an Australian citizen to justice. We look forward
eventually, in particular, to General Noun Paet being brought to justice, as he should
be.</PARA>

Treasurer inform the House of the results of consultation concerning the government's commitment
announced in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget to allow capital gains tax rollover relief for small
business? Can the Treasurer explain how the implementation of this measure will benefit small
business?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of
the proudest matters that the government was able to deliver on in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget was
capital gains tax rollover relief for small business. We delivered on capital gains tax rollover
relief for small business because we thought the taxation system should not penalise small
businesses that were trying to grow bigger and small businesses that were trying to create more
jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After we announced that measure, the government
engaged in an intensive round of consultation with small business organisations. On budget night we
had said that rollover relief would apply only where a small business rolled over the proceeds from
selling one asset into a like asset.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After consultation with small
business, today I can announce, on behalf of the government, new measures to enhance capital gains
tax rollover relief for small business. After listening to small business, the government has
decided that the like&hyphen;kind requirement for qualifying for rollover relief be dropped, that
is, small business will now be able to roll over from one asset to another asset without any
stipulation that it be a like&hyphen;kind asset. This will give new improvements and new capital
gains tax rollover relief for small business. This is the government which consulted with small
business, this is the government which listened and this is the government which can now deliver in
a new way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, as a result of that consultation, we have heard
the request from small business that the period for reinvestment of the proceeds from the disposal
of an asset be extended to 12 months before disposal and 24 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
months after disposal. This gives small business people who are selling from one business and
trading into another an extension of time in which to roll over their capital sum to grow or go
into a new business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of removing the like&hyphen;kind asset
in 1998&hyphen;99 would be of the order of $50 million. This will be another boost to small
business, another delivery on the coalition mandate, another encouragement to small business to
grow bigger, and new opportunities for jobs in new, growing Australian businesses. This government
takes its commitment to small business seriously and this is a government which intends to
deliver.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

my attention has been drawn to the article. It is an article in the journal of the Australian
Federal Police Association of October 1996. The article is quite extensive and is written by Jason
Burns, the secretary of the ACT police branch of the association. He describes the attack on
Constable Alison Castles in the following words. He says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Standing under the Great Verandah, Castles was dragged into the
crowd and thrown on the ground by one protester who allegedly said words to the effect "Sorry but I
have to do it". Castles was then repeatedly kicked and punched.</PARA>
<PARA>The article, after
describing the events, then concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">One lesson
that all Australian police organisations should learn from this riot . . . is the way the mob
deliberately targeted police women. Female <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> members were
attacked and pulled into the crowd in an effort to break up the police line. This is a troubling
development, and along with the use of acid, blunt weapons, beer bottles and paint, indicates the
levels of planning and organisation by protesters not really seen before in Canberra . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Any objective reading of this article, I think, would sicken most Australians&mdash;the
developments which occurred in that riot and the seemingly premeditated nature of the conduct of
some of those people associated with that riot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a
public debate about responsibility for this matter. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra
Times</EMPHASIS> on 27 October 1996 was an article which gave us details of a letter written by
Bill Mansfield, a senior official in the ACTU, which included the following words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACTU accepts part responsibility for the events in Canberra due to them
occurring in association with our rally.</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that that letter, and in
particular that admission by Mr Mansfield, was the subject of discussions at the ACTU council in
Lorne. The ACTU council rejected the Mansfield admission, publicly repudiated the Mansfield
position and refused to take any responsibility whatsoever for the occurrence in that riot on 19
August. I do not see how it is that people like Jennie George, Wendy Caird and Sharon Burrow can,
in one breath, be attacking the provisions of our legislation as it impacts on women and yet seem
silent in the face of this evidence. Women members of the police force, some of whom would be
unionists, carrying out their duties are, as we now know, targeted for a vicious personal assault
in a premeditated way because they are women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our response to these
events, I think, has been measured at all times. Obviously these matters are essentially for the
criminal process, but I do not think the parliament can ignore the revelation in this article in
the Australian Federal Police Association journal. In fact, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily
Telegraph</EMPHASIS>, in its editorial today, picks up these revelations and says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Investigating police in Canberra have now established the rioters
had come to the capital with a pre&hyphen;arranged set of tactics designed to create the maximum
mayhem and cause maximum damage. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7498"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Among their well&hyphen;laid plans was a cowardly agreement that
front line rioters would target women officers in the police cordon in the belief they would yield
first. The rioters were also convinced that if women police were attacked, male officers would come
to their assistance, creating weak points elsewhere in the line.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>The
editorial concluded with these words:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While unions
continue in the backward and misguided belief that the way to solve problems is by resorting to
violence, by attacking the symbols of the democratic system and by endangering the lives of those
whose job it is to protect us and our property, that is unlikely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Increasing numbers of workers are already convinced unions are no longer relevant
in their lives. The premeditated violence of August 19 will draw others to the same
conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA>I conclude by saying that we restate the government's call that the ACTU
leadership does have some part responsibility in these events. They ought to publicly state that
and apologise for that part responsibility. Given the close association between the political and
industrial wings of the Labor movement, it is also a fact that the parliamentary Labor Party has
some responsibility in this public debate to set proper standards. I call on the Leader of the
Opposition, I call on the shadow minister, I call on the member for Fremantle, who has talked much
about women's rights&mdash;</PARA>

accused the Treasurer of making derogatory remarks about women, despite the admonition of the then

Australian economy is now at a stage where we have inflation back at levels which we have not seen
since 1974. We have interest rates consequently coming down and, as a result of low inflation of
around two per cent, there is now no need for wages to chase prices. It was a point, I thought,
very sensibly made recently by the Governor of the Reserve Bank on 28 November, when he said that
safety net adjustments <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as proposed by the government were
sensible. But he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if the interventions are
more wide&hyphen;ranging, the outcome will be slower employment growth&mdash;either because
individual employers respond to the price/wage squeeze facing them, or because the Bank is forced
to respond to emerging inflationary pressures by raising interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA>The ACTU
living wage claim is a recipe to destroy jobs in this country. That is what it is. It is a
recipe&mdash;as our submission to the Industrial Relations Commission will show&mdash;to shave off
400,000 jobs. So what have we got now? We have a Labor Party which is trying to undo the budget and
put pressure on interest rates. We have the Labor Party supporting a living wage claim which will
destroy 400,000 jobs. What we have is a political party, still in a fit of pique from losing an
election, which is now setting out on a course to try to destroy everything that is good about the
Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Industrial Relations was asking
whether the Labor Party can distinguish itself from the ACTU. Can it on the living wage claim; can
it stand up and say what a sensible policy would be? The ALP cannot distinguish itself from the

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are
absolutely right about that, yes. It is certainly true that in some circumstances residents may
indeed transfer between facilities because their needs change. In fact, I have to point out to the
House and to those listening that one of the features of our reform package is that, where you have
couples who have entered a hostel and one becomes increasingly frail, and they would normally under
the present or the former system have to move one person into a nursing home to receive the high
level of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> care, our system will allow that couple to stay
together. The subsidy we will pay will follow the degree of mental or physical frailty of the
resident. It is not about which facility they are in. So there is a very great benefit
there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I read an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> recently that the new Leader of the Opposition in
Western Australia was claiming that he was going to fix this system. He was up there beating his
chest about it, saying he would not allow the separation of elder couples in hostel and nursing
home facilities. But the fact is he has no authority and no capacity to change the system. We do
have, we are changing it, and we will not put elderly couples through that separation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me finish my answer to the member's question. These changes that are often
made outside those circumstances are the choice of residents. The average total length of stay of
the small number of residents who currently move from a hostel to a nursing home is less than five
years. Very few residents will need to consider the payment of a second entry contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us keep in mind the fact that any unused portion of the entry deposit
is transferable back to the owner or back to the resident and is not kept by the establishment. In
the case of where they leave entirely or they transfer over, the balance will be paid back to them,
or to their estate as the case may be. The fact is that the owner of any establishment can draw
down only $2,600 per annum out of that entry deposit fee that is paid. The balance remains the
property of the person who has made the entry contribution fee. Residents who cannot afford to pay
an entry contribution will not have to pay in any circumstances, and the government will pay an
additional subsidy to help those individuals in their access of care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make it clear that only those with the capacity to pay will be paying
an entry contribution fee, that access will be based on the care needs of the resident, not on
their capacity to pay, and that the government will pay an additional fee for those who cannot
afford to pay an entry contribution fee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development.
Is the minister aware of media reports that despite falling productivity MUA employees are earning
up to $140,000 per annum? Is the minister also aware of claims by the Maritime Union of Australia
on the ABC that `industrial action was completely missing' from the waterfront under Labor over the
last 13 years? How do these claims impact on Australia's international
competitiveness?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="7506" SPEAKER="Sharp, John, MP" NAMEID="AJ4" ELECTORATE="Hume" PARTY="NP" MINISTERIAL="Transport and Regional Development" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank
the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question. Yes, I am aware of reports of waterside
workers being paid amounts up to $140,000. I have even heard reports of amounts in excess of that
being paid to waterside workers around the Australian waterfront. There is plenty of anecdotal
evidence to substantiate those claims made on ABC TV.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those claims were made in an ABC news broadcast last week in the context of
excessive overtime payments being made to waterside workers working at the port of Melbourne. This,
in anybody's book, would be described as outrageously high levels of pay for the type of work that
is performed on the Australian waterfront&mdash;outrageous, too, when you compare the level of
productivity that our Australian waterside workers produce on the Australian waterfront.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at our productivity level on the Australian waterfront, it is
around half that of those countries that we have to compete against. If you go to Europe, you can
find container movements per hour in the order of 50 container movements per hour. Here in
Australia, our average movements come out at around 20 container movements per hour. You can go to
the United States and find 40 containers being moved per hour as the norm in the United States. You
can go to Malaysia where 30 container movements per hour is the norm compared with 20 container
movements per hour here in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These excessive rates of pay
for those people who produce so little would be, by anybody's description, deemed to be outrageous.
But this is even more outrageous in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> light of claims made by
people in the Maritime Union of Australia that they did all of this without industrial disputes
over the last 13 years of a Labor government. I directly quote the joint national secretary of the
Maritime Union of Australian, Mr John Coombs, who said on ABC radio, with the passing of the
workplace relations bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be an increase in industrial
action, something that was missing completely from the waterfront over the last 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA>That claim that there has been no industrial dispute on the Australian waterfront over the
last 13 years is completely and utterly dishonest. The truth is that, from 1986 to the end of 1995,
days lost per employee on the Australian waterfront actually increased, not decreased. They did not
go down to zero but increased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you can see is that their low
productivity, their increase in industrial action over the last 13 years and their enormous pay
levels are causing enormous damage to the Australian economy. These are the people who prospered
well under a Labor government. These people on the Australian waterfront are Labor's
battlers&mdash;Labor's battlers earning these amounts of money. Those battlers that Labor has
represented&mdash;and who have so prospered during Labor's 13 years of government&mdash;are costing
their fellow Australians lots of job opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These job
opportunities that are lost are highlighted in the paper of the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce
released today on the waterfront and its performance. Their press release states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia rates last in an international comparison of 18 ports. Waterfront
charges, port charges, crane rates, ship working rates and delays all show Australian ports still
performing poorly. Delays alone add up to 7.5 per cent to the cost of freight and this costs
business around $1 billion a year.</PARA>
<PARA>These costs of $1 billion a year and more to
business hurt the real battlers in Australia&mdash;those people without a job. These are the people
that our industrial relations reform, through the workplace relations bill, is designed to benefit,
not the sorts of six-figure sultans that the Labor Party supported on the waterfront during their
13 years of govern <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7507"> ment&mdash;those who prospered

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr
RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The combined effect of the opposition's approach
on these policy questions of the two-year waiting period and the disallowing of migration
regulations relating to assurance of support is to ensure that most family sponsored migrants are
not covered by either the waiting period or any assurance of support scheme. That is the net
outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been the fact that over a long period
of time, when a person migrates to Australia in the family migration area, there has been an
expectation that there would be an assurance of support and there be an obligation assumed by the
family that obtains the benefit of having their family member able to enjoin them in Australia in
preference to other migration applicants. In relation to those who come through the business and
skills program, there is also an expectation that those who come with those skills ought to have
the resources to be able to maintain themselves after they arrive in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing remarkable about these propositions. Since the time of
Federation in one form or another sponsors have been expected to give assurances of support, bonds
or guarantees to ensure that such obligations are met. It was only under Labor that the system of
assurance of support came into disrepute. They did not take it seriously. They failed to expand it
to the full range of social security payments, so there would be some payments that would be
covered and if you could get on that one you could get on another. Despite overwhelming evidence
that a bond is more effective as a means of enforcement, they applied the bond only to a very
limited number of migrant categories and they failed to index the bond over that period of
time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has sought to ensure that the obligations that
newly arrived migrants do create are met by either of two ways: first, a preclusion period or, if
that was not able to operate, by the assurance of support scheme being able to be more effectively
used. What have we had? We have had the shadow <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7508">
minister on the Hinch program the other week saying, `If there is a villain in the piece, it's
sponsors and we want to make sponsors pay those obligations.' That is his own statement. He wants
to hold out that he expects sponsors to meet those obligations, but when it comes to the measures
that will ensure that people are not able to access benefits or that the people who benefit from
having their relatives here give assurances, meaningful assurances, that can be enforced, they want
to deny us the opportunity of ensuring that not only one but both measures cannot operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are in a situation now where we have no system in place that is able
to ensure that people who come through the family reunion program are able to be assured that the
commitments that they impose on taxpayers are met by the families who benefit from being able to be
here.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was
a question concerning premium increases by MBF. My answer is as follows: I do stand by the minister
for health's statement. The inference in the honourable member's question that health insurers are
seeking and obtaining premium increases under the current government that are either excessive or
not linked to the issue of prudent financial management is simply not backed up by the facts. Over
the period 1984&hyphen;95, private health insurance premiums across all tables increased by an
average of almost 12 per cent a year. In the two&hyphen;year period between 1986 and 1988, when the
Labor government was in power, premiums increased by a massive 40 per cent in only two
years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Labor government received nearly
200 applications from the major private health insurance funds for premium increases and to my
knowledge did not seek to alter one of those 200 applications. For 13 years the Labor government
neglected and disparaged private health insurance as a core element of a balanced health care
system. The difference between the attitude of the previous government and the coalition, which has
lived up to its election commitment to provide rebates to assist low income Australians to retain
or take out private health insurance, could not be more stark.</PARA>

Unfortunately, neither the audio nor the video tape of the proceedings in the chamber at the time
the interjection was made are of any assistance in resolving the issue as the interjection in the
question is inaudible on both.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having fully considered
all aspects of the matter, I have decided that, under the circumstances, the interjection as
originally recorded in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Proof</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> should stand. I have informed both the Minister for Defence
and the member for Werriwa of my reasons for this decision. I have further advised the member for
Werriwa that he may seek leave to make a further personal explanation in regard to the matter
should he so desire. However, I will not tolerate any further debate on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to take this opportunity to remind honourable members that the
exacting task faced by Hansard staff of accurately reporting proceedings in the chamber is made
even more demanding and difficult when debate becomes noisy and/or heated, as was the case in this
instance. I suggest that honourable members should bear this mind. It is yet another good reason
for maintaining a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reasonable and acceptable standard of

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Thursday, 21 November, I was
asked questions by both the honourable member for Hotham and the honourable member for Hunter in
relation to incidents which were said to have occurred earlier that week and which involved, in the
case of the member for Hotham, alleged deliberate obstruction by the Treasurer when the member for
Hotham was attempting to move to the dispatch box and, in the case of the member for Hunter,
alleged restriction by the member for Paterson of the member for Hunter's movement from one side of
the chamber to another during a division.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I remarked
when the member for Hotham asked his question, I am surprised that the matter was not brought to my
attention when it allegedly occurred. Had this been the case, any appropriate action that may have
been required could have been taken at that time. I remind honourable members that, as stated in
<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> on page 225:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a point of order must be raised immediately and . . . It is not acceptable to
raise points of order concerning proceedings earlier in the day or concerning proceedings of a
previous day.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to the question asked by the
member for Hotham, I have decided that no useful purpose would be served by introducing a
parliamentary version of trial by video so long after the event, particularly when the Treasurer is
on record as deeply regretting any offence or pain and suffering that may have been caused to the
member for Hotham.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to the matter raised by the member for
Hunter, I am confident that the member for Paterson will endeavour to give him a wider berth during
divisions. Again, I remind honourable members of their duty to conduct themselves in an appropriate
manner in this chamber. I hope that it will not be necessary for the House to be diverted by, or as
a consequence of, matters of this nature in the future.</PARA>

error, I contacted the Chief Hansard Reporter, Mr Harris, on 12 November to ask him to check and
confirm the accuracy of my correction of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Harris also explained to me that the shorthand Hansard reporter,
recording the member for Barker's words, did not hear my interjection. I repeat: that person did
not hear my interjection. The shorthand reporter reconstructed the words I might have said on the

the only <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record&mdash;and I understand that it is

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to report to the House on my recent visit
from 22 to 26 November to the Philippines for the APEC leaders meeting. This meeting marked the
start of the hard work of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7513"> turning APEC's free trade
rhetoric into reality. It began to turn vision into action. I believe that the meeting was very
successful, both as a forum for leaders to exchange views and in making progress on APEC's trade
agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Manila, each APEC member economy tabled an individual
action plan which set out steps each would take towards the Bogor commitment of free and open trade
and investment for developing economies by the year 2020 and developed economies by the year 2010.
These plans were reviewed and recommended by APEC trade and foreign ministers at their meeting just
before the leaders meeting. I wish to thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and the
Minister for Trade and Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) for their contribution during the
year to producing such a successful outcome in Manila.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While for the
most part the plans contain steps to which economies were already committed under the Uruguay Round
or unilaterally, they provide proof that APEC economies remain committed to removing tariff and
non&hyphen;tariff barriers to trade and to freeing up investment. They thus set an example we hope
non&hyphen;APEC members will take note of. I wish neither to exaggerate the achievements of the
plans nor to undervalue them. They were a good beginning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They
contain some new commitments of direct and early benefit for Australian business which in turn will
create jobs for Australians. That is why we will continue to press for greater liberalisation of
trade. For example, in the mining sector, the Philippines will lift import restrictions on coal.
Thailand will liberalise its natural gas market. In agriculture, Hong Kong will relax import
restrictions on rice by the year 2000 and controls on the stockpiling of frozen meat and poultry.
Japan will introduce new quarantine measures expected to expedite Australian exports of fruit and
flowers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be other new opportunities for Australian
business in banking and investment where access has been improved. China, for example, has agreed
to increase the number of licences for foreign banking, insurance and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> securities organisations. Thailand will increase the number of joint ventures in
the insurance sector. Singapore will gradually open up the domestic banking sector to greater
participation by international financial institutions. And the Philippines will review foreign
investment restrictions on investment institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also
promising new commitments with regard to opportunities for Australian professional services.
Singapore will remove commercial presence restrictions on engineers and architects. Japan is to
review laws relating to foreign lawyers operating in Japan. Korea will review restrictions on the
commercial presence for foreign accounting firms and improve market access for foreign
lawyers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The plans provide for each economy a consolidated picture
of liberalisation, in the case of some APEC economies for the first time, thereby giving a higher
degree of certainty and transparency for business. The plans also lay down a baseline for the
future. In a rolling process, the plans will be continually reviewed, updated and improved over the
next 25 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will now do all it can to encourage
the production of better plans over the next year or two. APEC leaders committed themselves in
their declaration to improve them by the time they next meet in Vancouver next year. APEC trade
ministers will review them next year, and in doing so will take into account the views of the
business community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government welcomes the increasing
involvement of the business community in APEC as insurance that APEC will focus on business's
needs. The government sees a major role for the APEC Business Advisory Committee in monitoring the
improvement of the action plans of the member economies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7514"> The business community has long asked governments to
facilitate travel among member economies. I was pleased, therefore, to announce during the APEC
meetings agreement with Korea and the Philippines to trial Australia's proposal of an APEC business
travel card which will provide business people with easier and faster access, including streamlined
arrival arrangements. The govern ment hopes that, once the trial has proved the worth of the
scheme, other APEC members will join in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has already
reduced tariffs and other barriers more than most member economies. Like every other government,
mine will take account of what other economies are doing in deciding future steps. But our position
is a positive one, based on the assessment that liberalisation will bring overall benefits to the
economy. Australia's own action plan demonstrates the government's continuing commitment to trade
liberalisation. This commitment is not a matter of ideology, but a consequence of the government's
conviction that liberalisation within the region will help sustain the region's economic growth,
will open up increasing market opportunities for Australian exporters, will help promote
Australia's own economic growth, and will create jobs and improve living standards in Australia.
APEC can help ease the costs of economic adjustment caused by liberalisation and globalisation
through maximising the opportunities those same forces provide to increase our exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in my first intervention during the leaders meeting,
globalisation is the most potent economic force in the world today. It is important, in order to
ensure public support for the economic and social adjustments that have to be made and to ensure
that we can take advantage of the opportunities globalisation offers, that governments explain to
their electorates the overall benefits of liberalisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recent
survey of Austrade's exporter clients showed that nearly 60 per cent either had increased
employment or expected to do so as a result of exporting. Sixty&hyphen;four per cent said that they
expected improved profitability as a result of exporting. Likewise, a survey of the growth and
performance of small and medium sized enterprises released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics
in September shows that a higher proportion of exporting businesses increased employment than
non&hyphen;exporting businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">APEC's ambitions will be realised
only if all participating economies continue to liberalise. Not every economy will move at the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> same pace in the same area. APEC does not require
mathematically precise reciprocity, but for APEC to work there has to be continual movement across
all sectors and all economies have to see the benefits for them&mdash;that is, in APEC language,
the principles of comprehensiveness and comparability are important to the success of APEC's trade
liberalisation process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that respect, I found the APEC leaders
meeting encouraging. My impression was of a strong commitment to APEC and to the goal of free trade
as the centrepiece of APEC. I was particularly heartened to hear the President of the United States
repeat his support for maintaining the momentum of liberalisation, as expressed during his recent
visit to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">APEC is an important element in the government's
efforts to improve market access, growth and employment, but only one element. Externally, APEC is
only one strand of our trade policy, which focuses also on gaining access at the bilateral and
multilateral levels. APEC can be of assistance by providing opportunities for bilateral discussions
on action plans and in imparting greater dynamism to the World Trade Organisation. The call by APEC
leaders for the World Trade Organisation to conclude an information technology agreement is one
such example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In turn, the government's trade policy is only one
element in its overall strategy to lift growth. Living cheek by jowl with the fast growing Asian
economies does not of itself assure success. We not only need the market access but also need to be
competitive. The government's budget deficit reduction strategy, its reforms of the labour market
and reduction of red tape are, likewise, important components of the government's program to lift
economic growth, employment and living standards. All of these are key ingredients in the
government's approach to industry policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7515"> In Manila and at the leaders meeting itself, I took the opportunity to
underline my government's commitment to engagement with our region and to APEC as a core feature of
that engagement. I reiterated that our participation would be wholehearted in achieving the trade
and investment liberal isation goals laid down at Bogor. I emphasised my personal commitment to
continuing the work of my predecessors on both sides of the House who established APEC and
suggested the leaders meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">APEC reflects the integration of the
various strands in the government's regional policies. It demonstrates the mutually reinforcing
roles played by our alliance with the United States and our partnerships with major Asian friends.
It creates a sense of community among a very diverse group of economies by building on their common
interests in promoting economic growth. It thus makes a very material contribution to the stability
of our region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The leaders meeting, in particular, is a most
valuable institution for Australia and the Asia-Pacific region. It provides an unparalleled
opportunity for face-to-face contact between leaders in the region. It helps underline shared
interests in growth and stability. It has a special character which can be maintained only if there
continues to be a personal commitment on the part of all leaders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The authority and expectations that leaders bring to the APEC process are
essential to maintaining the momentum of APEC's core trade and investment liberalisation agenda and
delivering the results our business sector and communities at large look for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the great strengths of the annual APEC meeting is the opportunity for the
Australian Prime Minister to meet, in a very short period, a range of other leaders from our key
regional partners. I had a very useful and productive meeting with President Jiang Zemin of China.
I was able to assure the President that the government saw close cooperation with China as
important, both politically and economically. As very different societies, we will not always see
eye to eye on everything, but a strong relationship is mutually beneficial, given the substantial
interests we have in common. I look forward to giving practical expression to this when I visit
China next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government sees China's full participation in
regional and global structures as a force for stability. I had a valuable first meeting with
President Kim Young Sam of Korea. Korea is now our second largest <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> export market and the ties between our two countries, including at a
people-to-people level, are growing strongly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My meeting with Dr
Mahathir built on my discussions with him earlier this year and enabled me to underline the
strengths and value of the bilateral relationship with Malaysia. I hope to be able to pursue this
further when I visit Malaysia in 1997. I had good discussions also with the Prime Minister of
Singapore, Mr Goh Chok Tong, and I plan to visit his country also next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My meeting with Mr Chretien, the Prime Minister of Canada, enabled me to reaffirm
our commitment to the traditionally close relationship between Australia and Canada. I look forward
to attending the next leaders meeting under his chairmanship in Vancouver in 1997. His positive
view of APEC's dynamism and capacity to produce results was encouraging. I was able to renew my
acquaintance with a number of other leaders, including the Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Hashimoto,
and President Soeharto of Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to thank
President Ramos and the people of the Philippines for the generous hospitality they extended to me
and to the members of my travelling party. President Ramos's strong and successful chairmanship of
APEC during such a demanding year is a tribute to him, to his government and to the people of the
Philippines. The holding of the APEC meeting in the Philippines gave me the opportunity to restate
the value the government places on Australia's relations with the Philippines. I note in the press
this morning some remarks of the finance minister of the Philippines drawing very strong attention
to the closeness of the bilateral relationship between Australia and that country. I particularly
note the rapid economic growth the Philippines is now enjoying under the leadership of President
Ramos. I was pleased, while in Manila, to be able to speak at a reception held by the
Australia&hyphen;New Zealand Chamber of Commerce and to meet many Australian business men and women
who are seizing many growing economic opportunities in the Philippines. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7516">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I assure them, and all other business people
operating in the APEC economies, of the government's interest in their success and the priority the
government gives to doing all it can to support them. Might I also take the opportunity to thank my
three representatives on the APEC business committee: Mr Malcolm Kinnaird, of Adelaide, Mrs Imelda
Roche and Mr Michael Crouch. All of them very ably represented the Australian business interests at
the gathering, and I think the interaction between the business representatives of the various APEC
economies is a very valuable and important adjunct to the whole APEC process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Could I apologise in advance to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) for the
necessity I have, because of another commitment, to leave before he will have finished his speech.
In normal circumstances I would not do that, but I hope he will understand the exigencies of the
situation. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Firstly, I join with the Prime
Minister (Mr Howard) in congratulating the Australian cricket team for a second terrific victory
and note the emergence on the scene of another genuinely quick bowler in the shape of Jason
Gillespie, whom I had the dubious pleasure of seeing operate on a very fast Western Australian
pitch. He absolutely obliterated the Western Australian side. If he is selected for the Perth test,
I expect it to be a short one indeed. It is good to see our cricketers performing well, despite the
odd criticism that is made of the team from time to time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also join with the Prime Minister in congratulating the performance of the
business people who attended the APEC conference in the Philippines along with the Prime Minister.
That growing involvement of the Australian business community has been one of the very good
features of APEC. I think we have seen over the last few months how truly international an outlook
our business community has developed, as shown by the very strong stands they have been taking on
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> issues related to an outward looking, competitive Australia
which takes export markets seriously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a total change
in the culture of Australian business over the last 13 or 14 years. The particular business men and
women named by the Prime Minister have played no small role in that. They are to be congratulated
in that regard on the leadership they have shown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the time the
Labor government left office at the beginning of the year, APEC had progressed from the initiative
that Bob Hawke and Gareth Evans put in place, strongly expanded by the subsequent Prime Minister
Paul Keating under his leadership, to the pre-eminent grouping for regional economic cooperation in
our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is terribly important to note the role prime
ministers and foreign ministers can play in regional affairs. Nothing is static in international
relations. There are moments which you can take&mdash;to use a cliche&mdash;at the flood, to
achieve things which, if you leave them on a backburner, if you do not deal with them at the time,
cease to be opportunities in the future, and a great chance is lost for a real advance in
international relationships in any particular area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was a
decision taken by Bob Hawke, Gareth Evans and Paul Keating at the flood. I think it is virtually
impossible now to imagine that we could have gotten the PRC, Taiwan and Hong Kong into one regional
organisation for an initiative at any time in the last year or so, or perhaps gotten a
post&hyphen;NAFTA United States into such an organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to
reflect upon a whole range of other activities which have occurred since the late 1980s in the
region, though many of them are very hopeful some of them are not so and there is a bit of
orneriness and crankiness which might well have produced a totally different set of outcomes if
that initiative had not been there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing about people like Paul
Keating, Gareth Evans and Bob Hawke is that they punched above their weight, the weight of this
nation, in international affairs and did a very <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7517">
effective job of it indeed. The problem with international politics is always that if you are not
there doing that sort of thing, if you are not there providing the leadership, your country,
particularly if it is a middle power like Australia, misses out. Nothing is static. As I said, you
always have to have new initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I have one major
disappointment with the remarks the Prime Minister has just made to us, it is that neither in his
presentation at APEC nor in his presentation here today is there the slightest evidence of anything
other than an almost traditional Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting approach&mdash;good chaps
chatting about good issues in an important way and making unexceptional statements. At the end of
the day, you need to do a bit more than that if you are an Australian leader. We have to bat very
clever indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from that initiative on business travel, which
is effectively setting up a pilot project with Korea, there is very little you can discern from
this that seems to provide a new approach to affairs in this region as far as Australia is
concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this government really does have to sort out its
attitude to multilateralism and bilateralism. The one criticism they made of our foreign policy was
insufficient aggressiveness in bilateral trading relations. Aggressiveness in bilateral trading
relations these days is not an unknown factor in the international political system. There is a
great deal of it. What aggressive bilateral relations generally constitutes these days is picking
up a multilateral agreement, like that associated with the WTO, and getting into international
legal circles or into bilateral relationships and punching somebody's head off. That is basically
the sort of thing that has happened to us since we have pursued aggressive bilateralism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is multilateralism, in fact, which is more the order of the day for what
dominates regional affairs in a cooperative fashion. The bilateral role, in so far as there is a
bilateral role&mdash;it is not unimportant&mdash;constitutes the softer approaches in international
relationships of pursuing trade missions, of putting forward exhibitions of your country, of
raising very <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> specific matters that relate to affairs between
two nations. That bilateral forum is not one in which you can resolve major trade issues unless you
go super aggressive. As the government well knows, having had to handle it, we have been a victim
of some very considerable aggression on this so-called aggressive bilateral basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are punching above your weight, it has to be said that aggressive
bilateralism will find you out very quickly. I think we have been found out in one or two areas of
this very quickly. If you are going to do things bilaterally in the softer areas, as I mentioned,
you need to do them fulsomely because the opportunities are there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another disappointment I have with the Prime Minister in this regard is that he
did not appear in India when he could have&mdash;he left it to his Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim
Fischer) and his Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer). I went to the presentations there. I
congratulate the foreign affairs department on their effort. It was a good exposition. There was
the odd glitch. Nevertheless, it was a very useful performance.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="DOWNER" NAMEID="4G4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You

I take the opportunities as they come and I take them humbly, Alexander. I well recognise that from
time to time it is necessary to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I
also took the opportunity to be somewhat more discursive in discussions with a number of
think&hyphen;tanks in India and make a more detailed assessment of the direction of Australian
foreign policy and of bilateral relationships between Australia and India. The Prime Minister's
failure to put a day or two into that was a tragedy. There was a real opportunity there for a Prime
Minister wanting to initiate things in international affairs to make his mark because there is a
degree of vacant space as far as that relationship we have with India is concerned. That vacant
space was not filled. The Prime Minister missed a very useful opportunity to fill it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7518">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The APEC leaders forum, as the
Prime Minister has said, does provide an opportunity for leaders to meet. It is now starting to
perform quite a critical function. Leaders will not simply sit around and talk about trade matters;
they will want to talk more discursively about regional affairs. We are beginning to develop in the
Asia-Pacific region something that resembles the sort of security community that people are used to
in other regional areas of the globe be it in the Middle East, central Europe or western Europe.
What that involves is a number of nations sorting out diplomatically for the first time in the
experience of most of them the types of regional arrangements that guarantee security. These
leaders meetings are critical in that regard. They are not just critical for being an opportunity
to get to know each other. If that is all they are then they are useful but not crucial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If APEC is going to continue to have the meaning that it ought to have, if
the leadership meetings associated with APEC are to continue and still be reflective of a
willingness of all leaders to attend, then that is the part of APEC which is most at risk. That
requirement on leaders to attend, because they are all busy people and they do not go just to meet
good chaps, is totally incumbent upon those of us who really believe in the organisation to
actually put forward initiatives and sometimes those initiatives will need to be outside the trade
area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there were a number of areas we could have advanced a
little further at APEC than we did. I would like to have seen more of an effort on bringing in
observer status to a number of nations which are on the borders of the APEC region. I would also
like to have seen more opportunity taken to utilise APEC as a forum for establishing further a
Chinese role in global affairs. It is a very difficult task we have to pursue&mdash;the appropriate
integration of China into the international political system. The ASEAN regional forum is doing a
very good job on that. APEC is another forum where those issues can be pursued. It is a broader
regional base than the ASEAN regional forum.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there is a deal of evidence now that, at least in the ASEAN regional
forum, there is an element of cleverness in the engagement of China which is beginning to work. You
can make an argument about that but, nevertheless, that is the case. Though there is a much higher
focus on trade matters at APEC, you will not simply get leaders coming out year after year or every
couple of years to APEC functions unless those leadership meetings can supply that broader based
capacity for diplomatic initiatives, coming from countries like Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned China. China is an area where the Prime Minister has a deal of fixing
to do. I am very glad to see that he is going to take a trip to China during the course of next
year. The problems that he has with China are largely problems of foreign policy inexperience of
this government. That is simply the fact of the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we were
in office we could pursue a whole range of sensitive issues with China, be they issues of
democratisation, be they issues of development and maintenance of democracy in Hong Kong, be they
issues of cultural rights of the Tibetan people, or be they other human rights issues. We could
pursue those actively with the Chinese without giving them cause to take offence. We have a record
of being able to do that. Why could we do that? We could do that for a variety of reasons. One
reason is that the Chinese government of the day basically accepted us as people of honour.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am being heckled by the foreign minister in this

foreign affairs, decapitated our sense of honour with the position that he pursued on the DIFF
projects&mdash;a position which would have got him into a deal more hot water in a government that
took questions of honour seriously in this place. If that were the case he would now find himself
an ambassador or in some other appropriate position elsewhere instead of the position he now
holds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7519">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact of the matter is this: our contemporary problems with China
started with that. They were then pursued by the inexperience of the Minister for Defence (Mr
McLachlan) and the overclaiming of what was indeed a good outcome in our ministerial discussions
with the United States&mdash;an overclaiming on our part, not on the part of the United States, as
to what all that meant in terms of regional affairs. When that was combined with stupid statements
from the Minister for Defence, the Chinese naturally assumed that it was the first stage of putting
in place some sort of containment strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think much of
the subtleties of what President Clinton had to say here was missed by the Australian population
and the media, but one of the subtleties was missed, and that was his firm declaration of what the
nature of the Australian&hyphen;American bilateral relationship was in connection with our
relationship with China and the US relationship with China. He felt the need to set that very
firmly on the record. He had to set it very firmly on the record because of the Chinese reaction to
the position which had been put deliberately, but with great inexperience, by the government at the
time of those discussions with the Americans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When impressions once
created on so many fronts&mdash;be they in our attitudes to questions of racial harmony in this
nation, be they our attitudes to approaches to the region, be they our views on defence&mdash;match
a particular stereotype that may have been there in the past, a redoubled effort is required to fix
them. The Prime Minister has a redoubled task; a task greater than he should have had when he goes
to see the leadership in China on his visit next year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Only one
serious error. This is an error of commission as opposed to omission, and therefore more serious.
The ones that I have been talking about thus far have been  errors of omission; this is one of
commission, when he decided to reorder the relationship that has been established and sustained
since they were in office in relation to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> our major partners
in international affairs. Where we have accorded an equal weight to our relationship with Japan,
our relationship with Indonesia and our relationship with the United States, the Prime Minister
managed to relegate the Indonesian relationship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The
problem with the Prime Minister is that he will never admit a mistake. He will never retreat from a
bad position. He will never admit it. It does not matter even if it happens to be about whether he
has appropriate mechanisms for establishing the probity of his ministers. He sets up a set of
standards for the probity of his ministers and finds that his ministers cannot conform with them,
particularly when any minister is capable of putting the weights on him. So the problem is not the
administration of it but the policy. The policy has to be changed to fit the circumstances of what
the Prime Minister is proposed to bear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I asked the Prime Minister a
question yesterday that gave him a chance to correct the position that he put forward. He seemed to
understand that he made a bit of an error. He got up and said, `I should not have said what I said
on that particular occasion, but I have decided on a new approach to that now. I will not correct
that in relation to the Indonesians. They are important to us, but I will never again establish a
hierarchy in our relationships around us.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are supposed to
believe from this point on that the relationship we have with Antigua is the same as the one that
we have with the United States, that the relationship we have with Belize is as significant to us
as the one that we have with Japan and so on. It is obviously the case that some relationships are
going to be more important to countries than others. You would not say, for example, that the
relationship with a nation of the size of Papua New Guinea would necessarily be very important to
Australia, but it is important for the simple reason of its geographic proximity. Likewise with
Canada. Canada to the United States would simply be your average middle power but for the fact that
the US shares a border and a long history with the Canadian people. So therefore they have a
completely different attitude to them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7520">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have an attitude to the United States because we have been defended by them.
That is why they are substantially important to us. We have a relationship with Japan that is
enormously significant to us because of the development of patterns of trade and investment in
association with Japan. We have a relationship with Indonesia which is critical to us because of
geographic proximity and the fact that we live forever together in this region and we simply have
to get on. It is entirely appropriate to establish a hierarchy of relationships in international
affairs. Simply because you are embarrassed about it is no reason to walk away from it. So the
Prime Minister does not get himself off the hook for that very substantial error of omission in the
remarks that he made in answer to the position that I put forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Next year the Prime Minister has a very substantial task to perform. He has to
overcome an impression in the region around us&mdash;and I do not believe this visit helped more
than a little in this regard&mdash;that we have lost our way in policy towards the region. The
reason why that perception is abroad is that of the errors I have already referred to, essentially
errors committed by his foreign minister. But they are also errors of his own. I referred to one
just a moment ago. The other was the extraordinary speeches the Prime Minister made in Indonesia,
which when you dovetail it with his relegation of them in the hierarchical order must still have
President Soeharto scratching his head as to what they were all up to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact is that he repeatedly erected this straw man. `Australia is not
part of Asia,' he said. There was a repeat of this something like 16 times in official statements.
Not that anybody had ever said this before but, when you repeat something for the 16th time and
nobody is used to hearing it before, you are entitled to think that the person who makes it for the
16th time is trying to make a point that you had better work out&mdash;is this gentleman trying to
offend us or what, having made this point so frequently?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second
remark that he made was that we were not a bridge to Asia, when successive Australian governments
have been arguing in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the international business community
that we are precisely that economically, and sought to take advantage of it. Indeed, all those
businessmen so honourably referred to at Subic Bay were people who had been living on the notion of
us being a bridge to Asia for a very substantial period of time. This is an area which he must
correct and he must correct very substantially.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had an opportunity
before the Prime Minister went to APEC to go to both India and Indonesia. I was delighted to be
accompanied by our foreign affairs spokesman, Laurie Brereton. I will tell you one of the things
that really impressed me about the Indonesians. They seemed to believe that they had a job to do.
That job was that there was a relationship with Australia that had to be sustained and they ought
to sustain it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a very interesting thing to be on the
receiving end of somebody else's initiatives and to see our ministers on the receiving end of
somebody else's initiatives. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the other ministers who were up
there indeed had a good set of ministerial consultations between the Indonesians and themselves at
the time. They were good because the Indonesians took control of the agenda and dealt with it.
Indeed, the one great initiative out of that&mdash;and it was a really terrific
initiative&mdash;whereby we now jointly go into partnership dealing with development issues in
eastern Indonesia was an initiative of theirs, not of ours. That was the most substantial thing to
emerge from it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is no bad thing in one sense. It is no bad
thing that we should be the object of somebody else's bilateral initiative. Indeed it is good. It
shows the essential underlying health of a relationship created by the previous government. But
that we had nothing therefore to say to them of very much moment at the time is a disappointment on
our side. And a great deal of work will have to continue to be done by them to sustain the
relationship which we have managed to build up over the years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The
Prime Minister these days does not seem to be capable of making a statement without having some
sort of ambiguous element included within it. So today, when <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7521"> the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) got up and asked him a question,
the Prime Minister got up and said, `Well, yes, what you said in characterising my remarks was
right, but I'd also said the opposite in the set of the same speeches.' We find that many features
of this speech he has just delivered here to us represent two bob each way. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has already reduced tariffs and other barriers more than most member
economies. Like every other government, mine will take account of what other economies are doing in
deciding future steps. But our position is a positive one based on the assessment that
liberalisation will bring overall benefits to the economy.</PARA>
<PARA>On the one hand, we will
talk liberalisation; on the other hand, we will only liberalise when somebody else gets into the
show and does it as we would want them to. So we get the old two-handed approach again. He
continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">APEC's ambitions will be realised only if all participating
economies continue to liberalise. Not every economy will move at the same pace in the same
area.</PARA>
<PARA>One thought. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And APEC does not
require mathematically precise reciprocity.</PARA>
<PARA>The other thought comes in. Again, it is
the old two-handed policy coming forward from the Prime Minister on this. Indeed, APEC is making
some very considerable progress, and we ought to be glad of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It
is sometimes said that the other nations in APEC are not doing as much as we are or not doing
enough. I think it is true to say that they probably have not done as much as we have. But are they
on their glide paths, so to speak, to the objectives that were set for 2010 and 2020? Yes, many of
them are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a very interesting study, which I would commend
to all honourable members. It is a paper produced by the Australia-Japan Research Centre at the
ANU. It shows the trade liberalisation timetables of each APEC economy compared with a glide path
which takes their general tariff rates from 1993 out to complete liberalisation by
2010&hyphen;2020, consistent with the Bogor declaration. It shows most countries well on
track&mdash;and that includes, in particular, China, Malaysia, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Indonesia and Australia. The US is slightly above its glide path, and Japan is
well above its glide path. So, quite clearly, there are things that have to be considered by those
two nations. But it is not a bad outcome to see that those other countries are basically in the
business of conforming to what it is that they have committed themselves to&mdash;and that very
major objective is one of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing I compliment the
government on and agree with them on is that they have determined that there should be a selling
job done on APEC in the Australian community. There is much to sell as far as APEC is concerned.
The massive expansion that has taken place in Australian trade in manufactured goods and services
in the region around us is a product of our liberalisation and their liberalisation. That means
thousands of jobs in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then you can go into the area
where President Clinton is taking initiative in&mdash;and I would commend the Prime Minister to
give consideration to his words on free trade in information technology. This is an area of vast
opportunity for Australia over the course of the next decade or two. We are, outside of Japan, the
most sophisticated IT market in the region and the second biggest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of our commentators sometimes like to sit around in armchairs and criticise
the performance of Australian business and Australian governments from time to time on these sorts
of issues and generally lend weight to a view that Australia is an inferior participant in the
international economy. If you want to establish that that is baloney, you can do it on many fronts.
But you can do it on no better front than the area of information technology, where we massively
outweigh&mdash;in the performance of our capacity to absorb it and our economy and export services
related to it&mdash;all the Asian tigers, bar Japan, by a country mile. I am not talking here in
relative terms; I am talking here in absolute terms. The rate of increase in employment in this
sector in this country is about 20 per cent per annum, which is a very heavy rate of increase in
employment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But it
also has to be said&mdash;and I am grateful for our opposition spokesman on industry getting in
before I could make the point&mdash;that, as you go through every single one of the areas in which
we have improved our performance in elaborately transformed manufactured goods exports, you find
somewhere standing in there an initiative in industry policy of the previous government, be it in
the car plan, be it in the steel plan, be it in the R&amp;D tax concessions, be it in the bounties
associated with shipbuilding, which were massive, and of course with computers&mdash;and be it,
above all, I have to say, in the sorts of partnership agreements that we have in the electronics
industry, feeding off the very substantial purchases in the Australian economy of Telstra. The
improved export performance largely in this region has been exponential&mdash;from $50 million in
value in 1983 when we came into office to over $1 billion now and reputedly $1&half; billion by the
end of this century.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But you rip Telstra out from those
underpinnings and from that, essentially, gentleman's agreement which nobody could ever legislate
and the performance will become very shonky indeed. Companies which were once 100 per cent
dependent on their sales to Telstra now total only 50 per cent&mdash;50 per cent is still your
bread and butter&mdash;and if you remove that 50 per cent then the rest of the performance goes
altogether. We have a terrific story to tell on APEC, as indeed this government can tell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, as it tells its story, it is going to have to qualify that
by the realities of the impact of the changes in industry policy that it has put in place and those
wonderful statistics that you can point to. That trade liberalisation in the region&mdash;feeding,
however, off industry policy here&mdash;may well start to change. It will take a few years, but it
may well start to change, and that will be to the detriment of our ability to sell this to the
Australian community in the way in which it ought to be sold. But, above all, apart from any
political selling job, the reality will be that it will be to the detriment of employment
opportunity here.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I would
encourage the Prime Minister to actually keep going abroad, but I would encourage him to take an
attitude other than that of good chaps meeting together and coming back with something other than
simply commentaries on it. I hope that when he goes abroad in the future he will go abroad with
initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just hope he will not let down people in the way in
which he let down the Indians. I hope that when his own government have made a few errors they will
at least admit mistakes to themselves, if they will not admit them to anyone else, and put in place
the essential corrective to restore the honour that we need restored if we are going to continue to
play the sort of role that the previous government enabled us to play in Asia when we punched, as I
said before, so magnificently above our weight.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Never
has a new government so quickly betrayed its constituencies. This was a government elected on a
promise to help Australian industry. It promised to keep the computer bounty established by Labor.
It promised to keep Labor's 150 per cent tax concession. It promised to ensure 10 per cent of
government purchases went to small business. It promised not to cut Labor's export assistance
schemes. And, most importantly, it promised to create 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing by the turn
of the century.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the government have delivered on
none of these. The reason is that we have an industry minister who cannot deliver for industry. The
Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) delivers compliantly only for Treasury. It is
worth looking at what he has delivered for Treasury to the detriment of Australian industry. In his
first year he delivered a $4 billion cut to industry assistance. Well done, Minister! A 27 per cent
cut to support for industrial research and development, with more to come as the cuts bite in the
out years. He allowed the 150 per cent tax concession to be traded to Tim Fischer's leadership via
the diesel fuel rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His only defence, as he told the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, was that it could have been worse. `Treasury
actually wanted to cut further,' he said, `and pip, pip, haven't I done well!' Not only has he
broken a promise but it could have been worse, and he expects industry to cop that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He allowed himself to be mugged by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in abolishing
research and development syndication. So thin was the justification for the decision that he put
four examples into his press release. He called them `actual examples' and yet, as his department
admitted in the Senate, not one of them was an actual syndicate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We
have now got the Wright family moved into research and development syndication. But, unlike
Minister Vanstone, who had the decency to turn up in the Senate, admit a mistake and apologise,
there was no apology <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7524"> from this man&mdash;no apology
for the fact that he has misled the House. He also got mugged over the Howe Leather affair,
allowing himself to be given the job of finding an adequate compensation package&mdash;something we
have not yet seen come forward. He is still working on it no doubt because he knows that he has to
come up with some form of compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have to realise that
he delivered on the abolition of bounties not only for the computer industry but for the Australian
book industry, the machine tools and robotics industry and, of course, the shipbuilding industry.
We know his own backbenchers have some serious concerns now about the shipbuilding bounty. His
Western Australian colleagues are lobbying him to reverse this decision&mdash;as well they should,
because Labor argued from the very beginning that they should reverse on this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen a huge growth in the shipbuilding industry in this country because
of the bounty scheme. Regional centres all around the country from Fremantle to Hobart to Darwin to
Brisbane are all in the shipbuilding industry because they got support. But this government has cut
that assistance from them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have got the backbench of the Liberal
Party wanting to know why the minister is prepared to look at a compensation package for Howe
Leather but not for the shipbuilding industry in Western Australia. The minister has attended that
state on two occasions and has not taken up the request of the shipbuilding industry to meet with
them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the Premier of Western Australia supporting Labor in
its call for the retention of this ship bounty. But it all falls on the deaf ears of the minister.
We have suggestions of the Western Australian senators crossing the floor on the shipbuilding
industry issue. We will be interested to see how they vote, to see whether they do vote for
Australian jobs and for jobs in Western Australia or whether they, like the minister, are prepared
to continue to be mugged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has also been rolled by the Treasurer
on a submission that sought to implement government election promises on government <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> purchasing. This was his latest defeat. He had briefed all the
journalists about how his first major initiative on industry policy was going to be the utilisation
of government purchasing. It is another promise that the government said it was going to honour but
which is now completely in tatters because the minister has been rolled by the Treasurer
again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a person who does not get rolled just by the
Treasurer in this government; he happens to be so ineffective he gets rolled by committee
secretaries as well. We have Senator Tierney refusing the minister's request to set up a bipartisan
parliamentary committee to look at ways of ensuring the future of the Australian steel industry.
What could be more important to the regional centres of Whyalla and Newcastle and Port Hedland in
the Pilbara? But the minister will not embrace the bipartisan approach, because his committee
secretary will not allow him to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But even on arguably the most
important promise&mdash;to deliver 200,000 new manufacturing jobs&mdash;he has also failed, because
he has participated in decisions which will significantly reduce the number of manufacturing jobs.
He has not even asked his department to tell him how he can achieve the 200,000 target.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if you thought that was enough, wait, there is more! The other day he
called for a further review of the programs of his department. The minister said he hopes the
review will not be used as an excuse for further cuts to industry assistance. He hopes! Under him
industry has got no hope. How much faith can Australian industry have in a minister who has been so
ineffective in such a short space of time&mdash;particularly in light of the fact that the review
is to bring down an interim report by March, in plenty of time for the Treasurer to use it to pull
more money out of what he calls business welfare?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry,
Minister, does not want any further cuts. It wants a government with a vision for Australian
industry. It wants a statement of industry policy by this government and a commitment to programs
which will support Australian industry in its development, in jobs growth, in net export growth and
in correcting the current account as well <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7525"> as the
deficit. It is for those reasons that, as an important response, the Labor Party is opposing in the
Senate the measures that have been proposed by this government to cut industry assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Funding for research and development and for bounties are not costs in the
budget; they are investments in the future of the nation. They lead to higher growth, they lead to
increased jobs, they lead to regional economic development and they lead to net exports&mdash;all
of the things that you say you aspire for this nation but for which you are prepared to put nothing
in place to help achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So complete has been the betrayal of
Australian industries and so concerned are they about the direction this government has so quickly
moved to that there has been a litany of calls from business groups in the community for this
government to articulate some sort of vision of industry policy. You can go through the headlines:
`Industry calls for a complete industry policy'; `Industry looks in vain for policy'; `Industry
policy has no vision, say chiefs'; `More flack flies over Canberra's industry policy';
`ACCI'&mdash;the greatest supporter of this government&mdash;`sights on industry policy'; and
`Industry calls for a vision'. This is a damning indictment of industry policy under this
government, and from the people who were looking to you for the sort of support they expected to
get out of the place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to acknowledge that people on this
side of the House happen to like this man. He is a nice man. He can actually be very pleasant
company. But the fact is that as a minister he is a dud. He is totally ineffective. He could not
represent anything. There are rumours that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) is
looking for fresh fields&mdash;Foreign Affairs&mdash;because of the debacle that the Minister for
Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) has created. But if Mr Reith really wants to test his leadership
credentials against the Treasurer&mdash;and we know how keen he is in that regard&mdash;what better
place to do it than in the industry portfolio? The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) should reflect on
this as he thinks through his first major reshuffle.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's approach to industry policy draws a clear contrast with that of the
coalition. It recognises that there is a role for government in industry policy, that there is not
a level playing field in the international marketplace. The policy focuses on securing jobs in
existing industries and making the most of the potential for jobs growth in new ones. It is about
identifying the opportunities for this country and realising the potential. It is a more active
approach. It is explicitly interventionist and it recognises the limits of the free market
philosophy. It also actively encourages and supports manufacturing industry as well as the new
high-growth, high-skill service industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst such a policy
approach signals a more interventionist approach, it does not mean a return to the old,
inward&hyphen;looking protectionist approach. Indeed, that is an approach that the National Party
wants to pursue. That is the division that is going on in the debate. It is a free market approach
in the Liberal Party and a protectionist and Black Jack McEwen approach in the National Party.
These must be great debates. No wonder industry has given up on getting a vision out of this
government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Neither is our policy one that involves a `dead hand of
government' approach. It is not about propping up poor performers. Rather, our approach involves
working with industry and regions to develop and support industries and firms that embrace best
practice and that are internationally competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do support the
continued opening of international markets. We as a government invested too heavily in the Cairns
Group, in the GATT outcome and in the APEC approach&mdash;as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr
Beazley) has just spent some time going through&mdash;to let that go. So we argue that the approach
we are pursuing has to be in the context of aggressively pursuing more open international
markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, because our approach involves a much greater degree of
industry input rather than being simply government driven, the intervention or assistance that we
advocate may vary from industry to industry, from region to region. It may mean, for example,
better <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7526"> addressing market access issues. It means
more aggressively pursuing the bilateral focus but against the backdrop of the multilateral
framework that Labor put in place and Labor established because it was prepared to address
important issues of industry reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We went to the GATT
negotiations for the first time in the history of this country with a policy that said, `Do as we
say and as we are prepared to do.' The National Party used to front, as representatives of this
nation, for decades and say, `Open up your markets to our agricultural produce.' When those markets
said, `Yes, but what about you opening up yours to our manufactures?' they were dumbstruck because
they had no response. They did not go with clean hands; they did not go with integrity; they did
not go with consistency. Labor introduced that for the first time. That is why we now have the
framework. We are not going to let that go. But in pursuing it aggressively, in pursuing the
continued opening up, we are not going to be the only ones leading in the field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other forms of assistance that could come by way of this interventionist
approach are: to encourage innovation across industry sectors through support for skill formation,
research and development and commercialisation; to better use the leverage of government
purchasing&mdash;something the minister has again failed on; better access to capital through
instruments such as pooled development funds; Commonwealth leadership and leverage to ensure the
development of major infrastructure projects; tailored assistance through, for example, the
bounties and factor F scheme; and a focus on industry plans such as the steel plan and the car
plan. This country needs an industry policy. In this parliament, it is only the Labor Party that is
committed to developing one.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last nine months, the member for Hotham
(Mr Crean) has been peddling the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> line that the government has
no industry policy. For reasons I will outline in a moment, the member is wrong&mdash;dead wrong.
It is interesting to ask, however, why the member is peddling this line. It is quite clear that he
has decided that this is the issue on which he will campaign for the leadership of the Labor
Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know on this side of the House that the member for
Hotham has been moving around business in Melbourne trying to sell a line; we all know that Bill
Kelty has been running around Melbourne peddling the same line. We also know about the struggle on
the left of the Labor Party involving the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) and the member for
Melbourne (Mr Tanner) and their role in the debate on the future economic policy of the Labor Party
and what role they are playing in the struggle. In short, it is clear that the member for Hotham is
trying to use industry policy to build an unholy alliance between the Right and the Left of the
party to deliver himself the leadership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish him luck because the
Crean-Kelty-Ferguson line, the accord line, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia
Reconstructed</EMPHASIS> line, this wonderful recycled line&mdash;and it is a bit battered, Simon;
you may have to get a new cover, but it is a remake, a re&hyphen;run, so it is no wonder it is
looking pretty ordinary&mdash;has been responsible for the economic mess that we inherited and for
the shambles of an industry policy we inherited when we came to office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the heart of this debate is the fundamental difference between the government
and the opposition about the key foundations of industry policy. The Labor Party's 13 years of
office were characterised by a small number of sectoral policies covering a small number of
industries while ignoring the general economy and the rest of industry&mdash;in other words, the
old game of trying to pick a winner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government believes that it
is critically important for all industry in Australia, and for us, to get the economic fundamentals
right first, to clean up Labor's mess, to provide a stable, growing economic base before we
introduce changes to the direction of industry policy. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7527">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did 13 years of Labor government, 13 years of the accord,
13 years of the Kelty-Crean-Ferguson industry recipe deliver to Australian business? It delivered
nothing but regression and a bleak future. The Labor Party, the party that pitches itself as the
workers' party, abandoned Australian business. Under Labor, Australia had the second highest
interest rates among developed nations and the highest unemployment rate since the Great
Depression; the manufacturing sector was forced to shed over 200,000 jobs and has shown no net
growth in employment in the last 12 years; business investment declined to its lowest level on
record; Australia's average productivity improvement was just 0.9 per cent&mdash;half the world's
average for this century; foreign debt increased by 800 per cent; and real household incomes fell
by nine per cent. A dreadful record!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The critical point is that
Labor's industry policy over the last 13 years, despite all the hype and despite the attempt by the
member for Hotham to put the best gloss on it, was not an industry policy which worked for all
Australian industry or for all Australian workers. The simple fact is that Labor's industry policy
failed Australian industry. Labor took their eye off the single most important part of the industry
policy ball&mdash;the state of the general economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome this
debate today because it allows me to directly rebut the attempt by the member for Hotham to suggest
that there is no government industry policy. The government's industry policy is quite clear. It is
understood and supported by industry generally. Our policy is in two parts. The first step is the
short term&mdash;to get the basic economic parameters right. Most businesses receive no direct
assistance from the federal government. The most important thing the government can do for industry
is to get the economy right. In fact, as a responsible government, we have no choice. For this, we
make no apology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our first obligation on coming to office has been
to set the budget and to begin to rebuild the economy. We are now seeing the results. Interest
rates have come down. All businesses and all industry have benefited from this. I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> make no apology for it being the first key step in our industry
policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key part of getting our economic foundations right has
been the passage of the government's industrial relations legislation. The simple fact is that no
single piece of legislation has been more welcomed by industry in this country for many years than
the government's industrial relations legislation. It is time the Labor Party acknowledged this
fact. It is time the Labor Party clearly stated that they will not change the legislation in the
unlikely event that they will return to office. The first element of the government's economic and
industrial policy is bearing fruit. The fall in interest rates alone will help all Australian
businesses, as has the passage of the industrial relations legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second step in our industry policy is the longer term, and it involves three
priorities. They are designed to ensure that Australian industry fully prepares for the competitive
environment that we will face by the year 2010 as a result of our APEC obligations. Few businesses
fully understand the challenges they will face by the year 2010. However, the government is aware
of the significance of the challenge and has built the key elements of its industry policy around
the need to ensure that Australian industry is fully prepared for the opportunities which will come
to our industry by that year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first of our priorities is
therefore to adopt a clear investment strategy for Australia. Competition for investment is
becoming more intense around the world. Investment growth is vital for our national future as it is
the basis on which secure jobs are built. Attracting investment will be a priority for the
government. We will not be offering outlandish incentives, but we will ensure that Australia is a
welcoming and competitive environment for investment and that businesses are able to deal quickly
and efficiently with the federal government. Reducing red tape and the delays and complexity
involved in dealing with the government when investing in Australia is an absolute priority for the
new government. We will not be reducing standards, but we will ensure that Australian <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7528"> government processing does not discourage
investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Research and development is the second of our three
priorities. I do not accept the criticism made by the member for Hotham of our recent changes to
R&amp;D arrangements. In fact, I find the criticisms of the opposition rather ridiculous. Their
track record is hardly one of distinction. Under Labor&mdash;under their so-called `clever country'
policies&mdash;Australian business expenditure on R&amp;D slipped to 18th out of 24 OECD nations,
despite billions of dollars spent on incentive programs. That is an appalling record. Australian
business expenditure on R&amp;D as a share of GDP was 25 per cent lower than the OECD average. That
is quite some record. In 1995 alone Australia bought $20 billion worth of technology developed by
other countries, despite Labor's promises to make Australia the clever country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, the syndication arrangements we inherited from the last government were
out of kilter. There was a disproportionate emphasis on the financial structures of the syndicates
rather than on genuine R&amp;D. The eight attempts by the last government to amend the system
underline this. Our new R&amp;D package, with a 125 per cent deduction and the START program, has
corrected this imbalance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Taken as a whole, our R&amp;D package is
very competitive by world standards. If the opposition was serious about supporting genuine
R&amp;D, they would support the passage of these changes through the Senate. I am particularly
concerned to ensure that as a nation we get the `D' part of R&amp;D right. We must encourage a much
closer relationship between those doing so much good research in Australia and business. We must do
more to ensure that Australia's research is turned into commercial reality right here in Australia.
It is critical if we are to have growth in secure jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third
priority involves ensuring that Australian companies gain fair access to world markets. As I have
said, our commitment to our obligations for 2010 under APEC is strong and not negotiable. But I
believe that, in making the concessions that have been <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> made
so far, the former government did not push strongly enough for full and fair access for Australian
companies to world markets. We must make sure that non-trade barriers do not subvert the move to
free trade. This will be the basis of our future APEC negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to these three priorities, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has also
announced the establishment of the employment subcommittee of cabinet. Through the work of that
committee, the government is developing policies to further assist Australian industry. Unlike the
previous government, we are concerned about issues such as the availability of capital,
particularly for small business; ensuring our work force is trained to meet the needs of industry;
maximising the benefits of strategic advantages; and ensuring that government interference in
industry is eliminated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of our industry policy,
Australia will have a much stronger and more favourable climate for business. The changes have
begun and will provide benefits for all Australians. We have already seen a fall in interest rates.
We want business investment in Australia and we are determined to encourage it. We are a business
and investment friendly government. We believe this is essential to secure jobs in the
future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I certainly will. Under
intense provocation from the economic imbeciles on the other side, I was forced to respond.
Following the ministerial sackings in the wake of the government's recent code of conduct scandal,
there have been persistent rumours about the political future of the industry minister. Indeed, I
have even seen it mentioned that he is going to be reshuffled in his portfolio and that he might be
seeking an overseas post.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I can use the football
analogy, the rumours are that he is being moved from a key forward position to the back pocket.
Those of us who have played footy know that, when you get to the back pocket, you've got one leg
over the fence anyway. We on this side of the House would be very unhappy about this situation. We
want him moved off the field. We want him dropped from the side and we want him removed from the
portfolio and from industry. And it needs to be done quickly for the sake of Australian industry
and for the sake of the Australian economy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7530">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many ways, Australian industry, particularly manufacturing industry, is
at the crossroads. The Australian economy has come through an intensive period of restructuring
that has seen dramatic changes in the way Australia's management and labour perform their work. The
previous Labor government guided that process and established a macro-economic environment in which
industry could draw confidence and indeed could grow, and I mentioned the fruits of that labour
previously. We engineered a steady growth rate of four per cent, reduced the inflation rate from
double digits to between two and three per cent, we left this government with a declining
unemployment rate and, of course, interest rates were lowering as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Labor government also set in place a range of industry assistance
arrangements designed to specifically stimulate growth, create jobs and lift exports. Above all,
Australian industry had industry ministers with energy and vision and they had a government that
they could trust and have confidence in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Australian industry
needs now, as it develops beyond the year 2000, is a minister with a vision and a government with
the will and capacity to lead industry development in this country. Unfortunately, Mr Deputy
Speaker, in this government and minister it has neither. There is a crisis of confidence in
Australian industry at this point in time, and it stems from a number of factors. There are doubts
about the capacity of the key economic spokespersons in the government to really get on top of the
economic task. We have a Prime Minister (Mr Howard) who has an economic record of failure. We have
a Treasurer (Mr Costello) who categorises four years of growth as five minutes of sunshine. We have
a failed New South Wales Premier in the finance portfolio and, of course, we have the industry
minister, that industrial fairy who flits from factory to factory sprinkling moon dust. He says
much, but he does very little.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It
could have been worse indeed. The second factor which has led to this crisis of confidence is that
all these <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> key economic spokespersons in the government have
persistently talked down the economy in the budget preparations. I have just alluded to the fact
that we left the Liberal and National parties an economy growing at four per cent, inflation at two
per cent and unemployment on the way down. Yet the key economic spokespersons can roam this
country, in preparation for the budget, and talk down the Australian economy. Is there any wonder
that there is a crisis of confidence in the government and their major
spokespersons?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, there is another factor as to
why there is a crisis of confidence in this minister. He lost the budget battle, and we have seen
the withdrawal of key industry policy measures that have delivered support and encouragement to
Australian industry over the past 13 years. In very simple terms, this industry minister is a cream
puff. He would blow away in a breeze. He got rolled in the budget deliberations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian industry wanted an industry minister with some hobnailed boots on who
would go in and defend, in the face of the onslaught by Treasury, the programs that have served
them so well. What did they get? They got a dilettante who wears a smoking&hyphen;jacket. He smokes

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The lack of
personal confidence in this minister, who is responsible for the industry policy of this country,
stems primarily from the lack of professional, political integrity that he has displayed in this
place. I refer to the flagrant violation of the Prime Minister's code of ministerial conduct by the
member for Ryan. We have all heard the recent debates in this place about this matter. These were
codes of conduct that successive Labor industry ministers lived by with distinction. The code of
conduct is very simple. Ministers are allowed to own shares. However, where there is a direct or
apparent conflict of interest with <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7531"> the minister's
portfolio responsibilities, the minister must divest. He must not trade in the shares that he
owns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know the political reasons why the Prime Minister did
not sack the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. What is more disturbing is the fact
that the minister seemed oblivious to the gravity of his political situation. He stumbled on in
question time with a lame duck defence that no-one believed, not even he or his Prime Minister,
certainly not the opposition and not the industry community in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What signal did this send to Australian industry? It said that Australian
industry had a minister who was prepared to violate a ministerial code of conduct for the sake of a
share killing on the Stock Exchange. It demonstrated that the industry portfolio was in the hands
of a man with no sense of ministerial propriety. It demonstrated clearly that they had a weak Prime
Minister incapable of enforcing even basic ministerial standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go through the range of industry policies that were cut in this budget.
They demonstrate very clearly the ineffectiveness of this minister. We have seen budget cuts to
Austrade and AusIndustry and to the NIES program, where funds have been cut by 17 per cent. This
was a program that had a success rate of 83 per cent. We have seen reductions in taxation
concessions for research and development. The Industry Commission found that concessions
contributed to net benefits to the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen
the scrapping of the bounties that were alluded to by the shadow minister for industry, science and
technology. Those bounties in ship building, books, computers and machine tools had all stimulated
economic activity and the exports of this nation. Yet this is the minister who allowed the other
economic ministers to roll him in the context of debate within the cabinet. These bounties are to
be scrapped. We have seen the government abolish the DIFF scheme and severely curtail the export
market development grants scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The regional implications of these
cuts are substantial, and they are not understood by this minister. The endorsement of Labor's

Labor government which gave Australia the highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression.
Remember that? It was the Labor Party which put Australia into a situation of uncontrollable debt.
It was the Labor government which believed in high interest rates. The opposition betrayed young

your memory here. Productivity was down, savings were down and investment was down. Do you remember
those days? So much for your industry policy. Unemployment became the previous government's legacy
for bringing real reform and growth to the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government may have liked talking about the so&hyphen;called `big
picture' approach. Remember the big picture approach? They were very good at talking about that.
But, unfortunately, they never even got close. You never even got close to the big picture, did
you? Instead, business and industry were left with a narrow&hyphen;minded approach to problem
solving. In reality, the Labor Party's industry policy was based on two important features: high
interest rates and the unfair dismissal laws of the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr
Brereton). We have two high profile features here. The unfair dismissal laws in particular brought
headaches for many businesses and Australian families. In my own electorate of Petrie&mdash;I speak
to small business people; obviously you do not&mdash;small business owners are steering away from
employing full&hyphen;time people. They employ casual staff when they are required.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government has made a commitment
to get the fundamentals right when it comes to industry policy&mdash;something that you never did.
In fact, the most important thing that this government can do for industry is to get the economy
right. A key step has already been taken with the reduction of interest rates. Let's talk about
interest rates&mdash;a power mechanism&mdash;which were kept very high for too long. They were like
a noose around the neck of business and industry. But this government is not going to stop there.
We have a clear investment strategy, which is what is needed. We need to attract investment
opportunities and encourage growth. That is important for rebuilding the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, the government recognises that, to increase competitiveness, the
removal of red tape is necessary, as is removing the delay and complexity that can be involved in
dealing with government. The opposition let small business down. It allowed them to drown in a sea
of paperwork&mdash;a bureaucratic nightmare which not only was a detriment to business but also had
consequences for families and personal lives. Energies were diverted from making businesses viable
and providing young people with real job opportunities. The situation was that we had red tape on
doing business, red tape on how to do business and, in some cases, red tape upon red tape. You are
very good with red tape.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government established the Small
Business Deregulation Task Force. The task force has reported and provided recommendations for
consideration&mdash;recommendations which, I might add, have taken the interest of many people in
the Petrie electorate. The Micro&hyphen;business Consultative Group has already been
established&mdash;you know that&mdash;and it has had a great impact on the establishment and growth
of micro business. Have you ever heard of that? Eighty&hyphen;two per cent of Australia's
businesses are micro businesses. They employ fewer than five people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is putting in place a platform that will mean more jobs,
particularly for young people, lower interest rates and greater productivity. In addition, the new
workplace reforms to come into force on 1 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7533"> January
1997 will result in a better industrial relations system for the whole of Australia. Businesses
will have certainty in hiring staff. Labour market reforms will help businesses to employ more
staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government which listens to small business; a
government which was prepared to make decisions which are necessary for capital reform to allow
small business and industry to grow and prosper. This is a government which takes its commitment to
business and industry very seriously. It has already commenced providing the platform and
foundation for the creation of jobs and the growth and stability of business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a small business operator in the service industry and also in the personnel
industry, I know what it is like to run a small business. This government understands how hard it
is to run a small business. I know what it is like at the month's end to look at the figures and
know whether you are going to make it or not. We have already introduced a number of budgetary
measures to recognise small business and their impact on the economy. In the budget we have
introduced a number of economic settings that will support growth and investment. The theme of our
budget was fiscal consolidation. Does the Labor Party know what this is?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very interesting matter of public importance. In the MPI there is
mention of sustainable growth and job opportunity. If the opposition understood fiscal
consolidation, it would understand that this is what fiscal consolidation is all about. The
government has three central objectives here: to increase national savings, to reduce the pressure
on the current account deficit&mdash;you do not talk about that very much&mdash;and to help sustain
economic growth over the medium term. We are looking at it over the long haul.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have at the moment the best climate that we have ever had. We have a low
interest rate and a low inflation environment for the first time in years. Under Labor we had the
highest interest rates ever. The Labor government crippled small business with its boom&hyphen;bust
policies. This government has promised not to introduce any new taxes. Today we heard the Treasurer
(Mr Costello) reiterate <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that, from 1 July, capital gains tax
will be changed so that rollover relief will be available where assets of a small business are sold
and proceeds are reinvested in the same or a like business within 12 months. This will help
investment. Small business owners can claim capital gains tax relief of up to $500,000 if that
money is put into a superannuation scheme to fund retirement or if it is invested in a like
business. This is a very welcome move for business across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area that I would like to talk about is the area of subcontracting. The
government has announced that it is not going ahead with the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5)
that the former government was going to introduce. That bill would have been devastating to
subcontractors in the building industry&mdash;absolutely devastating&mdash;so they are very
grateful to us for not even bringing it in in the first place. Another initiative is the modern
apprenticeship training scheme which will help&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the amendments be agreed
to.</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments now before the House are amendments which were put to the
legislation by the government in the Senate and they relate to one specific matter. The objective
of these amendments is to enable the expansion of the board of the Australian National Training
Authority by two additional members. Members will recall that the review of the Australian National
Training Authority recommended an expansion of the board by two. That review also recommended the
nature of these two amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government does not accept the
recommendation of the review in relation to the character of the parties who should fill these
additional two positions, but the government does believe that it is desirable to expand the
membership of the board. The reason for this is that we see the need within the community to
increase and extend the support for the national training arrangements within the business
community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian National Training Authority is fortunate
to have a very committed board and a board with a diversity of experience in both larger and
smaller enterprises. However, it is also the case that the business community in Australia is very
large and very diverse. We know there are some 700,000 to 800,000 small and medium sized
enterprises in this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> country and that they play a very
significant role in providing employment and training. Indeed, much of the traditional training
through the apprenticeship system has taken place within the small business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the great difficulties in the representation of such a diverse group of
enterprises is to ensure that there are people on the board who are recognised not only as having
experience in that area&mdash;and the board does already contain several members who have that
experience and are widely respected through the small business sector&mdash;but people who also
have links into wider business networks. It was recognised by the former government that
appointments to the ANTA board should be on the basis of personal merit. That is a principle which
the government certainly continues to support and regards as being very important. We should not
have members of the board who are purely representatives of organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to acknowledge the fact that Mr Bill Mansfield&mdash;a member of the
ACTU who has been a member of the board&mdash;has been a highly significant contributor to the
deliberations of the Australian National Training Authority. One of the things that has enabled him
to be a contributor has been his links with the ACTU because they have given him access to a wide
network of representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is, of course, perhaps limited in his
capacity to represent employees by the fact that a diminishingly small proportion of total
employees is now represented through the ACTU but, taking that into account, we nevertheless
acknowledge the fact that that membership has been valuable. He was not appointed by the ACTU, or
nominated by them as a representative, but appointed in his individual capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7535"> It is our intention to make
appointments to these additional two positions to the board of people who are fully justified as
members by the quality of the contribution that they would be able to make to the deliberations of
the Australian National Training Authority. We also intend to take into account, in making these
appointments, the access of these mem bers to the wider networks to which they belong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the opposition has some reservations about this. I simply make the
point that the national training framework, represented through the National Training Authority,
was an initiative of the previous government which we believed was worth while and needed to be
built upon. We are making significant reforms to this national training framework, but we would
particularly like to enhance the support and understanding of this activity throughout the business
community and that will be our intention. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to this Vocational Education and
Training Funding Laws Amendment Bill 1996 this afternoon, I would specifically like to refer to the
report of the review of the ANTA agreement. In some ways I find myself in a difficult situation,
and it relates to the fact that in many ways the opposition supports a suggestion that the board of
ANTA ought to be expanded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our difficulties relate to
the appointments, and I will refer to what the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and
Training (Dr Kemp) just said. He suggested that the people who ought to be appointed are people who
have links with the broader business community. I suggest that is code for the minister to appoint,
on the basis of patronage, people who have links to the government. If anything, I suggest that
might be akin to the appointments recently made, as announced in this House yesterday, to the
Centenary of Federation Council. I believe the issue of vocational education and training ought to
be above petty politics. That is why the ANTA board has been highly successful, despite the fact
that many in the government opposed, in its original sense, the establishment of the board of ANTA
and its objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can you take this government on trust? For
example, take the government's appointments to the Centenary of Federation Council. Dick Smith is
to chair the council. That is the type of person whom this government identifies with. Why? Because
he was one of the biggest donors. He was the one who orchestrated a campaign in support of the
election <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the Howard government. Then we go on. This is the
quality of the people the government likes to appoint. Professor Blainey was appointed, and he is
another political cohort of the minister for schools. Then we have Phoebe Fraser, who is the
daughter of a former Liberal Party Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I suggest that
it all goes to a question of trust. Our real problem is that we do not trust this government with
respect to the nature of appointments it might make to what we regard as one of the most important
boards that exist, not just at the federal level of government but at all levels of government. It
is not just a federal initiative. It goes to making sure that, at a state and federal level in all
regions of Australia, we have in place a comprehensive policy for vocational education and
training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context, I would like to refer to the fact that
ANTA was established by the Commonwealth&mdash;after much debate and with the support of
states&mdash;in December of 1992, coming into operation in 1993. In accordance with the
establishment of the board, it was required by the heads of government agreement that a review of
the operations of the board commence. The former government put that review in place in August
1995. It is interesting to note that the review was very much supported by all sections of
Australian industry. Submissions were made by a range of business organisations, individual
employers, government representatives and the Australian Council of Trade Unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister likes to make reference to the question of membership of the
Australian Council of Trade Unions and its affiliates. I will tell you what. We will put up our
record against that of ACCI any day you want because, when you talk about broadly representative
employer organisations, I do not suggest that ACCI is a broadly representative employer
organisation in Australia. As for the BCA, we all know who they represent&mdash;the big end of
town. If anything, they have very aggressive policies against the best interests of small business
in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My view is that the government ought to take up the
recommendations of the report of the review of the ANTA agreement. With <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7536"> respect to ANTA, I will tell you why it is important that we make sure
we do not politicise the board of ANTA. I agree with the minister. The original appointments were
on the basis of merit. People were required to enter into meetings of the board of ANTA on the
basis that they left their political baggage at the door. Every person who has participated in the
operation of the board of ANTA has risen above their business links, union links or government
links. That is why this government has now decided that the establishment of ANTA was the right
thing and that we ought to go on to strengthen and improve its operations, as suggested in the
report of the review of the ANTA agreement. Where I believe the government is falling short of
embracing the intent of that review is that it is now politicising the appointments. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On
this side of the House we agree that the board of ANTA should be expanded. Indeed, it was the Labor
Party that commissioned the report of the review of ANTA, and it was recommended that the board be
expanded by two. Two additional members were recommended, but the government disregarded the
recommendation about who should be appointed, about where the appointments to the expanded board
should come from.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government is going to do is
appoint a couple of its mates from big business&mdash;people who are acceptable to the Business
Council of Australia, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. This government in power now
is ideologically committed to business domination of training rather than adequate public input.
This is just another example of this government's determination to show that there is a new game in
town, and the game is to disperse patronage to the coalition's big business mates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what do you need to have to be a government appointment? The first thing you
need these days is to be a card&hyphen;carrying member of the Liberal Party. I suppose you would
get by if you were a member of the National Party, but it is so much better if you are a
card&hyphen;carrying member of the Liberal Party. The member for Batman (Mr Martin <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Ferguson) pointed out the appointment that has been made this week.
Have a look. It was Dick Smith. How did the Prime Minister justify this? He justified this by
saying that Dick Smith had given all this money. He gave&mdash;what was it?&mdash;a million bucks
to the Liberal Party campaign. So, obviously, not only do you have to be a card&hyphen;carrying
member of the Liberal Party but you have to make a significant contribution to the coffers of the
Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is like Britain in the old days. At the turn of
the century if you wanted to buy a peerage in Britain you made a contribution to the Conservative
Party. Today if you want a government appointment to a board in Australia you make a big buck
contribution.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is
what they will do next, sell appointments to government boards. You have to be in a position to
make a significant contribution, a big buck contribution, to Liberal Party coffers. In that way you
will be appointed to government boards. The one thing that should not be happening is that boards
like ANTA should not be politicised. We should be putting people on boards who have some
experience, some knowledge, some ability to make a contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only ability to make a contribution you need today is the ability to
contribute to the Liberal Party election funds. If you put a couple of thousand dollars or a couple
of million dollars into the election fund, then sure enough when the appointments are made, whether
it is to the committee on the centenary, whether it is to the ANTA board or whatever it is, up
comes your name. Bingo! You have hit the jackpot. Depending on how much you contribute, the more
likely you are to be appointed. If you make a big, big contribution you become the chair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We agree that the board should be expanded. There is no argument about
that. Our disagreement is with the way these appointments are going to be made. We do not think it
does Australia any credit at all, especially not in the training field, if you buy your way into
government appointments. That is what this government is doing. It is a disgrace. I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7537"> thought we had gone past buying patronage, but this is yet

when one hears the speeches from the other side. This is the quality of the opposition that
Australia now has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pretty obvious when you listen
to this debate why the Labor Party was so devastated at the last federal election and
why&mdash;when the battlers of this country had a chance to give their views about the Labor Party
after having observed them in opposition&mdash;in the Lindsay by-election we got an enhanced swing
there. I utterly reject the assertions of the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). They really are
beneath contempt. This is the pathetic character of the contributions to this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition was approached by the government before this amendment was moved.
The government's reasoning was fully explained. Even one of the possible appointees was
canvassed&mdash;a person to whom I believe the Labor Party has absolutely no objection. There is no
suggestion whatever that the appointees the government will be making to the ANTA board will be
anyone other than people who are distinguished in the training area, who are recognised around
Australia as people who have a major contribution to make to this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only that but we are actually seeking to make these appointments to expand
the support amongst the business community for an initiative put in place by the Labor Party. They
were never able to make it work. They were never able to get that level of support. The business
community, during the last election campaign and before, came to us on many occasions and said, `We
feel that this training system the Labor Party has put in place is so bureaucratic, so complex,
that we just cannot participate in it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why we have
undertaken the very major reforms that we are putting in place, to simplify this system, to
simplify access to it, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> so that young Australians can get
opportunities to undertake apprenticeships and traineeships in a way they were never able to do
under the previous government. We have acknowledged the quality of the representation that people
like Mr Bill Mansfield have offered to the ANTA board. Indeed, we have gone out of our way to
ensure that people within the trade union movement who have expertise will be fully listened
to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was personally delighted when Julius Rowe was approached to be
a member of the reference committee which we set up for the introduction of the new Australian
apprenticeship and traineeship system, and he accepted that appointment. He was acknowledged within
the trade union movement as being a real expert in this area. We appointed him because we felt he
could make a contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is prepared to
acknowledge, in a purely frank and objective way, the quality of people. But what have we heard in
this debate? We have heard the most utter nonsense from the member for Throsby, the fantasy land
that he indulges in. We have heard from the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), an
ex&hyphen;President of the ACTU and now presumably someone to whom the Labor Party listens,
inveighing against the big end of town, against the business community, throwing accusations
against the representatives of the major business organisations and imagining in some way that,
with its own shrinking membership in the ACTU, he is in some way advancing the political interests
of the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why I say that it is hard to know
whether to laugh or cry because you have an opposition here which not only shot itself in the foot
before the election but is continuing to shoot itself in the foot in the course of this debate. It
is no wonder that when the member for Batman was President of the ACTU 600,000 members of the union
movement walked out on him. It was the biggest loss of membership to the trade union movement
probably in its entire history over the last century, and he is the man responsible for it. It is
easy to see why because he cannot come up with a commonsense case on behalf of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7538"> Labor Party which rises above petty partisan politics and

balance is seven to one against working people. There is a serious perception that, if that is the

concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to the election, the coalition were
critical of the then government, suggesting that there were appointments of trade union people to
various boards. Yet now they are doing exactly the same thing. As previous speakers have said, we
are not opposing the expansion of the board; we are seeking a balance. What this amendment does is
implement what was recommended by the report of the review of the Australian National Training
Authority agreement: that is, to increase the national board by two. That is where it stops,
because the minister has said that he will not fill these two positions with those recommended by
the review report&mdash;that is, experts from the field such as the Secretary to the Department of
Employment, Education, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Training and Youth Affairs, a senior
state and territory official, and the chairperson of the Standards and Curriculum Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the people that it is recommended should be added to the board. I
would suggest that they are in a far better position to make a contribution than the two people who
will be appointed from the two business organisations. But this government, which holds itself up
as a decent and credible government, has said that it will place on the board two persons
specifically acceptable to the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Chamber of Commerce
and Industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What terrible people we are to dare to suggest that it
is not only jobs for the boys but also jobs for the boys from a specific part of the community
sympathetic to the government! I do not profess to argue that the government should not appoint
people it knows and respects to important positions, but in this case any appointment as is
forecast will be totally at odds with the very expensive review that recommended that the jobs go
to particular experts in the training field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government says,
`No, we will appoint two people who have got the numbers from their own particular business
organisations. Who cares if they have the qualifications or not?' The issue of training for
industry is too important to be trifled with by these ideologues as indicated by the
minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a former trade union official, I put many thousands of
voluntary hours into the pursuit of a proper, recognised and qualified training program for
Australian industry. I, like many others, worked closely with our opposites in the employer ranks.
We were all bipartisan enough that we frequently ensured appointments of specifically qualified
people to advisory groups or other leadership areas of training.</PARA>

employer organisations and people representing the trade union move ment. Unfortunately, this is

basis of lower wages and conditions of employment, as would be the policy adopted by the Minister
for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) if he were the Prime Minister of Australia. They are there on
the basis of ensuring that we com pete internationally with respect to the skilling of the
Australian work force. That is why we are concerned, because it was the minister himself who raised
the possibility of the two additional people being direct representatives of ACCI and the
BCA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did not put those words into the minister's mouth; he
referred to those people who are related to the operations of the BCA and ACCI in his discussion
with me. For example, he did not specifically refer to the recommendations which are set out in the
review of ANTA's activities. The review proposes that the appointments to the board be the
Secretary to the Department of Employment, Education and Training; a senior state or territory
official; and, desirably, the Chairperson of the Standards and Curriculum Council&mdash;and I
acknowledge that the Standards and Curriculum Council has been abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the real issue comes back to the minister's credibility. Obviously,
while we stand in opposition, the government will win the day. It is then a question of whether
this government is prepared to adopt the policy approach of the previous government to ensure that
the appointments made are not made on the basis of taking the baggage from where they come into the
operations of ANTA. In speaking today, I challenge the minister, when selecting the additional
people, to go out of his way to ensure that they are not there to sing the song of the BCA or
ACCI.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also say in passing that I believe that would be in
accordance with the thrust of the policy position adopted by state governments, especially Liberal
state governments, when ANTA was first established in 1992. That was the policy position accepted
by the Commonwealth government after comprehensive discussion with state governments, especially
Liberal state governments. They wanted to ensure that, if we were prepared to try and test a new
approach to vocational education and training, it rose above politics. My fear is that, because of
the nature of appointments that have been made by this government in a range of areas since the
election of 2 March, we might take vocational education and training back to the murky days <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7540"> which existed previously on the vocational education and

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel compelled to re-enter this debate,
given the unusual intervention by the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) which has just
occurred. He is a new member in the chamber, and he sees fit not only to refer to a private
conversation that we had but, indeed, to misrepresent it. I will certainly take that into account
in future discussions, or the absence of such discussions, with him on these and other matters
relating to legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At no stage did I say that
particular people would have to be appointed as representatives of the two organisations he has
mentioned. I instanced those two organisations, and I mentioned the name of a particular
person&mdash;whom so far he has refrained from mentioning&mdash;as being the kind of person whom we
might appoint. I had expected him to understand quite clearly what was being said. But I gathered,
as the conversation went on, that he really was quite out of his depth in this area, because he
said, `Well, I'm not sure about all of that; I'll have to talk to Kim about it.' I had always
thought the President of the ACTU was the expert in all these matters. But the shadow minister for
employment and training had to take it up with the leader, apparently, before he could understand
what was being said by me&mdash;and that related, of course, to an initiative of the former
government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It just beggars the imagination to think that the Labor
Party would be at all concerned that a government of the day might appoint people who were closely
linked to it, when one considers the incredible number of appointments made by the Labor Party of
members and officers of the ACTU. Indeed, so overboard did they go in appointing their union mates
to bodies&mdash;from the National Training Authority, to the industry training advisory bodies,
right down through the training system&mdash;and so keen were they to promote their friends who, of
course, contributed enormous sums of money to the Labor Party <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
for its election campaigns that of course I understand why they might think others might possibly
behave in the way their party behaved. But I can assure you that we do not behave in that
way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of this extraordinary behaviour in relation to the
training initiatives of the former Labor government, business was naturally very suspicious. That
is one of the reasons why for 10 years the Labor Party failed to get up public support for the
traineeship concept. Back in 1985, figures of 75,000 trainees a year were used; by the end of the
Labor period in 1995, the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships as a
proportion of the work force was the lowest for three decades. One of the reasons for that, Mr
Deputy Speaker, and Shadow Minister across the table, is that so many small businesses who did not
have unionised workshops were terrified that, if they took on a trainee, that trainee would bring
in his or her wake the union supervisor. They placed the training system under such intense union
supervision that they frightened off the very people who might hire the trainees and
apprentices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why for 10 years they were unable to make the
system work. It was not that they did not have some good ideas; they did have some good ideas. It
was not that there were not clever people thinking through the system. It was just that they could
never make it work because their whole approach was one of constant promotion of their mates in the
union movement of whom they are the political voices, the constant promotion of the major
contributors to Labor Party funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They put their own narrow
partisan interests ahead of the interests of young Australians and the national interest, just as
they are doing in this debate. That is why we are seeing the absurd contributions from the other
side the House on an amendment with which they actually agree&mdash;and it does them no credit
whatever.</PARA></SPEECH>

members to the ANTA board is fine, as long as the appointment of those members is in accordance
with the broader strategy of balance and as long as those members have the appropriate mix of
skills, experience and, of course, representation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But
this is not in any way what the government is seeking to achieve. The Minister for Schools,
Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) has made it quite clear that the two extra appointees
will be from the business community and the business community only&mdash;specifically, appointees
acceptable to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Business Council of
Australia&mdash;which is a far cry from the recommendations contained in the ANTA review. The ANTA
review stated in this regard:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the Secretary of the
Department of Employment, Education and Training, a senior State or Territory official and,
desirably, the Chairperson of the Standards and Curriculum Council be added to the Board.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, that is not what has occurred. The government is nothing more than ideologically
committed to business domination of training rather than adequate public input.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a former member of the council of the Casey College of TAFE, one of the
largest TAFE facilities within my electorate of Isaacs, I know that imperative to the operation of
these organisations is balance. On that particular council, of which I was an active member, there
were representatives from trade unions, from business organisations, from small business and from
academia. We interacted and exchanged information, and that of course was to the long-term benefit
of the Casey College of TAFE. The fact that we had that diversity of backgrounds was an integral
component of the business plans that we developed for it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might remind Minister Kemp, the underling of Minister
Vanstone, of what Minister Vanstone said in the estimates committee about what industry domination
of these bodies meant to this government. The minister said that she meant specifically excluding
workers' representatives from the vocational education and training sector. She understood business
to mean the owners of business, the owners of capital, not the person or persons who made capital
productive&mdash;that is, the workers in industry. She quite consciously and quite deliberately set
forth the government's position that was founded on this very premise. In fact, I refer Minister
Kemp to his superior's comments before that estimates committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The
opposition is opposed to this proposition. The major policy reversal that the government is
pursuing through this bill contradicts its push to put more employer representatives on ANTA and
contradicts the various points that it made prior to its election about broader consultation in the
area of education and training. That is apparent at every level. The operating budget cut of some
25 per cent to ANTA head office will see the removal of many and varied positions. The level of
service will have to fall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The abolition of pre&hyphen;vocational
programs, or at least their reduced funding for access, will have a detrimental impact on training
schemes in my state of Victoria. There will be a requirement that labour market programs themselves
will decline as a result of this budget measure which will have, as I say, a particularly
detrimental impact in Victoria. For example, labour market programs in that state will decline to
the tune of some $80 million per annum. I make reference to the funding of TAFE institutes in
Victoria. There will be a significant reduction in residual labour market funds to support training
for a number of apprentices as part of the new MAATS scheme. There will be new tendering
arrangements for labour market programs which will also impact on the provision of services within
Victoria and TAFE institutions such as that which I am already involved with, the Casey College of
TAFE. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS> </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This
is really quite unusual. We are dealing with a Senate amendment. It is not about wanting to restore
revenue to the government. It is not about wanting to save expenditure. It is not really about some
huge new clause that is going to affect, disadvantage or rescue a whole broad section of the
community. We are discussing two issues. One is the expansion of the ANTA board by two. Every
speaker who has made a contribution&mdash;even when they have made a couple of
contributions&mdash;has agreed with that. What we are really objecting to is a recommendation
arising out of a review that not only should the board be increased by two but also we should
appoint either the secretary to DEET or a senior state or territory official&mdash;and, of course,
someone from a board that has been subsequently axed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister
says that he believes that business networking is very important to the success of the
organisation. I do not think that I would disagree with that. But what really is interesting about
this recommendation of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> review is that the access to the
Public Service, both state and Commonwealth, that this would provide by the selection of these
people is to be denied. I find that particularly amazing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to
thank the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) because he really got on to the major point about
the whole issue, and that is that this is all about skilling Australians. It is all about how well
we will be positioned into the year 2000. It is an issue which I would think the Australian people
would want us to be taking as much as is possible a bipartisan view on. The member for Greenway (Mr
Mossfield) has already commented that, in his experience, the one issue on which you get agreement
between trade union officials and business representatives is in this area of training. You can get
agreement about a lot of other things but you really get them working very closely together in that
area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister talks about small business failing to take up
training opportunities. I agree with him. I have an example. In my own area, West Jobs was
developed and was highly successful. I acknowledge the contribution of all those people who served
on that committee, including the people with a trade union background. They did it in a bipartisan
way, working for the good of the region, for the good of the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we talk about the change that has occurred in the last 13 years and the
change that needs to occur in the next 13 years, what we need to be is inclusive of everyone.
Everyone has got a contribution to make, whether it is big business&mdash;the big end of
town&mdash;small business, a trade union or a worker. We all have a role to play in making sure
that we are indeed a country that has a significant advantage over our neighbours and a significant
advantage over the rest of the world in the way in which we are skilled, the way in which we can do
our jobs and the way in which we can bring our intellect and our skills to making products better,
more effective and more efficient.</PARA>

I have misrepresented the nature of the discussion that was held between the minister and me. I
also want to clearly say that yes, I did indicate that I would seek advice from the current Leader
of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). I will tell you why: he was the minister responsible for the
development of ANTA.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the minister, I do not
profess to be a know&hyphen;all. I operate on the basis that I am willing to talk to others because
I value their experiences. The minister might be a know&hyphen;all, but I am pleased that I
consulted the Leader of the Opposition, the minister who previously had responsibility for the
development of ANTA. I will tell you why I am pleased. The Leader of the Opposition correctly
advised me of the history of the development of ANTA. That is why we are expressing our concerns in
such a rigorous way today&mdash;because of the nature of the conversation I had with the minister.
In the course of the conversation, he suggested that we are returning to the days of people
basically being appointed on the basis of their association with particular organisations, be it
the ACTU, the Business Council of Australia or ACCI.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also
say in passing that our opposition is not related to concerns with the operation of the business
community in Australia today. If anyone is in difficulties with the business community today, it is
the current government. That is not just my view; it is also the view of the Premier of Victoria.
He is bagging this government up hill and down dale at the moment because of its lack of industry
policy. It is in all the media today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is vitally concerned not
just with the performance of this economy but with the fact that this government does not have any
real understanding of the needs of industry and is not prepared to go out there, roll up its
sleeves and try to get involved to assist industry. That aside, I agree with the current <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government that ANTA is a worthwhile organisation and it ought to be
continued. It has made substantial progress in improving vocational education and training in
Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition&mdash;as I said, unlike the
minister I am willing to learn from the experiences of those who previously had responsibility for
this area&mdash;drew to my attention that, when the ANTA board was first constituted, it was
generally agreed, including by coalition state governments, that members should be there for their
expertise, commitment and the contribution they would make rather than as representatives of
particular interest groups. That is what the Leader of the Opposition said, and it alerted me to
some difficulties with the suggestion by the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister
was the one who raised in the conversation with me the fact that he was looking to appoint people
who had links with ACCI and the Business Council of Australia. Those people should not be the types
of people appointed to the board of ANTA. The types of people who should be appointed to the board
are representatives of the business community who are vitally concerned on a day-to-day basis with
implementing decent and forward&hyphen;looking vocational education and training initiatives. They
should not be people who are there as representatives of particular organisations, be it the ACTU,
the MTIA, the MBA, ACCI or the BCA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was the basis of the
establishment of ANTA and that is why it is now a success. That is why the current government has
changed its approach to ANTA, and that is why the current government has finally decided, despite
its original vigorous opposition to the establishment of ANTA, to support its continued operation.
So the test for the minister is really whether or not, in considering the additional appointments,
he is prepared&mdash;unlike other ministers of this current government&mdash;to rise above politics
and ensure that the people appointed are appointed on the basis of merit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is exceptionally important that that be the case. It is interesting to note
that, since the election of this government, unemployment has blown out. The real problem is that
the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7544"> budget strategy of this government is a jobless
budget. That is clearly now coming through from the problems industry is experiencing. I noticed

appointments of people who would be there merely to carry out the instructions of the committees of
management of the BCA and ACCI.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can assure you of this, as a
former President of the ACTU: never did such a situation occur with respect to the initial
appointment of Bill Mansfield, an assistant secretary of the ACTU, nor did such consideration ever
occur with respect to the position he might have adopted in the workings of the ANTA board. That is
the issue I raise&mdash;to ensure that, with respect to BCA and ACCI, the people appointed might be
members of those organisations but are there as free agents, there operating in the best interests
of the Australian community, not taking into the board of ANTA the baggage of the BCA and
ACCI.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will tell you why: we need to make further progress on this
front. Unemployment, as the minister and I know, is the major problem confronting Australia. It has
worsened since the election. We are now experiencing some particular difficulties with respect to
the availability of skilled tradespeople. It is the responsibility of this government, in
association with state governments and the board of ANTA, to continue the great progress that has
been made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Major reforms are reflected in the fact that the new

ANTA&mdash;for I also note that tomorrow they will be announcing the continuation of the highly
successful Working Nation area consultative committees. I will tell you why: they were making
progress on the employment front. I am pleased that this government is prepared to face up to the
fact that it was wrong in the initial assessment of those important policy initiatives of the
previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ANTA has now been ticked off by the government.
Area consultative committees are to be ticked off again by this government because of the manner in

rightly accepted and regarded as an important element of any <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
immigration program. But this bill provides a power in the minister to also limit and cap the
number of such parents that will come to this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister
for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) wants to be able to say to some
Australians&mdash;citizens or permanent residents alike&mdash;if their parents happen to live
overseas, `Even if you meet all the restrictive visa qualifications, even if you meet the tests
that are set down in the regulations, you will not necessarily be able to come.' Those who do miss
out will not necessarily be able to go in some form of queue. They will simply be asked to try
again next year. They could miss out again and again because there is no necessity in this
legislation to give any priority to those who have waited for an extended period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Meanwhile, the elderly parent, for whom the person living in this country would
have a sense of responsibility, is asked to wait patiently, to go on hold for another year and not
be anxious about the lottery that is being played with their lives. As a personal reflection, I
regard the responsibility of caring for one's elderly parents as nothing particularly out of the
ordinary. My own family undertook that responsibility in the case of my grandfather, who came from
Scotland to live in Australia with us in a small flat associated with our home. I would have
thought that that sense of responsibility would be one which would commend itself to a party that
holds itself out as being committed to the rights of Australian families. But this legislation
actually intrudes into these very fundamental areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the bill
seeks to do in the case of dependent children is equally unthinkable. Many scenarios would arise
year after year where a parent in Australia would be unable to have their dependent child or
children in their care. If this legislation is passed, cases could exist, for example, involving
broken marriages and cases where the child may be the subject of abuse with one parent overseas and
one parent in Australia unable to bring that child to this country to care for their child simply
because the minister has set a maximum number of dependent children&mdash;from infants to those who
are nearing the end <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7546"> of their school days&mdash;who
can be sponsored and because the magic number that the minister has set has been reached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These scenarios are not hypothetical. The case of baby Samuel that I
referred to earlier is just a foreshadow of what is likely to occur, repeated hundreds of times
over. In that instance there was an infant child and the woman's fiance was living in England. She
could bring the baby under the existing rules but not the baby's father. So the family was being
torn apart. These regulations take that further. They make it worse. She will not even be able to
bring the baby&mdash;an infant child&mdash;to this country if the minister sets a cap and imposes
that cap as permitted in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Are these proposals
acceptable? I need to quote no person other than the present Minister for Immigration and
Multicultural Affairs to give support to my profound objection to these aspects of the bill. In
June 1989, when the current provisions in the bill were inserted, which allow capping of most
elements of the immigration program but not those immediate family elements, the then opposition
spokesperson, Mr Ruddock, now the minister, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I regard it as
absolutely unconscionable for a government to say half way through the year, `We have enough
spouses in now, we are going to close off the category and no more people in that category can come
to Australia&mdash;no more husbands and wives, no more dependent children, or aged parents'. I am
glad that the Minister has made the decision to exclude those groups.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet in his
second reading speech on this bill, the minister, referring to the issue of capping, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is crucial to restoring public confidence in the immigration program,
which had been greatly eroded under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said that Labor had allowed
immigration to get seriously out of control. It is utterly deceitful and irresponsible for the
minister to say this. By saying this, he helps to fuel an anti-immigration sentiment in the
community. He knows that what he is saying is not true. He knows that measures are now in place to
allow scrutiny of the veracity and the legitimacy of relationships. Today this opposition has
agreed with processes which <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will proceed in the Senate to
have a two-year probationary visa for any new marriages. So if there is any insincerity or any sham
in relation to a marriage, that can be dealt with effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This
bill moves beyond any legitimate application of government power into the direct family area and
acts in a way to hold husband and wife apart, husband and child apart and mother and child apart
and not to allow families to give any care or responsibility to their elderly parents. This is an
unthinkable measure. As the minister said in opposition, `I regard it as absolutely
unconscionable.' Where is the now minister's conscience?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth
is that these are not the minister's proposals. The truth is that the minister would now reject
measures of this nature were he given personal licence to do so. But he has become a cipher. He has
become the Philip Demidenko of the Australian political system. He is simply the hand that signs
the paper, putting forward proposals that have come down as edicts from a Prime Minister (Mr
Howard) who is running a sham and a phoney campaign, playing to the basest sentiments of some in
the community and using as his cat's paw a man who once had a reputation for honour and integrity
in this area. Philip `Demidenko' Ruddock is the Australian minister for immigration, the hand that
signs the paper, the cat's paw for the Prime Minister, the person who is talking code in order to
take base political advantage, where he himself has a conscience which I am certain is offended
mightily by what is being done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures that have come forward
are not necessary at all to ensure a lower immigration program. In fact, two of the last three
years of the Keating Labor government saw programs substantially lower than that which is now being
put forward by the current government. In 1992-93 the total program was 67,900, in 1993-94 the
total program was 62,800 and the planning level for this year is 74,000. It is not necessary to
attack family rights in order to bring lower immigration. There is a complete capacity in the hands
of this government to bring in an immigration <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7547">
program not only at the target level that they set but some 15,000 lower than the target they set
without the slightest need to introduce draconian measures of this nature. This is irresponsible
and socially destructive policy making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another point I would make,
and it is important, is that any loss of confidence in the migration program has far more to do
with irresponsible perpetuation of myths than with the program having gone out of control. Myths
that are being perpetuated by this government suggest that new arrivals somehow leech on the back
of Australian taxpayers. There are suggestions that measures of this nature are necessary because
of sham marriages and that the opposition is somehow resisting control measures about sham
marriages. The myths that are being perpetuated and fed to the community are doing that damage and
doing it daily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to speak up in a factual and balanced way,
not to implement policies of this nature which are destructive socially to the fabric of this
country. If I happen to be travelling overseas on a working holiday and meet a Dutch, Italian,
Greek, Japanese or English girl and form an affection for her and wish to marry, what part is it of
my government to say that I cannot bring my partner to this country and form my family here? More
so, if I have had a child by that person, what part is it of this Australian government to say that
my child cannot come to my country and be part of my family?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How
irresponsible it is to have a government that is saying that at a fixed point, at any one period in
a year, there will be no more such applications. If there is any area that should have absolute
priority, it is the right of Australians to have with them their husbands and wives and their
dependent children. The cruelty of any counter&hyphen;proposition should be self&hyphen;evident.
And it was to the then opposition spokesperson. It certainly is to me now. And it certainly is to
this opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another unacceptable change in this bill is that it
seeks to implement a legislative exemption of the Sex Discrimination Act to the Migration Act of
1958. That is to allow the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minister to prescribe a
two&hyphen;year cohabitation period for de facto and interdependent or same sex
relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see it as deplorable that the government seeks to
implement such legislative amendment in order to mete out especially harsh treatment to de facto
spouses and interdependent couples. This amounts to imposing by legislation moral values which
ignore contemporary views and restrict freedom of choice to a degree which will virtually end the
utility of these visa categories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say, in the spirit of some
cooperation with the government, that I have indicated to the minister that, were he to come back
to us with some proposal for a shorter period, we may well be disposed to look at that. But thus
far, there has been no approach. There is a determination to press ahead with a two&hyphen;year
cohabitation period before you can consider a person under this program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition sees no reason for treating these relatively small numbers of
applicants with less trust than spouse applicants. We believe that a stricter pre&hyphen;screening
process, which we have given the tick to, and a two&hyphen;year provisional visa, as would apply to
spouse applications, would be a proper check. We have supported the government's measures to
toughen up compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also make the point that, at least with
respect to some of the interdependent visa categories, there are circumstances in some societies
which are actively intolerant where physical cohabitation between two persons under the
interdependency category is not going to be established without possible physical and serious risk
to those persons. These are measures which do have serious implications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One other measure that we oppose is the introduction of the Migration (Visa
Application) Charge Bill. In itself, it is relatively innocuous. It seeks to roll all of the
existing migration charges into one&mdash;the visa application fee, which the government is
increasing by over 200 per cent; the English education charge, which is going up nearly 250 per
cent; and the health services charge, which is to be applied to the whole of the preferential
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7548"> family category without any rationale to support
widening its application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have accepted the government's increase
in most of those charges, but not to the English education charge. The reason is that learning
English is very much part of the settlement process. It is vital for arrivals who have been granted
the right to make this country their home, under the claim of a non&hyphen;discriminatory policy,
to learn English. It was called `the glue of a cohesive nation' in the coalition's own policy
statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To raise the charge to $5,500 per person will make it
unaffordable to many. This would plainly be discriminatory against non&hyphen;English speaking
applicants and not, in the code language of the minister, `selective'. It is in the national
interest that new arrivals learn English. They are more likely to become productive members of this
society. The coalition is ill advised to have taken that measure. Whilst the rolling into one
charge of all these measures is not in itself an objectionable matter, because it incorporates an
objectionable measure we will not support the schedule to the bill which allows for that to
occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should indicate that the opposition has accepted the
controversial visa application fee rise. As it is not possible to extract the English education
charge and oppose it alone in this bill, whilst our objection is only to one&hyphen;tenth of that
measure, the minister has again, in his failure to accept an offer of cooperation, refused to
separate the charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new charge in this bill is simply
expressed as a maximum of $12,500 per year, and it makes no distinction between primary and
secondary applicants. In other words, a family of four could face, under this bill, a total fee of
$50,000 in order to migrate to Australia. That is a pretty `selective' measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the provisions regarding the stripping of persons of their
citizenship for matters that go to their application for entry or citizenship to this country, we
accept that the government is addressing a matter about which many Australians may have legitimate
concerns. We welcome the supplementary explanatory memorandum that the minister has tabled and
brought forward at our request. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> It clarifies that the
government means in its action that there must be intent to defraud before an action can be
taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we raise a concern that I think will have to be
addressed by the minister, which is the question of statelessness. There are conventions in place
internationally to avoid persons becoming stateless. Somebody who has, by acceptance of an
Australian citizenship, found himself or herself without the citizenship of their former country of
residence could lose Australian citizenship under these provisions perhaps 20 or 30 years later.
These matters plainly need to be looked at. In that circumstance, I certainly ask the minister to
come back to the parliament and address this issue when it goes before the Senate, because the
Senate has established a committee to look at the whole of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, these measures are not necessary for an orderly migration program.
They are also cruel. In the language of the then opposition spokesperson and now minister, they are
unconscionable measures. They are being driven not by his agenda but by others. It is unworthy of
the government of Australia to have brought them forward.</PARA>

extent to which you said that the honourable member for Charlton found them offensive, you then
repeated the request for withdrawal. I suggest to you, Mr Speaker, that in that context, because

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Hotham for his
remarks. As I said, I have had an opportunity to reflect not only on the words used by the Minister
for Industrial Relations and the honourable member for Charlton but also on my own words on this
matter. Indeed, out of respect for the honourable member for Charlton, whose behaviour generally in
this House is exemplary, I thought there must have been a nuance within the remarks made by the
Minister for Industrial Relations that had escaped me, given the general furore that was going on
in the parliament at the time. We have alluded to that separately and I will not go on with
it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1">  If any
ruling made today was an error of judgment, the principal error is mine. The second one is that of
the honourable member for Charlton, whose previous behaviour in this House, as I say, has been
exemplary. However, a definitive reading of the remarks made by the minister does not under any
circumstances portray to me, in the independent role that I try to maintain in this House, any
offence, either disorderly or offensive. I looked at offensiveness in two particular arenas:
personal offence to the honourable member for Charlton, and political offence to the honourable
member for Charlton. On either ground, I ruled that no offensive re marks were made by the Minister
for Industrial Relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Giving the member for Charlton an
opportunity to interject and having taken cognisance of his previous behaviour in this place, I
looked at the videotape and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and interrogated the

linking&mdash;`we' being the government&mdash;the Australian Labor Party with the ACTU and
recognising that there are two former presidents of the ACTU on the front bench of the opposition,
there was nothing offensive. I would see that, in the normal course of events, as being robust
political debate but certainly not offensive debate.</PARA></INTERJECT></SPEECH>

with the final sitting in the Senate&mdash;also, of course, on Friday, 13 December.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason we need to sit until the conclusion of matters in the Senate is that,
in the event that there are bills to come back from the Senate, the House of Representatives needs
to sit so that those matters can be concluded prior to Christmas. With the very heavy legislative
program of the reformist Howard government in its first year, obviously there are potentially a
number of matters to be dealt with.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since that first evaluation, it has become clear that in the House of
Representatives there will also be a fairly significant workload. We therefore decided to sit on
the Monday and Tuesday of the week commencing 9 December as well. So as to give priority to
government business, we came to the view that we should sit on that Monday, with sitting hours and
routine of business applying as normal from Monday to Thursday, but with the exception that on the
Monday there will be government business only with question time at 2 o'clock. This will ensure
that we use the time to get through as much government business as possible.</PARA>

Reith) that we should have a question time on Friday is that it is very much in the spirit of what
the Leader of the House was saying when he was in opposition. The government started this term in
the parliament by saying that the government was going to do better than the Labor Party did when
they were in government. They were going to raise the standards. The Leader of the House was going
to become this shining beacon and he was going to be an example to all members of
parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was going to
keep him up to it and everything was going to be the way they thought it used to be in the House of
Commons. Then we come in here and what do we find? We find that the Leader of the House has
unfortunately learnt a whole lot of bad tricks from the New South Wales parliament, the Victorian
parliament and every other parliament around this country. The Leader of the House has debased his
position in this House and he has debased the word of his leader. Now he is going to gag me. The

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That, in accordance with the provisions of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Public
Works Committee Act 1969</EMPHASIS> , it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work
which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the
committee has duly reported to Parliament: CSIRO Research Interaction Centre and Biomolecular
Research Facilities, Black Mountain, ACT.</PARA>
<PARA>CSIRO proposes to demolish existing
laboratory facilities which are seriously substandard and very much outdated and to redevelop the
site to construct a high&hyphen;quality research laboratory to meet the Division of Plant
Industry's requirements for biological research into the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal will allow the CSIRO to increase its capacity to communicate the
results of its research, not only for the benefit of the industries that it serves but also as a
service to the Australian community. It is therefore planned to incorporate the Division of Plant
Industry laboratory into a CSIRO Research Interaction Centre to enhance the organisation's image in
the community at large. It is intended that this complex will bring the concepts and achievements
of CSIRO's research to the community and provide programs that will enable special groups and CSIRO
stakeholders to share in the excitement of new scientific discoveries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed CSIRO Research Interaction Centre, which is to be integrated with
the laboratory wing, will offer interactive exhibits illustrating CSIRO research and its
applications in the community. The centre will be substantially self&hyphen;funding in its
operation and it is intended to provide a powerful statement about CSIRO's commitment to inform the
public of its research and, in turn, inspire long-term interest in and support for the

incorporation of cafeteria, conference and banking facilities in the complex. The Public Works
Committee tabled their report on 19 November 1996, recommending the project at an estimated outturn
cost of $17.1 million. In their report, the committee recommended the construction of the CSIRO

<PARA>I will
make some brief points on these matters. The amendments were designed to amend the commencement
provisions of the bill to take account of the fact that the bill did not receive royal assent prior
to specific dates and to make some consequential amendments and other machinery provisions to take
account of the fact that the bill did not receive passage earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 4 proposes to insert an application clause into the bill, purportedly
to remove any doubt as to whom the waiting period will not apply to. Amendment 5 concerns the
effect of the Racial Discrimination Act and proposes to insert a clause into the bill to indicate
that the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act are to prevail over the amending act. The
government does not oppose this amendment. However, in doing so it wants to note that it does not
consider the amending act ever was or is in conflict with the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To that end, it is noted that the evidence of Professor Ivan Shearer and
the Attorney-General's Department given to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee
was that the bill does not discriminate on the grounds of race or contravene international
obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. This
position was adopted by the majority of that committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 6
is a consequential amendment, government instigated, resulting from changes made in amendment No.
1. Amendment 7&mdash;relating to the day on which a permanent visa is to be taken to have been
granted for the purpose of a newly arrived resident's waiting period&mdash;provides a newly arrived
resident's waiting period for a person who is granted a permanent visa in Australia after having
appealed. An initial decision to grant that visa is to commence from the date of the initial
decision. The amendment was made to give effect to recommendation 7 of the majority report of the
Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 8 is
another government instigated amendment. The government always envisaged the guidelines would be
issued to assist delegates in determining who <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> should be
treated as a family member for the purposes of this act. The amendment inserts a new subsection
that provides that the minister may, by determination in writing, set guidelines for the exercise
of the secretary's power and that the guidelines may be revoked and may vary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 9 relates to the definition of the newly arrived resident's waiting
period. Again, it was government instigated. The amendment removes the reference to a jobsearch
allowance relating to a newly arrived resident's waiting period as it is no longer necessary given
that the jobsearch allowance was abolished. There are some like matters, but they are largely
issues that arose out of government amendments giving effect to those matters which it had acceded
to as a result of the Senate committee's deliberations and technical and consequential
amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition supports this group of amendments to the Social Security
Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill. They can
be conveniently classed in two groups. The first reflect a recognition by the government that it
failed to get its legislation before the parliament in sufficient time to bring into effect the
legislation on the dates it had intended to bring it in. That is, aside from any question of
retrospectivity, the government did not bring the bill into the House nor give it sufficient
priority in the Senate so that it could be dealt with before the dates set in the bill acted as
commencement dates. So there obviously needed to be changes in the legislation to cover that
contingency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I find particularly ironic about this
is the spurious alleged savings that are now said to have been lost to the government by reason of
the Senate's decision. Senator Newman claimed $124.9 million would be lost primarily because of a
change in the start date from 1 April 1996 to the date of royal assent, which we can conveniently
assume would be intended to be early in the new year now. So the government is blaming the Senate
for the coalition's failure, first, to recall the parliament before 30 April this year and, second,
to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7562"> introduce the legislation into the Senate before
last week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an extraordinary proposition that $125 million in
alleged lost savings are now being attributed by the minister to actions in the Senate when the
bill was not brought before the Senate in time to come into effect on the dates the bill itself
said would be the dates of its commencement. We have this extraordinarily phoney campaign that has
been run in the community&mdash;again, unworthily by this government&mdash;on the basis of the
government positioning itself to take advantage of a sentiment that it knows to exist in the
community and of asserting that the Senate and the non-government parties have acted in an
irresponsible manner. But it failed to give priority to this legislation either in this House or in
the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's own legislation could not have come
into effect on the dates that it set out in its legislation because of that fact, so it has to move
consequential amendments, which we are now asked to agree to, so that the legislation can come into
effect at a time in the future. It claims that lost savings of $125 million will be the consequence
of that. I do not think I have heard anything so fanciful in my life. It is a most extraordinary
circumstance. When one finds that we have had threats of a double dissolution and suggestions that
Australian taxpayers are going to have to foot higher taxes as a result of this action, what one
really finds is that it is the government's own failure to bring this legislation before this
parliament in a timely way so that the matters could be dealt with.</PARA>

Senate obstruction? The House of Representatives has an overwhelming majority of government
members. It would have passed through this House at any time the government presented it to this
House. Had the government prepared its legislation at a more rapid rate and brought it before the
Senate, it would have been able to have the vast majority of savings in effect now because we have
allowed the vast majority of savings. The vast majority of savings <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provided for in this bill have been conceded. But the government itself did not

the Racial Discrimination Act, which I think is worthy of some comment. I commend the government
for being willing to deal with this in an express and clear way. I think it is an area where we
were able to find common ground where, unfortunately, too frequently we have been unable to do so.
But I contrast that with the area of Aboriginal affairs, the Hindmarsh Island Bridge, where it was
said that to take such an action would be an unfortunate and impermissible precedent. I am pleased

the committee reported and completed that report in September. We suspended any provisions that
existed that would not have allowed consideration of this legislation. The fact that the government

amendments. It is now trying to pretend that its amendments were forced on it by the opposition,

of the minister's speeches on the racial vilification legislation, which he spoke on last year. He
talked about bipartisanship and then said that `you should not ambush us'. Talk about ambush! Ever

read what he asked witnesses and then read what he has been saying ever since March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This whole area of immigration is now one of massive controversy. Why? They had
no intention of this money being in the budget. Once the Senate sent it to a committee, they had
determined themselves that they would <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not be putting that
money forward but they would be wiping out those savings and bringing forward their own amendments.
They determined that before the budget was brought down, yet they are still in the budget papers
and it was still put forward as a possible saving when they knew well and truly that it was never
going to be. That is the hypocrisy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is back here
and we will debate it clause by clause, issue by issue, because it must be debated. But do not
expect us to fall for the nonsense, the hypocrisy and the deceptiveness that is involved in this
debate because it is not simply a debate about savings; it is a debate about the way this group
wants to run the country. It is their style, their method and their approach. It is mean,
incompetent and vindictive. Ever single oozing pore of those types of comments coming from those
opposite reflects those three things.</PARA>

this parliament goes on, as they get more desperate and more concerned at how that incompetence
reflects on them and they are more able to shift the blame, as they have done so incompetently so
far, we will see more and more of this. I do not look forward to that. It is not edifying; it is
not good. I thought that bipartisanship was a viable option. We will never agree on all things, but
there is a fair degree of potentiality. From the day of the election onwards what we have heard

was Senator Ray who brought in the measures, for instance, that first established that there needed
to be a form of balance of family test in relation to constraining the number of people who might
be able to come through that part of the program which has been available for aged parents. It was
a difficult decision for him to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> take. It was a difficult

will be very brief. It is important to put on record that the Senate now operates with a series of
committees and it operates with priorities and cut-off dates. The system is that legislation
introduced in one session is not finalised until the next session, with that option being
overridden if the Senate so chooses. This was designed last year by the current government and the
Australian Democrats. They established the system that has been operating since then. It is within
this system that they have put forward this legislation as well as all the other legislation. They
designed the system that is now operating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we
listen to what the minister is saying, we get the impression that the opposition has more senators
than the government. The fact is that the government have something like 10 senators more than the
opposition in the Senate, yet they are somehow saying that we dictate in this matter. It is
important to realise that the process is in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> place. There are
cut-off periods, and matters are dealt with in the next session unless prioritised and agreed to.
The committee structures established are now chaired by particular parts of the Senate. This system
was established by the government and the Democrats last year, not by us. It was opposed by us at
the time. However, it is their system which they are now criticising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Any attempt to say otherwise is sheer cant, and that is reflected in the rest of
what they say. If they get that part wrong and cannot be honest about the Senate processes, what of
the honesty of their costings and the rest of the things about which they talk? If they are going
to deceive the public at large here tonight about the Senate processes, how can we trust anything
they say? How could anybody trust anything that this minister says about any of this legislation if
he tries to mislead the community at large over a Senate system that he helped design? The

had made to the Senate. They are now talking about the improvement they made last year. My, my, how

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My, my, how
things have indeed changed. The same people who have been vigorously defending the Senate tonight
made precisely the opposite statements not very long ago. They have very short memories indeed. I
can certainly recall almost every Christmas since I have been in this House criticisms from the
government about delays in their legislative program caused by the Senate. That is precisely what
has happened on this occasion. For some reason or other&mdash;my, my, how things have
changed&mdash;on this occasion, delays are being lauded by the Labor Party. They think it is
appropriate action for the Senate to delay the government's legislative
pattern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge that the Senate has processes
and procedures that take time, delay the processes of government legislation and give detailed
scrutiny to matters. That all takes <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7568"> time. However,
it is simply a nonsense to suggest that the timetable of the Senate is in the hands of the
government. Whilst we certainly have more senators than the Labor Party&mdash;I am grateful of
that&mdash;we do not yet quite have a majority. It is true that one or two defectors are gradually
coming our way, but, so far, they have not come the whole way whereby we can count on them.
Certainly the legislative processes of the Senate are invariably slow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the minister rightly pointed out, this legislation has been in the hands of
the Senate for something like six months. The government demonstrated what priority it gave to this
matter by passing it in the very first sittings of the new parliament. Within days of the election,
this government had the legislation before this parliament. It was sent to the Senate before we
broke on the first occasion. So there has indeed been a degree of urgency given to this priority
issue. This election promise by the coalition government was given priority and sent to the Senate
as quickly as possible. It has now taken from the end of May through until early December to return
it to this House. Inevitably, this delay has affected the proposed start-up date for the
legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister and the government cannot be blamed for
proposing a more ambitious start-up date. The minister could be regarded as having had a reasonable
expectation that that date could have been achieved. It could have been achieved had the Senate not
proposed to take as long as it did in relation to the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I
would also like to refer briefly to a comment by the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) which left me
somewhat amazed. He seemed to deny the claims of the government that the Senate's rejection of
these matters would lead to tax increases. Has the Labor Party learnt nothing from its 13 years in
government, when it spent money it did not have. Many of these measures would not have even been
necessary if you had not delivered to us a $10.3 billion budget deficit to start with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Labor Party had not, in government, spent money that it did not have, if
it had not adopted the attitude that the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) is describing in the House
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> at the moment&mdash;that is, increasing expenditure does not
result in increasing taxes&mdash;maybe we would not have had the $10.3 billion deficit which we
have had to address now that we are in government. Every time the government is denied one of its
savings measures, it has an impact on both sides of the budget. We have one or two alternatives. We
can increase the deficit&mdash;that is Labor's solution. We can borrow from somebody else so that
we can pay benefits to migrants coming into this country. We can borrow other people's money and
continue to live beyond our means. Sadly, the other option&mdash;the honourable member for Denison
does not seem to appreciate the simple reality of a balance sheet&mdash;is that you have to raise
more revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The clear message that the opposition are sending to
the Australian people is that they want higher taxes so that additional benefits can be paid to
newly arrived migrants. Let us make it quite clear that that is the message that they are sending
to the Australian people tonight. The government seek the early passage of this measure so it can
be implemented for the benefit of Australia. I am disappointed that opposition members are wasting

philosophy behind the approach that the government has taken on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the government did seek and receive a mandate in relation to the
changes that are the subject of this legislation. We made it very clear in our policy document
<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our commitments</EMPHASIS> that we intended to ensure that
access to benefits for all but refugees and humanitarian entrants would be the subject of a
two&hyphen;year waiting period, and that, in relation to that particular measure, there would be
specific provisions that would make allowance for changed circumstances after arrival.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition, as it then was, specifically envisaged that there might well be
circumstances where the person who had given assurances of support had died or lost their job.
There were a range of other circumstances that the government picked up in the Social Security
Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996 which
were designed to specifically acknowledge that, when changed circumstances arose, they would be
able to be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7570"> The government certainly had in mind, in relation to access to benefits, that those
people who came through the business migration program or the employer nomination program and
independent entrants ought to have sufficient funds to be able to provide for themselves after
arrival in Australia. Those who came through the family reunion program ought to be the subject of
sponsorship which was intended to be real. These were the people for whom the shadow minister, when
he has spoken, has made the point in other circumstances that they could be the villains in the
piece, if they want to walk away from their obligations. He commit ted the opposition to wanting to
make those sponsors pay those obligations. They were the sorts of words he used on the Hinch
program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that we know&mdash;and we have made this point
over and over again&mdash;that the assurance of support scheme under the Labor Party was allowed to
languish. It had been the subject of very few changes. We know from answers to questions in another
place at different times&mdash;by Senator Richardson in particular&mdash;that the recoveries of
moneys that were guaranteed under assurances were not possible. It was for this reason that the
government made it clear before the election that it would be moving in this direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You only have to read the documents that we put out at the time. It was
quite clear that it was to be extended to the full range of benefits, except those that were
specifically identified and for which we have not sought, in this legislation, such coverage. That
was the background to the measure. These were not, in our view, unreasonable measures. If people
are given an opportunity to obtain places in Australia in preference to others on the basis of
assurances that they will not become a charge upon the general community, it is our view that those
assurances ought to be honoured. The way in which you can ensure that they are honoured&mdash;when

I have to make, however, depends on an analysis of whether or not the government does have a

respect to migration and related issues. Those two documents addressed, in considerable detail,
migration policy and settlement policy. One of those documents was directed towards settlement
policy specifically. With respect to settlement policy, what the coalition did was to say that it
was very important that new arrivals in Australia be supported and that they have access to the
full range of services and benefits that would be available to all other Australians with no
discrimination. That was very bluntly there in black and white, in print.</PARA></TALK.START>

with the only media that was sought to be invited being the SBS. At that meeting, with a large
number of leaders of the ethnic communities, he sought to reassure them that what he had said
previously in 1988 about race, and about there being a degree of difficulty within the Australian
community about the capacity of the Australian society to absorb too many Asians, was no longer his
view. He sought to reassure them that he was committed to an immigration program that was based on
multiculturalism and that was consistent with the directions of the current government.</PARA>

intended to. There was not supposed to be a word or a whisper out there about a commitment of that
nature because he was running a subtext&mdash;the dog&hyphen;whistling that we have
heard&mdash;speaking in one voice to an audience that he was seeking to reassure and putting out a
false message to the rest of the Australian community that, in some ways, he was less comfortable
with levels of migration than the then government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He gave those
express assurances. Then, two weeks before the election itself, the coalition released their policy
document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our commitments</EMPHASIS>, which was not a document
in any detail but a series of cost saving measures that they proposed. In that cost savings
document they outlined savings they intended to make by extending Labor's six&hyphen;month waiting
period to two years. The first lines in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our
commitments</EMPHASIS> begin:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Achieve savings by requiring new
arrivals in Australia to wait two years . . . </PARA>

Australia for migrants, other than refugee and humanitarian migrants, before they became eligible

<PARA>Labor introduced that period. The document says that
the coalition will continue to do it. Then it says that access will now be extended to two years.
It then goes on and makes some other reassuring noises. It says, of course, that this does not
apply to anything like family allowance. It says:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will
complete my remarks. When the coalition brought forward its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our
commitments</EMPHASIS>  document, plainly, people had a discussion about what it meant and how it
was consistent with what the coalition had said by way of its more general policy statements. What
occurred, of course, was that there were discussions and comments by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)
in explaining it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you have is this situation. The
claim for a mandate, the claim that there is some authority flowing from this election, comes down
to in the end what the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) said yesterday in defending
her exaggerated claims for lost savings from this Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly
Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996. What she said there is that the
reason you knew the government must have intended this is that, if we were to sit down and analyse
the figures in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our commitment</EMPHASIS>, we would have started
to think about where those extra savings were to be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7573"> So the conclusion is this. This is where the mandate comes
from. The wise Australian voter, in considering what the coalition had promised, was intended to do
this: he was in tended to know that the coalition was going to move beyond unemployment benefits
and sickness benefits and the benefits that were subject to the six-month waiting period already,
and he was intended to have had the wisdom to know that the written statement in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our commitments</EMPHASIS>, that `Full access to family allowance will be
maintained' must have been a non-core promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, they must
have had the insight to know that when the now Prime Minister clarified his proposal by saying, `It
of course doesn't apply to family allowance and other benefits,' he meant the direct opposite. They
must have also had the resources of the finance department to work out that the $616 million
savings projected in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our commitments</EMPHASIS> could not have
been achieved by extending the six&hyphen;month waiting period to two years and then must have had
the wisdom after that to conclude therefore that the coalition actually had a secret plan for which
they would now claim a mandate after the election to introduce a two-year waiting period for all
the measures which they had said they had no intention of applying the two-year period to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not surprising that no commentator actually reached that conclusion.
There was a large debate about whether the costings of these measures were accurate. Peter Costello
said publicly that what was being done was simply extending Labor's six months to two years but
said that those savings would be achieved. So the basis of the so-called mandate is that you must
believe that the Prime Minister was a liar, you must believe that the Treasurer was a liar, you
must believe that what they said in their own <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our
commitments</EMPHASIS> document was false in so far as it said that it would not apply to family
allowance, you must believe that they were not intending to apply any consistency with their
previously published documents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now what we have is the real voice
of the coalition in government&mdash;misleading and deceitful, because where these measures come in
are not in terms of income support benefits. Income support benefits have been dealt with as were
projected by the coalition. When I went into the shadow ministry I said, `I don't <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> like this. I think we got the balance right', but the coalition went
to the people and said, `We are extending the six&hyphen;month period to two years. We thought we
had the balance right but we will allow this burdensome measure to come in so that new migrants
cannot get unemployment benefits, cannot get sickness benefits, and cannot get youth training
support for those periods of times.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if you are a working
Australian, paying your taxes, with kids to support, then you should get family allowance&mdash;the
sorts of things the coalition said you would before the election. They are not going to be able to
cheat people out of what are normal non-discriminatory benefits available to every person who has a
family and works in this country just because they are targeting you as a migrant, just because
they are seeking to play on these crude sensibilities that are run out there in the community. I am
very angry that this debate has been so distorted by the coalition. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

allowances, the document went on to say that full access to family allowance and Medicare will be
maintained for all migrants immediately upon arrival and that was the reference to what the Prime
Minister had to say because he spoke about the family allowance and Medicare. The fact is that the
family allowance payment at that time, when this matter was first developed as a policy initiative,
was in a form which was a minimum payment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The
government is implementing this measure on the basis that the minimum family <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> payment will be exempt but clearly those matters were included in the original
finance department costing, which had been submitted in relation to the election held in 1993 and
was the basis upon which these calculations were developed. All of the information was before the

calculated on that basis at that time.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that is not enough, apart from the costings of $616 million, there was that
wonderful interview on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program on 18 February
1996 with Laurie Oakes and the now Treasurer of this country (Mr Costello). I think his comments
are pertinent to the debate that is now before the chair. Laurie Oakes asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of your measures is to save $616 million over 3 years by requiring migrants to
wait two years before being eligible for benefits, when the Government imposed a six month waiting
period back in 1992 it was worth only $30 million, how can you get 20 times as much by increasing
the waiting time by four?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Costello, that man of the moment, does not have to
justify anything. He just comes out with all the commitments. He responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . let me explain that policy decision quite clearly, at the moment in relation
to migrants there is a six month waiting period for some benefits, what we've said is that people
who are coming into Australia as migrants aren't coming into Australia to go on Jobsearch Allowance
or unemployment benefit, by and large they're coming into Australia to bring their skills and to
make a contribution. We think it's fair that in relation to making that contribution that there be
a two year waiting period before going onto Jobsearch Allowance.</PARA>
<PARA>I could have repeated
that very slowly for the honourable member for Longman (Mr Brough) so that he, along with the
minister, could understand very clearly that it refers to jobsearch allowance, which is going
through in this particular bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What perhaps should be referred to
is the doorstops that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) gave in the days of the campaign. The member
for Denison has referred to them. How well we remember that dreadful one in Sydney at St Gregorys
when he was questioned by `dreadful media' who asked, `Tell me, Mr Leader of the Opposition, what
are you implying? Is this going to apply to family allowances?' Mr Howard replied, `Of course it
won't apply to family allowances or any of those other things that would interfere with the life of
the migrant.' He said that it would not apply. We are saying that it should not apply to those
amendments that are now being voted against by the government because they have been moved in the
Senate to bring the government back to honesty and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> back to
the commitment they gave to the people during the election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe a number of people have taken this debate between the sewer and the
gutter, and I do not know where. After the amendments were moved in the Senate last week, we heard
Senator Newman, a high ranking cabinet minister, say on ABC radio that, after the Senate rejected
the bill, migrants in this country would be able to ride on the backs of the battlers from the day
they arrived. Is this the type of debate that we want to see going in amendments to a bill such as
this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also had the Treasurer talking about a costing to his
budget of $200 million. Then we heard the Minister for Social Security talk about a figure of $400
million. Then, in a matter of four or five hours, the Treasurer said, `I was saying $200 million,
and now you are saying $400 million. I will grab the $400 million.' The minister has now said that
those figures were incorrect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the amendments we are
now debating are telling the Australian people that every migrant to this country has a right to
enjoy equal rights and be treated with respect regardless of their race, colour, creed or origin.
Obviously, neither the coalition in this House nor in the Senate, under the direction of Senator
Newman, sought to show that common respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Treasurer was
describing what would happen to Australia if these amendments were to go through, he referred to
our newly arrived migrants as `these people', as if we virtually have to put up with them. He said
that he was going to make it as hard as possible. The problem is that the Senate will not let them.
I believe that we in this House have to remind the coalition that it is not in their commitments.

opposition stands condemned for attempting to block proposed immigration reforms put forward by
this government. The coalition made a clear election commitment to ensure migrants did not become
eligible for social security and other welfare benefits for two years after entering the country.
Frankly, by every word that the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) has uttered in relation to this matter
he <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7576"> has condemned himself out of his own mouth. The
government's capacity to deliver on these election promises has been seriously compromised by the
Senate's refusal to approve the measures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this
matter let us not forget the complicity of the Democrats&mdash;the people who are there to keep the
others honest, they themselves said. They are conspiring with the Labor Party to prevent the
government from implementing its clearly stated election commitments. The Senate's decision will
add more than $400 million to the budget deficit over the next four years, and it will seriously
damage the integrity and public confidence in our immigration program&mdash;and that is perhaps the
most serious impact of the opposition's amendments in relation to these matters. Few Australians
are prepared to pay extra taxes to fund welfare payments for thousands of newly arrived
migrants.</PARA>

<PARA>I think Nancy Bates in this
editorial has clearly summed up public opinion. There is great anger and resentment in the
community that this thoroughly supported coalition proposal, this election commitment, has been
overturned in the Senate&mdash;and now that action is being further defended by members of the
Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a matter where the government made a clear
election commitment. It is a commitment that is supported overwhelmingly by the Australian people.
We recognise that occasionally problems will occur also for migrants; there are special benefits in
place for those circumstances. But we want to put an end to the practice where people come to
Australia not to contribute to our country but merely to access our social security system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not very long ago I was speaking to a senior Australian who had been on a
disability pension for several years. He had just arranged for the immigration of his second Asian
wife and was complaining to me that he was required to sign an assurance of support before his
second wife could come into the country. He said that he did so under duress because we would not
allow his second wife into the country unless he signed the document. But this was an invalid
pensioner; he had absolutely no capacity to honour, or intention of honouring, that assurance of
support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the kind of administration of this program which
brought great discredit upon Labor and, sadly, has also brought great discredit upon the entire
immigration program of our country. There was a lack of integrity there. There was no intention
ever to honour the rules. The coalition is proposing, through these very sensible amendments,
measures to ensure that those who choose to come to this country are aware of the fact that they
must make their own way, that they must contribute to this country and not seek to burden our
social security system. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You might say, `Oh well, they had a
mandate.' But the mandate extended very clearly to those sorts of income benefits that concern
unemployment and the like. It did not extend to those features of Australian life which <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> make for civilised society&mdash;things to do with health, things to
do with special benefits, things to do with carer pensions. What happens if somebody arrives and an
unpredictable situation arises within two years and they need to care for somebody? `Bad luck;
you're within the two-year period; you can't get the carer allowance.' What about
disability?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These proposals are absolutely outrageous when it comes
to consideration from the point of view of social justice. Let us not hear any of this nonsense
that we have heard from the minister. We know that he is in a desperate situation trying to justify
this, given his own philosophical background. But he does not have to agree with the rednecks, like
the member for Longman and others in this chamber, one&hyphen;termers, who are only here in this

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation is that these measures are
outrageous. They should not be accepted from the point of view of social justice and the government

Australia.' The taxi driver replied, `Oh, that's the place where you get paid to do nothing.'
People ought to remember that in 1995&hyphen;96 Australia had 99,139 new settlers to our shores. Of
those, more than 75 per cent came from countries from which, should I have chosen to migrate to
them, I would have received no support from the government, neither upon my arrival nor after 20
years of citizenship or permanent residency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, eight out of
the top 10 countries from which Australia accepted migrants last year have no social security

some would say, spendthrift as we are with some of our migrants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, the country from which we accepted the greatest number of migrants,
New Zealand&mdash;and in 1995-96 they numbered 12,265&mdash;has imposed a variety of residency
requirements which must be fulfilled before benefits will be provided to migrants by the
government. A minimum of 12 months residency has to be passed before a migrant <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is entitled to any form of unemployment or sickness benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Widows and domestic purposes benefits are only available should the recipient
have been living in New Zealand for a minimum of five years, or three years for both spouses before
being widowed. Anything up to 10 years residency is required to obtain the superannuation or
invalid benefit. The exception to this in New Zealand, as in Australia, as it will be under this
legislation, is for those in the humanitarian and the refugee program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you then actually look at social assistance in OECD countries from research
report No. 47 from the Department of Social Security, and again I refer to New Zealand, all
benefits are subject to prior residence requirements of a minimum of 12 months and up to 10 years

a parallel that they are being put into the same position as that Australian citizen who is already
making the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sacrifice? I do not wish these people to become

absolutely stuns me. You do not talk about but you refer to the sort of bias that might be out

You make those references.</PARA>

this country as newly arrived migrants actually would access the widow's allowance, the disability

and allude to the fact that they did. They were not spelt out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say
to the government and to the minister: if you wish to put that sort of hardship on people who
happen to have some misfortune fall upon them in their two years, then the people who support those
migrants into this country have got to give support on the basis that they are not widowed, that
they are not in an accident and are disabled, that they do not have a relative who is disabled and

would be in the form of a special allowance for those migrants whose circumstances changed
significantly after arrival in Australia for reasons beyond their personal control.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the Social Security
Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill as we
originally introduced it, there were schedules there that set out the full range of circumstances
where we thought that might occur. That included the situation of migrants sponsored by
individuals, which you adverted to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you go on and look at the
situation where people are sponsored by a business or an employer, you again will see a special
range of exemptions&mdash;such as where the job was withdrawn after the person's arrival in
Australia, the business went into receivership and the migrant's employment was terminated, the
business ceased to operate during the first two years in Australia or the worker was retrenched. As
to independent migrants, the fact was accepted that if funds were depleted due to a prolonged
illness of one or more of the immediate family members&mdash;that includes their partner and
dependent child&mdash;those special circumstances would be looked at as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a range of factors that were related to events which were occasioned
after a person arrived in Australia. But if the person's needs, as they are often characterised,
were clear before people came, then the question has to be asked: why were they being sponsored for
migration? Was it to bring people here to Australia to take up benefits that were essentially

feel it necessary  to rise again because I have been called all sorts of things tonight, amongst

context here. First of all, the member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) said that I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was trying to pick up some sort of mileage on this because of the race debate. We
have just heard from the previous speaker, the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), that the
Prime Minister (Mr Howard) somehow condones the race debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that I spoke on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly

parliament several months before the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) made her comments and before the
issue became the issue that it is today. I stand on that record. I am not a racist. I am not a
redneck. I am responsive to the electorate and I listen to the electorate, which is a damn sight
more than I can say for those opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the
opposition seems to have missed the fundamental point here. The point is not that these people are
going to miss out on some form of social security net, but that any person who is applying to
immigrate to Australia is being informed today&mdash;and has been since April&mdash;that they will
not be able to access these measures for the first two years. They come here with that knowledge.
Did you hear me? They come with that knowledge. Therefore, if they choose to immigrate to this
country&mdash;the lucky country as it is&mdash;they also must understand that it comes with
responsibilities that they have to be able to fend for themselves for two years. Gee, what an
unreasonable proposition to put to people!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us just go to one
particular point that you have rejected&mdash;the seniors' health care card. If any of you people
opposite listened to your electorate for one moment, you would hear them say to you, `I have worked
all my life for this country; I have paid my taxes all my life and now I can't get a seniors'
health care card.' The reason is because they are self-funded retirees. They see this as being
somehow a most unfortunate situation. How much more unfortunate do they see it when they see a

to support the motion before the House. If I may, I will just reflect on the immigration and
refugee humanitarian program for the benefit of a couple of the new members on the opposition
benches who were not in this place when it was brought into disrepute by the previous government.
The refugee humanitarian program was brought into disrepute when then Prime Minister Hawke made
what was, in effect, a unilateral decision&mdash;initially without consulting his own
cabinet&mdash;to allow the Chinese students to remain in Australia, post the Tiananmen Square
massacre. That was a decision that he made unilaterally. His cabinet fell in behind him because of
the circumstances. As a consequence, our refugee humanitarian program fell into very serious
disrepute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I challenge any of the members on the Labor
side to disagree with that proposition. In fact, I know that at the time within the Labor Party
itself there was a very strong sentiment amongst a number of the members that this was the wrong
decision to have made. I know that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the
member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), and I actually contributed to the debates at the time to alert the
House in relation to what was, in essence, the undermining of what had been until then a program to
which Australia had contributed as part of its humanitarian effort. It became a political football
and, unfortunately, now we find the situation where, as a consequence of that and as a consequence
of the policy decisions made by the previous minister, as outlined by the current minister in
question time on a couple of occasions recently, the immigration program had become skewed in such
a way that it also became subject to disrepute. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7584">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence, we find ourselves in a situation where this
country, which was built on immigration, finds that probably the great majority of its own citizens
believe that its immigration and refugee humanitarian programs do not actually work. As a
consequence, the government has introduced what are quite reasonable, acceptable changes to the
immigration program to ensure that there is equity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I listened very
carefully to the contribution of members. I consider the contribution of the honourable member for
Bradfield (Dr Nelson) to be a first-class contribution. I do not always agree with him, and I will
disagree with him in relation to the member for Oxley (Mrs Hanson). The member for Oxley is a voice
from her electorate representing some of the anguish that many of the citizens around the country
are expressing in relation to the immigration and refugee humanitarian program. They are expressing
this anguish because the previous government brought it into serious disrepute by using it as a
political tool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that, for instance, the previous member for
Petrie, Mr Johns, a Queenslander and a junior minister to the Minister for Industrial Relations,
made that observation during the period of the last government. He pointed out that the government
had become hostage to minority interests and, as a consequence, had lost its way. He was staring
into the abyss that was facing the Labor Party before the last election. He could see what was at
the bottom of the abyss. What was in the abyss was, of course, this huge electoral defeat, because
the Labor Party had divorced itself very strongly from the sentiments of mainstream
Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some now choose to call this racism. Some now choose to
decry this as some sort of temporary phenomenon. What they are not recognising, through the
amendments in the Senate, is the fact that Australians want the immigration and refugee
humanitarian program brought back into some state of affairs where it is fair, where people know
exactly how it is going to work and where those in the process know exactly how they are going to
be treated. The Senate amendments have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> perverted this
objective. We now find ourselves with the situation where, in order to redress the wrong the Senate
has performed, we are faced with supporting the motion in the House today, which I wholeheartedly

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To my colleagues who are interjecting at this moment,
I say that it is not at all enlightening to have comments of that kind made. We actually have a
situation where these measures, in the main, go to working Australians who have come here and
settled as permanent residents in this country. They are paying their taxes, but they are being
held out from that range of benefits which attach to ordinary taxpaying Australians. For example,
the parenting allowance is no more than the old dependent spouse rebate. So what is the difference
between that and the family tax benefit, for example?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition went into the last campaign claiming to be a family friendly party.
They said that they would lift the tax threshold and allow low income people to cash out at a DSS
as a cash transfer. That is exactly the same thing as the parenting allowance. So you have got this
discriminatory policy that says to people who are working and living here as permanent residents
that they will be treated in a discriminatory way on ordinary measures that are intrinsically part
of the taxation system. That is a fundamentally wrong principle to adopt. To suggest that people
come off the boat to get onto things such as the widow's allowance&mdash;they come off the boat so
that their partner can die&mdash;is nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consider the
situation: if you were to marry somebody who happened to come from overseas and had a child, your
family would not get the family allowance benefits that every other Australian gets, even if you
were in the work force. These are outrageous provisions. They are provisions that the then
opposition spokesperson, in talking about <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> these matters, said
should not in any way be applied in a discriminatory manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In
fact, the coalition documents before the election expressly said that all these matters should not
be the subject of any discriminatory policy. So how is it that we have this fraudulent outrage that
people come off the boat in order to get benefits of this nature? What they do is come here to get
a job, and 75 per cent of all people who come to this country as migrants never seek income support
at all. And those people are being denied the range of ordinary support that working, battling
families get. They are paying their taxes, they are paying their Medicare levies. And what are they
expected to do? Not get the ordinary transfer payments that exist within the taxation system that
other Australians are entitled to.</PARA>

also to think that this government would stoop as they have and in the direction they have
regarding migrants coming to this country. A couple of things need to be said. First, the Minister
for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) got up with great panache, he thought, and
explained to the member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) that special benefits were going to be changed. He
well knows, even when he covered social security, that special benefits are a discretionary

Party does not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7586"> understand what the electorate is
all about. As the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) read from a newspaper, I will just read a few
little lines from this one. I will be very quick. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> of 28 August 1996 headlined `Security net under
scrutiny' explains where the government is making some mistakes. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has to be very careful, however, that its search for savings does
not disturb the equity of the social security system. Unfortunately, that equity is a casualty of
the way the Government has singled out migrants for special attention. The decision to exclude them
from benefits to which other permanent residents are entitled is not justified. People who are
accepted as migrants are normally healthier and better able to get employment than the average
Australian because of the way the selection process works. None come to Australia to rort the
welfare system. Those who, through no fault of their own, come to need social security support
should not be denied it simply because they have not been here for those several years.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an important point to get into this debate, because we on this side of the House have
been accused of not understanding or appreciating what the electorate is all about. What we do know
is that the electorate is listening, as I said previously in an interjection, to some of the
talk&hyphen;back rubbish on radio, which is promoting and projecting some of the irrational
statements of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is outrageous that we should even
contemplate statements such as those that have been made in this House today, in the Senate during
the debate and in this House when this bill was previously debated. It is appalling, and it is
something about which each and every one of us should be ashamed. We should make sure that we stand
up and be counted, regardless of the racism debate. Most particularly, we should never single out
those people who come to this country and make a contribution to it. We are treating them as the
cause of all the problems that the government perceives. The problems are that the government
cannot manage its own business, it has made commitments to the electorate at large and it has lied
to the electorate at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> You have stated explicitly that the
only benefit to be cut would be extended, and that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is the
unemployment benefit or, as the member for Fisher wishes to refer to it, the dole queue. We have
said that we agree with your extending that from six months to two years. We have agreed with that
part of the amendment in the bill. What we have not agreed with&mdash;no decent thinking Australian
would agree with it&mdash;is that those people who come through no fault of their own should be
made desperate or destitute because of the callous disregard of the members on the government
benches. That is why we on this side of the House completely object to some of the comments being

or the dole; the youth training allowance; and sickness allowance. It rejected Government attempts
to impose a similar two-year waiting period for 11 other benefits, while the Government withdrew
two more.</PARA>
<PARA>Why did it withdraw two more? Was it because it finally thought that $0.3
million over four years for the child disability allowance was a bit rich? Negligible amounts for
the double orphan pension, which involves children who lose both parents, were going to be withheld
for two years.</PARA>

Australian community has changed over time and become a multicultural and diverse

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a coded debate which I find most

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On a
range of issues in the past, the minister has taken strong stands which are entirely consistent
with positions that are now being taken by the opposition. What has provoked this change? The
simple fact is that this change has been provoked because, from opposition, he has now come into
government; a government led by a Prime Minister who is prepared to take the low road on these
issues, a Prime Minister who has not distinguished himself by leadership in a debate which is
current in the Australian community. Far from being a person of courage, he is now the cat's paw of
the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is leading him to take steps which, I am sure, in his own
conscience, he believes are difficult to carry through.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is sometimes true that people deceive themselves and come to believe in what
they are articulating. I hope that is the case with the minister, because I would not wish to
suggest to him that he is a dishonourable <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> man. But I suspect
that, 10 years from now, when the pressure of office is lifted from him, he will come to reflect on
these years as being years when he ought to have done more to resist these kinds of measures.
Certainly it will be of no benefit to Australia as a coherent and sound society if we come to a
point where we develop two classes of persons living in this country, and where there are those who
are treated differently because of the fact that they have arrived recently. It has never been the
case in Australia before. We have had a strong, effective growing economy&mdash;a vibrant and
healthy economy. We have gone through a long period post&hyphen;war when we never needed measures
of this draconian nature. It has never been necessary&mdash;it is not necessary now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can have a debate about what levels of immigration are appropriate. That, I
know, is an issue upon which different views are legitimately held by many. But to allow this
situation to develop to a point where people are being treated differently because of their
background and where children who came to this country and are part of Australian families growing
up in Australia&mdash;working families&mdash;are being treated differently from other children in
this country because of the nature of their background seems quite improper and completely
inconsistent with anything the minister would have stood for previously at any time in his 24 years
in parliamentary service. It is one of the ironies of political life that he is now the author of
this legislation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

put in place. The six&hyphen;month waiting provision was a differential provision. That is exactly
what it was. The issue of when you grant people when they come through the door an age
pension&mdash;we have said 10 years is the period for which there will be a preclusion

discrimination when we are dealing with this legislation. We are not talking about issues of racial
discrimination in this legislation. That point needs to be made carefully, because there is no

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever the minister's motivations are and whatever motivations he attributes to
me, the point is that these measures are not worthy of Australia. Australia is a great country. I
have heard in this debate people say, `If you went to such and such a place, it wouldn't happen
that way.' The example is often given of the United States. The truth is that the United States
treats its own people very badly when it comes to welfare. It treats its own people appallingly
when it comes to medical benefits. It treats its own people very badly when it comes to things like
income support and a whole range of things which we in Australia take pride in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We as a nation do ourselves no credit in saying, `Other countries do not do this;
therefore, that is the benchmark for our own conduct.' We are in fact a greater, better and more
pleasant place to live in than, I believe, any other country in the world. We will diminish our
nation by these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I can mention just one matter about
costing, we have heard comment about the costs that are being attributed to the so&hyphen;called
vandalism of the Senate. One of the measures which I have dealt with was the starting&hyphen;up
time of this legislation, a matter which really is properly sheeted home to the government. The
other matter, of course, is the attributed cost to special benefit. Senator Newman quoted in the
Senate the other day a cost of $65.3 million over four years for having to pay a special benefit to
the estimated 30 per cent of new migrants who will be eligible for such a payment due to hardship
caused by extending to two years the waiting period for unemployment and sickness benefits. But the
coalition, in its own <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our commitments</EMPHASIS> document,
promised special benefits would be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7590"> maintained for
those who needed to receive them due to changes in circumstances beyond their control. In other
words, the minister is blaming the Senate for the cost of keeping a coalition promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the outset of this debate the coalition has sought to take some comfort in
the most fraudulent interpretation of what it put forward in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our commitments</EMPHASIS> document. I think anyone who reads from the
outset the transcript of these speeches tonight will have no doubt that what the government set
about to do was to play a game of deception upon the many voters of non-English speaking
backgrounds who might have been concerned about such a measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When
the Treasurer, Mr Costello, was asked about these matters, about his costings, did he come up and
say, `Well, no, the costings are explicable, because they actually include measures that are not in
the six-month waiting period that the Labor Party introduced'? No. He referred to unemployment
benefits. I believe it was a deliberate and straightforward intention to introduce a waiting period
by simply extending the six months to two years. When they came to office they realised their
costings were as flawed as we said, and they decided to go a bit deeper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) wrote to Senator Newman, referring to
Senator Newman's own objections to including the child support cash rebate and other measures,
saying, `Notwithstanding your reservations, we will proceed with these matters.' They included in
their first list things such as the double orphan benefit. It was a root and branch exercise in
moving from a position where they gave no plausible basis whatsoever for their electors to
anticipate these measures. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

deliberate. The reason for the use of the word `allowance' was to make it clear that special

allowance in those circumstances which arose after a person's arrival in Australia for reasons

that was a measure taken in response to what was the then crisis the refugee humanitarian program
was in as a consequence of what was in fact a process that allowed enormous latitude for litigation
on the part of those who had been refused refugee status after arriving illegally in
Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am trying to point out here is that the Howard
government enjoys in this particular instance, in my view, the overwhelming support of the
community in endeavouring to try to bring the migration and the refugee humanitarian programs back
into a state of repute. Those people who have an interest in immigration and refugee humanitarian

being unable to support it. That has happened because the previous Labor administration chose to
deal with it like a political football. If these measures are going to work, and they are

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I
really must respond to those comments of the member for Moore (Mr Filing). The difficulty we have
is that the member for Moore is suggesting somehow that this is to do with the refugee program. I
know that he is not interested in that program, but the fact is that most of these provisions do
not apply to refugees at all. There is a point that comes up which I think is of some significance
for this government, as it was for the previous government. If we have a person in a refugee camp
in Germany or in Croatia who has family in Australia, do we ask them to sponsor that refugee? If we
do, do we give that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> refugee a preference because of that
sponsorship?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we do that, that migrant becomes a
sponsored migrant in which case the sponsor is liable for their support. In a sense that can
distort the family reunion program because a substantial part of the refugee program is absorbed or
picked up by the family reunion program. Most people have thought that is a sensible thing to do
because, if there is a refugee in a country with family in Australia, they have a much better
chance of being successful migrants than a person who has no family whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this provision will do is the opposite of what the member suggests. If the
family in Australia realises that they are going to be liable for all those downstream costs and
not simply income support, they will not sponsor them. The person will probably still be successful
but will be unsponsored, so the taxpayers will pay more. That is what is going to happen. This is
the nonsense of this whole debate, because the government is pushing an agenda which is not about
the real issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If every refugee came to Australia as a sponsored
refugee, the chances of success are enormously high for successful settlement. If they are all
unsponsored, the chances are reduced. We all know that. If one looks at the people on the dole from
non&hyphen;English speaking backgrounds and looks at their status on arrival, they will see that
substantial numbers of them were refugees. They are the ones with the most difficulty in adjusting.
They are the ones who have the most difficulty with the language. They have had the most traumatic
backgrounds. If any of you have dealt with the Bosnian refugees, you would understand that. Many of
them missed schooling for years and years of their life. They have come from enormously difficult
backgrounds. They need a great deal of help. If they have a family here who will sponsor them, this
is much more likely to be successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that this
legislation will discourage families from putting up their hand to sponsor that relative. One of
two things will happen. The person will still come unsponsored, which means that they are totally
paid for by taxpayers, which will therefore be of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7594">
greater cost to the country, or alternatively that family will not sponsor them at all. So I
believe that the member for Moore is confused with respect to his obsession with the issue he
raised earlier regarding Chinese students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Acting Speaker, you
will recall that was an issue that tore the country apart. We all cried over that. Those who have
been in Beijing since and have spoken to Chinese who were there understand very well the anguish
that we all went through. To belittle that issue demeans the member for Moore. It is unfortunate.
He did not need to do that. I do not think anybody here claims to be Solomon. I do not know what I
would have done if I had been in the then Prime Minister's position. I do not think anybody else
here knows either. We are all very wise after the event, but at the time we were all torn
apart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to put an example to the minister to illustrate
the point that I was trying to make earlier. An Australian lives in England for five years and then
brings his wife and three children back to Australia. We have literally tens of thousands of
Australians living overseas with spouses and children born overseas, and in many cases the children
are not registered as Australian citizens. People are not aware of that. This person has no other
family in Australia. His mum and dad have died. He has an accident and can no longer work. Who
looks after the wife and children? Who pays for them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the
government would have us do is to legally forbid every single government official from giving them
any help at all for those first two years. That is what you are talking about. In removing access
to these benefits and any access at all, what you are talking about is an Australian being able to
get benefits for himself. So he is okay. He is below the poverty line, but he is okay because he
will receive a benefit.</PARA>

opposing this measure, the government is of the view that, in omitting these provisions that have

own right. The amendment now proposed is contrary to that approach. The amendment should be opposed
on the ground that it would require only that a person's partner had been an Australian resident

complexity of administration. The same argument applies to each of the other separate

period will have a very different character in terms of its impact on a family and their children
if it applies to a circumstance where the waiting period is extended to two years.</PARA>

there has already been a period of preclusion from benefits&mdash;unemployment benefits, sickness
allowance or a youth training allowance&mdash;that has been served and expired, the preclusion
period for the new person arriving will only be six months. It seems that to allow families to be
bereft of that income support net for, effectively, a period of four years or thereabouts, by
reason of these particular amendments, is excessive, notwithstanding the comments that the minister

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the bill was passed by the Senate last
week, yet purported to extend many of the penal measures to people who had been in Australia and
commenced their residence under the law as it then existed, which had very different provisions,
and who would have finished any preclusion period which they might have otherwise had to
serve&mdash;the six-month period&mdash;the government's position on this now is simply ludicrous.
It may have made some plausible sense when persons were expected to serve a preclusion period of
six months if the bill had been brought in and dealt with so that those people would have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7596"> had that period extended to 24 months. But the absurdity
of the proposition that somehow people who have served a preclusion period under existing law now
are entitled to a range of measures which are available to the general community as a whole and
then later at some stage go back on a preclusion period is simply absurd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister knows it to be absurd. To persist with these particular amendments
is simply a device to achieve a double dissolution trigger. It is simply a device for a political
motive. There is no rational, plausible or social benefit reason for any of these measures. Indeed,
the implausibility of the minister's position is illustrated by the point I made earlier in debate
when we were discussing the consented amendments. I made the point that it was in fact the
government's delay in bringing forth this legislation with any degree of urgency whatsoever in the
Senate that meant that the bill could not be dealt with before retrospectivity had to apply under
whatever test you sought to imagine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's argument here is
so implausible, so silly, so incapable of any rational basis that one can only really say that the
only plausible reason is that they do not want to make any changes that reflect commonsense in this
measure in order that they can maintain a double dissolution trigger. There is going to be a cost
to the community if the government is setting up this as a political stunt in order to hang a sword
of Damocles over the Senate with the prospect of a double dissolution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That means that, instead of getting the bits that they could get now and bring
into effect the waiting period for unemployment benefits extended from six months to two years, and
all the other elements that we agree with, they are going to wait now for at least three months,
and probably longer depending on the parliamentary timetable, forgoing those benefits. The cost of
that forgoing to the Australian community is going to be in the order of $12.5 million to $25
million, depending on whether you believe the costings of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) or of the
Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman). If it is a three&hyphen;month period, and the period
of delay <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the parliamentary process is longer, then the
cost to the community goes up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because the government are being
stubborn and not accepting the overwhelming savings that have been conceded by the Senate and
playing politics on this, the taxpayers of Australia are going to pay $12.5 million to $25 million.
I have to say that that is inconsistent, because what they said in their <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our commitments</EMPHASIS> was that the waiting period that was applied
by Labor applied to most welfare benefits. What we said covered, in their language, most welfare
benefits.</PARA>

it. The cost of setting up this stunt is in the order of $12.5 million to $25 million forgone on
your own costings because you will not bring into effect your legislation, because you choose not

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not take my full five minutes. I
will just complete what I was saying. It is important to realise that the mechanisms that are being

bill to be a first double dissolution trigger&mdash;not to pass this bill. So what the government
will deliberately do, strategically, is not take the bird in the hand. They will not take the
savings that have been offered up. The savings that the Senate has agreed to provide the
overwhelming bulk of the savings that the government sought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The
importance is that these measures will not be brought in because this government&mdash;just as it
delayed in bringing the measures before the Senate in the first place and therefore wasted the $129

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments are consequential upon other
amendments proposed by the Senate to ensure that no newly arrived resident's waiting periods will

special benefit, partner allowance, maternity allowance, child disability allowance, double orphan

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to accepting the recommendations made by both the majority and

the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other

periods should not apply for child disability allowance or double orphan pension, the House of
Representatives remains of the view that newly arrived resident's waiting periods should be imposed

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The House of Representatives considers that these
amendments&mdash;to not introduce newly arrived resident's waiting periods for carer pension, widow
allowance, disability wage supplement, mature age allowance, special benefit, partner allowance,
maternity allowance, parenting allowance, mobility allowance, seniors health card, more than the
minimum rate of family payment and health care cards&mdash;should not proceed as they would
counteract the electoral mandate given to the Government at the 1996 election to introduce its
election commitment relating to imposing a two year newly arrived resident's waiting period on most
welfare benefits. The House of Representatives notes that access of newly arrived migrants to
Australian social security payments compares favourably with other western nations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect to carer pension, it is noted that the Government had intended moving
amendments in the Senate to take account of recommendation 3 of the majority report of the Senate
Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee that special needs relatives be exempt from the carer
pension newly arrived resident's waiting period, as well as exempting refugees, former refugees or
a family member of the refugee or former refugee from that waiting period. The House of
Representatives is of the view that those amendments should have prevailed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment proposed by the Senate in relation to widow allowance (Senate
amendment (17)) would result in a disparity in access between widow allowance and newstart
allowance despite the eligibility criteria for widow allowance having always essentially been
aligned with those applying for newstart allowance. Previously, widow allowance has been subject to
a 26 week residence requirement, akin to the 26 week newly arrived resident's waiting period for
newstart allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The House of Representatives considers that the
introduction of a newly arrived resident's waiting period for disability wage supplement addresses
concerns that in deciding to come to Australia, migrants should be aware of the need to provide
adequately for themselves after they arrive in Australia so as not to make undue calls on the
Australian taxpayer. The House of Representatives notes, however, that there has been a
recognition, as reflected in the legislation, that circumstances <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7598"> sometimes change after a person arrives in Australia and that as a result, the newly
arrived resident's waiting period will not apply to a person who first suffered a continuing
inability to work in Australia because of an impairment or who becomes permanently blind while in
Australia. Therefore, the House of Representatives does not consider that the Senate amendment
relating to disability wage supplement (Senate amendment (18)) is warranted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The House of Representatives believes that any failure to introduce a newly arrived
resident's waiting period for special benefit will operate to effectively undermine the newly
arrived resident's waiting periods that operate for other income support payments, such as newstart
allowance. The Senate amendments relating to special benefit would allow many unemployed people to
avoid the two year waiting period provisions, and therefore the House of Representatives does not
consider that the Senate amendment relating to special benefit is warranted. Although the
Government had proposed that a newly arrived resident's waiting period should apply for special
benefit, the House of Representatives notes that the Government had and continues to recognise the
importance of ensuring that there is an adequate safety net to take care of those persons who
suffer substantial changes in their circumstances beyond their control.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To that end, the Bill as introduced and passed by the House of Representatives had
provided that such persons would be exempt from the operation of a newly arrived resident's waiting
period. Further, it is understood that the Government had indicated to the Senate that it proposed
moving a number of concessionary amendments to the special benefit provisions to take on board
those recommendations made by the majority report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs
Committee that impacted on special benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect to partner
allowance, the vast majority of those receiving partner allowance are spouses of recipients of
newstart allowance. Prior to July 1995 the unemployed person would have received the partnered rate
of unemployment payment and been excluded from this combined payment for 26 weeks. The House of
Representatives understands that the amendments proposed by the Government in the Bill as
introduced with respect to partner allowance are a further step in a process instigated by the
former Government of ensuring that persons qualify for social security payments in their own right.
The House of Representatives endorses this position and so opposes Senate amendment  (26).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The House of Representatives disagrees with Senate amendment (28) relating to
parenting allowance. Parenting allowance is an income support payment and as such, has always been
aligned with other income support payments such as newstart allowance. It was introduced in July
1995 by the previ <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ous Government to make available a payment
to those looking after children, to compensate for the abolition of the partnered rate of social
security benefits. It is noted that for that reason, newly arrived resident waiting provisions
mirroring those applicable to newstart allowance were inserted into the Social Security Act 1991
when parenting allowance was introduced by the former Government in July 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The House of Representatives does not agree that there is a need for Senate
amendments (32) or (36) on the basis that the operation of a newly arrived resident's waiting
period for the seniors health card or health care cards would cause undue hardship. Persons subject
to a newly arrived resident's waiting period would still have immediate access to Medicare. These
concession cards provide access to Commonwealth and State/Territory concessions which newly arrived
migrants should not expect to receive immediately upon entry to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Senate
amendments (20), (23) and (34)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The House of Representatives
agrees with the position that had previously been adopted by the former Government that people
should qualify for social security payments in their own right and notes that the former Government
had introduced a number of initiatives to give effect to that policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the House of Representatives does not agree with amendments (20), (23)
and (34) that would seek for newstart allowance, sickness allowance and youth training allowance,
respectively, to maintain the exemption from the operation of a newly arrived resident's waiting
period that currently applies to a person who is a member of a couple immediately before entering
Australia and whose partner has been an Australian resident for at least 26 weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In any event, the House of Representatives considers that it would be
inappropriate, in the light of the newly arrived resident's waiting period being extended to 104
weeks, to continue to require only that a newly arrived migrant's partner who has been an
Australian resident for 26 weeks before the newly arrived migrant could claim an exemption from the
operation of a newly arrived resident's waiting period. Such a disparity would not be justifiable
on policy grounds, in view of the individual entitlement to social security payments and will
result in complexity in administration.</PARA>

Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996. The 26 week newly arrived resident's
waiting period would apply to those persons who had entered Australia and been granted a permanent
visa before that day. The House of Representatives further notes that the amendments are being
proposed in response to suggestions that the legislation is retrospective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The House of Representatives does not agree that the legislation is
retrospective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The House of Representatives accepts that there was
wide coverage in Australia of the Government's policy announcement relating to newly arrived
resident's waiting periods, both during the 1996 election campaign and about the date from which it
was proposed that the extended waiting period should apply, that is, 1 April 1996. Further, the
House of Representatives understands that information foreshadowing the Government's new policy was
provided to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs by the Department of Social
Security. This was distributed to overseas posts on 19 March 1996 to provide to all visa applicants
and to successful visa applicants when a visa is issued; to migration applicants who had already
received a visa but had not arrived in Australia on 21 March 1996; and on 27 March 1996 to all
assurers of support of applicants who had not yet arrived in Australia. Since 1 April 1996, this
information has been provided to all on&hyphen;shore migration applicants and any nominators or
assurers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The majority report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional
Affairs Committee did not consider that the legislation was retrospective. The majority report
noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Committee notes concerns about the retrospective
provisions in the Bill and evidence that these may result in hardship for some newly arrived
residents. In the Committee's view these provisions were clearly enunciated during the election
campaign and information on proposed changes to the policy have been widely circulated by the
Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. The Committee notes that the provisions in the
Bill relating to special benefits are prospective. Therefore new residents who arrive after 1 April
1996 and before the Royal Assent of the Bill will be eligible for special benefits under current
arrangements. In the Committee's view, these provisions provide an appropriate transition and will
allay concerns about this aspect of the Bill.".</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr Downer</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The first question relates to withdrawal of consent to be bound by the terms of a treaty at international law. In respect of treaties between parties to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969 (`Vienna Convention') that are entered into after the Vienna Convention's entry into force (27 January 1980), that Convention sets out the international legal regime governing those treaties. Australia is a party to the Vienna Convention and would observe its terms. The Vienna Convention sets out the body of rules regulating denunciation of treaties falling within this category. In accordance with those rules, treaties containing no provision for denunciation could be denounced either with the consent of the parties (Article 54) or pursuant to the terms of Article 56, the terms of which the honourable member has reproduced in his first question. The Vienna Convention also sets out certain circumstances in which a party may withdraw from or denounce a treaty outside of the terms of Articles 54 and 56. These are addressed in response to the second question. In addition, there is some debate in the textbooks as to whether Article 56 of the Vienna Convention reflects the position at customary international law. The terms of the Vienna Convention are in many respects largely declaratory of customary international law. In relation to those treaties that are not governed by the provisions of the Vienna Convention the body of customary international law relating to treaties would govern such issues as denunciation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The majority of treaties contain provision for denunciation and could be denounced according to those terms. Of those treaties which do not contain such a provision, a large number would fall within the terms of Article 56, which are rather broad. The  types of treaties that are usually given as examples of treaties not subject to unilateral denunciation are peace treaties, treaties establishing boundaries, and important law&hyphen;making treaties. In practice, there would be very few treaties that could not be de <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> nounced. There are detailed provisions in the Vienna Convention that set out other circumstances where under international law it would be possible to withdraw from or denounce a treaty without the consent of all other parties to the treaty. Articles 60&hyphen;64 of the Vienna Convention set out these rights in some detail, and Section 4 of the Vienna Convention sets out the procedures that would be followed by a party invoking those rights. These provisions address such issues as denunciation because of a material breach of the treaty by the other (or another) party, supervening impossibility of performance, fundamental change of circumstances, severance of diplomatic or consular relations, or the emergence of a new peremptory norm of general international law. There are also issues that may arise under customary international law, such as desuetude and obsolescence, that could be relevant to withdrawal from a treaty. There is a large body of international legal jurisprudence regarding withdrawal from treaties that may be referred to in this regard, should the honourable member require further elucidation.</PARA>

<ANSWER PAGE="7610" SPEAKER="Ruddock, Philip, MP" NAMEID="0J4" ELECTORATE="Berowra" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Immigration and Multicultural Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr Ruddock</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Government is not reducing funding for housing assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) and (3) The major research and analysis effort behind the current direction of housing reform was the 1993 report of the Industry Commission, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Public Housing</EMPHASIS> . The Industry Commission's report called for a major reform of housing assistance, including clarification of Commonwealth and State responsibilities; improvements to rental subsidy arrangements to improve <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> equity and client choice of housing; and greater accountability and effectiveness of public housing. The Industry Commission recommended a move away from capital funding of public housing to recurrent funding arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The type and level of service that will be provided through State public housing and private sources will depend on the outcome of current negotiations between the Commonwealth and the States on future housing roles and responsibilities, including rental subsidy delivery. There is potential for the public housing system to play a greater role in assisting people with special housing needs that can be difficult to meet in private rental.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, people on low incomes receive housing assistance through two separate programs. The Commonwealth and State governments provide funds for the provision of public housing, and the Commonwealth provides separate Rent Assistance payments for private renters. Under the proposed reforms, the Commonwealth would provide rental subsidies for both private and public tenants. The States would continue to manage and deliver public housing, along with their related responsibilities for welfare, disability and health services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Depending on the outcome of subsidy reform negotiations with the States, a more equitable rental subsidy system could make private housing more affordable, and so ease the pressure on public waiting lists. This would help people who may need prompt access to public housing, including people with medical conditions and disabilities and those facing discrimination or homelessness, who may have difficulty meeting their housing needs in the private rental market. Subsidy reform could also better enable people without special housing needs to find suitable housing in the private rental market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The Commonwealth is working with State and Territory governments to develop options for housing reform, including rental subsidy design. In these negotiations the Commonwealth will support the following principles relating to costs for consumers:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> existing public tenants are protected and not financially disadvantaged; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> new public housing tenants do not pay more than 25 per cent of their income in rent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The Government is not reducing funding for housing assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The potential financial costs to the Commonwealth and the States under the reforms will depend on the final allocation of housing roles and responsibilities. If the Commonwealth were to become responsible for housing affordability in public and private rental for people on low incomes, for example, this shift in responsibility would need to be accompanied by a commensurate adjustment in Commonwealth&hyphen;State financial resources. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7611"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are compelling reasons to believe that social costs would be reduced by housing reform. Greater equity in rental subsidy delivery could improve housing affordability for many people on low incomes and assist the achievement of greater independence. Improved affordability would deliver the financial and social benefits of better enabling people to choose housing which suits their employment or education goals, or their need to be close to family or other support networks or services. The potential to provide better access to public housing for people with special housing needs (explained in (3) above) would similarly reduce social costs which may arise if special needs were otherwise met at a lesser level in the private rental market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) There has been much consultation throughout the development of housing reform, including consultation associated with the report of the Industry Commission; subsequent consultation with housing providers and their representatives; consultation with tenants' associations and continuing dialogue with National Shelter and ACOSS. No decisions have been made on the final model of housing reform, and the Commonwealth has proposed to State and Territory Governments that there be wide consultations on this matter. The Commonwealth will continue to consult key community representatives as housing reform proceeds.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Australia remains concerned about the imprisonment of individuals for the non&hyphen;violent expression of political or other views at variance with those of the Vietnamese Government and will continue to press the Vietnamese authorities for the release of all those imprisoned for the peaceful expression of political opposition. During my visit to Vietnam in July I sought information on a number of cases raised by the Australian Parliamentary Consultative Delegation during their visit to Vietnam in April 1995 and by the Embassy since. The Australian Government, including through its Embassy in Hanoi will continue to make representations on behalf of citizens detained for the non&hyphen;violent expression of their political beliefs. I also urged Vietnam to adhere to international human rights norms, particularly freedom of speech, religion and the right to express dissenting political views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Australia established the foundations for a dialogue on human rights with the successful visit to Vietnam in 1995 of the Australian Parliamentary Consultative Delegation of which I was Deputy Leader. As both Australia and Vietnam are parties to major human rights instruments, there is a solid basis for dialogue on human rights issues. We continue to maintain a constructive dialogue with Vietnam on human rights and register our concerns with the Vietnamese Government about specific human rights cases.</PARA>
