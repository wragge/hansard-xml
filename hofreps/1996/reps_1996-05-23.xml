<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, in rising as the new member for Parramatta, I follow a very distinguished series of predecessors. I note in particular Howard Beale, Sir Garfield Barwick and Sir Nigel Bowen. The latter two both rose to the rank of chief justice of their respective courts, they being the High Court and the Federal Court of Australia. I submit that we would have to go far and wide to find an individual who has made a greater contribution to public life than Sir Garfield Barwick.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The seat was also held by the honourable member for Berowra, Phillip Ruddock, who is currently the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and who continues to serve the House with distinction. In more recent times, it was held by two members whose party is now on the other side of the House. I am speaking of the Hon. John Brown and the Hon. Paul Elliott, my opponent in the campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hon. Paul Elliott is a very decent human being and was an honourable opponent who conducted both a robust and a fair campaign. I note that he is now assiduously <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> seeking to retain his nomination. He is present at virtually every function in my electorate. I submit to the factional leaders of the Labor Party, who we are assured make these decisions, that he is entitled to another go, and I look forward to a similarly robust contest in three years time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, it was a great campaign. It was not an individual effort but a team effort. A great number of those who made an outstanding contribution are with us in the gallery today. I would like to acknowledge my debt to the conferences of Berowra and Parramatta. I would like to acknowledge my debt to Phillip Ruddock, who, aside from giving me a great deal of personal support, managed to persuade his conference to weigh in heavily behind me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note the member for Warringah, Tony Abbott, sitting here in the chamber. Can I just say that he is a magnificent envelope folder and letter stamper. I see that, from those humble beginnings, he has now been elevated to the executive. There were numerous others. The Chief Government Whip (Mr Cadman) went above and beyond the call of duty and gave very unselfishly to assist in my election. To him, I am indebted. I note also sitting in the front row is the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop), who I continue to believe is Australia's pre-eminent marginal seat campaigner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The contest could not have been resolved in the manner it was unless literally thousands of Australians voted Liberal for the first time in their lives. Those people have a legitimate expectation that we on this side of the House will deliver a different and better form of government and that I, as their new member, will be an effective advocate for their particular needs, hopes and aspirations. Might I say that the needs of Parramatta are not something to which I now refer as a matter of custom; I refer to them as a matter of pressing urgency for consideration by this House and, in particular, by those who sit on the front bench on this side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, we need to look at the fact that the demographic centre of Sydney is Parramatta. The population has shifted ever westward, but the policy preoccupation of decision <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> makers has tended to remain on the northern and eastern suburbs of Sydney. I want to see Parramatta achieve its natural destiny as being the capital of western Sydney and Sydney's second CBD. The metropolitan planning study in 1988 conducted by the New South Wales government identified Parramatta as the natural second CBD of Sydney, but we have not delivered the economic and social infrastructure that the city needs in order to thrive and flourish in that capacity. I will continue to be an advocate for those causes</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will also be an advocate for causes such as the University of Western Sydney, which is opening a new campus at Rydalmere, and for the heroic work of people such as Dr John Yu, Australian of the Year in 1996, who works at the new Children's Hospital in Westmead and continues to perform miracles daily for the children of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, the single most decisive issue and turning point in the campaign was the issue of youth unemployment. The people of Parramatta rose up with the people of Australia and said that the sustained level of youth unemployment at about 30 per cent was, in fact, unsustainable. They said, `Enough is enough.' They said, `There has to be a better way.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I confess that I went into the campaign with some deep-seated reservations about our approach to the issue of youth unemployment to date. Let me acknowledge that it has been an intractable problem not just for the previous government but for governments on both sides of this House over the years and for governments around the world. It is an issue for which I hope we can establish a degree of bipartisanship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I note that in the first days of World War II Menzies offered to actually form a joint party government. Such was the menace of the external threat facing us as a nation. I suggest that youth unemployment is an issue of such menace and of such fundamental importance to our future as a nation that we ought to be able to establish a degree of bipartisanship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I came into the election with grave concerns about the way in which the issue has been handled to date. I came into it with a fear that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1214"> the direct interventions of government into the labour market had been spectacularly unsuccessful, and I thought we had to find a different solution. I set about to re&hyphen;position the whole discussion about the youth unemployment problem in Parramatta&mdash;not as a government problem that was going to be solved by some nameless, faceless, bureaucrats in Canberra&mdash;and I challenged the local business community to take ownership, to step up to the plate and say, `These are our children; this is our future, and we are not going to wait around like a group of mendicants with our hands out in the expectation that someone else is going to come along with some Messianic ability to solve the problem.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, we launched the Parramatta youth jobs initiative. I acknowledge my debt to the numerous people who responded to the call, even in the context of an election campaign. They did not come to support me personally or to support the Liberal Party; they came because they wanted a fresh approach to the problem of youth unemployment&mdash;the fact that we had 4,000 young people between the ages 16 and 25 in Parramatta who could not find a job. We established a mentoring program where individuals could volunteer to take a young person to help them write a CV, a letter of application, to understand what their skills were, to identify their talents, and to be introduced to employment opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We worked with the 1/15 Royal New South Wales Lancers&mdash;one of Australia's oldest military regiments, which has agreed to provide two days paid training to any young person who is looking for work. We had businesses come forward and say, `Yes, we would like to help in giving young people jobs.' Route 66 spent the last week in my office interviewing 1,000 young people for a new restaurant that they are about to open. I am delighted to say that 100 new jobs for young people will result from that initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concern is that overarching involvement of government in these issues can actually weaken the muscles of self&hyphen;reliance without which none of these problems are going to be solved. That leads to the question of one's personal philosophy: what are the motivating drives that cause one to aspire to occupy a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> seat in this place. Naturally, when one considers such issues, the emblem for me is found in the year 870 and in the person of King Alfred the Great. King Alfred is an emblem of virtually everything I believe in. His first act as king was to collect together all the laws that had been passed by those who preceded him into one document and have them translated into English, undertaking much of the task himself. And, in doing so, he laid a stake in the ground for the principle of the rule of law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His second act was to declare that every member of that community, from the least to the greatest, would be subject to the rule of law, including himself. Then he went out in an act of what I regard as heroism and organised the forces of Wessex and Mercia to resist the onslaught of the Danes when the largest Danish army ever to set foot on England came over in 860. The writing seemed to be on the wall that the English would be destroyed like the Britons before them. But, by combining the two kingdoms, he was able to resist with such ferocity that the Danes were forced to negotiate the Dane law&mdash;which proved to be a line in the sand preserving parliamentary democracy and in my view Western civilisation, without which we might all well be speaking Danish today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He then established the principle that individuals can make a difference; that we are not mere pawns, mere subjects of faceless, inexorable historical laws. I quote Paul Johnson, the eminent historian. On reflecting on Alfred, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He is a demonstration of the fact that one individual with sufficient clarity, single-mindedness, energy and will, can thrust his shoulder against the hinge of history and shift the equipoise and thereby achieve the work of multitudes.</PARA>
<PARA>So we in this House uphold the principle of liberalism which says that individuals can make a difference&mdash;and if one can make a difference, what can 148 of us achieve in this place?  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned my concerns about the overarching reach of government. The statistics in relation to the proportion of the gross domestic product which is consumed by the Commonwealth provide a stark assessment of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1215"> the position. In 1934, at the height of the Depression, Commonwealth consumption of the gross domestic product was 11.1 per cent. By 1955, that figure had doubled. By 1995, the figure was 28.1 per cent. When you add to that the spending by all other levels of government, the figure rises to 37.8 per cent, or $176 billion expended by governments out of the total gross domestic product of $455 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not advocating the abolition of the state. I am not suggesting it has no role, but I am suggesting it has gone too far. I am suggesting that enough is enough. I am suggesting that, when mum and dad out there in Main Street have to go to work all day Monday in the shops and in the factories and come home at the end of the day without having generated the first dollar for themselves and their families, it concerns me. When they have to return on Tuesday morning knowing that they will work all through the day until afternoon tea before they generate their first dollar, I suggest that we are upholding an incredibly powerful disincentive to initiative, enterprise and employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My feelings on the issue of youth unemployment and on the need for self-reliance are influenced by my family's own experience. We came to Australia in 1837 aboard the ship <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Brilliant</EMPHASIS>&mdash;200 Camerons travelling stowage third class. We came as crofters, from the Highlands of Scotland, who had failed to develop the skills which would make them competitive. As the Industrial Revolution swept up in a wave through England, they were smashed against the rocks. They had no basis upon which to resist. Their cottages were burnt down. They were forced onto the boats and flung, as the flotsam and jetsam of the Industrial Revolution, to the four corners of the globe&mdash;to places like Nova Scotia and New South Wales. Australia's gain was Scotland's loss. Nonetheless, I would prefer that we had been coming as a matter of deliberate choice and not as economic refugees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My grandfather&mdash;who was a patriotic Australian; he was in the saddle in Australian uniform at the last charge of the Light Horse at Beersheba&mdash;was a blacksmith. But when he <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> returned to Australia, he found that his skills with the hammer and the anvil were simply not the skills required by the emerging economy as the motor vehicle replaced the horse and sulky. So he drifted around from one clerical position to the next until he, my grandmother and my father, their own child, came to Sydney to occupy a council flat in Concord.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, Mr Speaker, I feel these issues quite intensely, and I refuse to stand by and watch the young people of Parramatta, likewise, become the victims of the third wave as the information revolution sweeps across this country. We must work to equip them with a set of skills which are relevant to the industries which are emerging and not those which are passing away. We must work to keep alive that spark of ownership and self-reliance within the community without which none of our efforts as a government can ever be successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">None of us arrives in this place without the assistance of numerous others who have made a contribution by way of inspiration by example. There are literally hundreds whom I could name, but there are a couple I particularly want to place on the record. I am indebted to the Hon. Neil Pickard; he is a man who has been much maligned but, in my opinion, he is a great Australian. I note, just for example&mdash;and I could cite many&mdash;that when my father had a heart attack, which almost terminated his life and certainly terminated his parliamentary career, Neil got out of bed at 1 o'clock in the morning and drove to the other side of Sydney to be with my family and me. I remain indebted to him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am indebted to people like Bruce Baird, one of the most effective ministers that the New South Wales government has ever produced; he has been a friend and mentor and encourager of young people throughout his public life. I am indebted to my firm, Blake Dawson Waldron, who went above and beyond the call of duty in their support of my political aspirations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I say to the businesses of Australia: I encourage you to seek to identify with the aspirations of your employees. If our party, if our philosophy, ever becomes subject to any <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1216"> sectional or class interest, it will be weakened to that extent. I challenge businesses to get involved in the problem of solving some of these intractable issues we face, and I note that we only give 0.5 of a per cent in philanthropic giving in this country as opposed to something like four times that amount in the so much maligned United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, I am indebted to my family, which is an extraordinary group of people. My sister Margaret is not here today because she is in Uganda running a local high school; she is one of the most inspiring young Australians I have ever met. I am indebted to my mother; she provided the glue which held our family together and, like so many others, did all the work and received none of the credit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am indebted to my father who many, particularly in New South Wales, will know of as a crusader, a campaigner, a person who was prepared to stand up for his convictions&mdash;whether or not they were popular, whether or not they were controversial. But I appreciate some of his more human qualities which tend to get lost in the fray: his respect for his opponents, his courtesy, his genuine liking of people and his belief that a difference of opinion, no matter how violent, ought never to impact on the quality of a personal relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am indebted to my wife, who is the most wonderful companion a man could ever ask for. I suspect there are few members in the chamber whose spouses have expertise in the science of primate evolution; she may well be conducting a mental case study on our progress in that regard at the moment. But she has been a wonderful comfort and support to me in this period of enormous change in my life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, Mr Speaker, I rise with a great sense of honour. I have enjoyed meeting members on both sides of the House. I have enjoyed the maiden speeches and the other contributions. I hope that I may look forward to making a contribution myself over the months and years ahead.</PARA>

<ELECTORATE> (Gellibrand)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(9.52 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I congratulate the member for Parra <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> matta (Mr Ross Cameron) on his very confident and assured first speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The supply bills&mdash;Supply Bill (No. 1), Supply Bill (No. 2) and Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill&mdash;that are now before the House represent the first steps in budgetary provision for the year 1996&hyphen;97. I want to say quite a bit about the budgetary policy for 1996&hyphen;97 and beyond. Before doing so, I emphasise that the economic circumstances in which this budget for next year is being put together are infinitely better than the economic circumstances which the Labor government faced when it came to office in 1983.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of an economy in recession, with double digit unemployment and double digit inflation, we now have an economy experiencing a record period of growth, which has created more jobs in the past three years than the Fraser government created in 7&frac14; years. The now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) bequeathed us an inflation rate of 11.4 per cent when he ceased to be Treasurer. Today, it is 3.7 per cent. He produced an average 50,000 jobs a year in the period that he was Treasurer. Under Labor, it was 160,000 jobs a year. He left 158,000 youth unemployed. Labor has left 88,000&mdash;a point I would particularly draw to the attention of the member for Parramatta.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Treasurer, Mr Howard achieved average economic growth of 2.2 per cent. We achieved average economic growth of 3.7 per cent. Foreign debt increased under Treasurer Howard by 35 per cent per annum. Under Labor, it was half that rate. He handed over a highly regulated, highly protected, uncompetitive, inward looking, dispute ridden, sclerotic economy. He now takes charge of an economy that is substantially deregulated, lowly protected, outward looking and export oriented, very competitive, much more productive, and with far lower levels of industrial disputation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are still things to do&mdash;there always are&mdash;but there is no gainsaying the fact that the Labor government handed over an economy in infinitely better shape than it received 13 years ago. Even with regard to the budget, the outlook is vastly better than that left by the Fraser government in 1983. The revised <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1217"> budget figures&mdash;about which I will have much to say&mdash;released by the new government show a projected budget deficit for next year of one per cent of GDP. That compares to a deficit of just under five per cent of GDP left by Treasurer Howard in 1983. When the government talks about budget black holes, it should be damn thankful it is not left with Howard's humungous hole&mdash;if I can use that colloquial expression.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A great deal has been made of the revised budget estimates by the new government. The former Labor government has been accused of economic mismanagement, failure and deceit. On the basis of the alleged budget hole, a major change to fiscal policy has been announced, involving taking measures to cut the budget by some $4 billion in 1996&hyphen;97 and the same again in 1997&hyphen;98. I want to make a number of points about these new budget figures and the allegations and policy changes that have resulted from them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, I completely repudiate the allegation of deceit. The fact is that the Labor government provided far more information regarding the prospective budget than its predecessor government ever did. Treasurer Howard provided virtually no information at all about the out&hyphen;year budgetary situation. With one notable exception, he only provided information for the current budget year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exception was during the 1983 election when he made up his own figures, even though he later admitted that he had different figures provided to him by Treasury. He confessed after the election that he had been told by Treasury before the election campaign of an $8 billion budget deficit forecast for the next year and that that figure was subsequently revised up to $9 billion a week before the election, and then to $9.6 billion the day before the election. None of those Treasury estimates were ever released before the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was released by the then Treasurer, now Prime Minister, during that election campaign was the figure of $6 billion for the next year's budget deficit, which he later justified, saying it was a personal estimate that he was entitled to produce having been Treasurer for five years.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the light of that disgraceful performance, it is extraordinary that the perpetrator now has the hide to accuse the Labor government of deceit, particularly when that government provided far more information about the budget outlook than he ever did. All of it, I must say, was official estimates; none of it was personal estimates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party brought in three&hyphen;year forward estimates of outlays early in our period in office. We brought in three&hyphen;year forward estimates of revenue and, therefore, of the whole budget outcome, a couple of years ago. We brought in a mid&hyphen;year review of the current year budget. We brought in a fiscal framework which set out at the beginning of the budget preparation process the economic and financial framework in which the budget was produced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite all this information, which no previous government had ever provided, we are accused of deceit because we did not update the out year budget figures when we announced the mid&hyphen;year review of the current budget last December. That was totally consistent with our original decision when we introduced the concept of the mid&hyphen;year review for the current budget year a couple of years ago, which was not to revise the out years in between budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We took that decision, not to hide worthwhile information from the public but because, obviously, unlike the current year, for the out&hyphen;years we did not have any experience of what had happened during the year&mdash;that is only something that was there for the current year. Also, we knew from experience over the previous decade and more that the initial budget starting point, which we obtained at the start of the budget preparation process, always varied considerably, sometimes enormously, through the budget preparation period. It did so because of changes by Treasury and the joint economic forecasting group to the economic forecast, and also because of changes in program parameters. They delivered different outcomes for various reasons from what was expected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thus we concluded that to release the budget starting point figure at the start of that process, or to update the forecast for the out&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1218">years in the mid&hyphen;year review, would be highly likely to mislead the public as to what the actual no policy change outcome would be at the time we finalised the budget for the next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This chronic unreliability of budget starting point numbers well before budget finalisation was acknowledged by the now Prime Minister after the 1983 election when he justified his non&hyphen;release of official estimates for the next year's budget outcome by saying&mdash;and it has been mentioned by others in this House&mdash;that estimates of this kind are notoriously unreliable guides to the ultimate outcome. Of course, that is precisely what we said and that is why we did not release them, and then we were accused of deceit for not doing so!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are now accused of is withholding information, which no government in the whole history of this country has ever released&mdash;with the infamous exception of 1983&mdash;information that would certainly be revised in future months leading up to the finalisation of the budget, and which information we had not sought nor obtained from the bureaucracy because the budget preparation process had not begun. We therefore completely and absolutely reject the allegation of deceit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to the allegation of economic failure and mismanagement. This stems from the revised budget outyear figures which show the headline budget outcome for 1996-97 of $4.9 billion compared with the 1995 budget forecast of a $3.4 billion surplus and an underlying outcome for 1996-97 of a deficit of $7.6 billion compared with the 1995 budget forecast of a deficit of $0.6 billion. In the two subsequent years, the headline deficit goes down to $3.9 billion and the underlying deficit to $3.3 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So why this change in the expected budget outcomes from those outlined in last year's budget? There are two principal reasons. The first is that the coalition in opposition deliberately undermined the budget. They tried to do this in 1993 when they opposed $3 billion worth of budget tightening measures. They were unsuccessful in respect of that. In this current year's budget, they opposed $2&half; billion of budget tightening measures for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1995-96 and $4&half; billion for 1996-97. So they tried to wipe out the projected budget surplus of $3.4 billion for 1996-97 by opposing $4&half; billion worth of measures. So much for the professed concern, hand on the heart, about the need to have a budget surplus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why did the coalition in opposition oppose the measures which at that stage they would have believed would have wiped out the budget surplus anyway? They were successful in blocking $0.3 billion in 1995-96&mdash;which, I might note, is enough to stop a surplus this year on the revised figures&mdash;and they blocked $2.3 billion in 1996-97. Thus, in part, the deterioration in the budget outcome that they are now fulminating about was brought about by their own actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, the major reason for the changed budget outcomes is the change to economic parameters. As noted by the Reserve Bank governor in an address in late March this year, 90 per cent of the change in the underlying budget balance is due to revisions in the economic forecast which come from the December forecasting round by the joint economic forecasting group, which is made up of representatives of Treasury, Finance, PM&amp;C and the Reserve Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what are these changed economic forecasts? In part they reflect reduced real growth of GDP in employment&mdash;real GDP growth is down half a per cent in 1995-96 and 1996-97; employment growth is down a quarter per cent this year and one per cent in 1996-97&mdash;but in part they also reflect reduced inflation. The real gross non-farm product deflator, which is for the non-farm economy the complete inflation indicator, is down a quarter per cent in 1995-96 and three&hyphen;quarters of a per cent in 1996-97, from 3&frac14; per cent to 2&half; per cent. Thus the nominal level of GDP in 1996-97 has been lowered significantly by a combination of lower growth and lower inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Treasury notes in the 12 March release of the revised budget figures, the level of nominal GDP for 1996-97 is now expected to be 2&frac34; per cent less than was projected at budget time and, for each one per cent fall in nominal GDP, revenue declines by $1&half; billion. So revenue was down in 1996-97 by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1219"> some $4&half; billion due to reduced real growth and reduced inflation. With lower growth, outlays are also increased, especially for increased expenditure on unemployment benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two key questions arise from all of this. The first one is: is reduced economic growth and inflation evidence of economic failure and mismanagement by the previous government? I must say it is a curious development indeed when lower inflation is said to be evidence of economic failure. It is what we were trying to achieve. In fact, the mark of the economic success of the previous government was that we achieved a substantial and enduring recovery with low inflation. The fact that inflation in 1996-97 is now forecast to be less than we previously forecast is clearly not a bad thing&mdash;well, at least I would have thought so. To argue the opposite is to take a complete <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alice in Wonderland</EMPHASIS> approach to economics. That is what the current government is saying. It is saying that lower inflation, because it reduces the expected budget outcome, is evidence of economic mismanagement and economic failure and therefore requires major budget cuts. This is just fairyland economics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to reduced growth, that is clearly what we do not want to see. Australia's performance on growth is still very good. We have had a record four and a half years of continuous economic growth. Our current, albeit reduced, rate of economic growth is still expected to be the highest for all the major OECD countries this year. To be bottoming out in the business cycle with a growth rate which still has us top in the growth league for comparable countries is hardly evidence of economic failure or economic mismanagement. The resultant revised budget deficit is hardly massive by the standards of other countries. In fact, at one per cent of GDP, it is almost the lowest budget deficit in the major OECD countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second key question that arises from these reduced economic parameters is whether this warrants the government's response of $8 billion of budget tightening measures. I would argue emphatically that it does not. The government's response is utterly illogical because it is a structural response to an essentially <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cyclical problem or phenomenon. The changed budget outcome for the outyears does not represent a structural deterioration caused by wild government spending or programs running out of control; rather, apart from the damage caused by the coalition's own actions in opposition, it is overwhelmingly a cyclical phenomenon due to lower growth and inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What if the cyclical change had been greater? Let us assume inflation had been one per cent lower in 1996-97. What would that have meant? On the government's approach it would have meant that we would have been a couple of billion dollars further down in the budget position; therefore, it would have required a couple of billion dollars more of expenditure cuts because we had a lower rate of inflation. What if the economy had collapsed? What if we had a recession like Treasurer Howard left us with&mdash;a budget deficit of five per cent of GDP, which would leave a budget hole of $28 billion? Would we require cuts of $28 billion in those circumstances? Clearly, on the government's logic we would since that would be the size of the black hole you would have to fill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such action would be utterly perverse. It would undoubtedly have major counterproductive effects on the economy as well as horrendous social effects. Indeed, even with the $8 billion cuts, this is likely to be so. This is because government cuts of $8 billion will of themselves have a contractionary effect on the economy. It represents a withdrawal of the three&hyphen;quarters of a per cent of GDP in each year. Of course, it is argued that will be counteracted by a boost to confidence, especially business confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But business and consumer confidence is already high. The December capital expenditure survey showed business expectations for capital spending for the first half of this year to be quite strong and for 1996&hyphen;97 to be 27 per cent higher than the corresponding expectation for 1995&hyphen;96. Of course, that was all before the change of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In such circumstances, it is hard to envisage that business confidence could be greatly increased and that that could lead to an additional splurge of business investment. So <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1220"> we have the certainty of lost public sector demand versus the possibility of some offset in private sector demand. Already private sector forecasters like Westpac are saying that this will result in reduced growth of half a per cent in 1996&hyphen;97 and 1997&hyphen;98. With reduced growth it follows that much of the apparent gain to the budget from the budget measures will be lost in the net contractionary effect on the economy. So what we gain on the one hand from the budget measures will be, at least in part, offset by the lower growth that will occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, on the face of a cyclical rather than a structural deterioration, we should work on improving the cyclical outcomes; that is, try to increase growth, not inflation. There are good prospects of this anyway. The Governor of the Reserve Bank has publicly stated that his hunch is that GDP growth in 1996&hyphen;97 will be a bit stronger than the current official forecast of 3&frac14; per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the revised budget figures were announced, the release of the December quarter national accounts showed GDP growth of 0.5 per cent. That compared with the JEFG, Joint Economic Forecasting Group, forecast for the December quarter of 0.2 per cent&mdash;0.5 per cent against the forecast on which the budget figuring was made of 0.2 per cent. Already we see that those numbers are out of date and it could well be that following the Joint Economic Forecasting Group round, which would follow those December national accounts figures, we will have additional estimates which the government has not released.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last three years the Labor government achieved real growth of GDP averaging four per cent per annum, despite a severe drought, low commodity prices and our major trading partner, Japan, being in almost continual recession all through that period. With the drought broken, commodity prices rising and Japan back in a growth mode, if the new government could just match Labor's performance and get four per cent per annum growth over the next three years, the supposed budget hole would basically disappear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also necessary in any budget round to run a tight ship, to look for and make sensible <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> savings and, unless the economy needs a boost, not to take decisions that structurally deteriorate the budget. But that is not what the coalition did in the election campaign. As has been said, they made promises with offsets which did not stand up and we have found a $4 billion hole in respect of those offsets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that the government will not release the finance costings of their funding measures is a clear indication of their unwillingness to reveal the extent of the fiscal hole that they have dug themselves into. Of course, that is a structural hole. So if, as the Prime Minister maintained in the election campaign, they keep their election spending promises regardless of the deficit much of the $8 billion will be required to offset the hole that they themselves have created.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is hard to conclude other than that the $8 billion of budget cutting measures that this government is planning to introduce are essentially based on ideology rather than economics. This government wants, for ideological reasons, to implement much of its Fightback public expenditure cutting agenda under the cover of a supposed budget black hole and, for the reasons that I have given in this speech, we do not accept that it has such cover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The slashing and burning of the public sector, the thousands of sackings, the decimation of Canberra, the wholesale scrapping of labour market programs, the vandalising&mdash;or `Vanstone&hyphen;ing'&mdash;of the higher education system, the damage to our export drive and our relations with Asian countries and the hurt and pain they will inflict on many people will all be their responsibility, not that of the former government.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1221">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The seat of Paterson is, beyond doubt, one of the most diverse electorates in this country. In its original form the seat was named in honour of Colonel William Paterson, soldier, explorer and Lieutenant Governor of New South Wales in 1809. But, with the re&hyphen;creation of the seat in 1992, Paterson was appropriately named after the great balladist, Banjo Paterson, a person who regularly wrote of the spirit of a young Australia. Like my forebears, I have continued the coalition tradition that was but briefly lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Allen Fairhall, a senior minister throughout the Menzies era, held the seat for eight consecutive elections between 1949 and 1969. The late Frank O'Keefe then sustained the coalition stranglehold until Paterson was dissolved in 1984. Bruce Cowan, the former longstanding member for Lyne, similarly represented for many years a great portion of what Paterson geographically represents today. The work and contribution of all three of these gentlemen are held in the highest regard by both sides of this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No&hyphen;one could better describe the area than did the poet Dorothea Mackellar when, in 1908, she penned the poem <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">My Country</EMPHASIS> as she sat on the verandas of the historic property of Torryburn between Vacy and Gresford in the heart of the Paterson electorate. The poem was inspired by the breaking of a long drought of that time. I would like to read a few selected lines from that poem, lines which all school children throughout Australia have committed to their hearts and minds:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I love a sunburnt country,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A land of sweeping plains,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of rugged mountain ranges,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of droughts and flooding rains.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I love her far horizons,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I love her jewel&hyphen;sea,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Her beauty and her terror&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The wide brown land for me!</PARA>
<PARA>The language that Mackellar speaks is apt in its description of Paterson. `Of rugged mountain ranges' speaks of the Mount Royal Ranges, which include the magnificent Barrington Tops. These rise in splendour and possess pockets of subtropical rainforest. The Paterson and Allyn valleys are prime dairy <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and beef country and their majestic geography undulates mile after mile.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The jewel&hyphen;seas are the Pacific Ocean and pristine waterways of Port Stephens and the Myall Lakes. These unreplicated waterways meet Nelson Bay and the villages of Hawks Nest and Seal Rocks, where time seems to tick by just that bit slower. `And flooding rains'&mdash;the historic footage of yesteryear can only jolt the memories of the mass flooding of the Hunter in 1955 which engulfed so much of the electorate, yet drew forth the true spirit of Australia so revered in our culture. This was her heart and this was her country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like Dorothea Mackellar, I too have developed a love for the area, its people and what it offers. As I stand proudly, surrounded by this new government, a worthy opposition, the legislators of Australia's future, I am led to comment on the responsibility and focus we face together. Labor has run its platform of equal opportunity in the workplace and in particular in this parliament, of trying to establish safeguards that minimise poverty, of attempting to promote a system of medical care for all Australians and of sustaining a welfare system that protects the needy and the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the canvas, Labor had painted the big picture for our nation. It had attempted to reignite Ben Chifley's light on the hill&mdash;a light that never truly caught fire. Unfortunately, the big picture was painted on flimsy brown paper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today everything has a price and, regrettably, a social cost. Once established, society readjusts quickly to a new status quo, creating a feudal system in reverse where an increasing percentage becomes totally dependent on a welfare state that does not do enough in providing incentive for individual productivity. For all Labor's good intentions, we have seen Labor's dream become Paterson's curse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1996 we are currently in a drought of a different kind, one that the flooding rains of 1955 will not fix. Our youth, the very future of this country and our source for optimism, have been failed; yet it is here that this curse has struck, and struck hard at the very social and cultural core. As I move around the electorate I am confronted by the reality of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1222"> young Australians just waiting without direction and, worse still, without hope. They feel deserted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But whom do we blame for this predicament, this sad indictment on our society? We simply cannot single out the Labor Party for this one. We are all to blame; yes, every member in this House&mdash;indeed, every Australian. You may ask why. The answer is simple: because we, and I mean all Australians, have allowed this to happen. That is the real curse that we all face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time has come for real leadership&mdash;leadership that shows direction and hope for all Australians. As Teddy Roosevelt, America's 26th President, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.</PARA>
<PARA>Roosevelt was the can-do leader in American politics. His young nation needed direction; it needed identity. His verve, his patriotism, his passion for the nation he loved excited the American people, instilling in them a sense of pride and promise as the United States entered the 20th century. So now we must do the same in the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have our own can-do leader. I see John Howard as the very hope of Australia. I distinctly remember the former Prime Minister once saying about leadership that all his predecessors just could not cut the mustard with the Placido Domingo of Australian politics. I see leadership in a far different light, and I am sure many other Australians do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">True leadership is about results&mdash;getting the runs on the board by holding your team together as the last line of defence and delivering the goods in the line of fire. But it is also about taking others with you on an issue that is right. Can-do leadership is about what the Prime Minister delivered in cementing tougher gun laws that span the nation, where the boundaries of states cannot impinge. The term `leadership' will be redefined under a John Howard government, so much so that he will not just be the Placido Domingo of leaders but all three tenors rolled into one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sensible, responsible government is not about intruding into community life but about <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> providing the framework for individuals to achieve their maximum potential in life, yet still maintaining the support mechanism for those who genuinely need support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unemployment is a major problem in Paterson. Unemployment, at the current rate of 11.2 per cent in the Hunter, continues the tragic and historic trend in our area of being well above the national average. Even more concerning is the sad indictment that we have some 30 per cent of our local youth wanting work; they are presently jobless. If those youth figures seem high and are the subject of embarrassment to the former government, then what should be considered is that the figure for youth unemployment would be much higher if we did not have one of the highest incidences of young people leaving home and heading to Newcastle or Sydney to find work. Through Labor's failed policies we have lost generations of people who will never, never return to the farm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government's programs of Priority One and Working Nation have failed our youth. Remember the classic line&mdash;with tear in the eye and hand on the heart&mdash;that no child will live in poverty by 1990. Six years on, for all Labor's intended good, Labor's dream has become Paterson's curse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Paterson's curse is often known by another name: Salvation Jane&mdash;a strain prevalent in the drier lands and used by stock in drought. So out of the dry well of ideas of Labor, what can I offer as solutions to the people of Paterson? One of the chief mantras repeated over and over is the need to get our small business sector in Australia back into business. The issue resonates with people because the concept is so easy to understand&mdash;it is logical and it is right. Small business has long held regional and provincial Australia together. Without invigorating the small business sector right across Paterson, no new jobs will be created and existing jobs will be lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election campaign, at a meeting of small business proprietors at Raymond Terrace, the member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) and I said that we would be a government committed to listening to the people. That is why in just over a month's time I am holding a small business and jobs summit in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1223"> electorate, briefing local business on our reforms but, more importantly, listening to their concerns and what they need to get jobs back on track in our electorate. That is what it is all about: motivating small business to get people back into work. This is a two-way deal and, yes, it is a worthy partnership in the future of our nation. Small business will not change unless a decade of government neglect and abuse is overturned in the Hunter. The record closure of small businesses in Paterson destroyed confidence and brought a community to its knees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On terra firma there was also a similar scenario unfolding. I seek to remind the members of this House of the promises of the previous government, who said in 1990 they would deliver a $1 billion package to make over the Pacific Highway. The member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who unfortunately is not with us in the chamber at the moment, sought when Minister for Transport to upgrade the highway's chief black spots, including the death trap of O'Sullivans Gap. Yet, for all his talk in promising new bitumen, he could not even deliver a bulldozer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government thought so little of the people who used this road. But we have listened. The coalition has committed funding of $386 million to build a new highway from Bulahdelah to Coolongolook and then on to Possums Brush&mdash;not a simple patch&hyphen;up job but a new highway. And we will deliver, and we will help prevent horrendous accidents like the ones that have claimed over 600 lives since 1987&mdash;the equivalent of more than one life per week on Highway No. 1&mdash;as well as an untold number of serious accidents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The timber industry is a critical economic lifeline for many local communities within Paterson. Just as the local people are passionate about their work, so too are outsiders equally passionate about restricting their future evolution. Encouraging such emotions to come to the boil is no way to solve the industry's future or its problems. What I say is it is time to stop playing politics and start putting practical initiatives into place to maintain a sustainable timber industry. If the Australian ethos of a fair go is observed, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> timber workers will now be at the top of the queue to receive their fair share.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It saddens me to see the environmental vandalism that occurs from the burning of waste timber that could be used as woodchips to help small towns and our national debt&mdash;all because previous governments would not listen to the very people who knew the industry, people like Royce Dawney at Bulahdelah and Mark Scifleet at Gloucester, people who are from generations of loggers, people who have timber in their blood and in a responsible fashion make it their livelihood. I am personally committed to working with the local timber industry and achieving a win-win situation for all sides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The implied threat or otherwise of Newcastle disease and avian flu re-entering, however inadvertently, our country could have an enormous impact on both the chicken trade and the local environment. Within Paterson, chicken farming outranks all comers&mdash;dairy production and cattle included&mdash;as our biggest rural income earner. In light of the recommendation by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to lift the import ban on cooked chicken, I have to say I am saddling up with my local chicken growers to challenge this view. Disease knows no barriers of state borders or livestock crossings. As we seek to establish ourselves as the food bowl to Asia and increasingly the wider Western world, I owe it to my rural producers, their work force and their families that our primary industry sector sustains the premium price in the market place for the produce which disease&hyphen;free food carries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Sir Allen Fairhall, the first member for Paterson, gave his inaugural address in 1950, he spoke of the honour of representing some of Australia's most rich and fertile lands&mdash;and pay dirt. However, he made it clear there was also a heavy toll to be paid. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . soil erosion is taking its toll . . . The rivers are silting up, and can no longer drain off all the water that falls in the catchment area . . . At present there is much wasted effort in our attempts to cope with erosion, the rabbit pest, failing soil fertility and the decaying mineral content of the soil. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1224"> </PARA>
<PARA>The burden we threaten to leave our children and our children's children if we continue to not so much neglect but pass up an opportunity to revitalise, clean up and adequately resource our local environment will be a great one. The price paid will be our nation's loss. This government's historic commitment to the environment through a $1 billion Natural Heritage Trust is, I know, well supported across the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Listening to the thankyous and the extending of gratitude can be onerous on the ear, but it is pleasurable to my soul. Without the fantastic support and love of my wife, confidante and best friend, Cynthia, and my forgiving very young children, David, Robbie and Samantha, who are here in the gallery today, the flame of desire to succeed would have been quickly doused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And one should never forget one's mum. My mum, Betty Baldwin, is the very person who instilled in me the care and love for family, for others and of country. My late father, David Baldwin, would be immensely proud at my achievement, but as a foundry worker and former Labor voter he would surely turn in his grave at what Labor has done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thanks go to Mike Warczak, my sailing buddy and the very person who introduced me to politics and ensured that, when I got angry about something, I got up and did something about it; my political mentor and friend Senator John Tierney and his media junkie, Graham Hallett&mdash;they helped put me on the path to victory; my state colleague and friend Peter Blackmore, who I know is listening in state parliament at the moment&mdash;he literally holds the right to what grassroots campaigning is all about; my friend and state colleague Patricia Forsythe MLC, who gave me the confidence and encouragement to stand, Chris Hartcher MLA and John Jobling MLC who put in so many hard yards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thanks also go to the campaigning team, which was headed by Richard Filewood and footed by upwards of one per cent of the actual electorate in manning the 84 booths on the day&mdash;their reward was victory itself; my treasurer, tower of wisdom and adopted uncle, Ian Paul, and his wife, Dorothy, who knew I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was worth investing time in; Daryl Lewis, a true National with a liberal heart the size of Paterson; my guiding light Mike Breen; and my personal team of Tony McCormack, Malcolm McPhan, Colleen Essex, Robert Frost, Ross Cadell, Ben Howell, Dawn Anderson, Bunny Almond, Phoeme Wallace, Fran Dawson OAM, Beryl and John Purdy and Greg Hansen, Peter Hulsing, Wilf Smith, and not forgetting our wise but not so old regional president, Arch Humphrey. All were spokes in the wheel. All came to the fore when it was time to be counted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To our State President, Bill Heffernan, State Director, Tony Nutt, and John Burston and his dynamic team at party headquarters: their never say die attitude when Labor let loose with both barrels pushed my campaign to the finish. To John Howard, Tim Fischer and Federal Director, Andrew Robb: united they stood and united they succeeded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my supporters from the previous campaign in the seat of Dobell in 1993 who continued on&mdash;Ron Moss, Betty Talarico, Phil and Colleen Walker, Paula Allan, Brenton and Nanette Pavier, and Don Frasca&mdash;I owe you all a great deal of gratitude for originally dipping my feet into the political well. But most importantly to my friends, colleagues and supporters from both the National and Liberal parties&mdash;the coalition family was never tighter and hence the victory forever sweeter in Paterson on 2 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, at the end of the day if I can be remembered for one contribution to this House I would want it to be that I was part of the team that helped turn the ship around; to steer a new course towards the nation's salvation. Ultimately, however, I have been sent to do a job, and it is a job that I will undertake with pride. I am here and I will continue to speak out for Paterson. Thank you.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to begin by congratulating the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) on his fluent speech and also on his sense of humour. I would like to talk about the Supply Bills and use that as an opportunity for talking about the strategy which the government is putting forward. It is an extra <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1225"> ordinary strategy, as the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) has shown so eloquently a few minutes ago. One of the most important things he showed is that the strategy is based on a serious misunderstanding about the nature of what is going on in Australia at present. As he showed vividly, the increase in the claimed deficit is due very much to the reduction in the rate of inflation. A reduction in the rate of inflation is what everyone in Australia wants, but its effect is to reduce the rate of growth of nominal national income, and therefore to reduce the rate of increase of revenue and so to increase the size of the deficit. That is a cyclical problem, as he said, not a structural problem. It is entirely inappropriate for that cause to be the justification for a structural response of the seriously damaging and destructive kind that is being proposed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One very simple arithmetical way of showing the misunderstanding that the new Treasurer (Mr Costello) seems to have is to look at the figures. He is saying that in 1996-97 there will be one per cent less growth in GDP, about $5 billion. Yet he is saying at the same time that that reduction in GDP of $5 billion will lead to an increase in the budget deficit of $6 billion. So we have the extraordinary estimate that a $5 billion reduction in national income will lead to a $6 billion increase in the budget deficit, making the government worse off and the people of Australia $1 billion better off. That does not make sense. The figures are wrong and hollow. They need to be redone. The assertions about a so-called Beazley black hole are hollow. They are simply assertions, and no more. They are based on hollow economics and hollow arithmetic without any foundation. Simply to go on asserting them is no argument at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The figures are sloppy. They are `severely rubbery', as an earlier Liberal Treasurer said in the late 1970s, or I think it may have been 1982&mdash;in the Fraser government years. There is no crisis. It is important for the Australian people to understand this. Australia has one of the lowest deficits at present and, even if the government's estimates were correct, it would still have one of the lowest budget deficits amongst the advanced countries of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> OECD. Even if we accepted their figure it would be the second or third lowest in the whole advanced country league table. As well as that, Australia's outlays and revenue collections as a proportion of GDP are the lowest in the OECD area, amongst Western advanced countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have been arguing in this place now for some years, we have one of the lowest public debts. Depending on how you estimate it, we have the fourth lowest or the second lowest debt, whether gross debt or net debt. It is clear that we do not have a problem of government debt. The issue of overseas debt is different, but overseas debt is principally private sector debt; it is not government debt. But in terms of our national debt, the debt of the government to the Australian people, we have the second or the fourth lowest amongst all advanced countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So on every count there is no crisis. Yet we are being presented with figures as if they were the basis for demonstrating a crisis and then we are told that they justify these terrible cuts. But not only do they not justify them&mdash;I will come to the cost of them in a minute&mdash;they are also counterproductive, they are perverse. More cuts will further slow down the rate of economic activity. They will have a contractionary impact on the Australian economy, and that will cause higher unemployment. A thoroughly sound estimate of that is that the rate of growth will slow down by about half a per cent a year in each of the next two years if the cuts are made, as has been discussed. That would reduce employment by about 40,000 in each of those years. So at the end of the two&hyphen;year period we would be 80,000 jobs worse off. That is perverse. It is a serious misjudgment. What we should be looking for are policies that will increase the rate of economic growth. That is the challenge that the member for Gellibrand threw out this morning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why not aim for a four per cent rate of economic growth so that we will speed up the rate of employment creation? That strategy would, of itself, obliterate the budget deficit within a couple of years. What we should also be aiming for at present&mdash;which the government seems resistant to accepting&mdash;is a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1226"> reduction in interest rates. The inflation rate is falling and interest rates are being reduced overseas. We should be reducing our interest rates so as to stimulate private sector economic activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The preconditions for it are there. If they had not thrown away the accord, we would have had that reduction in interest rates already. But even without that incomes policy instrument, we do have the capacity now to responsibly reduce interest rates. The Reserve Bank should be doing that and the government should be recommending it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the real tragedies of the strategy that the government is putting forward is that it seems to have abandoned the goal of full employment. Nowhere in the Governor&hyphen;General's speech was there a clear commitment to full employment. The government talked in very general terms about wanting growth in employment&mdash;and I do not doubt that it does&mdash;but it does not seem to be committed to the goal of full employment any longer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Certainly the Treasurer is mocking even the goal of five per cent unemployment by the year 2000. He was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> shortly after the election as saying that was always a fantasy and that there was no way it is possible, in effect. That is simply not true. It would have been possible and, by criticising that goal, he is demonstrating that the government is no longer even seeking that goal. That is a tragedy for the Australian people and a particular tragedy for those people who are going to lose their jobs as a result of the policies that have now been put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are really severe costs resulting from these proposed cuts, and it seems that the government is quite lacking in comprehension about the costs of what it is proposing. There seems to be an incomprehension about the importance of human services and what they do for the Australian people. What is good government about? Good government&mdash;at least in part&mdash;is about maximising the growth of employment, maximising security and improving and maximising the quality and accessibility of the services the government provides for the people. That is what people <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> want. If a government set out to do those things only, it would be almost guaranteed re&hyphen;election. But what is the government doing? It is undermining each of those goals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To take some very obvious examples, the government is talking about reductions in the allocations to universities and to other post&hyphen;secondary education. That will reduce enrolments, reduce the quality of teaching at universities and TAFEs and undermine the goal of trying to make Australia a clever country. That damages the lifetime employment prospects and opportunities of numbers of Australia's young people. That is a tragedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be reduced work experience and training opportunities if the government goes ahead with the decimation of labour market programs that it is talking about. Those labour market programs are demonstrably effective in increasing the employability of the people who go through them. Not everyone who goes through them gets a job, but the people who do go through them have a better chance of getting a job than those who do not. All the research about the outcomes of those programs demonstrates that quite clearly. To reduce expenditure on those programs is to undermine the employment prospects of the long&hyphen;term unemployed, and that is simply inhumane and irresponsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is talking about making cuts in all sorts of areas of the Public Service in ways that will directly undermine the wellbeing of Australian people. I heard at the weekend that there are major cuts in the provision of public health. Public health is one of the most cost&hyphen;effective areas of health expenditure that you can imagine, because it encourages people to live healthier lives and it deals with major health problems in ways that reduce ill health before it occurs. To cut back on those public health programs is to undermine a demonstrably cost&hyphen;effective area of government expenditure and it will also undermine the health of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is talk of either combining the offices of the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service or cutting back staff in those areas. To cut back staff in those areas would be to reduce the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1227"> quality of service to people who need it at the most vulnerable time of their lives. I went with a constituent to the Social Security office in my electorate just a few days ago. I was very pleased to find that the waiting time was short, that the person behind the counter handled the client effectively and with good knowledge, and that the problem was dealt with quickly. I was impressed with that standard of service but, if staff is cut, that standard of service will be undermined. Again, that will inhumanely reduce the quality of service to the Australian people at the time they need it most.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A particularly damaging consequence of the cuts is that regional offices of many departments will be closed down. I am surprised that the National Party has not protested more about this. We have heard of tax offices being closed, offices of the Family Court being closed and CES and Social Security offices being closed. No doubt there are many others. That really will reduce the standard of service and the accessibility of service in regional Australia. It is true that those offices are sometimes a little more expensive per client than are offices in the capital cities, but that is something that the Labor government was prepared to accept in order to ensure a high quality of accessible service in regional Australia. The new coalition government seems to have neglected people who, one would have imagined, it would want to represent effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many other cuts as well. Cuts which have already been announced are 530 in Health and Family Services, 180 in the Environment Protection Agency and 400 in Customs. We have got the absurd situation of Customs offices closing in ways that will make it much easier for people to try to avoid customs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have people being cut from the Australian National Audit Office which, again, is perverse because that undermines the scrutiny of effectiveness and efficiency within the public sector. This is ideology carried to destructive extremes. It is extraordinary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Department of Industry, Science and Technology is downsizing by 200. Worksafe Australia has been told to cut 80 staff&mdash;again <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> contributing to reducing the effectiveness of work safety programs in ways that will lead to more work injury and, again, greater damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Crime Authority has been told to reduce its staff by 50. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has been told to reduce its staff by 35. The Australian Securities Commission, which is a very important area for ensuring ethical and legal business practice, has been told to reduce its staff by 150, for goodness sake. The Commonwealth Ombudsman has been told to reduce its staff by 48. These are extraordinary misjudgments. It is ideology carried to extremes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the extraordinary things is that this is happening at exactly the time that, overseas, where profits have been downsizing, people have been reconsidering their approach. It has been very striking to read in the last few weeks that people who have been advocating downsizing for the private sector are now reversing and saying that they made misjudgments. A particularly clear example is Stephen Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley and previously the chief forecaster at the Federal Reserve in the US. One of the great advocates of downsizing in the 1980s, he has now said that he was wrong and that this is destructive. There are some very good quotations from what he has said. Recently, he writes, for example:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For years, I have extolled the virtues of America's productivity&hyphen;led recovery. While I think it's safe to say that such a scenario has become the new mantra for US businesses in the 1990s, I must confess that I'm now having second thoughts.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Slash&hyphen;and&hyphen;burn restructuring is not a permanent solution. Tactics of open&hyphen;ended down&hyphen;sizing and real wage compression are ultimately recipes for industrial extinction.</PARA>
<PARA>How right he is or, as he later put it more bluntly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If all you do is cut, then you will eventually be left with nothing, with no market share.</PARA>
<PARA>It is impressive that he has the honesty to admit that he was wrong; but he is saying that downsizing is damaging to companies.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1228">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, it is equally damaging to the private sector because: it reduces morale; it reduces efficiency because people are afraid, insecure and cease to take initiative; and the dynamism of enterprises, whether they be private or public sector, is reduced and people become preoccupied simply with protecting their own patch and not with doing the jobs, let alone advancing the organisations they work for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Downsizing is destructive of the effectiveness of the organisations that are doing it whether they be in the public or private sector. Yet, at exactly the time that such a strategy is being questioned and many US companies are, in fact, reversing their position on it, the coalition government is proclaiming it as the way forward. How extraordinarily misjudged and ignorant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the major plans they are said to be making, although we have not had confirmation of this, is that they are planning to transfer many functions from the Commonwealth to the states and territories. No doubt we will be debating this very much more fully in future when we know details. But it seems very likely that, since this is an idea that has been put forward in the past by Treasury and the Department of Finance and the coalition government seems to be of a mind to accept that kind of advice now, they will do so for exactly the same reasons as Treasury and Finance wanted to do it before, which was to use such a transfer as a cover for further cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very striking that there has been a downward trend in allocations by the Commonwealth to the states and territories during the last 20 years in ways that, personally, I feel have been a mistake. But further transfers of functions to the states and territories would undoubtedly be a cover for further cuts in funding relative to the number of functions to be fulfilled which would be forced on the states and territories. And that, too, would be very damaging to the quality and accessibility of services provided by the states and territories&mdash;which are, after all, the main direct providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most saddening features of this strategy is that it involves the abandonment of political morality. Because, if it is undertaken <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the way that is being talked about, it would mean the abandonment of many of the election promises that the coalition government made. For example, the present Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Reith), during the election campaign, said that the coalition would aim in government to ensure the employment of a fair and appropriate number of young people within the Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet, in the office next to mine, when I was coming into work on Monday, I saw this sign, headed `Public Service Recruitment Testing in the ACT', which says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be no test for 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The next test may</PARA>
<PARA>may&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">be held early 1997.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great privilege to be standing in this chamber as part of the class of 1996&mdash;a large class at that! It is very easy for a lot of us, when we see our name on the ballot paper, to assume that people are solely voting for us as individuals. By the end of a long campaign, when you have knocked on endless doors and you have met what seems to be more people than could possible be enrolled to vote, you start thinking, well they're actually voting for me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After all the sacrifice and sheer hard work of the campaign, I guess it is natural that we indulge ourselves and imagine we are personally responsible for the swings we achieved in individual seats. But I am under no such delusion. Notwithstanding the strong, professional, hard&hyphen;fought local campaign that my campaign team and I put in, I am entirely aware of why I am here and who the people of Forde voted for on 2 March. They voted for a coalition government and they voted for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1229"> John Howard, the member for Bennelong, as Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to place on record my thanks to the Prime Minister and his family for their commitment to the Liberal Party and to the people of Australia, particularly during the campaign. Time and time again, as I doorknocked and spoke with the people of the electorate, I heard expressions of respect, trust and admiration for the member for Bennelong. It is a huge testament to him that, despite the fact that politicians are held in such low regard by many Australians, he has managed to maintain trust with the public over such a long period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a Liberal Party member for over nine years and having stood as a candidate previously, I know that party leadership is crucial. It makes or breaks a campaign. For better or worse, it has become the wave upon which public opinion rides, which is why I know so many of us on this side of the House were delighted when the Labor Party adopted leadership as its campaign theme and slogan, for leadership is purely judged on achievements and outcomes. In that true sense, the Labor Party and its leaders over the past 13 years, particularly the former Prime Minister, failed miserably. They failed the Australian people and they failed the labour movement, as it once used to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a lot of speculation as to why people voted the way they did on 2 March. It is true that many thousands of people voted for change. But I do not believe they voted for change for the sake of change. It has really amazed me how condescending members opposite have been over the past few weeks about the depth of the message sent to them on 2 March. They seem to regard the results as some sort of aberration. They close their eyes to the damage inflicted on so many individual Australians by their years of mismanagement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Forde, the largest swings, some 14 per cent, were achieved in what were traditionally considered Labor heartland areas, like Eagleby, Kingston and Marsden. These suburbs are made up of good, hardworking Australians, blue collar workers, decent Queenslanders. Mr Keating would have described them as true <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> believers. But the fact is they stopped believing in the Labor Party a long time ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What angers me is that members opposite can still stand in this chamber and declare themselves the champions of the battlers. They believe they have some sort of monopoly on working class values. Well, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am proud to be able to stand on this side of the chamber, as other Liberals have before me, and outline my own working class origins.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am one of nine children. I left school at 13 to work in a factory to help support the family when dad took ill. Through hard work and determination, I was able to complete my education later in my working life. Together, my husband, David, and I owned and ran a small business before hitting hard times under the Whitlam government. We also raised eight children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is we have had to work damned hard to achieve what we have and it really riles me when members opposite sit there smugly and say that we are a party that somehow inherited or bought our way into the world. Well, that old class warfare is absolute rubbish and the people of Australia told them so on 2 March. The reason that so many Labor voters found it easy to vote for the coalition is they did not feel they deserted the Labor Party because they knew the Labor Party had actually deserted them a long time ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to place on record my sincere thanks to the people of Forde. My family and I have lived in Forde for the past 18 years. I am honoured and regard it as a great privilege to be representing such a diverse and beautiful electorate. Forde is a fairly new seat, having been formed in 1984. The composition of the electorate changed dramatically in the 1994 redistribution. The boundary changes altered its nature from largely suburban&hyphen;metropolitan to a semi&hyphen;rural one. It stretches over 4,500 square kilometres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such is the diversity of my electorate that it contains Australia's premier tourist theme park, Movieworld, at Coomera; some of the most beautiful and pristine national park areas, in Lamington, Binna Burra and Kooralbyn; the scenic rural towns of Beaudesert, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1230"> Boonah and Rathdowney; and some of the fastest growing residential areas of two of the most rapid growth local governments in Australia, Logan and Gold Coast city councils.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The historic sugarcane town of Beenleigh, with its rum distillery, is now a growing regional centre. It is poised to become well known as the gateway to the Gold Coast, with a multi&hyphen;million dollar transit centre planned this year. Situated halfway between Brisbane and the Gold Coast, Beenleigh is ideally placed to capitalise on the huge growth that is taking place in the Gold Coast corridor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, with rapid growth comes special challenges for the government&mdash;challenges that unfortunately the previous Labor governments, both state and federal, failed to tackle. To the north of Beenleigh, at Loganlea, is the Logan Hospital. Like other public hospitals throughout Australia, patient waiting lists have grown to unreasonable proportions. Waiting times for public dental treatment are simply appalling. It is clear that the previous Labor government failed to match funding levels with the demands on this hospital. It has failed to recognise and plan for the rapid growth of this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This fact was abundantly obvious on a whole range of issues as I met and spoke with local residents in the 12 months leading up to the election.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rapid growth has also brought added difficulties with crime and safety, and added pressure on our police force. An electorate wide survey which I conducted found that crime and safety was the No. 1 concern with over 90 per cent of my residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know many of us in this place remember the time when doors were left unlocked, evening strolls were relaxed and enjoyable and news of violence and murder was rare and shocking. I am not an advocate of the good old days, nor do I have any desire to turn back the clock. But I feel sad that our children and grandchildren do not share the same sense of personal safety that we did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I feel a very deep responsibility that we as the government have to try to stem the tide of rising crime. We cannot allow it to be left in the too&hyphen;hard basket. We must take a long&hyphen;term approach and address the underlying cause of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> crime&mdash;social breakdown. That means restoring the value of the family, giving parents more responsibility for their children and trying to foster and instil a sense of community citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be nothing more lacking in Australia today than a true uniting sense of community. It is a sad indictment of the Labor government's divide and rule mentality that we seem to be missing the true sense of national pride. I believe this is largely due to the fact that we had a Prime Minister who was ashamed of our history and was hell&hyphen;bent on advocating his vision for the future&mdash;a vision which more than half of Australia did not share. Good government, honesty and true pride in a nation will be the foundations for helping mend the social damage done by the Labor government and will go a long way towards uniting our communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems a paradox that the one time I felt the Australian community grow more united was when we shared our grief over the tragedy in Port Arthur. If we could only maintain that sense of communion, of oneness, each day of the year, then individuals might not become so alienated and lost as to commit such massive destruction. If each of us could show the same concern today for all of our fellow Australians as we now extend to the families of those involved in the Port Arthur tragedy, then we could recognise and perhaps help those in our community who are in desperate need of help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to place on record my complete support for the nationwide gun restriction measures that have been agreed to by all states. Further, I am very pleased that the government has indicated that it will closely examine the problems of violence in television and films. I defy anyone to explain the purpose that graphic violence serves. There is little doubt in my mind that this continual diet of violence is contributing to urban crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Forde there are several areas where local residents have experienced what can only be described as urban terrorism. In Eagleby, just to the north&hyphen;east of Beenleigh, youth street gangs have made local residents fearful of even stepping into their own backyards. A few weeks ago a local Eagleby man came into <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1231"> my office bleary-eyed because he had not slept all night. He was sick with worry about the gun shots and the cars speeding up and down his street constantly. This man broke down and cried, and told me how his wife had been forced to leave their home to go and live with her mother because it was not safe to stay there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regrettably, this is not an isolated case. I heard many similar stories from other local residents. This should not be happening in our suburbs, not in suburbs like Eagleby, where the residents are decent hardworking people as well as elderly retired people. Working closely with the new state government to deliver a safer community for all Forde residents, particularly those in Eagleby, is one of my top priorities. Sadly, there has also been an increase in youth crime in rural areas, which for years managed to remain insulated from many of the problems experienced in the city. As regional unemployment has grown and local jobs have become more and more scarce, many local rural children face an uncertain future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Beaudesert, which is just recovering from severe drought and the destruction of one of its oldest commercial buildings by fire, the recent announcement of the closure of the Australian Meat Holdings processing plant comes as a severe blow. This beautiful country town runs the risk of becoming a ghost town unless other industries can be attracted to the area. I want to assure the people of Beaudesert and surrounding areas that I will work very closely with their local government leaders to promote the area and to assist those who are left jobless by the closure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The meatworks and feedlot have been part of the local economy for 44 years and employed up to 600 local residents. Last week's shutdown comes after a protracted industrial dispute&mdash;a dispute which I believe was drawn out due to the attitude of union bosses. I spoke with many local workers during the dispute who wanted to return to work. They did not want to hold out; they just wanted to get on with the job. Sadly, they no longer have a job to get on with. We cannot be sure that if the dispute had not occurred neither would the shutdown, but I am certain that it <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was a consideration when the company had to make a final decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I concur with what others have said in this debate: there is a rightful place for unions as workers' advocates but not as the controlling master of the government and not as blackmailers of employees. It is a travesty that during Labor's term in office the union movement received on average $14 million each year in the form of direct grants. In the decade preceding my election to parliament, I spent a great deal of time working with associations that assist disabled people&mdash;Multicap, the Queensland Spastic Welfare League and, most recently, the Handicapped Association. I can tell you that $14 million each year would have made a huge difference to those people struggling to lead normal lives and to the families who care for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just imagine how many families would have benefited from respite care with $14 million. It would offer welcome relief to the woman who came to see me recently who is caring for her 14&hyphen;year&hyphen;old handicapped son. She receives only one day every five months in respite care. Disabled people&mdash;yet another group ignored by Labor&mdash;disabled youth, the frail and the elderly, and particularly their carers, need more government and community attention. I would like to place on record my utmost respect for the many employees of associations I have worked with, particularly the Handicapped Association, which is now known as the Horizon Foundation. Those employees are making a real difference in the lives of disabled people through offering support and relief for their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have focused a great deal on some of the challenges and particular problems facing the nation and the people of Forde. Forde is also an electorate of growing business opportunities. The small business men and women of our regional and urban centres&mdash;those who are still there&mdash;have weathered the storm of Labor's recession. I want to congratulate the local chambers of commerce for the support and fellowship they have provided to small business operators and the contribution they have made to their local communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can promise you one thing: Paul Keating was wrong. That wasn't as good as it gets. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1232"> Indeed, the best is yet to come, under the Howard government. Already in the first few weeks of parliament the government has begun to deliver on its commitment to small business. The decrease in the provisional tax uplift factor and the establishment of a small business deregulation task force to halve red tape and regulation are solid examples of our understanding of the needs of small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like for one moment to take this opportunity to promote a local industry and to offer to all honourable members of this House a very helpful tip. You could not hope to find a more peaceful, relaxing place to escape to than the Gold Coast hinterland in my electorate&mdash;from the mountain resorts of Binna Burra and O'Reillys in the Lamington National Park, to the five-star luxury of Kooralbyn Resort, through to the many beautiful secluded bed and breakfasts on Tamborine Mountain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tamborine Mountain has a very special charm, with its thriving cottage craft industry. I highly recommend it as a great weekend escape, especially to my many Queensland colleagues. The beautiful and historic rural townships of Rathdowney, Mount Alford and Boonah shire also make lovely sight-seeing day trips. For the more adventurous, you can get wet and wild at the Coomera Waterslide Park of the same name or, as I mentioned earlier, visit our theme park Movie World.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am indeed very privileged to be representing this part of the world. Once again, I thank the voters of Forde for the confidence they showed in me on 2 March. In return, I promise that I will constantly thrive to truly represent their hopes, desires and interests. As I said in my opening remarks, I have no delusions about being here. I was elected on the strength of the leadership of the honourable member for Bennelong, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), and the progressive policies of the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The party organisation is to be especially commended for the thoroughly professional campaign and the tremendous support provided to all candidates. I want to express my very deep gratitude to our Federal Director, Andrew Robb, and my personal thanks to his brilliant deputy, Lynton Crosby&mdash;whom we <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> were very fortunate to have as a state director in Queensland for a time&mdash;and to all the team at the federal secretariat and the many who worked at the campaign headquarters during the five weeks of the campaign. In Queensland, our state director, Jim Barron, and our president, Bob Tucker, have excelled themselves by gaining state government during a federal campaign. As I said earlier, we ran a very tough, grassroots local campaign, and I had a first&hyphen;class team behind me who kept me going for the long 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could not have been more proud of how it all came together on election day. Unfortunately, there is not time today to mention everyone who helped, but I would like to thank a few key people who were absolutely crucial to our victory. I would like to thank my current FEC chairman, Bob Carroll, who was pivotal in ensuring we had the resources necessary to fight a professional campaign; our treasurer and all&hyphen;round good guy, John Wallerstein; and local businessman, Brian Gassman. I want to convey my personal thanks to the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), who was very supportive, and his secretary, Margaret, who was also very helpful, and his FEC chairman, Peter Gallus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to thank those people who have supported me in my other campaigns over the past 15 years, as well as this one, particularly Jan and Allan Waite. As my personal secretary, Jan has also been tremendous over the past few months, together with my electorate officer Sheila Boreland, in helping to establish my office. I would also like to thank the powerhouse of the campaign, right from preselection through to election day&mdash;my eldest daughter, Selma, and her husband, Andrew Schuller. Andrew and Selma not only devised the campaign strategy but made everything happen. Andrew was part of the team in the campaign headquarters in Melbourne, and so many members would know just how helpful he is. I am very grateful that he managed to find the extra energy to help me out on his weekends and after hours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A special thanks must go to all of my children: Selma, 27; Kellie, 26; David, 25; William, 24; Edward, 22; George, 20; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1233"> Johllene, 18; and, Talena, 16&half; going on 17. I am very fortunate to have my eldest and youngest daughters here with me today. Selma works in Canberra and Talena is a student. To all of my children who are sitting by their radios at work today&mdash;and I am proud to say that they all work&mdash;thank you very much. I am standing here today due to their many years of support, understanding, tolerance, respect and, especially, love. I am very proud of these eight very special Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to mention their spouses and girlfriends, who were also a ready&hyphen;made work force. I would like to thank John Smits, Tracey Thornbury, Samantha Jones, and Kristy Keevers. To my four absolutely beautiful grandchildren who provided me with the best relaxation therapy possible&mdash;Jasmine, Nicholas and Caitlyn Smits, and Jillian Schuller&mdash;I say hello.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to thank my loving husband. No-one could wish for a more supportive and loving partner and friend. All through our 29 years of marriage we have shared our lives and our dreams. Our goals have been joint ones, and he has spurred me on on those rare occasions when I felt like giving up. Particularly over the last 12 months, he has kept the home fires burning and has been a constant support to the family. David, this is for you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, may I congratulate all of my colleagues who make up this large and enthusiastic class of 1996. I am sure that, like me, you feel very honoured and humble to be part of such a historic victory for our party. We must all continue to share the drive and determination personified by our Prime Minister and to carry through on the responsibility and the trust that are placed in us&mdash;to deliver fair and responsible government for all Australians, and for all of us. </PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1845 Benjamin Disraeli said, `A conservative government is an organised hypocrisy.' In the weeks since the federal election, it has become clear that this government will prove no different. There has been much talk about mandates. Whatever one's position is on the issue of mandates, it is clear that the coalition government's election was based, in part, on the assurances that were given about what would not happen if it achieved office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, on the second day of the campaign, the then Leader of the Opposition, the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard), issued an extraordinary list of things that a coalition government would not do. This set the tone for the whole campaign. On every major issue the coalition made soothing statements that this or that would not be changed. But what has happened?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at some of the major areas: first of all, industrial relations. During the campaign there was plenty of rhetoric about no-one being forced off awards and no worker being worse off and no big bang in industrial relations. But what has happened? The government proposes to introduce workplace agreements that will take precedence over award conditions. For example, in Victoria&mdash;where thousands of people fled Jeff Kennett's so-called reforms&mdash;people will lose the protection of a federal award. All that they will be left with is a workplace agreement that meets a handful of minimum standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industrial Relations Commission, which during the campaign the Australian community was assured would not be gutted, will have its jurisdiction limited to these handful of minimum standards. The hallmark of the new system will be the potential domination, under a cloak of secrecy, of individual employees by employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This potential is as old as capitalism itself; it is the reason why trade unions were formed in the first place. This government would do well to reflect on the Westminster tradition&mdash;that right&hyphen;wing governments since that of William Pitt the Younger in 1799 have been attempting to use legislation to crush trade unions. And they have all failed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1234">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next area to look at is taxation. During the election campaign the Australian people were exposed to the absolute theatre of the coalition's bullyboy shouting on the television, shouting on the radio, shouting about `no new taxes' and `no increases to existing taxes'. He could not have been more emphatic if he had borrowed George Bush's campaign trail answer about new taxes, `Read my lips'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But after just a few short weeks the credibility of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) is in tatters, hanging by a thread&mdash;the only finance minister in modern history to contend that a tariff is not a tax. The Treasurer has been widely claiming that the government decision in relation to the tariff concession scheme was a reduction of 40 per cent in the impact of a Labor government proposal on business. Businesses are always a special interest group closest to the hearts of coalition governments. But who picks up the difference for the reduction of this burden on business? The consumer; of course, the consumer&mdash;Fightback through the backdoor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to tax avoidance, it would seem that the government is now preparing to keep its `no new taxes' promise at least in one area&mdash;that of trusts. I have grave fears that the government is preparing to prevaricate on the introduction of tough measures to put a stop to the misuse of trusts. On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If need be we will be introducing legislation, but with all these things, its not an easy line to draw and I am now advised its such a difficult line to draw that its going to take a lot of public discussion and we'll engage in that.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the sort of dissembling language once referred to by George Orwell as `falling upon the facts like soft snow, blurring the outlines and covering up all the details'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tone of the statements attributed to the tax commissioner in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> yesterday morning is markedly different to the equivocation of the Treasurer. But it will require political will to bring these changes into being. It seems that it is fine to attempt to sell Telstra and smash the industrial relations system in Australia in this first parliamentary session. But to tighten loopholes exploited by the rich? That takes time. It is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> remarkable how easy it is to pick who the winners are under a coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next area I turn to is higher education. In higher education grand promises were extolled during the campaign that were designed to lull the community into a false sense of security. The Prime Minister said that a coalition government would:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . at least maintain the level of Commonwealth funding to universities both in terms of operating grants and research grants.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, you cannot get clearer than that, can you? According to numerous reports, this promise was laughed off as a joke by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, over dinner with the vice-chancellors. In question time on Monday, the Prime Minister refused to reaffirm his commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been suggestions that the coalition government will slash up to 12 per cent from the higher education budget. A cut of anything like this magnitude will leave the system&mdash;a system that has been incrementally improved since the days of Gough Whitlam&mdash;a ruin. Australia is now looking at nothing short of a headlong return to the days when university education was a privilege to be enjoyed only by the rich few. The Australian electorate did not vote for this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area we can look at is immigration. The coalition election commitments were also quite specific in the area of immigration and ethnic affairs. There was a commitment not to reduce the humanitarian and refugee program. Now it is revealed that there will be a fairly significant reduction. This is an open and direct breach of pre-election commitments. The baseline is to be reduced from 13,000 places to 10,000, with a corresponding cut in the refugee program from 4,000 places to 3,335. In a cabinet submission, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) has outlined the development of a strategy. But what is the strategy for? It is a strategy for hiding this breach of coalition election commitments. This example heightens concern about what the government has planned for other categories of Australia's immigration program.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1235">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's statements on any issue before the election obviously cannot be relied upon. Earlier this week the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) pointed out a whole range of proposed changes in the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs that the government is implementing. They amount to a dismantling of bipartisanship on these issues and are of serious concern, given the coalition's rhetoric before the election. I share the concerns of the member for Denison about the impact of these changes on those who come to Australia from other countries and on the ability of the department to deliver services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area we should be concerned about is the environment. This government was elected on a clear promise to maintain all existing environment programs funded by the Labor government. Of course, this was part of the wider fiction that the coalition, after years of opposition to major environmental initiatives, had suddenly turned out to be greenies at heart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people saw through this fiction, but I daresay others did not. It has now all begun to unravel. On the one hand, the Prime Minister has been suggesting in this House that members of the opposition who voted against the sale of Telstra legislation had no concern for the environment. I have already placed on record my total rejection of this spurious argument. But what do we see from the Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) on the other hand? He is quoted as saying, in reference to the National Heritage Trust Bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We don't want to clog up our own program with bills that are not essential.</PARA>
<PARA>Apart from the remarkable circumstance of the Minister for the Environment suggesting that the environment is not essential, at the same time as they are delaying this bill, the funding of 10 vital programs to the environment is due to expire on 30 June. Where is the commitment to ongoing funds for these programs from this `green' government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The programs in question are not peripheral. They deal with matters as vital as preventing industrial pollution, combating feral pests, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> protecting nature reserves, weed control, feral animal control and so on. What is the justification that is used for squirming out of so many ironclad, rock&hyphen;solid commitments? We get the answer: the underlying deficit. No&hyphen;one, apart from the coalition apparatchiks, believes this to be a real number, certainly not an important number, but I am sure that many people in the electorate are confused by the repeated claims and counter&hyphen;claims. This morning both the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) and the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) have dealt with the budget deficit myth with devastating effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you take away all the rhetoric and look at what academic economists have to say, the coalition's con is exposed for all to see. I refer to a public letter in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 20 May from Professors Fred Argy, Fred Gruen and John Nevile. This letter from these distinguished commentators needs to be quoted often and at length. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Public discussion of the projected $8 billion deficit needs to be put in a better perspective . . . The figure of $8 billion is itself not a firm figure. It is a Treasury forecast assuming no policy changes and a rate of growth of 3.25 per cent . . . The Australian economy is currently running between 1.5 and 2 per cent below its full capacity level. If it were at full capacity that alone would reduce the starting deficit for 1996/7 by about a half.</PARA>
<PARA>The professors conclude with a warning:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is neither necessary nor desirable to seek to reduce discretionary spending by $8 billion over the next two years simply because the economy is forecast to grow more slowly. If the economy is indeed slowing down, such a policy may well slow it down even further and increase unemployment in the short term, while helping neither the fiscal deficit nor the national saving rate.</PARA>
<PARA>Certainly no&hyphen;one voted for higher unemployment, but this is exactly the course on which the government has embarked. Having been elected on a string of commitments that conflict with its basic ideology, the coalition is seeking to manufacture a pretext on which it can escape them and at the same time implement an agenda more in line with its core philosophies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, said in his concession speech, the Liberal and National parties won the election on the promise not to dismantle the major social and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1236"> economic infrastructure built up during Labor's 13 years in office. In the short weeks since 2 March, the real agenda has well and truly begun to show through. It is not a new agenda; it is one to which the coalition parties have been committed in various guises for many years. It is an agenda that was deliberately obscured during the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you examine the government's actions in the weeks since the election, there are two possible conclusions about this government, both of them equally grave for Australia. The first is that this is a government that has an outlook fixed in the 1950s and 1960s and that is acting out of a sense of nostalgia, attempting to change things back for the sake of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second conclusion&mdash;equally, perhaps more, ominous&mdash;is that the government is preparing to conduct an ideological experiment with policies that have been proven failures in the rest of the developed world. The longevity of the Labor government meant that until now Australia has been spared the excesses of ideologically driven free&hyphen;market economic and social policy, often referred to as Reaganomics or Thatcherism. The government has no mandate for these pernicious policies, which have already been discredited overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested in an article which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian </EMPHASIS>last weekend, which reported on what can occur if rampant individualism is allowed to go unchecked. It is under the heading `The Me Society'. It relates the overemphasis in American society on the role of the individual and contends that this has led to a destabilising effect on civic society. According to the author, this individualism has led to a viciously greedy form of capitalism. Not only has the role of the state been weakened by this but churches, charity organisations, sporting clubs and even families suffer because people withdraw from participating in society. The article says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The citizenry seems to be losing its remarkable commitment to civic life, whether it is a matter of joining groups, attending parent teacher association meetings, visiting neighbours, or simply bothering to vote. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>As a consequence of handing over responsibility to the states in the area of welfare, some states are now trying to make their welfare systems as unattractive as possible, thinking that this will push the problem onto another, perhaps more generous, state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this article, Harvard law professor Mary Ann Glendon says that this arises because Americans have come to view their individual rights as absolute in a way which ignores community obligations. This a timely warning for Australia. The article says, `In short, the US is becoming a more selfish society at precisely the time that Australia and other developed nations are becoming more like the US.' We as Australians must retain our sense of community which understands individual rights in the context that we are all Australians together with obligations to each other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I wish to refer to a quote of the great philosopher of liberalism John Stewart Mill, who once wrote, `Not all conservative people are stupid, but all stupid people are conservative.' I remind the House that the Prime Minister is on record as describing himself as the most conservative Liberal leader ever. For the sake of the nation, let us hope that he does not live up to the other side of Mill's equation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am proud to address the House today as the member for Robertson. As I stand in this chamber to deliver my first speech I am very conscious of the honour and responsibility that has been given to me by the people of Robertson. This electorate covers the southern half of the beautiful Central Coast of New South Wales and is based around the city of Gosford, the town centres of Terrigal, Avoca, Kincumber, Woy Woy, Ettalong, Pearl Beach and Patonga, and the rural areas of Somersby, Mangrove Mountain and Spencer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Robertson's southern boundary is the magnificent Hawkesbury River, one of the finest rivers in Australia, if not the world.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1237"> been lucky enough to have the privilege of living on the banks of the Hawkesbury River for the past 20 years: firstly, on Dangar Island and then in the pretty village of Mooney Mooney, which is still my home today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Robertson is an electorate of 787 square miles covering a diverse geographical region. In the south we have the almost uninhibited Brisbane Water National Park, the Dharug National Park, and the river villages of Bar Point, Wobby Beach, Marlow Creek, Cogra Point and Wondabyne. The residents of these areas have no road access and rely solely on boat access to reach their homes. Robertson and the adjoining electorate of Berowra, held by my colleague the Hon. Philip Ruddock, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, have several hundred constituents whose only contact with the outside world is via the Hawkesbury River.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hawkesbury River is indeed one of the most magnificent natural assets of New South Wales which must be protected at all costs. I look forward to the one-third sale of Telstra enabling our government to honour its commitment to the environment with an injection of funds to help regenerate the Nepean&hyphen;Hawkesbury River system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Robertson is an electorate of contrast. It is a rapidly expanding area. It is an electorate of excitement and an electorate of challenge. The Woy Woy peninsula area, covering the towns of Ettalong, Umina and Woy Woy, has one of the highest percentages of older residents and veterans in Australia. It is an area populated by independent hardworking people who have supported themselves and their families all their lives and have asked for little help from others. But now as the years roll on, many of these people need help&mdash;help which they have not received from the Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Affordable nursing home accommodation is at crisis point in the peninsula area. Time and time again, I am approached by distraught family members or carers seeking my assistance when no place can be found on the Central Coast to accommodate an elderly family member. Can you imagine the trauma when a couple have been married for 50 or 60 years and one partner has to be taken away to be cared for in a nursing home, sometimes as <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> far away as Sydney or Newcastle, because affordable care is just not available in the local area? This situation must not be allowed to continue. I can assure the residents of Robertson, particularly those living in the peninsula area, that I will continue to lobby the relevant ministers to address this situation, which has been ignored and neglected under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the 1991 census figures, 22.9 per cent of all residents in Robertson, almost one-quarter, are aged over 60 years and the vast majority of these people live in the Woy Woy peninsula area. Yet under successive Labor governments and Labor members in both state and federal parliaments, this area still suffers from inadequate public transport; poor roads; a lack of public housing; inadequate medical resources; poor job prospects, particularly for young people; businesses and shops that still struggle to survive; and schools that are overcrowded and underresourced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of the peninsula area are fighting back. On 2 March they decided enough is enough and they voted with their feet at the ballot box. Booths that have always been classified as safe Labor showed their anger and frustration at 13 years of neglect. The voters now look to me as part of the Howard coalition government&mdash;as someone who is, and always will be, part of their community&mdash;to offer them hope for their future and their children's futures, something the Labor government has failed to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a tremendous fighting spirit and a sense of belonging in Robertson. We are all part of the Central Coast and we have all come here to give our families a better future. Robertson is now an electorate on the move. We are blessed with a magnificent environment&mdash;one which we must protect at all costs&mdash;with scenery and natural beauty ranked among the best in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have magnificent surfing beaches&mdash;too numerous to mention here&mdash;coastal lagoons, untouched rainforests, wonderful national parks, lush farm land and grazing land in the areas of Somersby and Mangrove Mountain, and river hideaways along the Hawkesbury River&mdash;places where time has stood still. We <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1238"> have the bustling city of Gosford nestled alongside the magnificent Brisbane Water. We have the dozens of costal towns like Terrigal, Avoca, Copacabana, McMasters Beach and Patonga where many of us came for holidays and never left. We have the rapidly expanding areas of Kariong and Kincumber, where every day amongst the sound of the bellbirds there is the sound of the builders' hammers creating yet another Australian dream for another Australian family&mdash;a home of their own in a friendly, happy and safe environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This rapid growth, however, has brought with it many challenges: challenges such as providing adequate schools, hospitals and child-care facilities for the thousands of young families who move to the Central Coast of New South Wales each year seeking a better life for themselves and their children; and challenges such as giving hope to our young people&mdash;hope for jobs and hope for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an opportunity in Robertson to create that future and give these young people the jobs that they so desperately want. Planet Earth 2000 International Garden Festival is that opportunity. In 1994, a team headed by the Hon. Barry Cohen secured the rights to hold the year 2000 International Garden Festival at Mount Penang on the Central Coast of New South Wales. This major international showcase, now named Planet Earth 2000, will run for six months and will complement and enhance the year 2000 Sydney Olympics. A detailed feasibility study is nearing completion and I look forward to briefing the relevant ministers on the exciting details of this study shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already I have had the pleasure to present to many government ministers a preliminary study which indicates that this festival will create over 9,000 full-time jobs and generate many hundreds of millions of dollars in economic activity. I appeal to all government ministers to continue to support Planet Earth 2000 festival proposals, as they will be a springboard for many Australian companies and products into the export markets of Asia and beyond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like at this time to pay tribute to the efforts of the Hon. Barry Cohen to make <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this festival a reality. The former member for Robertson is a man for whom I have great respect and a man who I know has many friends in this place on both sides of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Robertson has grown, so have the pressures of modern life and the expectations on young people to perform and be successful. There is an epidemic sweeping the Central Coast&mdash;an insidious, evil epidemic&mdash;which is claiming far too many young lives. That epidemic is suicide. So far this year, in 16 weeks, 21 Central Coast people have taken their own lives. All but two of these have been men, mostly young men who could not come to terms with the pressures of life. If I achieve nothing else as a member of this government, it is my wish that I will help create an environment of hope and optimism, giving all Australians a sense of pride in themselves, their achievements, and their community. This challenge is one which we must all face together to build a better community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have faced many challenges in my life, and two of those I would like to mention today because those challenges are responsible for me standing in this place as the member for Robertson. The first challenge was to open a road&mdash;not just any road, but the Pacific Highway&mdash;between Sydney and Gosford. In 1991 the Pacific Highway was closed by a landslip, leaving no alternative road other than the F3 freeway. In other words, if the F3 was closed by weather conditions or accidents, which unfortunately are all too regular occurrences on this road, all towns and cities north of the Hawkesbury River were virtually cut off from Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1239"> The New South Wales state government at the time made the decision that the Pacific Highway was a low priority road and the road remained closed. In January 1993, despite being told by most people that you cannot change the mind of a government, I started a petition to reopen the old Pacific Highway. This campaign grew into one of the largest community actions ever seen in New South Wales, with support coming from all sections of the community, including local government, media such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Central Coast Ex press</EMPHASIS> newspaper, and hundreds of other community groups. In all, over 30,000 signatures were collected on a petition which was then presented to the then New South Wales roads minister, the Hon. Wal Murray.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 3 June 1994 I had the privilege, alongside the then New South Wales state ministers, the Hon. Chris Hartcher and the Hon. Bruce Baird, of cutting the ribbon to mark the reopening of the Pacific Highway. The Central Coast of New South Wales had shown it had a voice&mdash;a voice that had to be listened to&mdash;and I had proved to individuals that a person can and will make a difference. At the time of this campaign, I held no public office nor did I represent any particular group. It was just the case of the whole community supporting a campaign for the good of the Central Coast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second and biggest challenge I faced was to win the seat of Robertson for the Liberal Party. Again, I was told by many that it could not be done. It is 26 years since Robertson was last held by a Liberal member. In 1969 the seat was won by the Hon. Barry Cohen, who held the seat until his retirement in 1990, and the Hon. Frank Walker held the seat with a comfortable margin of 5.6 per cent until March this year. After 13 years of Labor government, the electors of Robertson wanted a change. They wanted to be represented by a local&mdash;a local who had a record of taking on challenges and standing up for the Central Coast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They wanted Robertson to be part of a Howard coalition government, and they made sure Robertson was part of this new government. The swing to the Liberal Party in Robertson was an incredible 9.1 per cent. Throughout the campaign, which was a long and hard fought one, I was supported by a small but hardworking team whose support had encouraged me to complete what many people said was an impossible task. The members of all the local branches did a fantastic job and, more than anyone else, can take great delight in and credit for our amazing win when you consider that they have worked year after year for the Liberal Party, having always done well at a federal level but never quite winning.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This time, they showed that we were indeed a team to be reckoned with. Allan Woods, my campaign manager, held this team together and made sure that we delivered a professional and cohesive campaign. Colin and May Margin never doubted my ability to win, and organised hundreds of volunteers on the Woy Woy peninsula to ensure our booths were fully manned. Suzanne Fosbery convinced me to nominate in the first place, and Ray Carter was always available for advice when it was needed most.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bob and Bev Ferrier carried on undaunted throughout our campaign, despite Bob's serious illness. Get well soon, Bob, as we certainly need you back on deck. My good friends Chris Hartcher, the honourable member for Gosford, and Mike Gallagher, now an honourable member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales, both won their seats in parliament against the odds. They were always available at any time of the day or night with their advice, friendship and encouragement, which will always remain special to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon. Philip Ruddock, who is here in the chamber, and dozens of fantastic supporters from the Berowra conference all stuck to the task, and without them my job would have been that much harder. After a win such as the one we experienced in Robertson there is always a long list of wonderful people who rush to congratulate you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every one of the cards and messages are very special to me, but none more so than the visit I received from Mrs Jessie Hurley. Mrs Hurley had baked a cake to celebrate my win. That in itself is not particularly significant, except for the fact that Mrs Hurley was born on 15 June 1890 and will shortly celebrate her 106th birthday. Mrs Hurley still lives in a self-care unit with her daughter at Tarragal Glen Retirement Village and is an inspiration to all who meet her. We have invited the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to her birthday and we would be honoured if he would attend this happy occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to acknowledge the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), who <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1240"> is in the chamber. I look forward to working with him for the good of the central coast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My family and friends supported and encouraged me throughout the campaign, and this has helped me pursue my goals. Many of these people put aside personal political preferences to assist me. My proud parents, Kevin and Hazel Lloyd, taught me to never give up, to always have faith in yourself and to always have commitment to your beliefs and principles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My parents have always led by example, having worked throughout their lives in small business ventures to raise a family and to provide the secure environment in which my brother and I were lucky enough to grow up. I am pleased to inform the House that my parents recently celebrated their golden wedding anniversary, an event which is becoming all too infrequent in these days of family breakdowns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you are the first and only member of your family to be involved in politics and public life, it is at times daunting for your family. Their support has been a great strength to me. My brother, Daryll, his partner, Anne, and their children&mdash;Rodney, Alison, Bradley and Lachlan&mdash;have always supported my projects and campaigns and have always had faith in my ability to succeed for the good of my community. My irrepressible cousin, Daniel Fitzhenry, was always on hand when the pressures of the campaign were weighing me down to lighten my day with a `handy to have' piece of junk or a lengthy verse of Pidgin English, born of his many years in the highlands of New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My sons, Steven and Peter, who have always been my best friends, have grown into two fine young men, of whom I am immensely proud as they now go out into the work force as young adults. I believe they are representative of the vast majority of young Australians who now look forward to the Howard coalition government providing a brighter and more secure future. Both Steven and Peter have shown maturity beyond their years in handling the pressures and responsibilities that go hand in hand with the election of their father to this great place.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My wife, Kerry, who has been at my side for the past 22 years and is in the gallery today, has been a tower of strength as together we have made the long journey from shy teenagers, to young parents struggling to pay the bills, to first home buyers worried whether we can pay the mortgage, to business people just hoping the risks are worth it, to community representatives and now to the greatest honour of all: representing the people of Robertson in this great place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our journey through life has not always been an easy one; but, with Kerry as my partner, it has been exciting and always challenging. This journey has moulded a team, a very strong team, which now stands ready to tackle the challenges that lie ahead in making Robertson and Australia a better place for all of us. Finally, I will close with these words: `Ordinary men can do extraordinary things if but only given the chance.' I thank God and I thank the people of Robertson for giving me that chance.</PARA></SPEECH>

There is no change to the diesel fuel rebate, the maintenance of support for export market development grants, the continued assistance for regional development initiatives at existing levels, the maintenance of the factor F pharmaceutical industry assistance package and the continued 150 per cent tax concession for industrial research and development. Even Labor's commitment to create 600,000 new jobs over the next term found a positive echo in the coalition's promise of 200,000 new jobs in the manufacturing industry. These of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1241"> course were the promises, but they will be broken promises on 20 August.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These supply bills authorise the continuation of supply&mdash;the funds to government&mdash;under current policies; that is, under Labor's policies. Of course, that will not be the case after the budget. We know now, as we suspected during the election campaign, that the coalition has no intention of honouring its promises to maintain our policies. Assistance for industry, in the government's view, is simply business welfare. That is consistent with its ideological view that there is no place for government in the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hear from various sources daily the changes being proposed to schemes such as the development import finance facility, the export market development grants scheme, the Asian infrastructure consortia program and the R&amp;D concession. They all add up to a billion dollars a year in program assistance, which the government is about to cut. Add to this the increased pressures imposed on the manufacturing industry in this country by the appreciating dollar and you realise that it is not the time to cut the assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But of course the government's view is that cutting spending has primacy, no matter what the cost or regardless of the consequences. I will give just two examples of this&mdash;statements that have been made over recent days by ministers on the government side. The Assistant Treasurer, Jim Short, told the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry council dinner last week that the government would be cutting industry programs that are effective and efficient. I can understand changes need to be made if the programs are not effective or are inefficient, but why get rid of the ones that work? Here is a deliberate statement to an industry that that is what the government is going to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) has promised to shorten the period required for anti-dumping complaints but is persisting with a 10 per cent cut to customs staff that will make the promise impossible to deliver. I ask the members of the National Party in particular to reflect on that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen significant growth in Australian manufacturing under Labor's reign. Australian manufacturing has been growing more quickly than almost any other major sector of the economy and since 1992 has grown by 26 per cent compared with economic growth overall of 16&half; per cent. Australia's manufacturing productivity has risen by 16.8 per cent since the end of 1991, and over the last decade manufacturing exports have risen on average by 17 per cent a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That occurred through policies developed by the Labor government. We created the environment and the assistance by which that growth could happen. It will not happen on its own, as our history has shown. We are not saying that programs should not be reviewed. Many of the programs which now face the axe have been reviewed countlessly and have come up trumps. Look at the reports and findings in relation to the export market development grants scheme. These have significant multiplier effects in the economy. Without the scheme we would not have exports. Those opposite profess concern about making the economy more competitive and correcting our balance of payments, yet they are going to cut the very programs that have assisted us in making some important headway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If as a nation we are to get unemployment down, we need to generate economic growth on average at better than four per cent. That we can do it has been shown over the past 4&half; years, as the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) pointed out in an earlier contribution today. What also has been shown is that the constraint on doing better than four per cent economic growth is our balance of payments. The economic strategy that has to be developed, therefore, is one that addresses that constraint essentially by expanding our net exports. Whether it is export growth or competitive import replacement does not matter so long as the strategy is to expand net exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1242"> Labor did much in its term of office to transform our industrial landscape. We took it from a protected, inward focused regime which was focused on producing essentially for a domestic market to one which is now internationally competitive and outward focu sed with significant diversification and already huge growth in export markets, to which I have alluded. But, despite all of that progress, we still have not broken the balance of payments constraint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is agreement on the need to reduce tariff levels, to pursue micro-economic reform, to secure macro-economic stability, to lock in low inflation, to improve productivity and to lift our skills base. Both sides of the House seem to be in agreement about that. There have been essential elements in the progress that we have made, but in themselves they are not enough. Should we leave the shape and performance of Australian industry&mdash;so critical to growth, jobs and regional development&mdash;simply to market forces? Labor's view is that we should not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor in government did increase industry's exposure to competition and to international market forces, but at the same time it recognised that intervention was necessary to assist industries to make the transition to becoming internationally competitive. We supported this transition with a raft of industry plans, assistance programs, reforms to the workplace, training and education infrastructure, and assistance particularly for disadvantaged groups who were affected by the change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Success is going to be based on both competitive relations and ensuring not only that firms are competitive between themselves but also that we develop patterns and networks of collaborative and cooperative relations between firms and institutions. Critical to both the competitive and collaborative relations is information and understanding of the context of the markets in which they operate. It is in that regard that government also has a critical role to play in establishing these cooperative relations and in developing the understanding of context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reforms and programs that Labor in government put in place and its recognition and development of the role of government were based on a recognition of the importance of market forces and also their limitations in making that transition and the risks involved in a complete surrender to them. What really is at stake is whether we actually have a view of how the nation develops and are prepared <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to act upon it or we simply leave it to market forces. The reality is we need a more active industry policy, one which recognises the limits of the free market philosophy, one which actively encourages and supports the manufacturing sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst job opportunities in the manufacturing sector are limited, the sector is central to this economy because of its wealth creating and technological development roles. It is also the essential underpinning of a burgeoning services sector&mdash;the jobs creator. But free market economics does not work perfectly. Individuals and firms do not always act rationally. In some industries few firms compete in oligopolistic markets. Not all of our trading partners and competitors are committed to the same pace of change as us or indeed have caught up to where we are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The so-called free market induced equilibriums do not materialise, as the textbooks and the theorists would have us believe. Knowledge within and about markets is not perfect, as the theorists would have us believe. The doctrine of `factor endowments' has been swamped by the ability of transnationals to pick and choose the location and operations of their businesses. In essence it is no longer a question of what you have naturally; it is what you do with it. We must be in a position where we are prepared to better value add the natural resource base and combine it with our obvious skills base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this regard significant progress has been made under Labor's reign, but there still is much more to do. I am firmly convinced that it will not happen on its own. We have to support industry in the direction of the change we expect them to be part of. It is not good enough simply to urge industry to become more competitive and productive. We have to assist them to become so. Whilst we have worked well to remove the old protective policy regime and open up the economy with impressive results to date, we must do more now to develop the new policy regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1243"> The debate on industry policy in this country has been debased. It has been simplified to a choice between the free market and intervention. My argument is that we need to look at these issues strategically, not polemi cally. In essence, the argument is one about reaching our potential in industries where we know we have strengths due essentially to the combination of our natural resource base and our skills base. The approach will increasingly involve regional applications in the context of national strategies and the accessing of  support programs. The approach must be industry driven, not government driven, so that the market structure and its competition are properly understood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The response itself, as distinct from simply the approach, will invariably involve a partnership between government and industry to match the policy instruments to the circumstances, to achieve a proper balance between a market discipline and, where necessary, structural intervention to achieve the national objectives. It will involve a commitment by industry through targets to expand our traded goods and services to become more productive and competitive, but using the partnership to address the impediments which limit the achievement of those targets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I happen to believe that a successful model in this regard is the approach that the previous government adopted in the agrifood industry, the food processing industry. I hope to have the opportunity in subsequent debates in this House to go into more debate about that approach. With government playing a facilitative role and being prepared to offer support to industry-driven responses committed to targets and to growth, we have seen a huge growth in food processing exports in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a target to achieve $10 billion of exports by the turn of the decade from what was a little over $2 billion just a couple of years ago. Even at $2 billion, the food processing industry in this country was the largest manufacturing employer in the nation, employing about 150,000 people. If we get this strategy right, as all the evidence suggests we will, and expand the exports, it is not just great for our balance of payments; it is terrific for jobs. This is what smart industry policy has to be about&mdash;not the programs that have assisted them to get there being cut from underneath them, because then you lose the leverage. Then you lose the basis upon which <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you get the commitment from industry to expand, to grow and to produce the jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In government we established policies with broad application to many industry sectors, which I will refer to briefly here. I will be using opportunities in other debates to go into some detail about them. We have the export market development grants scheme, the DIFF scheme, the 150 per cent R&amp;D tax concession, the national industry extension service, better access to venture capital because of the changes that we introduced, and the establishment of Ausindustry and Austrade. Many of those programs will be cut by the government in its ideological drive to reduce business welfare to find the bottom line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very mechanisms that have helped our industries grow in this country are going to be stripped away from them. They are not props, they are not handouts. I see members laughing over there. I wonder whether, when they approach manufacturers in their industry, they are prepared to laugh in the same way about the insignificance of these programs when they will get swamped with submissions showing the importance of these programs to their growth. They are not props or handouts. They have been instrumental in improving our traded goods performance. Without them the same progress would not have been made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned examples of those programs that had application across industry sectors, but there are also many examples under us of specific application to certain industries: the partnerships for development program, for example, in the information technology, a huge industry growth sector; the factor F plan in relation to the pharmaceuticals industry; the car plan; the shipbuilding industry&mdash;we saw the gutting of initiatives under the shipbuilding industry in legislation that you introduced yesterday; the coal export levy in relation to the coal industry; the support for the magnesium industry. All of these involve commitments by industry to increase our traded goods and services to invest in R&amp;D and all have delivered, but they have only delivered against the commitment because we were prepared to use the leverage and the initiative of government programs to ensure that they did, to work in partnership with industry to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1244"> achieve the end results. Labor believes that policies like these need not only to be continued, they need also to be built upon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's job in opposition will be to hold the government accountable to the promises they made during the last election, which we are showing increasingly these days were made duplicitously. We will continue to pressure the government to deliver on those promises, those things that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) went on the John Laws program to say, `I would rather make half the promises and deliver all of them than make all the promises and deliver half,' and who also said, `Even if it means the deficit going out, we will deliver all of our promises.' This was his `L&hyphen;a&hyphen;w&hyphen;s' commitment. We have already seen him this week in question time start to walk away from those commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the Prime Minister was elected on a mandate of continuing down Labor's path, he has also very clearly staked his personal reputation on delivering all of the promises. He has said that he wants to be benchmarked. We will make sure that he is benchmarked to deliver better than Labor's 733,000 jobs and slashes the level of youth unemployment below 87,000, as he told the press club. Labor's record has established the benchmarks. We will hold the government accountable against them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this place to make my maiden speech. Although the word `maiden' is no longer politically correct, this is the way most people would describe one's first speech in parliament. According to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Oxford Dictionary</EMPHASIS> , `maiden' is defined in six ways, including the following:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Maiden&mdash;involving the first attempt or occurrence particularly pertaining to MPs.</PARA>
<PARA>To my humble way of thinking, this is not at all sexist. It is just a simple and traditional use of English to embellish what would otherwise be a quite ordinary event. I think a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> maiden speech is a real achievement whereas the description `first speech' is quite mundane&mdash;one must always be aware of the thought police. There are many words that have suffered through what is classed as `politically correct language'. One word that is attacked often is `chairman'. The `man' in the word `chairman' comes from the Latin `manualis' meaning hands. Therefore, the literal translation of `chairman' is `hands on the chair'. It has nothing whatever to do with gender.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Political correctness is just one of the many things that seem to have got out of hand during the previous government's time in office. Education&mdash;and as a consequence jobs&mdash;is another. Young people are being kept at school until year 12 without any real consideration as to their wishes or, for that matter, what the needs of the community are. If young people were given a good general education until year 12, they could then make a decision about their future or their job path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young people should be able to choose their future at year 10 and, if they wish, be encouraged to apply for an apprenticeship or a TAFE course, to enter the work force or continue to year 12. Whatever their decision, we as a government should make it as easy as possible for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The young people who choose to enter the work force would quickly learn the work ethic that a full day's work is required if one is to earn a full day's pay. They would learn that some aspects of their job must be done whether they like it or not. They would also learn that there is a great feeling of self&hyphen;achievement after completing a good day's work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young people who choose to enter an apprenticeship would also learn these skills as well as their trade skills. By the time they reached 18, they would have begun to understand what the real world is about. Unfortunately, the current system has put off too many employers who see it as rigid and complex. As a consequence, too many young people are left unemployed with no prospect of attaining work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the government, we should promote the value of investment in further education and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1245"> training and we should provide assistance for those who wish to access education and training opportunities. We should train people for real, long&hyphen;term jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although actually a state matter, it is obvious that the current indenture system for apprenticeships is far too complex. Large amounts of time spent at college and away from the workplace, plus the inability to move easily among states, has made the system very unattractive to small business. Consequently, many young people are being denied the opportunity of an apprenticeship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young people who choose to stay at school should continue their education with an emphasis still on literacy and numeracy. Towards the end of secondary school, those who wish to go to university could devote 12 months to enable them to complete a university entrance exam. Those wishing to study for a diploma course could spend that same time preparing for the course. This way we would cease trying to turn everyone into a university graduate and give young people a chance to realise their potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most people are aware of their aptitude. I know I could never have been a brain surgeon or a physicist, no matter how hard I studied. I think today's young people also know what they are capable of achieving. At present our education system is not giving them those choices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My interest in education issues comes from my background in teaching. I became a teacher through a strong desire to help people make the best of opportunities. This strong desire lasted through the raising of two daughters and spending 15 years travelling around country Queensland. My ambition was finally fulfilled at the age of 34 when, on coming to Brisbane to live, I had the opportunity to attend teachers training college.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the last 22 years, which have been spent in the Brisbane electorate of Lilley, we have lived where we chose because it is a convenient location. The electorate of Lilley is in the north&hyphen;eastern suburbs of Brisbane. It extends from Breakfast Creek to Brighton.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lilley is a very diverse electorate with a large number of industries which range from <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Brisbane's domestic and international airports to sea cargo facilities, chemical production, light and heavy engineering, warehousing and tank farms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like most electorates, the demography is constantly changing. With the Australian population so mobile these days, it is not uncommon to live in a street where everyone else originates from a different part of Australia and even the world. It is because of this constant population movement that the infrastructure needs of the electorate are difficult to maintain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Brisbane airport has been at the mouth of the Brisbane River since Kingsford Smith's time. The benefits of Brisbane's domestic and new international airports are their convenient location to the CBD and their accessibility to the main arterial roads that link the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast. Furthermore, both airports directly employ more than 5,000 people, with a further 16,000 related spin&hyphen;off jobs. The annual economic impact of the airport to the region is estimated to be around $2 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the increasing density of population under the flight paths, the noise factor is becoming a matter of concern. The airport environment committee has taken an initiative to minimise the impact of noise by establishing steeper ascent and descent profiles on certain flight paths. This, with the airlines being encouraged to upgrade to more modern and quieter aircraft, will be a help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The local administration of the Federal Airports Corporation is very conscious of the noise problems and monitors them constantly and we as a community have to be vigilant about future development. We must not allow housing to encroach on the buffer zones around the perimeter of the airport. It is vital that we do not become like Sydney airport, and I will fight to ensure that we put people before flight paths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1246"> Another environmental issue in Lilley is the Brisbane City Council's planned toxic waste dump at the mouth of the river. This proposal by the Labor council is an absolute disgrace and has met with massive resistance from the local population. The residents of Pinkenba, the suburb most affected, have formed an act ion group that is lobbying long and hard for the council to change its plans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dump is sited at the mouth of the Brisbane River and will receive toxic waste from all over Brisbane. This will mean that over 60 per cent of toxic and hazardous wastes will have to be transported across the city, much of it through the CBD, to reach the treatment works.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This site is situated close to Boggy Creek which flows into the Brisbane River and, ultimately, into the Moreton Bay Marine Park. The Moreton Bay Marine Park is a fragile breeding ground for prawns, crabs, fish, migratory birds, seagrasses and mangroves. All of these must be protected. Furthermore, because of the hard work of many community groups, the Brisbane River has been cleansed to such a state we are now seeing the return of dolphins to the mouth of the river.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Brisbane City Council has informed the residents of Pinkenba that the area in which the toxic waste dump will be sited will not flood. I now ask those so&hyphen;called `experts' to repeat their guarantees to residents after the last recent heavy rain in Brisbane. I understand Brisbane's need for a new toxic waste dump and, understandably, no&hyphen;one wants it in their backyard. However, I think a little more council consultation and a little less confrontation would make it much easier for a consensus to be reached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contrast to the proposed toxic waste site, a few kilometres north is an area known as the Boondall Wetlands. These wetlands were rescued from developers in 1990. With the hard work of a community based committee, the Boondall Wetlands have been transformed into an area that is the pride of Brisbane City.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Comprising 1,245 hectares, the Boondall Wetlands are the resting and feeding place of migratory birds from as far away as Siberia, China, Japan, Mongolia and Alaska. The Wetlands Reserve Management Committee has also identified evidence of past Aboriginal occupation. The committee has set up a community program designed to help young Aboriginals identify with their origins while <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> encouraging them to pass this knowledge on to the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Besides their cultural, conservation, geological and visual values, the Boondall Wetlands are an extremely valuable resource that enhances Brisbane's overall quality of life and helps maintain Brisbane as Australia's most livable city. The Boondall Wetlands have the potential to become a major regional focus for eco&hyphen;tourism, conservation, environmental education and outdoor family fun and recreation. Therefore, it is no surprise that the Boondall Wetlands were the central focus of the 1996 Ramsar international convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an electorate, Lilley is a great place to work. It is as diverse as it is friendly. It has great community spirit. Each area is very keen to see that the very best is available for its residents. I find this a wonderful atmosphere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A key community group is NOTION, Nundah's Organisation to Improve Our Neighbourhood. NOTION began in 1993 in response to the uncertainty over the development of Sandgate Road. Sandgate Road is one of Brisbane's main arterial roads through the north&hyphen;eastern suburbs. In Nundah there is a section of road known as the bottleneck, and it has been an increasing problem for locals for over 25 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After much community consultation, NOTION came up with the idea of a `cut and cover tunnel' that would bypass the Nundah shopping centre without disturbing the suburb with a busy four&hyphen;lane highway. This would maintain the fabric of the Nundah shopping area, which is one of the oldest in Brisbane. It would also improve the traffic flow and maintain the link among residential areas, schools, shops, public transport and parks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consequences of not addressing the Nundah bottleneck have been devastating for the local community. Accidents and fatalities continue to occur, and traders continue to leave, which affects the social and economic viability of the area. I believe the Nundah road issue should be given urgent attention. But any solution must put the concerns of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1247"> local residents and businesses first, and not be seen solely as a solution of traffic flow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lilley also boasts one of the top five industries in Australia&mdash;the racing industry. At this time of the year, Lilley is the racing capital of Australia with the staging of the prestigious $9 million Brisbane winter racing carnival which is recognised internationally. Tracks in the electorate are Eagle Farm, Doomben, Albion Park, which is now devoted to harness racing and greyhounds, and the training complex at Deagon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Historic Eagle Farm has been more than just a pillar of racing in the state. Heroic aviator Bert Hinkler of Bundaberg landed on the track to a rousing welcome from the citizens of Brisbane in 1928 after being the first pilot to fly from Britain to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first rugby match between Queensland and New South Wales was played at Eagle Farm and I am pleased to say that Queensland won that 11 to 10. The first cricket match between England and Queensland was also played there. Almost 1,000 thoroughbred horses, a big percentage from Queensland owned and operated stud farms, are based there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) for the prompt way in which they have moved to set up the Small Business Deregulation Task Force. There are many thousands of small businesses in Lilley which are very tired of struggling with the regulations and Labor's unfair, job destroying dismissal laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although there appears to be a slight improvement in business confidence, as a government we must continue to encourage the small business community. During the election campaign many small business owners told me they were only staying open because of their duty to their employees. Many told me their employees were taking home more money than the business owners themselves. As a nation, we must stop people feeling guilty about making a profit because making a profit is not wrong. Making a profit is one way to get this country going again.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, I was fortunate to have Senator Jocelyn Newman visit Lilley. It was great to see a minister prepared to visit Lilley and discuss important issues such as domestic violence and social security with the locals. I believe all the people of Lilley will benefit from the Liberal Party's commitment to consult at this grassroots level. I urge all ministers, including the Prime Minister, to come and consult with the talented local organisations and communities in Lilley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As one of the 76 House of Representatives Liberals, I look forward to making a significant contribution in this 38th Parliament to the progress of this wonderful country. A lot has been said about the number of women and what changes we are going to bring to the parliament. I think it is important that we are looked upon as individuals and not as some sort of freaks or super people who are going to sweep all before us. We are human beings with the same strengths and weaknesses as our male colleagues. It should not be an expectation of the community or this parliament that we will succeed or fail because of our gender. We should be judged on how we have worked in our electorate and in the parliament. Dame Enid Lyons, an advocate of strong family values, in her maiden speech in September 1943, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe sincerely that any woman entering the public arena must be prepared to work as men work: she must justify herself not as a woman, but as a citizen; she must attack the same problems and be prepared to shoulder the same burdens.</PARA>
<PARA>All 26 Liberal women in the House of Representatives and the Senate can be confident that they are here on merit and not because of a patronising quota system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to thank the hundreds of people who helped me during the campaign. The Lilley Liberal FEC chairman, Peter Nicholls; campaign director, John Blake; campaign chairman, Bill Gollan; chief fundraiser, Santo Santoro; the state member for Clayfield and now a Queensland minister, Councillor Graham Clay, who organised the 47 polling booths; the state president, Bob Tucker; the state director, Jim Barron; and state vice&hyphen;president, Graham Young, must all be singled out for special mention.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1248">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A big thank you also to the campaign committee and all the branches that worked tirelessly and faithfully. We were able to have over 450 volunteers working on election day, and I thank them all. We were able to open and maintain a campaign office for nine months prior to the election. This was only possible because of one of our strong supporters who volunteered her time, Mrs Anne Reid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My family were also a wonderful support. My two married daughters, Julie Zerk and Margaret Hendry, both live outside Brisbane, but they, with their husbands, David and Ross, and our three grandchildren, Heidi, James and Tom, gave up valuable personal time to come and help their mum and nana over the line. I don't know what I would have done without them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my husband of 36 years, Mervyn, I say thank you. It does not seem enough and yet it says it all. He is my best friend, my supporter and the one who took all the flak. He gave up his own personal life&mdash;except for the occasional golf game&mdash;to support me fully throughout the campaign. It is wonderful to have Mervyn and my 90&hyphen;year&hyphen;old dad, Max Dunstone, sitting in the gallery today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Deputy Speaker, I am very proud to be a member of this parliament. I am very honoured that the people of Lilley have chosen me to represent them. I look forward to working with the coalition for the people of Lilley and Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the member for Lilley (Mrs Elizabeth Grace) on her maiden speech. It is a special time for new members. It does not seem that long since, in 1988, I made mine, just before the member for Groom (Mr Taylor). It was the first maiden speech in this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> In the debate on the Supply Bill (No. 1) 1996&hyphen;97, I would like to examine some of the benefits which the electorate of Port Adelaide has received after 13 years of federal Labor government and in doing so set the standard by which the new coalition government is to be judged. The question that arises is: how many of these benefits will be discontinued by the new coalition government, given its ideological drive to cut billions from govern ment outlays on the basis of the phoney projected budgetary deficit?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 12 months to February this year alone, organisations in my electorate of Port Adelaide received federal government assistance totalling over $25 million for various projects. Labor cared for our war veterans through the provision of extra hostel accommodation. In fact, a soil turning ceremony was conducted by the Governor of South Australia, Dame Roma Mitchell, on 12 May.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor cared for the extension of defence home loans to eligible ex&hyphen;service women and the upgrading of entitlements. Labor cared for young people through the provision of employment and training schemes like LEAP, which were funded under Working Nation, and a new TAFE college in Port Adelaide, funded by Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor cared for local school children with the provision of funding for capital developments, new information technology equipment and increased levels of recurrent funding. Labor cared for health care through the provision of funding to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital and Medicare. Labor cared for the aged and the disabled through funding of home and community care programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor cared for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders through the funding of the arts board and, in the longer term, the passing of the historic Mabo legislation. Labor cared for immigrants through funding of organisations like the Cambodian Australian Association, the Refugee Association, the Indo-Chinese Australian Women's Association, the Macedonian orthodox community, the Overseas Chinese Association, the Serbian community, the Vietnamese community and the Cambodian Association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor cared for people with disabilities and people in need of crisis accommodation through the funding of the Port Adelaide Central Mission, the Salvation Army, SPARK, the Port Youth Accommodation Services and the Western Areas Women's Shelter. Labor cared for the community through funding to local governments for environment and heritage work, such as the redevelopment of Garden Island, the main street program in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1249"> Port Adelaide, new roads and the new ecotourism project at the St Kilda mangroves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question for people in Port Adelaide is just how much of this federal government funding to these and other organisations, which has contributed so much to the development of facilities and the creation of job opportunities in the electorate, will continue. How much of it will be erased by the new government in their ideologically driven cost cutting frenzy? What will be the consequences of the failure to fund these groups and organisations in my electorate of Port Adelaide and the similar groups and organisations in other electorates, including those in the electorate of the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne)?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor left office having presided over the longest period of sustained economic growth since the mid-1950s, with every prospect of that growth continuing. Job growth was strong, interest rates steady and inflation low. In fact, for the information of the member for Sturt, Port Adelaide had the highest drop in unemployment in South Australia, from 16 to 11 per cent in the last 12 months. My electorate had the highest job creation in South Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That's good; that's excellent.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3J4">Mr SAWFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much. Inflation has been low. The level of real household disposable income increased by 40.4 per cent under the five successive Labor governments of 1983 to 1996. Real earnings increased by nearly seven per cent, and the real value of additional payments to low income groups almost doubled. In addition the former government has encouraged more flexible workplace arrangements to assist families, including the issues of equal pay, equal opportunity and parental leave that I hope are dear to you, Madam Deputy Speaker. On economic management, Labor's record has spoken for itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, Labor managed to maintain social cohesion in times of great change. That more than anything was the real measure of the quality of our government. It is that social cohesion which will come under some threat with the new government's individual contracts, job cuts, education cuts, health cuts, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> social security cuts and cuts to community organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Creating more jobs and reducing unemployment was always the Labor government's highest priority. That is why it launched Working Nation, an ambitious jobs and training program. It is sometimes very easy in this place to forget the magnitude of the commitment to that program. It was the biggest attack on unemployment ever undertaken in this country. In its first year Working Nation created over 380,000 jobs, reduced the unemployment rate from nearly 11 to 8.6 per  cent, allowed 375,000 long&hyphen;term unemployed people to receive individual attention and help, ensured a huge boost in the number of Australians gaining skills and training and provided record growth in the number of people starting apprenticeships and traineeships. It delivered, and it also delivered many benefits to the people in my electorate of Port Adelaide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year I attended graduation ceremonies for participants in landcare and environment action programs in Port Adelaide. LEAP gave young people the chance to work and train, while at the same time doing something valuable for the environment. It was interesting at that ceremony that some of the business people involved offered one of the young fellows a job as an apprentice butcher. He is still working there. Another program participant was offered work at an aged care hostel. Even though the program had nothing to do with butchery or aged care, people were impressed with the commitment of these young people who had not had opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirty thousand young people commenced in LEAP nationally over the last three years and Commonwealth funding was approximately $196 million. In all, tens of thousands of young employed people have gained valuable work experience and new skills through Working Nation programs. Those who graduated that day in Port Adelaide received nationally accredited training over 26 weeks in a selection of modules from the certificate in construction, while assisting in the development of the Port Adelaide Art and Cultural Heritage Centre. I know the member for Sturt would have seen that the local press showed <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1250"> that the arts community was developing very strongly in Port Adelaide.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="PYNE" NAMEID="9V5">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V5">Mr Pyne</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very successfully too.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3J4">Mr SAWFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, very successfully. Other LEAP projects were conducted on the Linear Park project at Lockleys and on `the scrub' at West Croydon. The participants in that program built gravel and sawdust paths, replaced fences and restored an old well, as well as gained skills in conservation concepts, micro&hyphen;irrigation and the preparation, planting and maintenance of trees and shrubs. Some of those people are in business on their own and some of them have taken up franchises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The group also restored indigenous plants previously used by Aborigines for food and medicinal purposes, creating an Aboriginal food trail. The area will become a living classroom for children from the Kilkenny Primary School and surrounding schools to learn about the environment and the importance of protecting and preserving it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year a total of $4.4 million was spent on education, employment and training in the Port Adelaide electorate. The resultant new jobs, which contributed to regional development and provided new skills and training, were created by funding from the former Labor government. It was a demonstration of Labor's commitment under Working Nation to provide flexible solutions to improve the employment and training opportunities for unemployed people. I expect that these job and training schemes for young people, unfortunately, may be amongst the first to be slashed by this new government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year the Port Adelaide electorate received $3.8 million for health programs, including funding for the new breast cancer clinic in Arndale which was a most welcome addition and greatly appreciated in the western suburbs of Adelaide. The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, under great trauma from the state Liberal government, has, with the help of federal funding, streamlined its services and is regarded Australia&hyphen;wide and internationally as an example of waiting list management that has the potential to be adopted across the Australian public hospital system. The people involved in running that hospital are to be congratulated for their initiatives. It would be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a disaster for the western suburbs if the Brown government sold the Queen Elizabeth Hospital following its sale of Modbury Hospital and the fire sale of other South Australian assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Medicare is a very popular health program because it is fair and efficient, and it has enormous support in my electorate. In fact, it is so popular that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), for the duration of the campaign at least, reversed his lifelong opposition to it. But I believe the coalition's promise of keeping Medicare will be the first promise broken; it will be kept in name only. GPs in my area are already very concerned. The government can do any of a number of things to dismantle Medicare, such as reducing the rebate to doctors for bulk&hyphen;billing or introducing a co-payment, any of which will be a breach of the election promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dismantling of Medicare will put an extra cost burden on the people of Port Adelaide, especially families. People in Port Adelaide told me before the election that they wanted Medicare to stay, that they wanted bulk&hyphen;billing and that they wanted the current arrangements. They said that some changes could be made, but they tended to elucidate only three&mdash;changes that would improve Medicare, not destroy it. They wanted coverage for extra health services, such as physiotherapy, dental care, podiatry and chiropractic services. They wanted some financial help to make private health cover easier to afford. They wanted shorter waiting lists for elective surgery. We promised to make all three improvements to Medicare if we were re&hyphen;elected. Unfortunately, we can be sure that none of these improvements to Medicare will now be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor recognised that a commitment to our young people, and to this nation's collective future, required the will to fund a significant expansion in the education and training sectors. Labor has a very proud record: a 55 per cent real increase in schools funding and a 79.1 per cent real increase for non&hyphen;government schools, a 56 per cent real increase in the funding of TAFE and other forms of vocational education, a 77 per cent increase in places available at universities, a doubling <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1251"> of the proportion of young people staying at school until year 12 from 36 per cent to 72 per cent, a trebling of the number of young people undertaking non&hyphen;apprenticeship post&hyphen;school vocational training from 27,000 to 78,000, and a decrease in youth unemployment from 158,000 in 1983 to 88,000 today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal government prior to 1983&mdash;of which the new Prime Minister was Treasurer&mdash;was prepared to let young people leave the education system poorly equipped to get work and poorly equipped to be successful in a modern economy. In contrast, Labor in government sought to provide the opportunity for every young person to achieve the education and training they required so that this nation's collective future was assured. The consequence of the coalition government cutting expenditure on education will be detrimental to those currently in education and to the nation generally. It is not always just the higher education sector that should be worried; it is all sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young women in particular have benefited from the emphasis on education and training as opportunities previously denied them have opened up under Labor. Young women now make up more than half the number of students in higher education. Women who wish to work have been supported by legislation like the Sex Discrimination Act and the Equal Opportunity Act, and equal pay and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor supported the right of parents to choose their children's school by increasing funding and improving facilities in the education system, both government and non-government. From 1982 to 1996, the non&hyphen;government sector share of school enrolments grew from 24 to 29 per cent. In that time, Commonwealth funding for non&hyphen;government schools rose by 79.1 per cent in real terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Labor's record on education is compared with the performance of Liberal state governments, there is real reason to be concerned about the new coalition government's commitment to education. For example, in Victoria Premier Kennett has closed 300 schools and reduced teacher numbers by 8,000. Non&hyphen;government schools have also felt the Kennett razor, with cuts of 8.1 per cent. The Dean Brown Liberal government in South <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia is also showing little regard for education.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Rubbish!</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3J4">Mr SAWFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not rubbish. In the lead&hyphen;up to the 1993 state election, the Liberals promised that education funding would not be cut. The fact is that they have clearly breached the industrial relations election promise, with cuts of $40 million and closures of schools. In my electorate, they closed the Port Adelaide Girls High School and recently announced the closure of the Parks High School&mdash;a disgraceful decision which was against the advice of the Department of Education and even against the advice of the editorial in the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schools in the Port Adelaide electorate to benefit from funding by the former government in the last 12 months for specific projects include Le Fevre High, Siena College, Our Lady Queen of Peace School, Portside Christian School, St Joseph's School, Mount Carmel College&mdash;both primary and secondary, Seaton High School and primary school, Woodville High and the Aboriginal school, Wiltja. In January this year, $1.47 million was provided for new building projects at three schools: St Joseph's School at Ottoway, Mount Carmel College at Rosewater and Our Lady Queen of Peace School at Albert Park.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year I opened stage 2 of the four&hyphen;stage master plan for Siena College in Port Adelaide. The new facilities included the extension and refurbishment of the science laboratories, the relocation of a computing room and the establishment of an open learning facility. The government provided more than $&frac34; million towards the cost of the developments. The projects, like so many in the Port Adelaide area over the last 13 years, are an investment in the future of South Australia, Australia and, most importantly, our children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always held the view that a strong primary school foundation is critical to a child's future, and so I hope that the new government will continue to expand upon the programs that this government set in place. We all know only too well that children without appropriate literary, numeracy and social skills grow up to be alienated young adults who are capable of doing anything.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1252">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provision of new information technology in schools is vital if the nation's children are to have the benefit of an education which will stand them in good stead in the future in an information&hyphen;rich world. During the campaign, Labor announced a $300 million information technology package consisting of $240 million over four years to enable schools to buy or lease 150,000 computers, and $60 million to train teachers. It was funding which would have enabled all Australian schools&mdash;public and private&mdash;to participate in the growing information revolution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The framework for an Australian education network had been created through the establishment of an open net to link open learning students across Australia; and the education network Australia, EdNA, which was to link all schools, TAFE colleges, universities and other education and training providers across Australia and internationally. A vital part of this plan involved keeping Telstra in full public ownership to provide fair and affordable access for all Australian schools. This will become extremely difficult if the coalition government's plans for the privatisation of Telstra pass the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government funded the Salisbury Highway-South Road connector and duplicated the Port Wakefield Highway. These will greatly improve access from the Adelaide-Perth, Adelaide-Darwin national highways to Port Adelaide and Outer Harbour, to Adelaide airport, to the standard gauge rail freight depot at Islington and to industrial developments in the inner western suburbs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another much needed development is a new bridge over the Port River. The bridge is essential to ease the heavy traffic congestion through the streets of Port Adelaide and to provide direct access to the industrial sites&mdash;including the Submarine Corporation&mdash;from the main Adelaide highways to Western Australia, the Northern Territory, New South Wales and Victoria. Under the former government, forward planning for the new bridge was under way. It is a vital development for Port Adelaide and important also for the whole general area. I hope the new government does not abandon this project.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Adelaide&hyphen;Darwin railway is also important to the future of Port Adelaide and South Australia&mdash;and, I suggest, Australia. I hope it too will get the go&hyphen;ahead. I wonder how hard the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) and the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) will fight for the rail workshops and the jobs at Port Augusta and Islington. British Aerospace and the Submarine Corporation at Osborne are the big ticket industry developments in the Port Adelaide electorate which were supported by the former Labor government. They have provided jobs and injected money and expertise into local industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the little time I have left, perhaps I will concentrate a little on families. Providing targeted child-care assistance has been a high priority of the former government in helping families balance their work and family commitments. There are now five times the number of child-care places available than there were 10 years ago. About 76 per cent of families using child care receive some assistance with their child-care fees, while 42 per cent receive full assistance. I wonder what will happen to that in Port Adelaide; I wonder what will happen with that in the electorate of the member for Sturt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder what will happen to single aged pensioners renting privately. I wonder what will happen to unemployed couples with children under 13. I wonder what will happen to sole pensioners, to rent assistance and to the base of the pension? What will the new coalition government do? Will they reduce, as they did when last in office, the real values of pensions? I suppose that is what they will do&mdash;I expect so&mdash;because they will copy the conservative national government in New Zealand and will cut all benefits by 10 per cent. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to participate today in the debate on the supply bills for 1996&hyphen;97. I consider it a privilege to serve the people of Australia, particularly those in the electorate of Sturt. Therefore, I will comment on the supply bills today in a general sense on the issue of privacy. We on this side of the House recognise the enormity of the task ahead, that the people have bestowed upon us the honour <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1253"> and responsibility of leading this nation. I hope that we will exercise our authority judiciously to bring about change that benefits all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have looked across this chamber in recent weeks and seen very few of the faces that I used to recognise and know well when I was in opposition. Some of the old faces are still there, like that of the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford). But many of his friends, particularly those of the class of 93, have failed to return. They were led to their political deaths by a man who posed as George Patton but proved to be George Custer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, there are plenty of people to be blamed for the Labor Party's Little Bighorn. Some of those who had a hand in it are still here, and I am sure the Labor Party will take out due process on those people who have been in part responsible for the defeat of so many Labor members. The blood-letting remains their prerogative, not the Liberal Party's. We on this side of the House are more interested in governing. If the raft of first speeches already delivered by many of my coalition colleagues is any indication, we have a very sincere and genuine wish to see fundamental change occur in Australia and get on with the job at hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One area that was danced around by the previous government was that of privacy. It is an issue that has been creeping up on us for a long while. But, with the proliferation of computers, the development of sophisticated software and the need&mdash;or the perceived need&mdash;for both government and private organisations to collect information, it has become a very important issue. While I am cognisant of the need for reform in many areas, I hope that privacy will be a priority item on this government's agenda; it is certainly a priority on mine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">National attention first fixed on the privacy issue in the 1980s during the attempt by the former Hawke government to introduce the Australia card. The people held the view that the search for our national identity did not extend to allocating each citizen his or her own very special number. The coalition opposed its introduction and, with the help of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> other people, managed to defeat the Australia card proposal&mdash;or so we thought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Privacy Act was passed in 1988 to allay some of the fears that people held about identity cards. But, at the same time, the act allowed increased scope for information gathering and sharing in order to reduce tax and welfare fraud. Eight years down the road, government's access to information exceeds by a long way that whichever could have been anticipated by the introduction of the Australia card. That access has become increasingly available to private companies. No longer must they thumb through the telephone directory to search for new customers. In today's competitive environment they seek qualified leads: people who have purchased goods or services or spent a sum of money that suggests they might be suitable targets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where do they find such leads? There are thriving companies whose only business is the buying and selling of names of people who have purchased goods or services and are in certain income tax brackets or read certain magazines. The more qualified the list, the more it is worth. While it all sounds a bit sinister, at times we have only ourselves to blame. Recently I noticed in one of the airport lounges a huge bottle of scotch on offer as the prize in a lottery.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not win it. Entry was free, requiring only that we fill out a card telling the company a little bit about ourselves. A footnote on the card asked if we minded whether that information was passed on to others who might have products that interest us, for example. With eyes firmly fixed on the bottle of scotch, like some of my friends on the opposition benches, I filled out the card and did not bother to read the fine print.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1254"> We usually do not pay attention to the fine print. But how often have we rued that choice when our mailbox is overloaded with so-called unrefusable offers from companies we did not know existed? But in these cases, if we had not volunteered the information, we would not be harassed. Not so when it is a government department or its employees pass ing on information that we surrender&mdash;we are told&mdash;for the greater common good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even the strictest civil libertarian would not argue against the need for governments to keep databases. It makes no sense to issue Medicare cards, drivers licences and the like if no record is kept of their use. But there exists a very real possibility of invasion of privacy when this information is passed on to a third party. The ability to exchange information between departments has certainly aided efficiency and reduced fraud. It makes perfect sense that the Australian Taxation Office should match data with the DSS or that the DSS should match data with Immigration, for example. But, having acknowledged the need for such data procurement, we must also expect that the rules governing the use of such data provide sufficient protection for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the last parliament, members of the Labor government praised the success of data&hyphen;matching. Last year the former member for Oxley, one of those defeated in the election, when reporting on the data&hyphen;matching program of the Department of Employment, Education and Training said in this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The privacy question, of course, is something that we always need to be conscious of, to ensure that the Big Brother allegations are not highlighted and pushed too much.</PARA>
<PARA>One would find it difficult to tell whether the former member was actually concerned about Big Brother or whether he was opposed to aggrieved citizens' complaints about Big Brother's existence being aired too publicly. The same member told this House that the Privacy Commissioner's office was the only reassurance that Australians needed. Roger Clarke, a senior researcher at ANU, obviously has a different opinion. He believes that more than 35,000 people have been threatened with punitive action arising from decisions based on this system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Privacy Act of 1988 attempts to provide us all with protection against such abuse, but it is clearly inadequate, according to a report that was tabled last year by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, of which I was then a member. Its inquiry into the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> protection of confidential and personal information held by the Commonwealth found many problems with the existing legislation itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an ambiguity in the information privacy principles that form the basis of the act. For instance, the term `protection of the public revenue' is used as an exception in these principles. What is meant by that term? More importantly, how liberal is that term currently being construed? It is open to interpretation to such an extent that departments or agencies could use the term as an excuse to spy on anyone in receipt of any income or benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other acts of the Commonwealth address disclosure and protection of information issues especially relevant to a particular area, but it is the case that the information and privacy principles in the Privacy Act may provide overriding grounds for disclosure. This is an anomaly that needs to be corrected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Privacy Commissioner himself has described the data-matching process as the privacy equivalent of driftnet fishing. I believe we must reform the act to ensure that all departments and agencies operate under the same controls. Data&hyphen;matching programs should be administered by identified senior officers who will be responsible for all such work in that area. Agency and department heads should be at all times familiar with the programs being conducted on their watch. Their responsibility should include continual reappraisal of, and justification for collection of, information from third party sources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Taxation Office, according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Independent Monthly</EMPHASIS>, is wired into electric and gas authorities, motor vehicle registries, land title offices, the Securities Commission and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS>. That is in addition to the Department of Social Security and other federal departments it uses to aid its tax collection. Certainly, I am not in a position to judge how essential such a wide network might be, but the Commissioner of Taxation should be acutely aware of the need and should be able to justify ongoing necessity for such a network.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Power of disclosure should be limited to senior officers and precise records should be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1255"> kept of all such disclosures made. The Privacy Commissioner should be made aware promptly of all disclosures. Detail of all data&hyphen;matching activities should appear in the annual reports of government bodies. When collecting information about people there is always the danger that it will fall into the wrong hands. I remember another politician saying that he wrote things down only if he wanted them to appear in the newspaper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government collects information on its citizens who are told on surrendering such information that it may be used by other government bodies. In reality there is not much choice. Receipt of benefits is usually conditional on giving a tax file number and other personal identification details; thus people exchange freedoms for assistance. But, in doing so, they still retain the right to expect that the information will be kept in safe hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recent experience tells us that this has not always been the case. Just over a week ago, Telstra announced that it would be spending millions of dollars over the next two years to protect its customers from misuse of phone information. That assurance followed a six-month study by a privacy audit panel which found that Telstra failed to meet best practice standards in the areas of accountability, use of information and gaining consent from customers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Michael Pickering, who is Telstra's group manager of corporate policy, sounded an ominous warning. `I wouldn't want to give the impression that there are no risks,' said Pickering, who went on to explain that Telstra would be doing everything in its power to reduce those risks of privacy invasion. The audit also revealed inadequate confidentiality and security for recorded data transmissions in addition to inappropriate usage of information by staff. As the audit also stated that Telstra exceeded internal standards for protection of data, I do not know whether to be reassured or alarmed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The much publicised Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales found that over 30 officers of the Commonwealth have been involved in the sale, supply or purchase of confidential information. These <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> officers were employed across the spectrum of government services in customs, defence, health insurance and social security. In addition to those areas, the information involved in the trades came from Immigration, Australia Post, and Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. The commission had no reason to believe that these were isolated examples of the illegal and unauthorised trading in data. These revelations raise serious questions about access, security and penalties for those who are guilty of breaking the faith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, when information is compiled, it is natural to assume that someone must have access to it. But who? For what purpose? Who is checking to ensure that the data is accessed only on a need-to-know basis? What are the penalties? This is no time bomb waiting to explode; this was detonated some time ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have already seen some egregious abuses of the system&mdash;for example, a tax officer accessing records of a prominent sporting identity on 156 separate occasions over a two&hyphen;month period. She claimed she had no motive for doing so other than having a crush on the athlete. I am not sure whether she had similar crushes on the other 309 people whose files she accessed over the same period. She claimed not to have passed on the information she had gleaned from these files, and the judge dismissed her case on appeal, explaining that the bad publicity she had received was penalty enough. What recourse then for those whose privacy had been invaded?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This example underlines the lack of a privacy culture in the public sector. This woman had no idea she was committing a crime. Because she was able to access the information, she felt it not unreasonable to do so. All officers in the service of Australians need to be educated and reminded of their duties to ensure that confidential information remains just so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In another breach of trust, an Australian Federal Police officer was convicted last year for disclosing confidential information to a credit management company. The penalty for this was deemed to be a six&hyphen;month good behaviour bond, although I imagine the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1256"> $4,200 bill for witness costs probably had more of an impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994, an information technology officer from the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department was responsible for the biggest leak in Federal government history when he mailed computer disks containing nearly 10,000 confidential documents and e-mail messages to my friend the then shadow Attorney&hyphen;General, Senator Vanstone. This officer did not have authorised access to those documents, but he managed to elude all security safeguards. We have all seen Hollywood representations of schoolboy hackers breaking codes and tapping into government computer records, but no longer can these be regarded as fantasy or exciting. Unless we ensure that our security is tight and our data is safe, the potential for disaster remains great.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we move to protect people's privacy, we must make the punishment fit the crime. Unlawful collection or disclosure of confidential information should be the subject of general offence provisions in the Crimes Act 1914. The Crimes Act should undergo partial consolidation, and penalties should be set out for conduct deemed an offence. With a partial consolidation, various departments could retain the responsibility for determining just what information needs to be protected. By locating the general provisions in the Crimes Act, we will be sending a message to the community that we are serious about respecting their privacy. At the same time, it will serve as a reminder to those responsible for dealing with confidential information that breaches of trust will assume greater gravity than they have been accorded in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note with interest that the Attorney&hyphen;General of New South Wales has plans for comprehensive privacy and data protection laws. The European Union has thus far set the standard and the New South Wales legislation will attempt to meet those same standards. There is a good reason for this: the European Union will soon reduce the information loop, restricting it to those states that have adequate privacy laws. By using the European standard, New South Wales hopes to maximise its opportunities for business. It also hopes to encourage other Australians to follow suit in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tightening their privacy laws. If it makes sense for Europe to have uniformity, with all its diversity of nationality, currency, customs and laws, then certainly it makes sense for Australia to come together to find the necessary common ground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee's final recommendations concern the establishment of a national privacy code and thus extend the protection provided by the information privacy principles to all confidential third party information. The proposal for such a code should be discussed by the Council of Australian Governments at their earliest convenience. The world has changed rapidly and will continue to do so at an alarming rate. The information superhighway has made the globe a smaller place, but it has created its own potholes in need of repair. We must be ever alert in ensuring that checks and balances are placed on governments in data collection and disclosure. We must not be left behind. Corporations, particularly those which participate in public&hyphen;private partnerships, must be held to the same stringent standard as the Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a Liberal, I believe in the primacy and the privacy of the individual. I am pleased to see in recent press reports that my colleague the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) recognises the weight of the situation and has announced that he will act on the whole matter of privacy. The Australian people should expect no less.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The backdrop to this supply legislation is the very harsh fiscal policy of the new federal government, which is essentially designed to decimate critical public sector functions in Australia; to slow the economy by reducing demand at a time when it has already slowed to a relatively painless soft landing under the former government; to increase uncertainty amongst many areas of the Australian community, not the least of which is the public sector; and to cause devastation in many regional economies across Australia as a result of job cuts in the public sector, withdrawal of services and consequential loss of economic opportunities that will flow from that. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1257">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is becoming clear that the chant from the new government in response to virtually any criticism about anything is going to be, `Beazley's $8 billion black hole.' Every question asked on anything to do with any form of expenditure, or any issue that relates to government decisions on any programs, is going to be met with the response, `Kim Beazley is to blame; there is an $8 billion black hole.' Interest rates are going up: blame Beazley's $8 billion black hole. Unemployment is going up: blame Beazley's $8 billion black hole. Foreign debt is going up: same response. There are floods in Queensland: blame Beazley's $8 billion black hole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pretty soon it is going to be shortened to `Beazley's black hole' and it will become a religious mantra. People across the country will chant it long after they have forgotten what it is supposed to mean. In response to accusations of adultery, people will say, `Beazley's black hole made me do it.' Schoolboys coming home late will tell their mothers, `Beazley's black hole is the reason I'm late, mum.' The next time Gary Ablett is up before the tribunal he might say, `My defence is Beazley's black hole.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government may even legislate to make it a defence for employers in the unfair dismissal legislation. If somebody gets unfairly dismissed and they take the employer to whatever tribunal is going to be hearing unfair dismissals&mdash;I suppose we will find out about that some time today&mdash;the employer can get up and say, `Beazley's black hole made me do it and therefore there is no case to answer.' No doubt, journalists from other countries will eventually come and study Australia as an interesting case in peculiar mass hysteria because we will have people running across the length and breadth of the land all chanting, `Beazley's black hole.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before it gets completely out of hand&mdash;and it is rapidly heading in that direction&mdash;we need to have a look at what we are actually talking about. What is going on with the finances of the Australian budget and what, precisely, is this government proposing to do? We are actually talking about a gigantic fig leaf being used to cover a number of things being done by this government. First, it is a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fig leaf to ensure that they can effectively fund a range of unfunded promises&mdash;up to $4 billion worth&mdash;and slip them in under the guise of blaming the former government for any cuts that have to be engineered in order to pay for those promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of those promises are going to be pretty interesting when they come to implementation. For example, they deal with tax cuts for people on incomes as high as $82,000 a year&mdash;the Australian battlers the Liberal Party is so keen to represent. When the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was on the radio during the election campaign, he did not get his lines right; he was not sure what the upper limit was. But it was demonstrated to him that it is likely that there will be some people on incomes as high as $82,000 a year who will be eligible for tax cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How are they going to pay for these things? How are they going to finance tax cuts for people on such miserly incomes as $82,000 a year&mdash;more, I might add, than politicians get paid? How are they going to fund those tax cuts? We will see cuts in child care, we will see cuts in social security, we will see cuts in aged care and we will see massive cuts in higher education. That is how they are going to finance their promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of the fig leaf is the introduction of Fightback. They went to the election saying, `We are changed; we are soft and cuddly and middle of the road; we are not nasty New Right ideologues any more. Fightback has been put back in the drawer.' But what are they doing now? All of the nasty cuts and all of the winding back of public services for people&mdash;all in Fightback&mdash;are being introduced one by one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the macro&hyphen;economics of this mythical $8 billion figure and see what it actually is. In reality it is a $4.9 billion deficit, proceeding very quickly to a $3 billion deficit over two years. Where has it come from? Some people on the other side seem to have pretty short memories. Almost $2&half; billion of the deficit that they have been left with was caused by their own actions in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very shortly we will be dealing with the legislation for the sale of airport leases. This sale should reap substantial revenue for the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1258"> government. The former government tried to sell airport leases. That was part of its revenue in the existing budget. The deficit blew out because that legislation was stopped by the current government in the Senate. So a big proportion of the problem was something that they created themselves while they were in opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to remember that we are talking about less than one per cent of GDP. That is the actual deficit. It is still the best in the OECD. That has hardly been a secret. There have been tired attempts to beat up suggestions that in some way there was deceit on the part of the previous government; that the former Minister for Finance kept this all a secret; that there was a deterioration in the fiscal outlook. However, it was widely discussed and debated during the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister said, `I will give implementation of my promises priority over the deficit.' He said unequivocally on radio in Sydney that he would put that ahead of tackling the deficit. What has happened since he has been in office? Exactly the reverse. Everything relates to the so&hyphen;called Beazley black hole. Everything relates to the deficit. The promises are being scuttled at an average of three or four a day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has brought this about? It is a change in forecasts. The previous forecast for growth was 3.75 per cent, and that was readjusted by Treasury to 3.25 per cent. That was a pretty marginal adjustment but, for reasons that are obvious, it produces implications for the income and expenditure of the government which, ultimately, tally up into significant amounts of money&mdash;in the billions of dollars. That is hardly evidence of conspiracy to mislead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it were not for the economic policy of the new government, these figures probably would have improved again anyway. They are subject to significant variations from time to time. The Treasury adjusts them as new data emerges. Had it not been for the new policies of the government, the figures probably would have been adjusted upward and, automatically, the anticipated deficit would have been reduced. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw your attention to a letter of 20 May in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> from Fred Argy, Fred Gruen and John Nevile, who are amongst the most prominent and respected economists in Australia. They state that the real deficit is about $4 billion, and then they conclude:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But, it is neither necessary nor desirable to seek to reduce discretionary spending by $8 billion over the next two years simply because the economy is forecast to grow more slowly. If the economy is indeed slowing down, such a policy may well slow it down further and increase unemployment in the short term, while helping neither the fiscal deficit nor the national saving rate.</PARA>
<PARA>Here is the irony: rather than the so&hyphen;called black hole creating the cuts, the cuts are going to create the black hole because the economy will slow down. It has had a soft landing in the business cycle for the first time in many years as a result of the proper economic management of the former government. This government is going to slow it down further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The end result will be that it will create its own deficit. Rather than sliding up again a fraction to eliminate the gap that had emerged, by cutting viciously into the public sector the government will cause the economy to slow down further, demand will be reduced, and it will create the very problem that it says is causing the cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are now left with Costello's con&mdash;Fightback without John Hewson. That means nearly $10 billion of cuts without a GST&mdash;yet. It means a balanced budget with no growth and no jobs. If the crisis is so serious, why is it that we have not had a mini&hyphen;budget? Some 5&half; months have elapsed between the election and the budget. The government is saying that there is this incredible crisis and that Australia has been left in a total mess by the former government&mdash;all sorts of nonsense of that sort&mdash;but it does not seem to be sufficiently important to have a mini&hyphen;budget. That tends to suggest that there is a little bit of hype and a little bit of nonsense coming from the other side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does Labor's legacy look like? Unemployment has diminished to 8.5 per cent, with a much higher participation rate. If we had the participation rate that we had in 1983, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1259"> unemployment would be about three per cent. The other side seems to have a bit of difficulty working out what its line on this is. A few days ago, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) said that the 730,000 jobs created in the last three years under Labor really did not matter because they were almost all part&hyphen;time jobs. Yet yesterday the Prime Minister said how great it was going to be under the new IR legislation because there would be lots of part&hyphen;time jobs created. Which is it? Are part&hyphen;time jobs real jobs, important jobs, worthwhile jobs or not? The government members seem to have a difference of view on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had inflation down and steady around two to three per cent; interest rates steady, at eight to nine per cent; a soft landing in the business cycle; wages growth around five per cent based on productivity above two per cent annual growth; the dollar increasing in strength to a point where it is starting to become a bit of a problem so, if anything, we have now got to dampen down the value of the dollar by intervention; an internationally exposed competitive economy; and massive increases in education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to concede there were some problems, such as the current account deficit at six per cent of GDP, but it was falling down to about 4.5 per cent of GDP, and when the current Prime Minister was Treasurer he left the economy with a current account deficit of 5.5 per cent of GDP. There were specific factors involved: the drought, commodity prices and the like. Initiatives that were pursued by the former government&mdash;such as the superannuation initiative and industry policies&mdash;were starting to impact in the long term on the current account deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Foreign debt is a symptom of internationalisation. It is very amusing to see Access Economics, the great gurus of the Liberal Party, predicting that under Liberal rule foreign debt is going to blow out to over $300 billion. At the same time as foreign debt increased, the holdings of Australians abroad increased from $4 billion to $90 billion, again, as I say, as a symptom of internationalisation. It will not be very long before the Treasurer (Mr Costello) stops talking about <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $10,000 per Australian in foreign debt because people will start remembering what he used to say and start realising that foreign debt is continuing to increase for entirely understandable economic reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Liberals are about is harsh contraction at the bottom of the cycle, turning a soft landing into a hard crash&mdash;as the very respected eminent economists I have just quoted indicated&mdash;sacking as many public servants as they can, devastating many regional and rural areas of Australia through withdrawal of jobs and services, abandoning any form of wages policy and letting the strong get stronger to get their market outcomes, and letting the weak diminish the limited amount they are already receiving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not surprising that when Access Economics looked at all this they came up with the conclusion that pretty well everything was going to get worse over the next five years. These are the architects of Fightback speaking; these are the Liberal Party speech writers; these are the people who the Liberals have relied on for so many years. The reality that those on the other side are going to have to face in a couple of years is that their performance is going to be compared with the benchmarks left for them. Whether it is their performance on inflation, unemployment, productivity or interest rates, they are going to have great difficulties even to maintain the levels set by the former government, much less improve on them. That is when the reality will hit home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will also hit home is their totally bogus claim to represent blue-collar workers in Australia. There were a few exceptions of course. They did not represent blue-collar workers who happened to be seafarers: they wanted to kick them to death; they did not like meat workers; they did not like building workers: `We will slug them extra tax'. It is a bit selective and that is going to come home as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to turn in the few minutes left to me to my own shadow portfolio. It is an interesting example of what is likely to happen under this government. We have got a minister in charge who has tried to force the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1260"> to resign after only nine months in the position. He failed dismally at doing this and admitted it. Now he has decided that he is going to legislate to increase the board and put one or two people on it that he hopes will force the other people to resign. He seems to think that the only people qualified to sit on a board of an organisation are those who have actually done the things that the organisation does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this sort of logic perhaps you would ask why he has appointed Dr Allan Hawke, who is a geneticist, as his head of department. I think it is a great appointment but, using Mr Sharp's logic, perhaps it should be a master mariner or a pilot or a train driver. He is a minister who has said initially about Badgerys Creek, both before and after the election, `We are going to build it. We are committed to it. Labor will wimp on it. We are very strongly behind it.' He did not happen to mention to the people of Hughes and one or two other electorates around Holsworthy that he was thinking something completely different at the time. In the last few days he suddenly says, `We have discovered all these problems at Badgerys Creek and it may have to be knocked on the head.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Alan Jones on radio 2UE asked him whether he might have to knock it on the head, he said, `Yes, that certainly could be the case, Alan. We might have to kill Badgerys.' Suddenly somewhere in the vicinity of 100,000 to 200,000 people in a particular region of Sydney, who were at the polls only a couple of months ago making decisions about who they would vote for, are told, `Oh well, it has just occurred to us. We might think about whacking an airport next to you.' That had been killed off and left for dead a long time ago by the previous government. Did they think to put this to the people before the election? Oh no. But, of course, they do not engage in deceit; they do not engage in subterfuge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen also one or two other amusing performances by the minister. One of my favourites so far would have to be his performance before the Bus and Coach Proprietors Association on the very complex and difficult issue of disabled access to public <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> transport. I would just like to quote a couple of sentences from his speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Market forces should have been capable of resolving this issue. Market forces backed by adequate research would have identified the size of the market, its needs and its financial capacity. Market forces, not Labor's politically driven Canberra based agenda, would have solved this problem without a fuss, facilitating the uptake of disabled access vehicles inexpensively.</PARA>
<PARA>What on earth does he think has been happening over the last 50 years: centralised socialist planning? Market forces are the very reason why people with disabilities do not have proper access to public transport, because it is too expensive for private operators to have the equipment and to modify buses and the like in order to provide the access, and most disabled people are not millionaires. What an absurd performance!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is the minister who proposes to basically decimate Australian shipping by removing the sorts of fiscal support that all major shipping nations have across the world and all the major competitors have across the world. He is the minister who has managed to announce an inquiry into Australian National and its financial problems and at the same time announce who is to blame. So he announces the conclusion of the inquiry at the same time as he announces the inquiry. With this sort of track record, many users and people involved in transport must be shuddering at the prospect of what sorts of cuts he is going to offer up to the Treasury and Finance. Perhaps he will abolish air traffic control or maybe the Maritime Safety Authority or something like that! With the current cowboy type approach, anything is possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is instructive to look at the transport budget because it provides in microcosm an illustration of what is actually happening in the public sector in this country. For 1995&hyphen;96 its budget was $1.37 billion. Only $81 million of that was for running costs, of which $15 million was associated with safety administration. The coalition promises included an extra $147 million in the transport area: $28 million for Adelaide airport; $18.8 million for the Tasmanian sea highway in this forthcoming financial year; $65 million for the Pacific Highway; and $36 million for black spots. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1261"> The only cuts it promised were the $27 million for the ships capital grants and PAYE legislation which we have just debated in the House. Now, $850 million of the current budget relates to roads, where the coalition was committed to `continue federal road funding expenditure commitments at current levels and add significant new road infrastructure and maintenance programs'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next biggest item&mdash;and this is where it gets interesting&mdash;is noise abatement at Sydney airport: $105 million in 1995&hyphen;96, to fall gradually to $43 million in 1996&hyphen;97. So there is not much to cut. Almost all of the budget is in programs which are supposedly supported by the coalition parties. This is where the controversy about Badgerys and Holsworthy becomes so significant, because the forward estimates contain substantial amounts of money, over $500 million over two or three years, to provide for the construction and purchase of land at Badgerys. So now we know what is really going on. It will be very interesting to see those forward estimates on 20 August. Now we know what is really going on, and that is an attempt to rip out that money. Forget about building a second airport for Sydney, because those are the only cuts that are really able to be offered up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This offers a very good illustration of what is happening. There is minimal fat to cut in Australia's public sector. It is overwhelmingly devoted to programs, to delivery of services, not to administration and bureaucrats and fat cats and all the mantras and myths that come from the other side. All of the major items in the budget are things that the Liberals have committed themselves either to maintain or to increase. No wonder they are looking for alibis, no wonder they are desperate to invent any excuse they can to lay waste to the public sector. No wonder we have now got Costello's con&mdash;the mythology of Beazley's black hole. I have got bad news for them. The Australian people are not going to wear these sorts of infantile lies and mythology. They won't let them break their promises and they won't accept the sort of Thatcherite regime that they are trying to construct. It is Fightback in disguise, a situation where they are going to lay waste to a whole host of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> social support mechanisms in regional and rural Australia as a result of their cuts. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No century in recorded history has experienced the number of social transformations and such radical ones as the 20th century. In the so&hyphen;called free market or industrialised countries, which account for only one&hyphen;fifth of the population yet remain a model for the rest of the world, work and work force, society and politics in the last decade of this century are all different significantly not only from the first decade of this century but also from what has existed at any other time in history. They differ in configurations, in their processes, in their problems and in their structures. Far smaller and slower social changes in the past have triggered civil wars, rebellion and violent intellectual and spiritual crisis, yet the extreme social transformations of this century have hardly caused a stir.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect that this century will be recorded as the cruelest and most violent in history with its wars, mass tortures, ethnic cleansing, genocides and holocausts. Hindsight clearly shows the three evil geniuses of this century&mdash;Hitler, Stalin and Mao&mdash;were destroyers rather than builders because they created absolutely nothing. Indeed, if this century proves one thing, it is the futility of politics because the social transformations of this century had little to do with political events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The age of social transformation will not come to a close in the year 2000 and the bad news for some in our community is that it will not even have peaked by then. One hundred years ago our society was dominated by the biggest single group in every country, the farmers. Today, however, farmers are at most five per cent of the developed world's population and work force. Traditional farmers are close to extinction and those who remain have become a protected species kept alive only by enormous subsidies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second largest group in the population and work force of every developed country around 1900 was composed of live&hyphen;in servants. Ninety years later, live&hyphen;in domestic servants scarcely exist in developed countries. In the developed society of 2000, farmers will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1262"> be little more than objects of nostalgia. Yet these enormous social transformations were accomplished without civil war and, in fact, were accomplished almost entirely in total silence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the main reasons why these transformations caused so little stir was that by the turn of the century a new class, the blue&hyphen;collar worker in manufacturing industry&mdash;Marx's proletariat&mdash;had become socially dominant. By early this century society was obsessed with blue-collar workers. It was fixated by them, bewitched by them. Farmers and domestics were everywhere but as classes they were invisible. The new class, the industrial worker, was extremely visible. The people lived in dense clusters within and around cities and they soon proved eminently organisable with the first strikes occurring almost as soon as there were factory workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sorel found widespread acceptance of his 1906 thesis that the proletariat would overturn the existing order and take power through the violence of the general strike. Mussolini, Hitler and Mao built their strategies on Sorel's thesis. Mao's statement that `political power grows out of the barrel of a gun' was a direct quote from Sorel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No class in history has ever risen faster than the blue-collar worker and no class in history has ever fallen faster. The workers of 1913 received no pensions, no paid vacations, no overtime pay, no extra pay for Sunday or night work, no health or old age insurance, no unemployment compensation and, in fact, they had no job security whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fifty years later or thereabouts, in the 1950s, industrial workers had become the largest single group in every developed country. They had extensive job security, pensions, long paid vacations, comprehensive unemployment insurance and, in some cases, guaranteed lifetime employment. Above all, they had achieved political power. In Britain, for instance, they were considered the real government with greater power than the Prime Minister and the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some 40 years later, industrial workers and unions are in retreat. They have become marginal in number. Where industrial workers who made or moved things accounted for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 40 per cent of the work force in the 1950s, they now account for less than 20 per cent of the work force, that is, they are no stronger now than they were at the start of this century. I suggest that by the turn of the next century industrial workers will account for no more than one&hyphen;eighth of the total work force. Union power in the community has been declining very fast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But just as the traditional farmer has become a recipient of subsidies rather than a major producer, so will the traditional industrial worker become an auxiliary employee. This is because the industrial worker has already been replaced by the technologist&mdash;someone who not only provides labour but also has theoretical knowledge. Industrial workers may soon become just another pressure group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrary to the chroniclers of the rise of the industrial worker, the rise of this class caused neither a revolution nor violence. In fact, contrary to what Marx suggested, the industrial worker did not destabilise society. The history books record the squalor of early industry, the poverty of the industrial workers and their exploitation. Workers did indeed live in squalor and poverty and they were exploited. But they lived better than those on the farm or in a household and they were generally treated better. Proof of this was the decrease in infant mortality figures during this period. The drop in infant mortality can be directly related to the increase in living standards brought about by industrialisation. Industrial work provided farmers and domestics with their first opportunity in history to better themselves without the need to emigrate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rise of the class succeeding industrial workers does not provide an opportunity for those industrial workers. In fact, it is a huge challenge for them. The newly emerging dominant group in our society is the knowledge worker. By the end of this century the knowledge worker will make up more than one-third of the work force. That sector will be as large as, if not larger than, the proportion that manufacturing workers made up in the community. The majority of them will be paid at least as well as, if not more than, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1263"> industry workers, and the new jobs will create greater opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, and this is the greatest challenge facing our country, the great majority of new jobs require qualifications that the industrial worker does not possess and for which they are poorly equipped to acquire. They will require a good deal of formal education and the ability to acquire and apply theoretical knowledge. They require a different approach to work and a different work ethic. They will have to change their mind&hyphen;set. Above all, they will require a habit of continuous learning. At the very least they have to change their basic attitudes, values and beliefs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fall of the industrial worker in the developed world will have a major impact upon those countries outside the developed world. Developing countries can no longer expect to base their development on their comparative labour advantage, that is, they cannot rely on cheap labour. It is widely believed, especially by labour union officials, that the fall of the blue-collar industrial worker in developed countries was largely, if not entirely, caused by moving production offshore. But this is not true. The main competition we have, internationally, is from countries that have high production costs so it cannot be that it is cheaper to go offshore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major competitive factor and the challenge that Australian businesses must address is the application of knowledge to the manufacturing process. It means that we cannot base development on lower wages but rather we must gain the flexibility of production from the application of knowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the shift to knowledge based work poses enormous social challenges for our community, the knowledge community. This is the first society in which the ordinary people&mdash;and that means most people&mdash;will not earn their daily bread by the sweat of their brow. It is the first society in which honest work does not mean how many calluses you have on your hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also the first society in which not everyone does the same work. This is far more than a social change; it is really a change of human condition. What it means for the values, commitments and problems of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the new society we do not know because we are still going through this transition stage. We know that much will be different and that that then leads to a continuing feeling of uncertainty, and that is evident within our community at the moment. That feeling has emerged as the country's most constant social development. The knowledge workers will not be the majority in the knowledge society but they will be the biggest single population in the work force group. Knowledge workers will give the knowledge society its character, its leadership and its profile. They may not be the ruling class but they certainly will be the leading class.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their characteristics, their social position, values and expectations differ fundamentally from any group in history that has occupied the leading social position before. For starters, knowledge workers gain access to jobs and social position through formal education. Knowledge work varies tremendously in the amount and the kind of formal knowledge required. Some jobs have low requirements, others much greater. You can compare a technician in Telstra to a brain surgeon. Some have low knowledge requirements whereas others have greater requirements. But even if the knowledge required is quite primitive, only formal education can provide it. Education will become the centre of the knowledge society and the school will become the key institution. What knowledge we must have and what quality of knowledge we must have will become very important issues for debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are questions we need to put to policy developers. It will become a major political question as we move into the 21st century. In fact, the application and distribution of knowledge may come to occupy that place in society that the acquisition of property and income over the last two or three centuries once occupied. That period has become known as the age of capitalism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, in the knowledge society more and more knowledge, especially advanced knowledge, would be acquired well past the age of current formal education. School as we know it would become the most vital and greatest concern to the new society. Increasingly, the educated person will become somebody who <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1264"> has learned how to learn but who also continues to learn throughout their lifetime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The productivity of the non&hyphen;knowledge services worker will become the social challenges for the knowledge society. On it will depend the ability of the knowledge society to give decent incomes and dignity and status to non&hyphen;knowledge workers. The possibility of acquiring knowledge will no longer depend on obtaining a prescribed education at a given age. Learning will become the tool of the individual, available to him or her at any time of their lives. In the new knowledge society there will be no poor countries; there will only be ignorant countries. The same could be said for companies, industries and organisations of all kinds, and it is also true of individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Historically, workers have been generalists. They did what had to be done, on the farm, in the household, in the craftsman's shop. It is also true of industrial workers. But knowledge workers, whether their knowledge is primitive or advanced, will be defined as specialised. It demands for the first time in history that people with knowledge take responsibility for making themselves understood by people who do not have the same knowledge base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most knowledge workers will spend most, if not all, of their working lives as employees. But the meaning will be very different to what we traditionally consider the word to be. Individually, knowledge workers are dependent on the job; they receive a wage or a salary. They have been hired and can be put off, fired or terminated, whatever the terms are these days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Legally, each is an employee, but collectively they are capitalists, increasingly so through their pensions funds. In the knowledge society the employees will own the tools of production. Increasingly, the true investment in the knowledge society is not the machines and the tools but in the knowledge of the knowledge worker. Without knowledge the machines, no matter how advanced and sophisticated, are unproductive. Therefore, we will need a new type of management and management techniques and training. Management, in other words, is a social function and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> its practice is becoming more of a liberal art. For managers, the days of treating your employees with disrespect are over. The greatest advantage that a manager can have these days is understanding that your assets actually leave at 5 o'clock every day and you hope that your assets turn up the following day at 9 o'clock. So we have to work towards understanding and managing these new assets because the assets are actually in the knowledge worker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I submit that we will need to develop a vital third sector, which is the social sector of the community. Already we have a private sector and a public sector, but we heard from the previous speaker, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), that we have some major challenges in this particular area of development. Things are not getting done in the community; we have lost our sense of community. The reason is that public and private sectors cannot give this sense of community. So we need to develop a social sector of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Knowledge as the key resource is very different from the traditional key resources of the economist: land, labour and even capital. That knowledge has become the key resource means that the world's economy will in fact take control. Every country, every business, will be placed in an ever&hyphen;increasing competitive environment. Every country, every business, when it comes to decisions, will have to consider its competitive standing in the world economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national boundaries are in fact breaking down and few politicians, journalists or civil servants look beyond the boundaries of their own countries when a measure such as taxes or the regulation of business or social spending is being discussed. This will no longer do. The first question will be not whether we need the measure, but what the impact will be on the country's competitive position in the world economy. We will need impact statements similar to the environmental impact statements we currently have; we will need a competitive impact statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Knowledge knows no boundaries. There is no domestic knowledge and there is no international knowledge; there is just knowledge. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1265"> With knowledge becoming the key resource, there is only a world economy, even though the individual organisation in daily activities operates within a national, regional or local setting. Knowledge goes beyond national boundaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The challenges for the future are many. They are more serious and daunting than the social transformations of the last century. We will have to think really seriously about education, its purpose, its values and its content. Most of it is based upon industrial age thinking; we need to start thinking about the information age and the knowledge society. We will have to learn to define the quality of education and the productivity of education and to measure both and to manage both. We also need systematic work on the quality of knowledge and the productivity of knowledge. Neither as yet can be defined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The performance capacity, if not the survival, of any organisation in the knowledge society will come to increasingly depend on two factors. So will the performance capacity, if not the survival, of any individual in the knowledge society. These factors are: what responsibility knowledge has and what the responsibilities are of the knowledge worker, especially of the person with specialised knowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Increasingly, the policy of Australia will have to give primacy to the country's competitive position in the increasingly competitive world economy. Any proposed domestic policy needs to be shaped so as to improve that position, or at least to minimise adverse impacts upon it. The same should hold true for the policies and strategies of any institution or organisation within Australia, whether a local government, a business, a university or, in fact, a hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also need to develop an economic theory appropriate to a world economy in which knowledge is the key economic resource and the dominant, if not the only, source of competitive advantage. We desperately need to develop a strong, independent, capable social sector which is neither public nor private. But we cannot have that alone; we need all three sectors to be operating together. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to review the political process. The function of government and its workings must be central to political thought and political action. The megastate promoted and indulged in this century has not performed either in its totalitarian or democratic versions. We are in a period of rapid change. Old ways and old systems are not coping with it and we need to address them in all organisations, whether they be political, business or otherwise. We do not even have the beginnings of political theory or the political institutions needed for effective government in the knowledge based society of organisations. If the 20th century needs to be one of social transformations, the 21st century needs to be one of social and political innovations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear from the early weeks of this 38th Parliament that there is only one party capable of thinking towards the future in this regard. I have just listened to the member for Melbourne who was talking about the past quite a lot. He was talking about industry and industrial ways and the industrial era. He was talking about education, social welfare and other issues. They are all very important issues and I do not think there is any politician on either side of the House who will dispute that they are important issues. But they need to be addressed with the thinking of a knowledge society and the information age. Currently we are too much in regression, trying to get back industrial age thinking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is only one group putting these policies forward and that is the coalition. An example of that will be our workplace reform legislation which we are bringing to the House today.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to rise to speak on the Supply Bill (No. 1) 1996&hyphen;97, which formally commences the process for the 1996&hyphen;97 financial year budget to be presented on 20 August. The Supply Bill is treated formally and members tend to wax lyrical about many issues as if it were an address&hyphen;in&hyphen;reply. According to the forms, procedures and traditions of the parliament, the Supply Bill goes through as requested by the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had one occasion on which tradition and convention were torn up in the face of Australian democracy. That was in 1975 when a cabal of Liberal Party people such as Malcolm Fraser, John Kerr and Garfield Barwick entered into a conspiracy to deceive the Prime Minister and the government of the day and foisted upon the Australian people an undemocratic election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The process is conducted in a much more gentle frame of mind on these subsequent occasions. The Supply Bill falls in a context of recent, constant assertions by the opposition of an $8 billion black hole in the budget accounts. This is Costello's con, of course, and it is interesting to draw the attention of the House to a newspaper clipping from the Western Australian <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Times</EMPHASIS> that some of us kept from the early 1980s. The article is called `Howard's budget apology'. The story says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Fraser Government knew before the last Budget that it could create a $4200 million deficit next year, the former treasurer, Mr Howard, said today. `I knew that figure and I'm sorry I did not make it public', he said.</PARA>
<PARA>The story goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Howard's revelation today comes on top of a mounting political row over the silence, during the election campaign, over a predicted Budget deficit as high as $9600 million.</PARA>
<PARA>This is about $25 billion in today's figures. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When Mr Howard delivered his Budget speech on August 17 he made no deficit projections based on the Budget programmes beyond the current financial year in which he predicted a deficit of $1600 million, since blown out to more than $4000 million. Today Mr Howard said that when the Budget was in its final stages he went to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Treasury and insisted, against its wishes, that it make a projection on the Budget's effects on the deficit in the 1983&hyphen;84 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA>The story then goes on to say how Mr Howard kept that exclusively to himself. So there has been a considerable amount of disingenuous behaviour and commentary on the part of the government in respect of this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the Supply Bill and this year's budget are concerned, in the course of debate in this House and in the other place, the government has been asked on a number of occasions across a whole range of portfolio areas whether it is proposing to keep commitments it made in the course of the election campaign. The constant reply from those opposite, despite what they said in the election campaign and despite the impressions they conveyed to the Australian community, is that we will all have to wait until the budget on 20 August.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my shadow portfolio area of trade, I have particular interest in a range of trade and industry assistance measures&mdash;a range of programs that help ensure that our export and trade performance is at its peak; a range of measures that help to ensure that small and medium size businesses get every opportunity and every incentive to trade, particularly in our own region. Two examples are the EMDG, the export market development grants scheme, and the DIFF scheme, the Development Import Finance Facility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will start with some comments on the EMDG scheme. The coalition went to the election with a trade document called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting the challenges: the new global economy: Liberal and National Party trade strategies for the future</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On page 3 of that document it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's Export Market Development Grants (EMDG) Scheme has been in operation since 1975, and has been supported by Australia's export businesses. The coalition will retain the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>Later in the document under the heading `Export incentives'&mdash;about page 30&mdash;there is a further commitment which, in the course of some description of export incentives, asserts:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will maintain the Export Market Development Grants Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>The now Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade (Mr Fischer), when he was shadow <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1267"> minister for trade, went to the National Press Club in the course of the election campaign on 15 February of this year. In his speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is a privilege to present the Coalition trade policy, `Meeting the Challenges', and debate that policy.</PARA>
<PARA>In the course of his presentation in respect of the document I have just referred to, the now Deputy Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And finally, ladies and gentlemen, we of course have as the fifth track in relation to our approach to trade, the promoting and financing of Australian exports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Austrade stays, the EMDG scheme stays . . .</PARA>
<PARA>There was a clear and unequivocal commitment to the Australian people and to Australian companies and to Australian exporters that the EMDG scheme would stay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, since the election the Minister for Trade has assiduously refused in this place or elsewhere, as has the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) in this place and elsewhere, and as has the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) in this place and elsewhere, to confirm to this House or to the Australian public that the government is prepared to meet that commitment and not break that clear and unequivocal election commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also the case that in a related document the coalition expressly committed itself to not just maintaining the EMDG scheme but to expanding and extending it to parts of the tourism industry. However, since then we have heard nothing but deafening silence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It appears on the part of those sitting opposite that it is all well and good and appropriate conduct for the then Leader of the Opposition and now Prime Minister to go to a primary school and give assurances to primary school children, which he has subsequently walked away from, and it is all well and good for the now Minister for Trade, the Deputy Prime Minister, to go to the National Press Club and give assurances, which are subsequently walked away from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The EMDG scheme is not the only trade or industry development incentive program in place. The proposed abolition of a range of these incentive schemes and the adverse <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> effects that would follow was put very well by Tim Colebatch in the course of an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> recently. Mr Colebatch had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In less than 10 years, Australia's exports have more than doubled, $39 billion to $92 billion. Most of that growth was in non-traditional areas: services exports trebled to $21 billion, and manufactured exports grew fivefold to $17.5 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The export boom in manufactures and services has added almost $30 billion a year to Australia's output, and perhaps 500,000 jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>In the course of his article he describes this export enhancement as `Labor's greatest economic achievement'. He then goes on in the course of his article to describe as `alarming' the coalition's policy and budget agenda and the lack of any strategy for ensuring the continuing of these trade and industry programs, which are currently, as he describes them, being tossed up as targets for alleged financial reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the course of the coalition's trade document there is also a commitment to ensure ongoing discussions with relevant chambers of commerce. There is a commitment that the views of relevant chambers of commerce will be taken into account by the coalition. That being so, I was interested to see recently a public comment by the Managing Director of the Australian Business Chamber, Mr Philip Holt, when he said in respect of the government's proposed abolition of the export market development grant scheme, a scheme which he described as helping small and medium business to get into export markets, that the proposed abolition was a major backward step for small and medium sized businesses. He said that it was the breaking of an election promise which would adversely affect job creation and increase the balance of payments deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is considerable consternation in relevant groups of industry and commerce about the government's abolition of this particular program in clear breach of an express election commitment. A successful business in Western Australia, my own state, has kindly forwarded to me a copy of a letter to the Minister for Trade in respect of the abolition of the export market development grant scheme. It is from a company by the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1268"> name of Dynamic Technology which is based in Osborne Park in Western Australia. The letter in part says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our organisation, being one of the 90% of small to medium enterprises claiming EMDG support in 1995, have committed several hundred thousand dollars to a major export initiative to promote Australian made technology and products into very competitive overseas markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our commitment to allocating funds for this export initiative was based on the premise that the Export Market Development Grant Scheme would provide us with the necessary assistance to achieve our export strategy. For the Federal Government to tamper with this scheme would have a major impact on our . . . export activities and we believe, it would be a fundamental breach of the coalition's pre&hyphen;election promise to maintain the scheme and support exporters like ourselves.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, that refrain has been echoed far and wide by a range of companies and industry groups. I notice that my colleague the shadow minister for tourism, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), has just entered the chamber; so I draw to his attention a recent release by the Tourism Council of Australia, entitled `EMDG scheme must aid tourism industry', with Bruce Baird, the former New South Wales coalition minister and now managing director of the tourism body, calling upon the government to fulfil its election commitment in that particular area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I referred to the EMDG scheme and to the DIFF program, which has now been abolished by the government. I was interested to see today a story in the Brisbane <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>, headed `Cuts to scheme "foolish"'. It read:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moves to cut two Federal Government schemes just as a rising dollar has spooked the nation's exporters, has been slammed by peak industry body, the Metal Trades Industry Association . . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Association chief executive Bert Evans has termed the path taken by the Government as "foolish" and "the most short&hyphen;sighted thing I've seen in my career".</PARA>
<PARA>So here we have the chief executive officer of the Metal Trades Industry Association describing the proposed abolition by the government&mdash;in the case of EMDG in breach of its election commitment&mdash;as foolish and the most short&hyphen;sighted thing that he has seen.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of DIFF, we have seen the Transfield $60 million Philippines naval vessel contract put in jeopardy; we have seen the former head of Foreign Affairs, Richard Woolcott, who is now the personal emissary of the Prime Minister to Malaysia, attacking the doing&hyphen;in of the DIFF scheme and saying in the last couple of weeks:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Scrapping them . . . could undermine Australia's credibility as a reliable supplier, and advantage our commercial competitors in the region, who may pick up those projects which Australian companies will not be able to proceed with.</PARA>
<PARA>That litany has been joined by protests from ambassadors from a range of neighbouring countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very interested today, Mr Deputy Speaker, when it was drawn to my attention that the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade had been gazumped by his portfolio boss, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), who had refused to provide to the Deputy Prime Minister Department of Finance proposals for expenditure cuts to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, allowing him access only to proposals for expenditure cuts to trade agencies and programs such as EMDG and DIFF. We see today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> that, as a result, internecine warfare has broken out between the Minister for Trade and the Minister for Foreign Affairs&mdash;internecine warfare as a result of the portfolio boss of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade doing him in. The article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> refers to internecine warfare, to relations between officers of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Trade starting poorly and only getting worse, and describing a degeneration of relations between Mr Downer and Mr Fischer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what do we have here? What is the reason these trade and export enhancement programs have been done in? We now know why the Minister for Trade sits in this House in stony silence, refusing to give to this House the commitment that he gave to the National Press Club. He has been done in by his political junior&mdash;his portfolio boss, the Minister for Foreign Affairs&mdash;who, as I understand it, has refused to provide him with access to expenditure cuts proposed by the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1269"> Department of Finance to the entire Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, leaving the Minister for Trade with access only to information in respect of agencies such as Austrade. So we know why these important export assistance programs like EMDG are being done in&mdash;it is because the Minister for Trade is being done in.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. What action is the government taking to ensure there are practical and lasting amendments made to the Native Title Act so that there is greater certainty for pastoralists, miners, tourist operators and Aboriginal people?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="1269" SPEAKER="Howard, John, MP" NAMEID="ZD4" ELECTORATE="Bennelong" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is throughout the Australian community at the present time quite widespread and very legitimate concern about uncertainties in relation to the operation of the Native Title Act. I have seen and heard some comments made by the Premier of Western Australia, the Premier of South Australia, the Premier of Queensland and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory&mdash;all of whom have quite legitimately complained about the fact that the way the Native Title Act is operating at present is delaying much needed development in this country. All of the concerns that have been expressed by the state premiers I completely concur with. They <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1270"> are merely giving voice to the legitimate desires of the people and the business organisations within their own states to see a great deal more certainty than exists at present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the extent that there are differences of opinion around Australia, I would hope those differences of opinion would not be about the objective, but rather the methodology. What the government has set about doing on this issue is to try to achieve a practical set of reforms to the Native Title Act. We are not in the business of trying to drive a wedge between different sections of the Australian community. The pastoralists of this country have a legitimate interest in obtaining security, the mining industry has a legitimate interest in obtaining security and the Aboriginal people have a perfect right to see that their common law entitlements are not taken away. In framing our approach, we have regard to all of those interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite plainly, the continued delay is causing a great deal of insecurity and a great deal of uncertainty. There are those who believe that the simple answer to the situation is to attempt to legislate the extinguishment of native title where pastoral leases are involved. I can understand why people would see that as a solution. One of the difficulties is that that solution faces a number of hurdles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first hurdle it faces is whether it is consonant with the election commitments made by the coalition and, on the best advice, it is not. The second hurdle is whether it is likely to draw the support of the necessary numbers in both houses of this parliament and I think, on a present reading, it is unlikely to do that. The third hurdle, even if it were to pass through this parliament, is whether it would then be immune from constitutional challenge and therefore be immune from creating a further delay and, in fact, a greater delay than an alternative that might be adopted. It should not be assumed that going down the route of legislative extinguishment will bring the certainty that the mining industry, the pastoral industry and the state premiers of this country so legitimately aspire for and have so legitimately called for in recent days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my view that in fact it may cause greater delay if we were to go down that path <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> than if we were to go down another path. The federal government, in proposing another path, is in no way unsympathetic to the views that have been expressed by the Premiers of Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia and by the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. We happen to think that the most practical way to get to the goal they want to get to is to go down the route that we have advocated. That is why our approach has been somewhat different and that is why there have been different views expressed on this issue over the past few days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not an easy issue and it is not going to be assisted by people taking rigid, uncompromising positions. I do not believe that anybody can regard the position being taken by the federal government as being rigid and uncompromising. We are trying to find a solution to a difficult issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to all of the opinion formers in this country, including the leaders of the Aboriginal community&mdash;and I have seen some remarks attributed to at least one of those leaders in the past 48 hours which were quite unfair in the description given to the attempts my government has made to find a reasonable solution to this problem&mdash;that we want practical reform to make the Native Title Act more workable. I want to give certainty to the pastoralists of this country, I want to give certainty to the mining industry and I want to protect the common law rights of the Aboriginal people. Our discussion paper and our goals in this area have been fashioned around those three objectives and I believe that what my government has put forward is the speediest, most effective and most practical way of achieving those three goals.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. What are the defects under the existing industrial relations legislation, enacted by the previous government, for dealing with the unfair dismissal of employees?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="1271" SPEAKER="Reith, Peter, MP" NAMEID="WI4" ELECTORATE="Flinders" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Industrial Relations" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question and I take the opportunity to congratulate him on his excellent maiden speech today. He will be in this parliament for many years to come. He has asked a very relevant question. There is no doubt that, of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> all the many defects of the existing legislation, particularly for small business, the one that has caused so much angst in the small business community has been the Brereton unfair dismissal law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If someone has been unfairly sacked, then they should have a right of appeal. But that basic principle is not really in contention here. What many people in the small business community properly feel is that the current system just does not work; it is not really fair to anybody. In fact, the current system seems to be designed more to destroy jobs than to provide any support for people who might have been unfairly dismissed. There is no question that the current system is tainting the whole of the work force and thereby proving to be a significant disincentive for many people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me in a practical way give the House some examples of some of the cases that have occurred under the existing system. I have been talking about small business, but the system has also had an impact in a wider way. For example, after there was careful examination of certain allegations, a university lecturer was sacked. The allegations essentially amounted to a claim that the university lecturer had sought sexual favours from female students on the basis that they would get better marks. Effectively, he was sacked by the university; under the Brereton law, he was reinstated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second case involved a major airline in Australia. An employee was using company records to harass both female employees and female customers of that particular airline. This bloke was given a fair hearing and he was sacked. In my view he should have stayed sacked; but, under the Brereton law, he was reinstated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact for small business was highlighted in a very practical way last year when one of the small business organisations, as part of its regular advice to a small business that had received an unfair dismissal claim, said that if the matter got to a hearing the small business ought to put aside two weeks on average just for the matter to be heard. Mr Speaker, think of that from a practical point of view. If you are running a small business <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1272"> yourself, putting aside two weeks is a major problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And that is if they get to a hearing. Many cases are being settled. Why are they being settled? Because the legal advice has been that the average cost to defend such a claim under the existing system is about $8,000. The unfortunate truth of the matter is that, when a small business talks to their local solicitor, a lot of the time the local solicitor says, `If you want to make a commercial decision, you might as well offer them five grand, even though the claim might be completely baseless, because it will save you two weeks in court and possibly eight or 10 grand in legal fees.' That amounts to a form of blackmail and is unfair to all parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that this system has to change. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> had a very good editorial on this in February this year just after the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, had said that he also thought there ought to be some change. The editorial said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is needed is a complete repeal of the federal dismissal laws and their replacement with Commonwealth-state legislation based on the key aspects of the existing state laws.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are the existing laws. I believe that the defects of this existing system are very apparent and obvious to all. On that basis, we ought to have an expeditious change to that law so as to provide some relief for small business and, even more importantly, by providing that relief give a lot of people the chance to get a job that they have been denied under the existing system.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

The first agreement that Alexander Downer and I reached within minutes of being sworn in was to spare the world a particular agony: we agreed we would not send our portrait photographs to the embassies of the world.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the member for Mallee that I am aware there was a meeting this morning on the other side of Parliament House between the Greens, the Australian Democrats and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1273"> Labor senators as they form this unholy axis to do battle against the coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of the Greens it is a bit curious. Why is it curious with respect to the Greens? Because they went to the election standing up for the environment, I would have thought, yet their first move is to vote against a series of initiatives totalling $1 billion in value to get the environment right in Australia&mdash;to help deal with soil degradation, to help reverse soil salinisation and to improve our coastal areas. The Greens are joining this unholy alliance to vote against a $1 billion environment package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we have the Democrats. The Democrats are the real vandals of democracy in this country. They are attacking the real mandate of the coalition government. I think it is time to examine their mandate claims. I reveal to the House that when, on 2 March, people chose to vote Democrat for the Senate and then exercised their preferences, in Victoria 42.5 per cent of the voters gave their preferences to the coalition; Tasmania, 44.4 per cent; South Australia, 46.2 per cent; New South Wales, 46.6 per cent; Queensland, 48 per cent; and Western Australia, 49.3 per cent. The real point is, clearly, almost half the people who voted for the Democrats voted for John Howard to be Prime Minister of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And then we come to the Labor Party. They are the classics. What they are doing&mdash;and they do not like hearing this&mdash;is voting against better pay for blue&hyphen;collar workers; they are voting against the industrial relations legislation by joining this alliance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition does have a mandate to get on with the job. We have a mandate which will see our legislation properly presented to the Senate. I reveal one other development which has not yet been focused on: the decision by the Senate to send the Telstra bill not to a legislation committee but to a references committee of the Senate.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate that. I am delighted to reflect, as the member for Batman invited me to, on what is contained in the legislation. I can tell the member for Batman a few things that are not contained in the legislation. To start with, the legislation does not continue the legal monopoly over the bargaining process now enjoyed by the trade union movement of Australia. Secondly, the legislation does not continue the prejudice against youth unemployment contained in existing legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third thing is that it does not continue the prejudice against employers and employees making their own bargains. The fourth thing the legislation does not contain is the immunity which is now contained in legislation which allows unions to conduct predatory conduct to destroy thousands of small businesses in Australia. I am also happy to say that the legislation, fifthly, does not contain <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the preference for unionists contained in existing industrial legislation. Sixthly, the legislation does not contain the de facto protection for compulsory unionism. Seventhly, it does not contain a bias against those who want to make workplace agreements with their employers. Eighthly, it does not continue the collectivist approach to industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ninthly, and very importantly, not only will this legislation not discriminate against people who want to exercise freedom of choice at the workplace&mdash;not only will people be allowed to join or not join a union according to their choice&mdash;but, unlike the member for Hotham and the member for Batman when they ran the ACTU, this legislation will allow workers to decide whether or not to join a union; and, tenthly, having decided to join a union, they can join the union of their choice. That represents 10 responses of mine to the invitation of the member for Batman. Eleventhly, it does not contain a provision for a $3.05 per hour youth wage, nor might I assure the member for Batman does it contain a provision for a $3.05 per hour youth wage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The attempt by the Labor Party to represent this legislation as in some way bringing in a youth wage is a pathetically dishonest attempt to misrepresent the provisions of this legislation. This legislation represents a new era in  Australian workplace relations. This legislation will do more to boost the productivity of Australian firms than any piece of legislation presented to this parliament over the last 20 years and, much to the annoyance of those who sit opposite, this legislation will improve the job prospects of young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will enable young Australians to have more job opportunities and encourage the employers of this country to employ more young Australians. As much as the opposition might not like it, when this legislation is introduced and the Australian people understand its ramifications, they will see yet again that&mdash;so far from you people being the friends of the working people of Australia&mdash;the true champions of the working men and women of Australia now sit on this side of the parliament. </PARA>

<ANSWER PAGE="1276" SPEAKER="Howard, John, MP" NAMEID="ZD4" ELECTORATE="Bennelong" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In responding to the honourable member for Batman, there were four elements of the legislation that I did not touch on. I take the opportunity afforded by this question from the member for Robertson to touch on those. He asked me what were the disabilities for small business of existing legislation covering industrial relations. There are more than four in fact, but let me confine myself to four.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first of those was dealt with very adequately by the Minister for Industrial Relations when he talked about the unfair dismissal laws. All of those newly&hyphen;elected members&mdash;members like the members for Paterson and Parramatta, both of whom made their maiden speeches this morning; they were both first&hyphen;class contributions to this parliament&mdash;have touched on what I think would have been the experience of all of us during the recent election campaign: that, if you spoke to the men and women in small business in this country, the issue right at the top of their complaints list was the unfair dismissal law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unfair dismissal law, which has been responsible for destroying more jobs over the last three years than any other legislative act of the former government&mdash;the pride and joy of Laurie Brereton&mdash;without any warning, without any commitment, without any mention, without any mandate, without any electoral authority and without consultation, was dumped by Laurie Brereton on the Australian public before the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was the explanation? You did not get it from the former minister. You got it from the now President of the ACTU, Jennie George. When interviewed on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> program not long after the 1993 election she was asked, `Don't you understand, Ms George, that the employers of Australia object to this legislation? They haven't been consulted about it.' Do you know what she said? She said, `What the employers of Australia have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> got to understand is that they lost the election and we won it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was the attitude. That was winner takes all legislation. Unlike the Australian Labor Party, we took our plans about industrial relations reform to the Australian people at the last election and they overwhelmingly voted for those plans, and that is why we are going to introduce them. So the first thing that is wrong about the present industrial relations laws for the small business community of Australia is the rotten, job destroying unfair dismissal laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second weakness of those laws is the way in which after the 1993 election you destroyed the effectiveness of the secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act. Those provisions were brought in by the Fraser government in 1977. I am very proud to say that as Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs I authored those changes. I can well remember my discussions with the former Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, and the head of the Public Sector Union in 1978. They bitterly opposed those changes. They knew that those changes were going to make it very difficult and very painful for unions to destroy the business operation of many small firms in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it had not been for section 45D, the National Farmers Federation would never have won its historic battle at Mudginberri in 1985. If it had not been for section 45D, the former Queensland government would never have triumphed over unionism during the south&hyphen;east Queensland power dispute. If it had not been for section 45D, many small businesses in Australia would have been driven to the wall. What was your response to that? Your response was to destroy the effectiveness of 45D and to expose small businesses to that kind of blackmail and thuggery. So that is the second weakness in the existing laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other two weaknesses are that the existing laws do not allow enough flexibility for people to combine their work and their family responsibilities. Many small firms are only too willing to make arrangements with their employees to allow those employees more effectively to combine their work and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1277"> family responsibility. But, unfortunately, the rigidity of the award system prevents that being fully realised. So we are going to do something about that&mdash;and you will find enormous benefits in the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, and most importantly, for the first time in Australia's industrial relations history this legislation will allow people who genuinely want to make bargains at the workplace level without the unwanted, undesired and unnecessary intrusion of third parties, to make those arrangements to organise their workplaces in a manner which will boost productivity and protect the job security of the people employed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of all the groups in the Australian community who will benefit most from the workplace relations legislation to be introduced this afternoon, it will be the small business community of Australia&mdash;and that is why they will support us in even greater numbers at the election in three years time.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

I suppose I should get the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith to sign it as a memento of his time because I can promise him that it won't look like this for much longer. One of the two great bike riders of the parliament! Section 122(1A) of the existing act states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following matters are examples of the matters in relation to which it may be directed under subsection (1) that preference is to be given:</PARA>
<PARA>They are only examples, so understand that this is not a complete list. But it is quite amazing to pull it out and read it. These are the provisions:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) engagement in employment;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) promotion;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) regrading;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) taking annual leave;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(g) overtime;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(h) vocational training.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, you can be at work and you can be as good a worker as the person working alongside you, yet merely for the fact that you exercised your democratic right not to be in a union, you can have an employer pick the other one in preference to you, simply because of that fact. In other words, your entitlement, for example, to annual leave can be subjugated to this principle of preference under the existing law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is absolutely incredible. In a society that prides itself on giving people a fair go and treating people on their merits, we have a system which has institutionalised a system of discrimination against people on the basis that they decide not to be a member of a union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It goes further than that because these matters can be in an award, you can be a small business operator under an award and you are required by law to discriminate against a person because they are not in a union. So it is a basic breach of one of the great tenets of this country&mdash;that is, that people are entitled to a fair go, to be treated <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on their merits. That is part of Labor's existing legislation&mdash;a law which must and will be changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of such laws has been over time to destroy and remove the chance for people to have a job. The idea of no ticket, no start in Australia, unfortunately, is commonplace. How many times have honourable members, particularly on this side, had a constituent ring up and say, `I'm being heavied by the union because they require us to join up our people in the union?' I must have had loads of those cases. The Transport Workers Union, for example, is well known in this country. You can be a small business operator, turn up on a site driving your own truck and you will be banned from that site as a result of a law put in place by these people at the behest of the trade union movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It goes beyond these matters of compulsory unionism and preference. Take the existing provisions for certified agreements. They are agreements which are struck at the workplace which are then certified by the Industrial Relations Commission. Under the existing system, those certified agreements are between unions and employers. If you are in a union, as an employee in that workplace, you might have some say&mdash;although in a lot of unions the union members have absolutely no say. But if you are in a business and you are a non&hyphen;union employee, under the existing law there is no requirement for majority support for an agreement. In other words, if the union does the deal with the boss, you get no formal say. If you are a non&hyphen;union member in particular, you have got no look&hyphen;in whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that is basically wrong. It is basically unfair. It is unreasonable that people, simply because they are not in a union, should have their rights taken away from them. That is a situation that cannot last, must not last and I say will not last.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a bit disappointing that we have seen today a move in the Senate by the opposition parties to refer a matter to a Senate committee of a type which in the past has not been used for legislation. The Senate, in the time that they have had a two&hyphen;track system for committees&mdash;references committees and legislation committees&mdash;have never, until the last week <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1279"> or so, sent a legislative proposal off to a references committee. They have always gone to the legislative committees. That was the reason why they set them up. On this occasion they have sent them to the references committees. You can only judge from that that there are some in the Senate who want to obstruct the reasonable passage of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I invite honourable members to think about the consequences of that. It is not as if the proposals which we will be introducing today are new. These proposals have been the subject of intense public debate. In a democracy, you cannot have a better debate than to have a public debate and then to have an election to let the people decide. That is what has happened on this occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The undemocratic feature of this development today is that the existing rules in the industrial relations system were put together under the previous Labor government but they were rejected in the election. Now we have the Democrats siding with the party that was rejected to obstruct the proposals for which the incoming government has a mandate, which the people have asked us to introduce. The reason they have asked us to introduce these measures is that they give people a chance for a job, they give people at work a chance to have a say and, ultimately, these proposals respect and uphold one of the great values of our Australian society&mdash;that is, the right to be treated fairly and on your merits. The current system is unfair. It discriminates against people. It is time that that was brought to an end.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second allegation made in the article is that the parents of Mr Tate are flown once a year at taxpayers' expense to Europe to accompany him. On the basis of the parents being dependants of Mr Tate, the previous government and the previous minister, who is now the member for Holt, concluded that this was in accordance with the guidelines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third allegation is that Mr Tate is paid $49,000 a year more for his post at The Hague than his predecessor, a career officer, was paid. That allegation is also right. But it is not the whole truth. It is not true that the ambassador is paid $49,000 a year more than his predecessor at the Holy See. That is not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> true, because his predecessor at the Holy See was Brian Burke. Remember Brian Burke? That was his predecessor. You appointed Brian Burke, didn't you, or was it Bill Hayden who appointed him? It was you, wasn't it, who appointed Brian Burke? Brian Burke was not paid $49,000 a year less. He was not paid less than Michael Tate; he was paid the same. Brian Burke was paid as a permanent head. There he was, one of the many former discredited premiers of Western Australia, and off he went on the salary of a permanent head.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Holt, in his straitened circumstances, has been interjecting throughout this answer, saying that this was the practice of the previous government. In a doorstop today&mdash;he has to go to the Reps' entrance now and do the doorstop to try to get publicity; to get the motormouth on television night after night&mdash;he said these salaries of the Labor appointees `were based on a practice adopted by federal coalition governments in the past'. That is what you said. `All this information was on the public record at the time that each appointment was made.' Remember that: `All this information was on the public record at the time that each appointment was made.' Then he went on to make what I thought were some rather puerile party&hyphen;political points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But he is wrong, because all this material was not on the public record. What was on the record was this minute which was sent to former Senator Evans, signed by the assistant secretary for staffing in the department. That minute states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite an extensive search of Departmental archives we have been unable to locate the files of "political appointees" for the period 1979&hyphen;86.</PARA>
<PARA>Oh! You did not say that at your doorstop this morning. This is the department's view. Whom would you believe&mdash;the member for Holt or the department? Take your pick. It further states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do know that several earlier political appointees were paid at a senior Public Service level, but at a lesser rate than Secretary level, eg.

<PARA>Oh, dear! The Liberals didn't pay them as much as you paid your mates.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this afternoon to address what I regard as one of the most serious issues confronting Australia as a nation at this particular point in time. I refer to our obligation as a nation to ensure that we protect and give opportunities to our most important resource, namely, our young people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a country, we must ensure that we have strong leadership that is capable of guaranteeing that, when they go to work, young people have the opportunity to access decent training opportunities and, in doing so, that they are safeguarded at work with respect to having a system in place which guarantees decent rates of pay and conditions of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is on that question that I refer to what I regard as the failure of the current government with respect to the proposed cut in youth wages and the question of continuing support for real training and employment opportunities for young people. In that context, I also refer in passing to the miserable performance of the previous coalition government, prior to 1983, not just with respect to the question of our young, but with respect to the nation at large. With that in mind, can I say that, when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was last in office&mdash;and I would remind the House&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="1" SPEAKER="SPEAKER" NAMEID="10000">
<TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Prime Minister was in office as the Treasurer <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1285"> of this nation, and when the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), served as a policy adviser to representatives in that government, the Prime Minister left Australia in a state of disarray. In 1983, he left a legacy of a spiralling underlying rate of inflation of 10.5 per cent, and an unemployment rate of 10 per cent. That is why he was known at the time as the double digit Treasurer&mdash;double digit John Howard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that time, Australia was basically at industrial war. An industrial war was in place in Australia because of the failure of the Prime Minister, who was then the Treasurer, to put in place a reasonable wages policy and to pursue an approach to life that was based on cooperation and goodwill in the workplace. With that legacy in mind, our responsibility was to try to reshape Australia and to take Australia forward. We had to ensure that, as a nation, we had the ability not only to compete locally but also to compete on an equal footing with other nations in the international arena in the light of increasing globalisation of the world economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our first responsibilities were, for example, to reduce the level of industrial disputation by something in the order of 60 per cent based on the current figures; to lock in a low rate of inflation; and to give workers and their families better opportunities through the development of decent programs, such as through lowering taxes&mdash;including, I might say, for the corporate world. People should not forget the level of corporate taxation that existed under the Prime Minister when he was the Treasurer of this great nation. In government, the Labor Party also addressed the question of improvements in child care, access to decent educational opportunities, and public housing. Those issues are all low on the policy agenda of the current government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to the fact that we pursued superannuation and a decent savings policy and that we sought to increase household disposable income not just by increasing the social wage but also by having a record achievement in job creation. The end result was an increase in disposable income in the order of 40 per cent since 1983, when the member for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Goldstein was last a policy adviser whilst he sat at Monash University and Melbourne University for the purpose of ensuring that his very backward looking approach to public policy in Australia was put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is high time that this nation faced up to the fact that we made a good start in the last 13 years to ensure that we put in place and lock in once and for all equal opportunities at work and at home for our young men and women of Australia. We did not have that opportunity when we assumed power in 1983 because not only was Australia an economic mess and there was industrial war in Australia but also the Prime Minister had left Australia with a record deficit. In dollar terms today that deficit was in the order of $24.5 million or 4.9 per cent of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand why members of the government do not like to hear these hard facts: they do not like to be reminded of their failure to perform when they were last in power in Australia. We were not just concerned with those issues. We were concerned about ensuring that Australia's young were given not only educational opportunities irrespective of where they came from and irrespective of the level of income or the nature of the job that their parents had but also decent opportunities to access tertiary education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know the approach of the member for Goldstein prior to the election of the Labor government in 1983. When he started lecturing at Melbourne University, his first lecture in politics was about what a great lecturer he was. He was only interested in lecturing la creme de la creme, not ordinary working&hyphen;class kids who had been given an opportunity as a result of the previous decisions by the Whitlam Labor government to ensure that all of us, irrespective of where we came from, had access to tertiary education. It did not matter whether you lived at Blacktown in Sydney or Footscray in Melbourne, you were guaranteed an opportunity to pursue a tertiary education opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to that, we are about record job growth. The member for Goldstein likes to forget that, when the current Prime Minister of Australia was last in power, this was his legacy on the employment front&mdash;and I know <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1286"> it hurts: he had 700,000 dead men and women hanging on his shoulders. No wonder he wandered around the nation stooped. But that was not bad enough. He likes to raise the issue of youth unemployment. What was the level of youth unemployment in 1983? This is John Howard's legacy&mdash;158,100 young men and women of Australia were denied employment opportunities and, in association with their denial of employment opportunities under the then Prime Minister, they were denied access to decent wages, conditions of employment and decent opportunities of work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to the question of the training wage and I refer specifically to a speech that was tabled in the House this afternoon given by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training yesterday entitled `Training: pathways to real jobs'. I urge all members of the House to read that speech in detail and consider the hidden agenda that is contained in that speech and in the industrial relations bill that is to be introduced into this House today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A very precise examination of that speech, which has been tabled in this House, takes you back to the coalition's policies of October 1992. Yes, Jobsback. I refer specifically to page 9&mdash;I am sure the member for Goldstein is aware of this particular policy document&mdash;which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a minimum hourly youth wage for youth:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> for 15 to 17 year olds: $3 an hour;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> for 18 to 20 year olds: $3.50 an hour;</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that people do some calculations with respect to the application of the member's speech of yesterday in association with the government's policy of October 1992. This is what it amounts to. Under the provisions flagged by the member for Goldstein yesterday whereby `no young person will be required to take up a training option where their total income would be less than under the income support arrangements', I put it to the House that the real application of that speech is as follows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sixteen&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;old workers can be paid as little as $3.05 an hour. The Jobsback policy of 1992 is calculated on the basis of a 38&hyphen;hour week&mdash;and I assume you don't want <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to take away the 38&hyphen;hour week in association with reducing the hours of work and wages of young people in Australia. From the youth training allowance rate for dependants without children in the age group, which is $232.10 per fortnight, you come up with an hourly rate of $3.05 an hour. Let us go to the 18&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds. They will get little more than about $3.38 an hour, even worse than the policy of October 1992 of $3.50 an hour. That is also calculated on the basis of a devisor of a 38&hyphen;hour week from the youth training allowance rate for dependants without children in the age group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we go to the new industrial relations regime, the so-called bill. I refer the House to the approving authority. What does it say? I refer specifically to the failure of the Prime Minister to answer this question in the House today and I quote from the proposed bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It means any person or unincorporated body declared in writing by the minister&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and it is the current minister in the House&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">administering the Australian National Training Authority Act 1992 to be an approving authority for the purposes of this definition.</PARA>
<PARA>That makes you ponder. That could effectively mean, as I said before, Humphrey B. Bear, Jeff or Felicity Kennett, or even Amanda Vanstone's sister, who is now free from pursuing show trials in Western Australia. Because that is what it really says.</PARA>

If there is one major area of policy which stands out as being the most disastrous failure of the previous government, it is the employment area&mdash;the youth unemployment area in particular.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for pulling me up on that point. I shall observe the courtesy. The member for Batman told us that the former government had put into place policies which provided real and genuine training to young people. Youth full&hyphen;time unemployment today, at 27&half; per cent or thereabouts, is as high as it was when that program was introduced two years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Hotham knows only too well, what the former government put into place was a set of programs which did not lead young people on to real jobs. These programs that the member for Batman thinks are so wonderful gave the merry-go&hyphen;round a spin and brought 60 per cent of the young people in those programs right back to the end of the unemployment queues again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sort of training that has traditionally led to real jobs has involved apprenticeship and traineeship opportunities. Last year, near the very end of the former government's tenure in office, the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships was, as a proportion of the work force, the lowest for three decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole apprenticeship system was allowed to atrophy. It did not fit in with the training agenda that you wanted to run. It did not fit in with the training agenda that the ACTU were promoting. The agenda they were <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> promoting forwarded their industrial relations objectives. They were not the slightest bit interested&mdash;they never were interested&mdash;in putting into place a training system which focused on training for young people and led to real jobs. The ACTU wanted to link the centralised wages system with the training system. They wanted to have a highly bureaucratic set of arrangements. Every time they could stamp somebody as having achieved a competency level, regardless of the value of that person to the small business, they wanted more money; they wanted higher wages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So young people have been disastrously disadvantaged by the policy of the former government. There are now 26,500 teenagers in Australia who have been unemployed for more than 12 months, and that number has risen in the last year. I am sure nobody is claiming that it has risen because of the policies of the present government; it has risen because of the policies of the previous government. The coalition is about putting in place training opportunities that will give young people a foothold in real jobs&mdash;the kinds of training opportunities that the former government and its mates in the ACTU refused to accept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They put in place something they called the national training wage award. They did not bother to talk to small business about that award; that award was designed in the smoke-filled rooms of the ACTU. That award put in place proposals and policies which have discouraged small business from taking on trainees, which is why there is such a pathetically low number of trainees in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There could be many more. There could be many more apprenticeships. There could be new kinds of apprenticeships in new industries alongside the traditional kinds of apprenticeships. There could be many more apprenticeship type opportunities in the service sector, in information technology and in multimedia. There could be opportunities across a whole range of new industries. But of course the work practices in those industries very often do not fit the kinds of arrangements the ACTU is prepared to allow Australian governments to put in place.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During his speech, the member for Batman told the House that the labour market programs are currently frozen. Let us leave aside the issue of whether or not the training under those programs is high quality training. It is not the accredited training, according to industry standards, that provides portable qualifications for young people. The member for Batman indicated in another part of his speech that that was the ideal requirement for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1290"> training.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But why is there a constriction at the moment on the availability of funds in this area? It has nothing whatever to do with the decisions of the present government.

We know why we have this matter of public importance before the House today: because of the government's failure of young people by its proposal to cut youth wages and to discontinue any support for real training programs in this country. This really is a cynical exercise by the government, which thinks it can cut youth wages and conditions of work so that it can stand up and wave a flag saying it has brought down youth unemployment. That is basically what this exercise is about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is going about cutting wages and giving employers basically open slather on part-time and casual workers and junior workers. It will be open slather by the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1291"> employers in this country. They are going to have every right to treat people as they wish. That is what is going to happen. The youth will be paid less than the dole. They will get three days of `productive work'&mdash;I think that was the term used&mdash;a week and they will be paid less than the dole for three days work. That is what this cynical exercise is about. The federal government has cleared the way. It is going to cut wages for apprentices, I am sure, and trainees. Their wages will fall as the government makes changes to the Industrial Relations Act and goes ahead with these exercises under the guise of tackling youth unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employers will pay young people for only the time they are on the job, or in `productive employment'. That could be a new term. I am sure some smart employers could turn that around and use it to their advantage by saying, `You've actually been doing some learning. We won't bother paying you for the last three hours because you were not being productive&mdash;you were only learning.' These are the sorts of exercises and the sort of process we are seeing evolve and that is what we could end up with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If and when trainees and apprentices are undertaking training off the job&mdash;at a TAFE college or at some other place where they can receive training&mdash;they will not receive any payment. That sort of exercise is meant to encourage training or to encourage young people to become skilled, but I cannot think of anything worse that we could offer young people. Where is the encouragement to train? There is no encouragement to train. People have always received training as a part of their income. It is under the guise of flexibility, like everything else, that wages will be cut and people will not be paid for training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> We have all been young; we have all had to train&mdash;but as you train you still have to live, you still have to pay the rent, you still have to buy the food, you still have to clothe yourself, you still have the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day expenses of living. That might not have got through yet because we are only into being paid for being productive. If you are not productive, you will not be paid. That is the new regime in Australia. It is not about somebody receiv ing an income because they need an income to live at a certain standard of dignity; it is now only about what you can be paid from productivity&mdash;only if you are productive. We are going down that road.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be seeing falling rates of apprenticeships, traineeships and training in Australia. It will be going backwards. There is certainly a fall, which will mean wages falling below the dole. In Tasmania&mdash;I do not know if it has started elsewhere in Australia&mdash;there is now `dob in an unemployed person'. If the employer does not like you he can ring up about you. If you have fronted up for a job and he says, `Here is $3.05 an hour,' which is the going rate, and you say, `No, I am not going to work for $3.05 an hour,' he can say, `Okay, I am going to dob you in to the dole office.

I cannot see how it is going to go anywhere near increasing full-time work because employers will engage more part-timers and more juniors to do full-time workers' jobs. We are going to do away with any link between three tradesmen and one apprentice. That will go. There will not be any link between tradesmen and apprentices or tradesmen and training. It will be open slather.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An academic in today's press, Ms Barbara Pollack, who specialises in this area, said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> that restructuring the commission's powers to arbitrate on the ratio <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1292"> of apprentices to tradesmen would remove any incentive to training. Of course it will. What other role could it play? It would have to reduce any incentive for training. Why would somebody want to be trained if it is probably going to cost them money? They will probably lose income to go into training. There will be a disincentive in getting people to train.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government did encourage training. It believed in training. It believed in linking training and work in many ways. Many good programs came out of the previous government, such as school&hyphen;to&hyphen;work. Those sorts of programs are excellent programs and should be continued. I can only see them going backwards under this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the previous government we went down the path of locking training and wages together so that we could maintain and educate our young people in the work force to become smarter and better skilled and keep our competitive edge in Asia and in Europe. We talk about being a smarter country so that we can go down that track, but we are not going to become the smarter country; we are going to become the duller country, with fewer skills and with no innovation coming from the other side. We did not hear anything from the minister. He gave us no reason to think that the government has any sort of vision in this area at all other than cutting, going backwards, and reducing people's wages and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has said that it is not going to have any regulations on part-time, casual or junior workers and that business can hire whoever they want to. There is going to be a lot less accountability and fewer regulations. How they are going to make that happen I do not know. Somebody turning up will be offered an hour's work. They will either accept the hour's work or they will not get any further work. That is how it will work, to say nothing about what is going to happen to the scope of hours within awards and within award structures. We do not know how this will work and how it will tie in to people's entitlements to receive unemployment benefits in the future. This government will make it harsher and harsher for people. You either <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> accept what you are told, accept what you are given and sign, or go&mdash;that is going to be the tale. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to join in this debate with some amazement. We have just heard a diatribe from the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) which would take us back to the Great Depression. He talks about everything that was wrong then and how wonderful everything was under a Labor government. He sat in office with the ACTU and did everything possible to prevent young people from getting jobs, from getting real structured training, from learning new trades and from learning to participate in the life of their nation. We have today one of the highest youth unemployment rates this nation has ever seen. It is an absolute disgrace. We know it is a disgrace, and this government is going to try to do something about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also just heard from the member for Lyons (Mr Adams). The member for Lyons seems to assume that this government, in attempting to make some changes that would benefit young people, is out to destroy them&mdash;we are going to beat up on them and we are going to force them into slave wages. Let me tell the member for Lyons something: people work for fair value. Employers in this nation well know that they are not going to get good productive work, nor are they going to improve their own employment situations, if they do not pay decent wages and offer people decent conditions. We all know that. It is axiomatic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our social safety nets in this country, applied through the social security department, allow people a living wage. If people cannot get enough income at work to support themselves, then they will live on the dole instead. What a nonsense to say that we will put up a proposal to try to disadvantage young people who have been so demonstrably disadvantaged under a Labor government over the last 13 years!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us talk about some of the problems we face today in vocational education and training. They are substantial, and I will tell you what: in the eight minutes that I have left to speak, I will not even come close to covering <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1293"> them. Let us start at years 9 and 10 in secondary schools. We have a demonstrable problem in that we are losing out of years 9 and 10 a number of students who are leaving school at that very early age&mdash;not to enter the job market and/or to go on the dole. We are just losing them. We do not know where they are going, but we know that they are disappearing out of the school system. They are bored because there is no structured work for them to do and there is no training that appeals to them. They are the ones who are going to wind up on the streets as the homeless and, ultimately, are going to wind up in the dole queues; they may be those who wind up on drugs or alcohol and with other problems; and they may wind up in the courts and in the justice system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to do something for those kids. I am worried to death about them. It really frightens me. Under the Labor government, our school system has moved away from a concept that we once had&mdash;that there were two streams, if you like, to education. One of the streams was basically those who wanted a good general education, for whatever purpose, and then went on to CAEs or universities in order to get further education and further training. The other stream did both academic studies and vocational trade training at school. The member for Lyons knows that, but the government of the day did away with it. Some time in the 1970s they said that vocational training was second-class education for second-class kids, and they wiped it. Late in the piece, the last government finally started to catch on&mdash;after 13 years of failure&mdash;that the skills base was disappearing, that we were losing skilled tradesmen and that we were losing our capacity to attract people into vocational training. So you started to make some changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> We need for those kids in years 9 and 10 a program that will offer them a couple of days a week at work in some structured training, including training in life skills&mdash;how to get up on time in morning, how to be at the job on time, how to brush your teeth, how to use deodorant, how to present yourself as acceptable to the rest of society, how to stay at work until finish time, how to produce some thing while you are there, as well as how to get on with your work colleagues and do something decent for the company in which you participate&mdash;and two days a week in general education at high school. We have tried a pilot program at Berwick High School in my electorate which has become so successful that we desperately need funding for it. They have heaps of kids that they believe are at risk of leaving the school system and being lost out there in the never&hyphen;never, unrecoverable for a long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will tell you another thing about this group of young people: they generally have very poor literacy and numeracy skills. That will follow them all the rest of their lives. There is a real link between non-attendance at school and lack of literacy. We find links between those who are abusive at school to their fellow students, whether it is violence or whether it is verbal harassment, and poor literacy skills. If you go and talk to the youth organisations, they say that there is a real link between those who are on the streets and need help and those who have poor literacy and numeracy skills. These are young people that needed to have a better go at primary school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Beyond this, in years 11 and 12 we are trying to create some structural training, real vocational education and training, that gives the kids a certificate which they can use as part of their time already spent in TAFE or in a private training institution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, a young person who wants a career in the hospitality industry, as part of their VCE in Victoria, can go to school and take a hospitality course and they can get credit for having done that course which gives them time off in either an apprenticeship, a hospitality traineeship or some other courses they want to do at TAFE.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is such a huge proliferation of training mechanisms, devices and authorities all over this country that nobody understands the system. I defy you to tell me one expert in Australia&mdash;be it a single official in the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, the minister herself, or the member for Goldstein, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), who is now sitting on the front <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1294"> bench&mdash;who would be able to name all of the training programs in Australia. There are something like 89 or 90, maybe even more. Some of those are designed to help the unemployed, some are designed for training, some are designed to provide links between high school and tertiary qualifications and some are just mickey mouse courses to recycle unemployed people from one course to another so they can continue to get their unemployment benefits. And that goes on and on. What we need is a rational, structured and objective training mechanism in Australia. It needs to have some semblance of sense. And we will address that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been some confusion in this debate about what the member for Goldstein had to say yesterday, and let me tell you. I will read you a little bit of his speech.</PARA>

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">AUSTRALIA AT THE TURNING POINT</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Today is an important day for job&hyphen;seekers, for individual Australian workers and their employers, for trade unions and employer organisations, for industrial tribunals and for the community generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill I introduce today represents a break with a system of industrial relations that has been based on a view that conflict between employer and employee is fundamental to the relationship and that an adversarial process of resolving disputes is appropriate and inevitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill rejects the highly paternalistic presumption that has underpinned the industrial relations system in this country for too long&mdash;that employees are not only incapable of protecting their own interests, but even of understanding them, without the compulsory involvement of unions and industrial tribunals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The system of industrial relations which this bill seeks to reform has almost become an end in itself, doing more to protect the interests of those involved in the system, rather than the people the system is supposed to serve. This bill, by contrast, seeks to restore the focus of the system on those who really matter, employees and employers at the workplace and enterprise level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite supposedly being designed to help employees, the system this bill seeks to reform has helped contribute to a long&hyphen;term decline in workers' living standards in Australia, relative to those in many other countries, while contributing to our unacceptably high level of unemployment. Up until the 1980s, the economic deficiencies of our industrial relations system were largely concealed by the strength of this country's agricultural and minerals sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the 1980s saw a significant reduction in the capacity of our primary industries to generate the growth in living standards which Australians had come to expect, and the manufacturing sector had proved to be ill&hyphen;equipped to compete on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> world markets. This resulted in our chronic and growing current account and foreign debt problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP government eventually responded with a series of structural reforms, such as reductions in protection and deregulation of financial markets. However, labour market reform&mdash;the most important type of structural reform needed&mdash;came very late in the process, and was entirely inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout the 1980s, the coalition championed the need for major reform. Many on our side contributed to this debate, both in the parliament and in the wider community. They did so even though they were subject to much vitriol and vilification from the then federal government, which steadfastly defended the centralised system, even as its defects became increasingly obvious to most objective commentators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of this bill is the final vindication for the reformists amongst whom none stand higher than the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). He has capped off the intellectual debate with his political leadership, which has paved the way for the introduction of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">History will record that the intellectual debate, the battle of ideas, was finally won with the concession in 1993 by Paul Keating in a major speech to the Institute of Directors where he said that:</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Australia needed a model of industrial relations `which places primary emphasis on bargaining at the workplace level within a framework of minimum standards provided by arbitral tribunals';</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> `. . . compulsorily arbitrated awards and arbitrated wage increases would be there only as a safety net.'</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> `The safety net would not be intended to prescribe the actual conditions of work of most employees, but only to catch those unable to make workplace agreements with   employers.'</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> `Over time the safety net would inevitably become simpler. We would have fewer awards with fewer clauses.'</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> `For most employees and most businesses, wages and conditions would be determined <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1296"> by agreements worked out by the employer, the employees and their union.'</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> `These agreements would predominantly be based on improving the productive performance of enterprises, because both employers and employees are coming to understand that only productivity improvements can generate sustainable real wage increases.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is now notorious that Mr Keating did not have the necessary leadership skills to deliver an industrial relations system along these lines. As happened on so many occasions under the Hawke and Keating governments, he buckled under pressure from the ACTU.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By delivering on our election policy, Better Pay for Better Work, this bill will deliver the framework for structural reform of the labour market demanded by the imperatives of world competition and warranted by the legitimate expectation of Australians to enjoy improved living standards through higher employment and better paid jobs over time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If anyone has any doubts about the need for genuine reform of our industrial relations institutions and arrangements, they need go no further than the latest ABS statistics which show:</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> an intolerable rate of unemployment, at 8.9 per cent (and a disgraceful 27.8 per cent for our youth);</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> booming current account deficits contributing to our net foreign debt of $185 billion (or almost 40 per cent of GDP);</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> real wages stagnant or falling over most of the Labor years, with a deteriorating gap between rich and poor;</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> erratic productivity growth, with industries like the waterfront, that are so critical to our competitiveness, going backwards compared to overseas benchmarks;</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> industrial disputation, while lower than the horrendous heights which marked so much of the postwar period, is still unacceptably high against the yardstick of our competitors, who have been making greater strides toward cooperative workplace relations; and</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> finally, every Australian knows that we still experience some of the highest real interest rates in the developed world, a hurdle made <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> so much harder to overcome given the `black hole' legacy left by Mr Beazley to the tune of some $8 billion in our national finances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Structural rigidities in the labour market are a major contributor to those sorry outcomes. We can and must do better. We know from experience that what we have doesn't work. Australia needs a fresh start. This bill provides just that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, this bill is about providing employers and employees with much greater choice about how to regulate their relationships, in a way that accommodates changing societal and economic trends and which is focused on delivering better outcomes rather than propping up outdated institutional arrangements for their own sake, regardless of their adverse effects on the livelihood of everyday Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In promoting the cause of flexibility as a legitimate and necessary aim of our policy for the labour market, the coalition's approach to realising that goal also keeps faith with the basic Australian values of ensuring a `fair go' for all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ours is not a model that relies on cutting workers' incomes; we saw enough of that under the accord years. Employees' wages will not be reduced by any provision in this bill, whether in respect of awards or agreements. This bill balances the promotion of flexibility with the provision of statutory protections that ensure:</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> fair dealing, particularly in the areas of termination of employment and the removal of discrimination;</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> fair competition, by removing monopoly rights and compulsory membership of industrial organisations;</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> fair agreement&hyphen;making, underpinned by a set of guaranteed minimum conditions; and</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> fair compliance arrangements, so that people are held to their commitments, once entered into by agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, it was because this balance was so relevant to the current and future needs of our nation that the coalition received an undeniable mandate in the last <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1297"> election. Some five million voters judged our policy on its merits and endorsed it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are returning that vote of confidence by responding, as a matter of priority, in this first session of the parliament, with legislation that does what we promised we would do. Against that benchmark, we are happy for the Democrats to `keep us honest' when the bill reaches the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">CONSULTATIONS ON THE BILL</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the election, we have been concerned to ensure that our policy would be implemented in the most effective way possible. Accordingly, we have consulted widely with employers and employer organisations; with unions and the ACTU; with state and territory governments; with women's organisations and the churches; and with ethnic, community and welfare groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been open to the views put by all these groups, and from many others who have been directly and indirectly involved in the consultative process, including: those who have made written submissions; representatives on the government's Policy Implementation Taskforce; and a wide range of individual commentators and experts. We have benefited considerably from their suggestions on many policy implementation issues, and this is reflected in the bill that is before the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let me make it clear that the fundamentals of the policy itself remain as put to the Australian people on election day.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">OVERVIEW OF THE BILL</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal object of the proposed Workplace Relations Act expresses our intention to establish a framework for cooperative workplace relations which promotes the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The object focuses on giving primary responsibility for industrial relations and agreement&hyphen;making to employers and employees at the enterprise and workplace levels, with the corresponding role for the award system being to provide a safety net of minimum wages and conditions. As a corollary, emphasis is placed on due compliance with awards and agreements, reflecting the responsibilities that properly accompany the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provision and negotiation of industrial rights and entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The object also gives priority to ensuring freedom of association, with democratic and accountable employer organisations and trade unions that employers and workers, respectively, are free to join or not join. Finally, the object of the proposed act gives expression to the social importance of avoiding discrimination and assisting employees to balance their work and family responsibilities effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I would now like to elaborate on some of the key elements of this bill to explain how the government's reforms are to be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our legislation puts the emphasis on direct workplace relationships, and on the mutual interest of employer and employee in the success and prosperity of the enterprise. The bill promotes a legislative framework, without unnecessary complexity or unwanted third party intervention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Above all, the legislation is designed to empower employers and employees to make decisions about relationships at work, including over wages and conditions, based on their appreciation of their own interests.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Unfair Dismissal</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, most fair&hyphen;minded observers would acknowledge the absolute disaster that was Labor's unfair dismissal laws&mdash;interventionist regulation that depressed small business confidence, discouraged investment and diverted the attention of industry from its prime task of making workplaces more efficient and providing more real jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is replacing Labor's failed arrangements with a new unfair dismissal scheme&mdash;a system which provides employees with access to a fair and simple process of appeal against dismissal, based on the principle of a fair go all round. It is a scheme that:</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> is fair to both employee and employer;</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> ensures legalism is minimised, while discouraging frivolous and malicious claims; and</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> is in line with Australia's international obligations. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1298">
<PARA>A new jurisdiction will be put in place for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, empowering it to consider whether a termination of employment was harsh, unjust or unreasonable, and to create new entitlements accordingly, by way of orders, where appropriate, which will be enforceable in a court. An applicant will be able to be represented by a registered organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This jurisdiction will apply only in the traditional federal area of coverage. Terminating employment on certain proscribed grounds will be unlawful, reflecting the current legislation, with the addition of protection against dismissal where an employee fails to sign an Australian workplace agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission will be required to attempt to settle an unfair dismissal claim by conciliation, and if conciliation is unsuccessful, by arbitration. Where it determines that a remedy is appropriate, the commission will have to consider its possible effect on the viability of the employer's business. This will allow the special circumstances of small business to be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission will be able to grant reinstatement, and ancillary orders in respect of lost pay, or if reinstatement would be inappropriate, such payment in lieu of reinstatement as the commission thinks appropriate. The commission will also be able to order payment of costs in cases of applications instituted vexatiously or without reasonable cause.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Award System</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to consider the impact of our reforms on the award system. At the outset, let me state that the government has maintained its commitment to ensure that all employers and employees with federal award coverage will have the choice of remaining on their awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the role of the commission, the scope of awards, and arrangements for their adjustment, need to be consistent with and reinforce the role of awards as a genuine safety net. This is important for the viability of the wage system&mdash;to ensure its capacity to provide safety net protection, to encourage <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> agreement&hyphen;making and to meet overall economic objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission's role in relation to wages will focus on the setting of minima&mdash;it will not generally be able to arbitrate claims above the minimum safety net. The mechanism by which the commission adjusts safety net rates of pay and other award minima will not be prescribed in the legislation. This will be a matter for the commission to determine, through a review of wage principles, within the framework and objects of the legislation and after hearing the submissions of all the parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consistent with the focus of awards on safety net minimum wages and conditions, the commission's jurisdiction, and thus the capacity of the parties, to incorporate matters in awards will be confined to certain allowable matters. The bill provides for a full bench of the commission to establish principles relating to the future handling of these matters, as it has done in the past with its existing award jurisdiction. All matters beyond those specified in the legislation should generally be determined at the enterprise or workplace level, whether in formal agreements or informally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, conciliation will be available with respect to all matters, including agreements. When conciliating, and if requested by the parties, the commission will be required to make a recommendation by consent to resolve differences, provided it is satisfied that the parties will abide by the recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the date of commencement of the new act, new awards will not be able to contain matters other than those allowed by the statute. Transitional arrangements will apply whereby parties to existing awards are encouraged and assisted to simplify their awards to focus on the allowable terms and conditions, with other matters addressed by agreement. After 18 months, any disallowed matters remaining in awards will not be enforceable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such reforms to awards will deliver critical changes that were acknowledged by the previous government as necessary, but which it failed to put into place because of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1299"> straitjacket of its accord relationship with the ACTU.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission will also be reviewing awards to ensure that provisions are more flexible and geared to the needs of individual enterprises and workplaces. In particular, restrictions on regular part&hyphen;time work will be removed from the award system. Such part&hyphen;time work, with pro rata entitlements to the conditions available to full&hyphen;time workers, and reasonable predictability in the manner in which hours are worked, will be a boon for many workers who, for reasons such as family responsibilities, are either unable or do not wish to work full&hyphen;time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With awards concentrating on safety net minimum standards, new paid rates awards will not have a role in the wage system. Existing paid rates awards will be subject to the award simplification process applying to awards generally and, over time and after consultation, will be treated in the same way as minimum rates awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All current legislative provisions relating to paid rates awards will be repealed and the commission will no longer have the power to make such awards. Current entitlements for the allowable matters under such paid rates awards will be protected, with any changes being subject to the commission's wage principles. It is expected that parties to these awards will make agreements that determine the detailed remuneration and working arrangements to apply, as most have done to date via certified agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because awards will be simplified, there will be more choice about how work is to be organised at the workplace. With simplified awards, employers and employees will find themselves talking to each other more about how they would like to organise, to their mutual benefit, matters that, until now, have been dictated to them by the award.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Junior rates of pay will be retained to protect the jobs of thousands of young people whose employment prospects would be jeopardised if they were abolished from awards, as Labor intended. However, as appropriate, support is provided for improved training arrangements through trainee wages <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in awards. Provision for supported wages for employees with disabilities is also made.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Agreement&hyphen;making</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this bill, the options for agreement&hyphen;making will be significantly expanded and simplified. Employers and employees in the federal jurisdiction will be able to choose whether they want informal over&hyphen;award arrangements, or whether they want to formalise their agreements. For those who want formalised individual agreements, we have provided Australian workplace agreements, AWAs. If they prefer formalised collective agreements, they will be able to choose certified agreements, CAs, made with unions or made directly between employers and employees. For those who want agreements under a state jurisdiction, we are providing access to such agreements, bearing in mind that it is a matter of consent for the parties if they choose to go that way. The bill does not discriminate in favour of one form of agreement over another&mdash;collective or individual, union or non&hyphen;union. These are matters for decision by employers and employees, according to their own circumstances and their own perception of how their interests are best served.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both Australian workplace agreements and certified agreements have been designed to meet the objectives of placing the primary responsibility for industrial relations with employers and employees at the workplace, and reducing the complexities imposed by the current system. However, agreement&hyphen;making under the government's legislation will be subject to a set of statutory minimum conditions to ensure due protection for workers.</PARA>
<PARA>(i)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Minimum Conditions</PARA>
<PARA>Both AWAs and CAs will have to meet these minimum conditions. Consistent with our election guarantee, pay must be no less than that prescribed under the relevant award&mdash;whether you are a regular worker, a casual or a pieceworker. Other guaranteed minima cover conditions relating to annual leave; personal/carer's leave; parental leave; long service leave; equal pay for work of equal value; and jury service.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1300">
<PARA>(ii)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Australian Workplace Agreements (AWAs)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A major innovation in the bill is the establishment of AWAs, allowing agreements to be reached directly between an employer and his or her employee(s). The government accepts that greater emphasis on flexibility and self&hyphen;regulation under AWAs must be accompanied by appropriate employee protections and sanctions against those who abuse the flexibility we are providing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AWAs will be formalised simply, by being filed with the Employment Advocate, EA. The EA will be an independent statutory officer whose powers and functions are laid down in the legislation. The Office of the Employment Advocate will be established as a distinct entity to facilitate the operation of AWAs and foster proper understanding and application of the opportunities, rights and obligations provided for by the new act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Advice to employees on statutory entitlements and services of the EA will also be required by the legislation, and the EA will provide employers with readily accessible information and pro forma material for this purpose. This will enhance access to the system for thousands of individuals who have understandably steered clear of it, because they don't have the time to waste interpreting complexities that have been generated over the years by the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Procedures for filing AWAs will be straightforward. A simple declaration will be made by the employer that the statutory requirements for the AWA have been met&mdash;most notably, that the AWA provides terms and conditions which are no less favourable than the statutory minimum conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The EA will not vet the agreement before it comes into effect, and all agreements will be confidential to the parties, as they should be. There is no conspiracy of secrecy here. Current overaward arrangements, which are not tested by any third party, can't be accused of secrecy simply because they are not subject to public disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Complaints relating to non&hyphen;observance of AWAs, including breaches of the minimum conditions, may be taken to the EA for invest igation, and following investigation and conciliation, can be taken to a court. Thus, if a worker has not received any of the legislated minimum conditions&mdash;or any other entitlements in the agreement&mdash;and if that complaint is substantiated, employers will be liable to a $10,000 penalty for breach of the agreement, as well as whatever recovery of entitlements is due to the employee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The use of duress to obtain an AWA will, where a complaint is upheld, lead to its invalidation, appropriate orders by the court, including rectification by the parties, and/or a penalty. The EA will be empowered to investigate complaints of duress in the making of AWAs. In the course of reaching AWAs, there will be a right to take protected action. However, there will be no such right during the period of operation of an AWA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are relying on a range of constitutional powers for AWAs, particularly the corporations power. Provision is made for the states, by complementary legislation, to expand the coverage of AWAs to employers and employees outside the scope of those powers.</PARA>
<PARA>(iii) Certified Agreements (CAs)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current certified agreement provisions are being revised substantially. Transitional arrangements apply to cover existing agreements, including Enterprise Flexibility agreements, provision for which is being repealed. We will again rely on a range of constitutional powers to support the new provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New simplified arrangements will make CAs more accessible and able to be finalised more efficiently. An agreement will be able to apply to all employees to which an agreement applies within the enterprise, subject to majority endorsement. The majority approval requirement will obviate the need for the present complex consultation requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">CAs may also be made directly with employees. This mechanism will replace Labor's failed enterprise flexibility agreements, of which there have been few, because the provisions invite an intrusive and unwarranted role for unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a union wishes to make an agreement, or to participate in negotiations as a principal party or on behalf of members, it must have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1301"> a member in the enterprise concerned whose industrial interests it can represent. In the case of agreements made directly between an employer and employees, a union will be able to represent any member in discussions with the employer and, if it so chooses, may become a party to the final agreement if a member so requests&mdash;although the union may choose not to be bound by the final agreement. However, the agreement must still be approved by a majority of the employees to be covered, whether or not a union is involved. Special provisions will accommodate greenfields sites, so that agreements can be struck in advance of a business becoming operational.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the enterprise&hyphen;based focus of the agreement system, it is appropriate that the capacity for multi&hyphen;employer agreements to be certified should be tightly circumscribed and involve testing against the public interest by a full bench of the commission. The consent of all employers and the majority of the employees to be covered by the agreement will be required. Protected action will not be available in the making of such agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provisions relating to protected action for bargaining for single business CAs will be retained, in modified form, but any industrial action during the specified period of operation of an agreement will be prohibited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to certification, the commission will test agreements to ensure the statutory minima are met. In that regard, as is the case with Labor's no disadvantage test, the minimum pay guarantee may be satisfied on a collective basis. Thus, the guarantee may be met for each employee of a particular kind covered by an agreement if the commission considers that, when considered overall, the wages payable to all employees of that kind under the agreement satisfy the minimum pay requirement. This will facilitate the ready handling of certification of agreements by the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In agreements with cashed&hyphen;up penalty rates and annualised salaries, for example, the minimum pay requirement will be satisfied if earnings under the agreement at least match what could reasonably be expected to have otherwise applied under the award at the time <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of certification. There would be no ongoing test against the statutory minima, unless provided for by the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also responded to concerns raised by various women's groups and community organisations by retaining absence of discrimination as a precondition to certification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the bill contains a requirement for a triennial report on agreement&hyphen;making to be produced, covering the operation of AWAs and CAs.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Freedom of Association and Organisational Arrangements</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to address the key issue of freedom of association and the role of registered organisations under the bill. Among the fundamental principles underpinning the government's industrial relations policy, are the principle of freedom of association&mdash;including the choice whether or not to be in a union or employer organisation&mdash;and the principle that all Australians be treated equally before the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the government's proposed legislation, employees will be able to make choices about union membership and, if they wish to be in a union, they will be able to join any union whose eligibility rules cover them. They could set up an enterprise union of their own. They could establish a union with special skills and service delivery to suit them, without artificial limits that protect current union monopolies. If they believe the `super union' which covers them is too distant from its grass roots, they can vote to establish an enterprise branch, or vote to support disamalgamation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission will be denied jurisdiction over preference in employment. Existing award provisions providing for preference will cease to have effect. Under the bill, individuals, including independent contractors, will be protected against coercion to join or not to join an organisation or to cease to be a member of an organisation. Closed shops will be abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is not anti&hyphen;union, and our legislation is not an attack on unions. The legislation will assist unions who are seeking <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1302"> to be effective in providing a good service to their members.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Far from withering away, entrepreneurial unions will succeed in this environment. Some in the union movement know this is their future and are already responding by looking at innovative approaches to providing services for their members. I support this development as an early and promising response to the new environment of choice that lies in front of us and is supported by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To support that development and to overcome the union monopoly situation conferred by the current act, the `conveniently belong' restrictions on registration and changes to eligibility rules will be repealed. The new provisions will assist in the establishment of new unions, including enterprise unions. The existing requirement that, to be registered, a union must be capable of being a party to an interstate dispute, will not apply. The minimum registration requirement will be lowered, from 100 to 20 members. The maximum annual income for organisations to be subject to less demanding financial accounting requirements will be raised from $10,000 to $20,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mindful of the possibility of adverse effects for innocent third parties from greater competition between unions, the bill provides powers to the commission to make orders about the representative rights of organisations. This will allow it to make orders to deal with disputes between registered unions over the representation of workers where there are actual or imminent harmful effects on an employer's operations. In making any orders, the commission will have to take account of the views of employees involved, and the effect on the operations of the employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Provision in the bill to allow for the disamalgamation of federally registered unions recognises that there may be situations where amalgamations turn out to be unsatisfactory. Amalgamations occurred after 1991 in the context of pressured circumstances&mdash;for example, new provisions of the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993 designed to force small unions into such relationships. There should be an avenue for members to deal with unsustainable situations where disamalgam ation provides a basis for more effectively representing their interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, and subject to a majority being in favour of disamalgamation, the Federal Court will be able to approve the disamalgamation and make appropriate orders about the fair division of the assets and liabilities, and any other matters necessary to be dealt with to implement the disamalgamation fairly. In the legislation, and reflecting the new objects that are proposed, we have moved to strengthen the powers of the industrial registrar to ensure that organisations meet the financial accountability and reporting requirements of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consistent with our view that uninvited intervention by unions in workplaces should be addressed, the current provisions in the act relating to the rights of unions to enter workplaces are restricted under our bill to unions with members who have requested them to visit their workplace. Finally, the Trade Union Training Authority Act 1975 is also being repealed through this bill, allowing for the winding up of the authority's operations. The government considers that it should be the responsibility of unions and their members, rather than the taxpayer, to provide the wherewithal for union training.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Compliance</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The existing compliance arrangements in the federal industrial legislation do not strike a fair balance and have been overhauled. Consistent with the generally accepted principles of collective bargaining, industrial action will be permitted in certain circumstances. Provided conditions are met, there will be a right to take such action and a right to lock out in relation to bargaining for a single business CA or an AWA. However, there will be effective legal remedies available to those who suffer harm from illegitimate industrial action. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondary boycotts are not an acceptable form of industrial action. Accordingly, meaningful secondary boycott provisions will be restored to the Trade Practices Act 1974, and the relevant provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 will be repealed. The current provisions effectively allow unions to hold sectors of the economy to ransom for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1303"> three days at a time. This is inimical to an internationally competitive economy. The commission will be able to conciliate where a federally registered union is involved in a boycott, but there will be no requirement for a specific period of conciliation before legal action may be initiated by firms which are affected by boycotts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission will continue to have powers to facilitate bargaining for CAs and to suspend or terminate the bargaining period, particularly where genuine bargaining is not occurring or where there is risk of serious harmful effects for the economy or the community. In handling the latter case involving critical situations, the powers of the commission will be closely circumscribed, emphasising the need for conciliation to be exhausted before any consideration is given to arbitration. Any such arbitration will generally be confined and be undertaken by a full bench consistent with principles established by the commission, and taking account of how productivity might be improved in the business concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industrial action other than for genuine bargaining for agreements is not compatible with the norms of the system and will not be protected. Existing restrictions and delays inserted by the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993 on access to remedies for such industrial action will be removed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission will have powers to give directions to stop or prevent unprotected industrial action. This will apply to any matters within its jurisdiction, including inter&hyphen;organisational disputes&mdash;for example, demarcation&hyphen;representation disputes. The Federal Court of Australia will be able to enforce such directions by injunctions and will be able to award damages and sequester funds. Parties suffering from illegal industrial action will have access to effective legal redress, including injunctions and/or damages. Industrial action that continues in breach of such directions from the court will be in contempt of court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission will also continue to be able to exercise its existing powers in relation to unprotected industrial action&mdash;that is, stand down provisions; refraining from hearing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> matters where a party is not complying with an award, order, direction or recommendation; suspension or cancellation of awards; and orders in relation to industrial action in the Commonwealth and territory public sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Non&hyphen;compliance with an order will provide a new ground for deregistration. Deregistration matters will be dealt with by the Federal Court. It will be unlawful: for an employer to pay strike pay; a union, or its representatives, to take industrial action to pursue strike pay; or for an employee to accept strike pay.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Minimum Entitlements</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to provisions relating to unfair dismissal, a range of other minimum entitlements provisions, dependent on the external affairs power, were introduced by the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993. They concern minimum wages, equal remuneration for work of equal value, termination of employment, and parental leave. As each jurisdiction has adequate machinery to deal with minimum wages and equal remuneration, these provisions are redundant and will be repealed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principle of equal pay for work of equal value is enshrined in the legislation as a factor in setting minimum award wages by the commission and as a minimum condition for AWAs and CAs. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will continue to provide the means for complaints against alleged discrimination in the overaward area to be dealt with.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, at this point and before concluding, let me put to flight any suggestion that the government is, through this bill, diminishing the standing of the commission. Certainly, the commission's role will change, as must that of any institution for it to adapt to the dynamics of society and operate in a global economy. However, the commission will continue to play an important role in Australian industrial relations. This may be readily appreciated, simply by reviewing aspects of its role, which include:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also introduces certain complementary institutional changes to give the commission's operations greater flexibility and effectiveness. These are:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In keeping with the government's election commitments, the bill provides that the jurisdiction of the Industrial Relations Court of Australia be transferred to the Federal Court of Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, this bill meets the commitment which we made to the Australian people on 2 March this year&mdash;a commitment to put the focus of industrial relations policy on the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill has as a key premise that the simplification of industrial relations processes and formalities is an essential part of our aim to empower individual employers and employees. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People will make different choices between all the available options and we welcome that.

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Government's Approach to Airports</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government recognises that airports are vitally important to the communities and regions which they serve. In circumstances where airport usage is increasing rapidly, passenger and freight users need airports which are operating efficiently, are responsive to user requirements and which deliver the services necessary to meet the requirements of the Australian tourism, export and service industries which depend on air transport to compete in world markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, airports can generate substantial adverse impacts, particularly for the communities located in the immediate vicinity of airports. The government is acutely aware of the aircraft noise issues related to Sydney and Sydney West in particular. Our election commitments therefore included that:</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Sydney and Sydney West would be withdrawn from the airport leasing process until there is a solution to the aircraft noise issues there</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the east&hyphen;west runway would be opened</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a full EIS would be undertaken on Sydney West airport.</PARA>
<PARA>We have already taken decisive steps to deal with these issues, and processes are under way to ensure permanent solutions to aircraft noise issues in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence this bill and the Airports (Transitional) Bill 1996 provide the legislative framework for granting of leases to airport specific companies and the transfer of assets and obligations associated with those airport operations from the Federal Airports Corporation to the companies. They restart a process which stopped under the previous government's heavy-handed approach to Sydney <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> airport and its role in the sales process. We have excised Sydney and Sydney West from the first tranche of sales. The process can thus recommence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bills before the House substantially match those previously put forward by the Labor Party. The sales process demands continuity, if it is to proceed quickly. Given the familiarity of the House with the basic provisions of the regime previously proposed, I will run through the essential provisions and then concentrate on the improvements we have made. These improvements meet our election commitments which reflect the interests of airport users; the interests of local communities; and the interests of bidders.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Government Airports Policy</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's decision to establish long&hyphen;term leasehold arrangements at federal airports will improve the efficiency of airport investment and operations in the interests of users and the general community. Leasing of the airports will facilitate innovative management and greater local involvement and input to decisions on their operation and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Airports deliver highly specialised services to the Australian economy. There will be opportunities for greater autonomy of individual airports post leasing and for airports to cater better for the particular markets which they serve and therefore to meet the needs of local and regional economies.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Aviation regulatory arrangements</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leasing of airports does not change the regulatory arrangements in other areas of the government's aviation policy nor the fundamental roles played by the individual agencies. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority will continue to have primary responsibility for air safety in Australia. Airservices Australia will continue to provide facilities and services required for the operation of the national airways system. Regulatory provisions authorise the establishment and monitoring of quality of service performance indicators and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission scrutiny to back up these aspects of the business.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1306">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the advent of leasing, the government is also aware that significant market power will move from the public sector to the private sector. The government is thus committed to putting into place an appropriate regulatory framework to protect the interests of current and future airport users and local communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, the Federal Airports Corporation operates as a self&hyphen;regulating government authority in respect of land use, planning and building and on&hyphen;airport pollution control. Post leasing, these responsibilities will need to be assumed by the government itself to ensure appropriate public interest regulation of the activities of airport lessees and other users.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as providing a regulatory regime which can replace those regulatory functions currently performed by the FAC, the Airports Bill establishes appropriate transparency and reporting obligations on airport operators. In summary the provisions ensure:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Provisions have been included in the bill on access for new entrants which will trigger the access provisions of the national competition policy reforms.

It is the government's intention to maximise the opportunity for commercial negotiation to solve access issues, but the ACCC may take an arbitration role if negotiation is unsuccessful. This approach will apply at the core regulated airports&mdash;that is, the major 12 FAC airports.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The sale of long&hyphen;term leases over airports currently operated by the Federal Airports Corporation, FAC, forms an important part of this government's privatisation program. The government is confident that the leasing process for the federal airports offers a number of long&hyphen;term benefits to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision to sell long&hyphen;term leases offers benefits to airport users and the community as <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a whole. The leasing process should lead to further improvements in the operating efficiency and quality of service of the airports by exposing them to private sector disciplines. It will also provide an opportunity for the funds of Australians to be productively employed in the provision of national infrastructure through the involvement of superannuation and investment managers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provision of airport infrastructure has traditionally been considered the responsibility of government due to the large amount of capital required. However, today, Australia's capital markets have reached a level of maturity and sophistication capable of supporting the evolving infrastructure requirements of airports. The Commonwealth's involvement in the provision of such infrastructure will no longer be necessary given the protection to public interest considerations afforded by the proposed regulatory regime of the Airports Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The primary purpose of this bill is to put into place a framework to facilitate leasing of all federal airports effectively as ongoing businesses under a two&hyphen;stage sales process. It is proposed that Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth airports will be included in the first phase leasehold sales. Adelaide will also be added to the first tranche consistent with our election commitment, subject to decisions to be taken in the budget. The leasing of Sydney and Sydney West airports will be deferred pending resolution of noise issues at Sydney airport and an environmental impact study being conducted on Sydney West airport. In the meantime, consideration will be given to how best to position Sydney and Sydney West airports for future sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides for the transfer of airport land and other assets from the FAC to the Commonwealth; the granting of leases over the airports and transfer of associated assets to individual airport companies; and the orderly treatment of the FAC's debts during the sales process. Provision has also been made in the bill for the transfer of airport staff employed by the FAC to the airport companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1310"> The companion bill, the Airports Bill 1996, will establish the regulatory regime for air ports post leasing. This regulatory regime is designed to improve the efficiency of airport operations while ensuring the protection of airport user and community interests.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leasing the airports permits the government to retain some control over the land on which the airports are located. The long term of the lease will ensure that sales proceeds are similar to sale under freehold title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sale of long&hyphen;term leases is expected to produce a significant net offset to outlays in the forthcoming financial years. Provision has been made in the bill to allow for the orderly disposal of the FAC's assets and facilitate and account for the leasing process. The transactions associated with these provisions are expected to be budget neutral. As honourable members would appreciate, it would not be appropriate for the government to disclose details of expected proceeds from the leasing of the airports, as it is likely this would influence the outcome of the sale process, possibly reducing proceeds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have indicated, a number of measures designed to facilitate the leasing of the federal airports are contained in the bill now before the House. These measures provide for the land and associated assets of the FAC to be transferred to the Commonwealth, as well as provide for the Commonwealth to grant a lease over land at a particular airport to a company referred to as an airport lessee company. Following this, the bill provides the government with a flexible disposal strategy to grant an airport lease to a company either established by the Commonwealth or the purchaser. In both instances when the lease is granted, the FAC's contractual rights, obligations and liabilities are transferred to the airport lessee company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also provides for airport staff to transfer to the airport lessee companies at the time a lease is granted over the relevant airport. The bill also contains provisions to enable transfer of accrued benefits and leave entitlements post&hyphen;sale. These provisions are designed to ensure fair and consistent treatment of staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To ensure that state and territory governments receive duties to which they are entitled on sale transactions which take place in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their state or territory, the sale of shares in airport lessee companies or the sale of leases over the airports will be subject to state and territory taxes and stamp duties. The bill does, however, provide for the transfer of the lease or assets that take place while the airport lessee company is owned by the Commonwealth to be exempt from stamp duty. This exemption does not cover the sale by the Commonwealth of its shares in the company, nor the transfer of the lease or assets to a company where that transfer takes place after sale time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of taxation provisions have been provided for in the bill to ensure that both the purchasers and existing lessees of the FAC are not disadvantaged from a taxation perspective. The government has adopted these provisions in respect of transactions between the FAC, the Commonwealth and the airport lessee company to ensure that the tax effect of the transactions would be the same as if it were a sale by the FAC in the private marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Provisions have also been made in the bill to deal with the FAC's debt, which comprises both Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth debt. These provisions, along with the existing provisions in the FAC's statute, provide the government flexibility to deal with the FAC's debts in the most appropriate manner. In managing the FAC's debt during the sale process, the government can assure honourable members that the FAC bondholders' interests will be taken into account. The bill also provides for the treatment of the debt during the sale process to be properly recorded in the Commonwealth's accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the leasing of the major federal airports, the FAC head office will continue to have a role in overseeing the management of the remaining federal airports prior to their leasing in the second phase of the sale process. These second phase airports present specific regional and administrative issues which will need to be addressed prior to their lease. Among these are the joint user airports at Canberra, Darwin and Townsville, which are jointly operated by the FAC and the Department of Defence. The development of new operating arrangements with Defence will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1311"> be required before the civil facilities at these airports can be leased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is expected that a number of the second phase airports which have been unprofitable in the past should prove commercially viable under private ownership through cost reductions and improved revenues. The government will examine options to secure the future of the remaining few airports that may prove to be commercially non&hyphen;viable by taking into account the specific financial characteristics of each airport as well as regional interests and concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is intended to provide a framework for the sale of leases over the airports currently operated by the Federal Airports Corporation. This bill and the companion Airports Bill 1996 are designed to promote the most efficient operation and maintenance of Australia's airport infrastructure, while ensuring that the benefits of increased efficiency are passed on to airport users and the community as a whole. The government is confident that these arrangements will ensure a fair return from the airports while allowing it to divest itself of a function in which its involvement is no longer essential.

<PARA>A 26&hyphen;week newly arrived resident's waiting period for certain social security and other payments has operated for several years. Refugees and humanitarian migrants are exempt from this requirement.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government expects that new entrants to Australia should provide for their own support during their first two years, 104 weeks, in Australia and, as a result, announced as part of its 1996 election policy commitments that the newly arrived resident's waiting period would be so extended. This bill implements that commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a general rule, a newly arrived resident's waiting period of 104 weeks will apply to migrants, except for refugee or humanitarian migrants, immediate family members of refugees and humanitarian migrants at the time that the refugee or humanitarian migrant arrived in Australia or existing holders of subclass 820 visas, who arrive in Australia on or after 1 April 1996 or who are granted permanent residence on or after 1 April 1996, and who wish to claim certain social security benefits such as jobsearch allowance or sickness allowance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 26&hyphen;week newly arrived resident's waiting period will continue to apply to migrants who had arrived in Australia and been granted permanent residence before 1 April 1996. A newly arrived resident's waiting period will apply to the following payments:</PARA>

<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> except for cases stated above relating to widow allowance, the waiting period will be extended by whatever period or periods a person is absent from Australia, if the person leaves Australia after their waiting period has commenced.</PARA>
<PARA>The changes to the newly arrived resident's waiting periods in this bill are modest and reasonable and will ensure that taxpayers only pay for those in need. As an adjunct to the changes, the government is reviewing sponsorship arrangements with a view to ensuring that anyone who sponsors a migrant should provide financial support for that person before any calls are made on the taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will also implement legislation aimed at streamlining information gathering <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from third parties and clarify that income data for different financial years may be used in a single data-matching program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 1307 of the Social Security Act 1991 and section 346 of the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973 allow the Secretary to the Department of Social Security to require a person&mdash;usually employers and other third parties&mdash;to give information about a class of persons with a view to:</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> detecting cases in which amounts of pension, benefit or allowance have been paid when they should not have been paid; and</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> verifying the qualification of persons who made claims for those pensions, benefits and allowances.</PARA>
<PARA>Both sections define the type of information that may be sought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, information about when people start and end their employment may not be sought under sections 1307 or 346. The result is that employers are often faced with having to respond to a request for information under section 1307 or 346 and then having to deal with a follow&hyphen;up request authorised under another section of those acts if, on the basis of the initial advice provided by them, it appears to the Department of Social Security that there has been an overlap in payment of a social security payment or youth training allowance and employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government wishes to reduce the paperwork burden on business. To that end, it would be more efficient if only one request had to be made to employers. It would also be beneficial from an individual's viewpoint. In many cases, the initial provision of more information about a person would confirm that the person was legitimately entitled to a payment and so there would be no need to undertake a follow&hyphen;up that might, quite unjustifiably, result in employers drawing adverse inferences about a person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also serves to make a minor amendment to the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990 so as to put beyond doubt the ability of using Australian Taxation Office income data for different financial years in a single data&hyphen;matching program cycle.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1313">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would ensure, for example, that income data in respect of the 1994&hyphen;95 financial year could be used so as to review the entitlement of a person to family payment for 1996 even though the person might have already lodged their 1995&hyphen;96 tax return. It would also ensure that income data in respect of the 1994&hyphen;95 and 1995&hyphen;96 financial years could be used in a single matching cycle to enable checking on student and parental personal income details for 1995 and 1996.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise for the attention of the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), a recent decision of the Australian Broadcasting Authority. In February, the ABA ruled that what is known as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Liars Club</EMPHASIS>  program on Radio Station 3RRR had breached radio program standard 3(b) as well as conditions of the station's licence as set out in the Broadcasting Services Act. The decision was the result of a complaint by the Church of Scientology that comments made by the program presenter in September last year constituted religious vilification.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The Broadcasting Authority's decision is the first time that a complaint on the basis of religious vilification has succeeded. What should trouble the minister and many Austral ians, however, is that there is precious little justification for the decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Broadcasting Authority's judgment that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Liars Club</EMPHASIS> gratuitously vilified the Church of Scientology on its program is disturbing, firstly, because the decision simply cannot be justified on the facts of the case. In defending the decision, the ABA's Nick Herd said that gratuitous vilification carried with it the meaning that comments were unwarranted. The comments were made by a former member of the Church of Scientology which, being based on his own experiences within the church, can scarcely be said to be unwarranted. Secondly, the ABA's decision establishes a precedent which, if not addressed, could effectively shackle broadcasting in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Herd claimed that the critical factor in the ABA's deliberation on the matter was the failure of the presenter to offer a countervailing view to that presented by his guest. This is despite the presenter in question having challenged the claim by the interviewee that Nazism and Scientology had a lot in common.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Are we now to understand that, for example, all radio presenters, when interviewing former members of religious associations who relate unfavourable experiences about those associations&mdash;no matter how justified they may be&mdash;will be liable to claims of religious vilification? This decision, as it now stands, strengthens the hand of anyone seeking to silence commentary on contentious issues involving religion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABA's decision was a bad decision which confused considered commentary for vilification. If it is not reviewed we will have in Australia a precedent that, rather than complementing this nation's strong tradition of free speech, will in fact restrict it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1314"> Professed religious convictions should not become a smokescreen for avoiding criticism or public scrutiny. For example, in my electorate there is a man by the name of Neil Thomas. He has his own church which has been called the Grace Church, Neil Thomas Ministries and other names from time to time. He has set up many companies which have gone into liquidation, leaving a trail of creditors. He does not pay his bills and he inveig les people into handing over to him their life savings&mdash;in short, he is a crook. He should not be immune from public scrutiny simply because he sets up a church.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this decision is not reconsidered, the ABA may well become a clearing house for ongoing and vexatious religious disputation. The Broadcasting Authority was never established for this purpose, and I do not believe that it has the administrative capacity to deal with such matters and sort the wheat from the chaff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the minister to use his powers under section 171 of the Broadcasting Services Act, which allow him to direct the ABA to investigate matters in the interests of due administration. I further request that the minister use his power under section 161 of the act to advise the ABA of the government's policy on religious vilification which urgently needs clarification as a result of the Broadcasting Authority's decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems apparent that the judgment and the persecution of this program by scientologists have led to the axing of this program by 3RRR. I am particularly concerned that the Broadcasting Authority refers to `warranted' and `unwarranted' criticism. Who determines what is warranted and what is unwarranted? The Broadcasting Authority's view leaves it in the situation of sitting in judgment on what are valid or invalid religious convictions and conduct. Clearly, the responsibility of the media and broadcasters is to offer both sides a go rather than make the decisions themselves.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on your elevation to high office, and note the very genuine spirit of debate that now takes place in this House under your speakership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw to the attention of the House the historic privatisation of the port of Geelong. This program by the Victorian government means that the port of Portland and the port of Geelong will be in private hands. These very important ports in Victoria will now set a benchmark in the export and import of Australian products. For all other ports around <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia, it will mean there will be a benchmark for costing, for activity and for the way in which a competitive port can operate. The sale price that was achieved by the Victorian government was $50.5 million, and the buyer is a consortium made up broadly of TNT and other investors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key element of this change in the operation of the Geelong port is that the channel will remain with another authority. This means that, similar to the national highways and the standard gauge, the channel will remain in public ownership whereas the port itself will be in private hands. We will have a competitive situation where the Geelong port will be competing with Melbourne, Portland and other ports around Australia. As I said, it sets a benchmark for this waterfront problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major imports through the Port of Geelong are: crude oil to the Shell refinery, which represents about 50 per cent of the product that comes through the port; fertiliser raw materials for the Pivot company, with which I had a very good association and which has been a user of the port for many years; and the aluminium that comes into Alcoa at Port Henry, again an important user of the port. The Grains Elevator Board, another important user, exports grain. That board has also been privatised, meaning that the port authority and the privatised grain handling operation will combine very well to provide a first&hyphen;class operation. Also, Midway products uses the port to export its woodchips to various places around the world. Another port activity is the export of Riverina bagged rice, another recent technical development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the former management of the Geelong Harbour Trust and its more recently changed arrangements as a privatised operation under the general management of Peter Morgan, the port has reduced its costs and manpower levels. The Port of Geelong was in a position to be privatised and moved into a more competitive area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Victorian Treasurer, Mr Stockdale, commented in his news release as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The port system is now well on track to deliver more competitive services at a reduced cost for port users which will flow into the wider economy. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1315"> </PARA>
<PARA>Already, the government's reforms in the Geelong port, aided very strongly by the leadership of Mr Peter Morgan, have led to a 22 per cent drop in port charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The waterfront is a key part of the Howard government's reform agenda. This afternoon historic changes to the industrial relations legislation were introduced into the parliament, the impact of which will be very much felt on the waterfront in other ports around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had the two major changes of privatisation and industrial relations. I am very confident that the Port of Geelong will lead the way to become one of the best ports on the Australian coastline both for imports and exports and will be a model of competitive efficiency.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, tonight I wish to raise in this adjournment debate what I believe to be the deliberate vandalism of an important labour market program established under the Labor government's Working Nation policy&mdash;new work opportunities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The vandalism to which I refer is the recent decision by the Victorian Workcover authority to bring the landcare and environment action program and the new work opportunities participants within the scope of the 1985 Victorian Accident Compensation Act and to determine that new work opportunities host employers and LEAP sponsor organisations are employers for workers compensation purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an appalling and puzzling decision. Because of the training and work experience focus, the longstanding precedent has been that participants in labour market programs are treated as trainees, not employees. It is the case that as trainees they have been fully covered by appropriate accident, injury and public liability insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the cost of this has not fallen on LEAP sponsors or host employers. I can think of no better way to frighten off potential sponsor organisations and host employers than to saddle them with a potentially large Workcover liability.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can the participants in training be regarded as employees? The Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs pays these people a training allowance. The sponsor, broker or host employer has little or no capacity to reject participants referred to it by the department. Sponsors are not required to pay superannuation for participants&mdash;or is this next on the list of ways in which to reduce the effectiveness of these programs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already this decision has affected the operation of at least one new work opportunity provider operating in the region I represent. The manager of the Northcote Training Centre, Jan Roberts, raised this problem with my office last month and was quoted in the press recently as saying that up to 80 per cent of host employers had been forced to withdraw their offer of work experience for the unemployed as a result of this decision. Who does this hurt? Of course it hurts the long&hyphen;term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Working Nation initiatives of the Labor government, the Department of Employment, Education and Training in Melbourne's east strove hard to ensure that the very long&hyphen;term unemployed were the first to be assisted under the new work opportunities program. The hard line on helping those most disadvantaged was difficult to hold but it was held to the credit of the department. We are talking about providing opportunity to people who have been unemployed for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northcote example that I referred to earlier meant that 45 people were withdrawn from their programs midstream. Some of the sponsor organisations who reluctantly had to withdraw from the program included: Upper Yarra Community House; the Macleod Nursing Home; and the Brotherhood of St Laurence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth stressing that up to the point of this ridiculous decision, the new work opportunities program operated by the Northcote organisation had been highly successful. Some 52 per cent of participants&mdash;who have been out of work for between four and 20 years&mdash;have been placed in full&hyphen;time jobs through their participation in programs organised by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1316"> the Northcote new work opportunities. This is what Working Nation was all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those in academic ivory towers and right&hyphen;wing think tanks who cast doubt on the macro&hyphen;effectiveness of labour market programs have obviously never been to a labour market program graduation ceremony.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a great deal of speculation about cuts by this government to labour market programs. The oldest trick in the book is surely to change the program and thereby reduce its effectiveness so that it can later be abolished on the grounds that it is not effective. Is that what is happening here?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Has the federal minister protested to Jeff Kennett against this nonsensical decision to call trainees employees? Does the government endorse the deliberate vandalism of new work opportunities and LEAP by the Victorian government as a prelude to the abolition of these programs?</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to commend the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) on the speech he gave last night during the adjournment debate. He referred to child labour, which is occurring in a number of countries. I wholeheartedly support the efforts of the member for Reid in drawing the attention of this House to certain practices that are absolutely shocking&mdash;for example, children, some as young as three, being chained up and forced to put things in boxes and undergo labour, and children as young as 10 undergoing more difficult labour. So I commend the honourable member for Reid on drawing that matter to my attention and to that of the people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> On a related matter, I would like to talk about World Vision and foreign aid. I have had an association with World Vision through child sponsorship for about 20 years. Nothing can warm the heart more than sponsoring a child through World Vision, watching that child grow and keeping contact with that child through letters and regular photographs. You feel in a small way that you are contri buting. Again, I commend the practice of people in wealthier countries&mdash;and Australia is in that affluent group&mdash;assisting in that very direct and personal way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A delegation from the Australian Council of Overseas Aid recently visited me and drew my attention to the fact that Australia's aid budget has been declining in recent years. It used to be around 0.5 per cent as a percentage of GNP in 1982-84, and at present it is hovering at about 0.35 per cent. All honourable members should think seriously about this question of foreign aid. There are really desperate situations out there in Third and Fourth World countries, and we must never forget that we are all part of the global community. We might say at times that we have problems, but think of a pregnant woman who is working right up to the moment of delivering a child. She is working in back-breaking work for something like $2 or $3 a day, and the child is born virtually in the midst of her labour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We talk about the benefits of the wonderful health system that we have here. Yet when that child is born the mother uses a piece of grass to tie the umbilical cord. In that grass frequently there are tetanus spores. Looking at the conditions in which those people have to live and how easily diseases can be transmitted reinforces my view that we must give substantial commitment to overseas aid. We must ensure that moneys are channelled through the aid agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aid agencies, particularly aid agencies like World Vision, are closer to the ground. There is less chance of money dissipating and more chance that projects can be developed at a village level. It is of the essence to ensure that individual projects in these villages in the Third World are enhanced by the identifiable means which World Vision and other agencies have of picking particular projects, channelling the funds and raising the standard of living, even if this means just getting a well sunk or providing a pump, agriculture and seed. Developed at a village level, this is the way we can really help. We must all the time address ourselves to this need to maintain in real terms our foreign aid budget.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), I want to bring to the attention of the House the vandalism that this government is perpetrating in a whole range of areas of our life. I wish to refer in particular to the vandalism that arises in important areas of support for both small and large Australian businesses, particularly those seeking to gain access to export markets in our own region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What brought this issue to my attention was an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>&mdash;an article which has particularly unflattering caricatures of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer). The article is headed `Ministers at odds over budget cuts'. The gist of the story is that there is a dispute between the two ministers and their offices with respect to the future of the development import finance facility and the export market development grants scheme. These programs are not unknown to the House; they have had very considerable success in promoting Australian business in developing regions of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AusAID recently completed a review which found that the $285 million expended under the DIFF program in the last five years gave rise to $1.37 billion of business for Australian companies involved in projects. The review also found non-monetary quantifiable benefits such as the establishment of credibility in international markets, improved trading opportunities with recipient countries, increased investment and a higher degree of export orientation in Australian firms. Similarly, the export market development grants scheme, which the government appears to be allowing to bleed to death by the continuing cuts of speculation about its future, has been demonstrated to be a successful program. Even the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Short) is quoted in a recent story in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> as acknowledging that successful&mdash;I emphasise `successful'&mdash;government programs would have to be scrapped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Talk about shooting yourself in the foot. This approach of the government, particularly <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in relation to DIFF, has attracted much negative comment. The former head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Woolcott, has had some very strong things to say on the matter. The ambassadors from a number of our important trading partners&mdash;China, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam&mdash;are all reported in the financial press over recent days as having made protests to the government about the impact of the abolition of DIFF. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian companies already appear to have lost ground in bidding for a $20 billion revamp of the Philippines defence forces, with other significant infrastructure contracts likely to follow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"This is not only about the projects, but about Asian perceptions of Australia," one senior Asian ambassador in Canberra said yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The serious damage to Australia's credibility caused by the abolition of DIFF comes despite a concerted bid by the Coalition to assure Asian leaders that it is committed to . . . the region.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, Transfield, a company in our home town of Melbourne and which plays an important role in the Anzac frigate project is, according to reports, in some considerable difficulty in relation to a $60 million naval program in the Philippines as a result of the government's decision to scrap the development import finance facility. Transfield can scarcely be terribly impressed. In recent days a company in Queensland headed by Mr Ian Berckelman has been mentioned in the press. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ian Berckelman has been doing business with Indonesia since 1974, but he doesn't know if he should bother anymore.</PARA>

<PARA>There is a small businessman who has been extremely successful in Indonesia in promoting Australian business, Australian know&hyphen;how, and because of the stupidity of this government in shooting itself and the Australian community in the foot, we will lose these opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mention also a Western Australian example, a company called Relpar Pty Ltd, which <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1318"> is involved in the provision of training, education material and equipment for handicapped children at 10 special schools. It is also in strife as a result of the government's approach.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rise this evening to indicate to the House that we have an international tragedy within the Commonwealth of Nations. I am sure many members on both sides of the House share the concerns I have with the sovereign state of Sri Lanka. In fact, that country, over the last 10 or 15 years, has been subjected to a horrendous civil war involving the Sinhalese majority, the Tamil minority and a smaller minority group of Muslims. People are being killed and very large injustices are being imposed on that community. I think it is incumbent on Australians, bearing in mind that we have a very large Sri Lankan community in Australia, to take more than a casual interest in the needs of that sovereign state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Foreign Minister, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), whilst he was very happy to stand in the General Assembly in New York, was less committed to looking after the interests of some of these countries because the profile just was not there. I am delighted that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Foreign Affairs (Mr Andrew Thomson) is at the table because I think it is also incumbent on us as a government to do something about it. I think we can do something about it as, I would hope, an influential country within the Commonwealth of Nations. I say to the parliamentary secretary that I hope our Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) will look at ways and means in which we can assist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know we are dealing with another sovereign state. I know we are dealing with another government. If people were wanting to meddle in our internal affairs, they would have some reservations about that. However, I think there is something we can do with the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and at the parliamentary level in conjunction with diplomatic overtures that I hope will continue to be made in relation to Sri Lanka.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last 10 years something like half a million people have been killed or displaced and there have been lots of injustices on both sides of that conflict in Sri Lanka. I hope we can do something about it, that we can get things under way to assist. I am sure I am not the only member on either side of the House who has been pressured by the groups representing Sri Lanka here in Australia, be they Sinhalese or Tamil, to do something about it. I do not intend, and I am sure our government does not intend, to take sides in what is an internal dispute. At the same time, we can do something to reintroduce a very large dose of democracy into a country which is staggering and suffering under horrendous conflict.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The New England Highway stretches from one end of my electorate to the other and beyond. The highway is the lifeblood of the Upper Hunter, as it carries most of the product of the area, including our coal to the port of Newcastle, and provides an important link between towns and from towns to places like Sydney and Tamworth for the people of my electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New England Highway forms part of the national highway system. Many people, including honourable members of the National Party who represent the electorates on the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1319"> New South Wales north coast, would like to see it declassified in order that the Pacific Highway may be reclassified as part of the national highway system and, therefore, attract the sort of government funding which goes hand&hyphen;in&hyphen;glove with such a reclassification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the New England Highway goes through my electorate, I would like to hear a clear and unequivocal commitment from the Minister for Transport and Regional Development to the ongoing retention of the New England (Mr Sharp) Highway as part of the national highway system. In addition, I would like a commitment from the minister on the funding of the so&hyphen;called Kurri&hyphen;Kurri Corridor, which will provide an important link between the end of the F3 freeway and the beginning of the Upper Hunter area. I would also like a funding commitment on the tidying up of the mess which exists in the Blackhill, Beresfield, Thornton, Tarro and Woodberry areas as a result of the sudden ending of the F3 freeway in that area and the spill&hyphen;off effect we get through those areas. This latter issue goes to public safety and also goes to the amenity of the residents living in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Not only would the Kurri Corridor provide an important economic transport link between the Upper Hunter area and Sydney and all of its markets but also it would give Cessnock residents their first great hope of a bypass of the town. Cessnock is a beautiful town full of wonderful people, but it does have its problems. Chief amongst them are the thousands and thousands of heavy vehicles that boom through both its streets and its CBD day and night. Its other problem, which it shares with so many country towns, is the decline in its central business district.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The council at Cessnock, of which I was a member for some eight years, would like to address the problem. They would like to beautify the CBD and make it a more friendly and comfortable environment in which to shop. They want the residents to stay in the town and do their shopping rather than seek a more comfortable form of shopping in the large supermarket and retail complexes which exist in the Newcastle and Lake Macquarie areas. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The council is stifled in its endeavours because of this issue of heavy vehicles. It is difficult to attract funding for a bypass of Cessnock because Cessnock is not situated on the national highway. So the Kurri Corridor gives us real hope. The design of the corridor has been funded and it is in place. All we need now is a commitment from this government on the retention of the New England Highway as the national highway and the funding of the Kurri Corridor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this is not a possibility in the longer term, we have one other opportunity. During the last federal election campaign, the then shadow minister for transport, now the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, indicated to the Australian people that a new form of road funding might come into being. It was called `Funding for roads of national importance'. The bypass of Cessnock is an issue of very great importance. I suggest that the minister, at the very least, revisit his election commitment and investigate the funding of a bypass of Cessnock under that funding program he indicated he would commit himself to. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

I would challenge any of the opposition members to go and look at any one of the long&hyphen;term training courses&mdash;for example, the 13&hyphen;week plus&mdash;which just happen to ensure that anybody who has been long-term unemployed and who participates in one of these courses no longer appears as long-term unemployed but then goes onto the merry&hyphen;go&hyphen;round and becomes one of the short&hyphen;term unemployed. I invite them to go and visit one of these courses as they come to completion and just have a look at the morale of these people. It does an enormous amount of good for someone who <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1320"> has been unemployed for a long time to build up friendships, build up experience and also to gain some feeling of self-worth on their completion of these courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem that I have, and the problem that I think most of these people have, with these courses is that the Labor government never addressed the next step. The next step, of course, was actually putting these people into employment. That seems to have been something that we could just brush over. In fact, with this issue, all we have seen over the last 13 years&mdash;and, in particular, the last four or five years&mdash;has been a complete effort to hide the figures and to ensure that the public were misinformed about the real situation.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that now, today, we have seen introduced into this parliament a piece of legislation that will directly affect the impact that the job market is going to have.

We have seen those addressed in this parliament today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that the Australian people understand that the piece of legislation we introduced today is only one small piece of a very large document which will go a long way to addressing the draconian steps that were put in place by Labor supporting nothing but unions and union supporters and, in doing so, to the detriment of both employers and employees.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to speak in support of this bill, which will provide an additional $95.7 million to improve Aboriginal educational opportunities. I am especially pleased because this bill is the result of an initiative of the federal Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In setting up the national review of education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in 1993, the former government was recognising the fact, stated in the 1994&hyphen;95 report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Social justice for indigenous Australians</EMPHASIS>, that Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islander people were `the poorest, sickest, most unemployed and least educated of all Australians'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The review was established to examine the operation of the first triennium of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy, AEP. The AEP began in 1990 as a national effort between the Commonwealth, the states and territories and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to strategically address the educational needs of indigenous Australians. The AEP identified 21 goals under four main themes: involvement, access, participation and outcomes; particularly recognising the fundamental importance of the involvement of indigenous people at all stages of decision making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The original joint policy statement of the AEP in 1989 acknowledged the power of education to improve the quality of life for people from financially impoverished backgrounds. The joint policy statement says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Numerous reviews, inquiries and consultations conducted in recent years have all demonstrated that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people place a high priority on education. They want for themselves and their children no less by way of educational opportunity than is afforded other Australians. They expect that educational processes should leave them to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to realise their individual potential, lead satisfying lives and contribute actively to the community. They look to education as a means of moving out of poverty and welfare dependency, enabling them to earn income through employment or enterprise and to manage the development of their communities.</PARA>
<PARA>Five years after the AEP was established was a suitable time to consider the extent to which it had met expectations in terms of the 21 goals. The review praised the AEP for delivering more funding stability in the form of triennial rather than annual arrangements, for fostering cooperation between federal, territory and state governments and between education sectors, and for identifying the need for more culturally appropriate curricula.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not surprisingly, it also found that the AEP's first three years held some lessons for its future operation. In terms of educational participation and attainment, the review found that improvements, although evident, were inconsistent across sectors and systems. It found that many parents now have an avenue for becoming directly involved in their children's schooling through the establishment of over 2,500 parent committees under the Aboriginal student <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1323"> support and parent awareness program, ASSPA. It also found that the cooperative national approach of the AEP had encouraged the development of Aboriginal studies and Torres Strait Islander studies as part of the curriculum in an increasing number of educational institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These kinds of improvements were not seen uniformly across the country, however, and addressed to only a limited extent the extreme educational disadvantage facing our indigenous population. The review made 44 recommendations designed to improve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's experience of education. Sixteen of the recommendations apply specifically to the Commonwealth, while others involve the state and territory governments and non&hyphen;government education authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government responded to the review in September last year, announcing a package of measures which included those incorporated in this bill. The response announced the Labor government's intention to make the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program recurrent, and this measure is a key part of the bill we are considering today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will provide greater stability of funding, as well as ensuring that funds remain commensurate with enrolments. It will also simplify funding arrangements, addressing complaints made to the review about the time spent preparing submissions. In line with review recommendation 37, the proposal is to provide funds on a per capita basis and in a way which reflects the differing costs of educational provision across sectors, and in remote and non&hyphen;remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the government intends these changes to accompany a more accountable outcomes&hyphen;focused process for the distribution of Commonwealth funds. There is no doubt that we need to continue down the path set by the previous government in placing a high priority on establishing comprehensive and up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date databases across all sectors of education and training so that the performance of the AEP in meeting its objectives can be properly evaluated. The previous government also obtained agreement from most states to increase their effort in Aboriginal education expenditure in order to access a pool of Commonwealth money in the form of strategic results projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition will be most interested in arrangements made with the states as a result of this bill. We would expect the government to ensure that commitments made by the states to increase effort are not permitted to lapse due to any reduction in commitment by the Commonwealth or any diminution of resolve on the part of the Commonwealth. There is far too much at stake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I would like to congratulate the chair of the reference group overseeing the review, Mandawuy Yunupingu; the deputy chair, Romina Fujii; and the other members of the reference group on the excellent job they did. I would also like to say that real improvements can be made in indigenous education if all governments work together with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. We have come some of the way; this bill takes us further toward our goal.</PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (Aston)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.08 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As this House will know, this is an area in which I have taken a personal interest for some years. I am therefore very pleased to speak on this particular bill this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that has struck me over the six years I have been in this place is that not only here but also as I have travelled around the country&mdash;with you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and with other members on the standing committee and through other outlets and avenues&mdash;I have heard many claims from different people about what the keys are to addressing Aboriginal <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1324"> and Torres Strait Islander disadvantage in this country. And there is acknowledged and quite clear disadvantage, by whatever indicator you care to use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When people talk about the key to addressing that disadvantage, they sometimes talk about health; they sometimes talk about housing, education, employment, the importance of land, the justice system, and so on. It seems to me that those things are all important. It is not just one of those items being the key; they all play an important part and it seems to me that it should be an interactive process. You have to improve housing and health in parallel with education and gradually develop that total environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the next honourable gentleman to speak from the coalition&mdash;he comes from the Northern Territory and we welcome him to this parliament&mdash;will probably have more first&hyphen;hand experience of this than I, but I have certainly travelled extensively around the country. What we have seen and heard as we go around the country, in terms of health and the delivery of educational services to indigenous people, has been generally a very sorry tale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You do not get a good education if your health is not up to scratch. If you have a middle ear infection&mdash;and in some schools that you and I have been to, Mr Deputy Speaker, 50 per cent of those in the school have middle ear infections&mdash;you have a health problem. But you have also got an education problem because you cannot hear what the heck is going on. So we need to look at education in the Aboriginal field in a broad sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also need to look at overcrowded housing. I have seen overcrowded indigenous housing all around this country. I remember particularly going to Maningrida, which is well known for its arts and crafts, where the average number of people per house in that community is about 38. If you are going to school during the day and you want to advance yourself and do some study or whatever, going home to 38 people in a three&hyphen;bedroom house with one toilet and a shower, in a warm climate, is not exactly conducive to becoming a diligent student, even if you want to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aspect of culture is interesting. Again I would be interested in the comments, perhaps later on, from the honourable gentleman from the Northern Territory. I remember going to Yirrkala which is often held up as a model school in terms of indigenous involvement in running its own education process. It is a school at which Mandawuy Yunupingu, to whom the previous speaker referred, was a teacher some years ago before he moved on to greater fame in other fields. There was great pride, and appropriately so in many senses, that the teaching was conducted in the local language. That was culturally appropriate and was acceptable to the community, but if you went down the road and talked to the major employer in the area, which was Nabalco, the management there said, `One of the problems we have with trying to offer jobs to Aboriginal people is that, although they go to school and they go through the school system, because they often do not have a basic command of English to the standard we need we actually cannot employ them.' So you have this dichotomy of culture and education, and you have to get that mix right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, in the home environment the problem is not just the crowding. If there is substance abuse at home and there is violence or other problems of that sort, clearly you are not going to sit down and do your homework and have the right environment in which to study. Those sorts of problems, coupled with peer pressure and so on, I think are often worse for our indigenous community than for people almost anywhere else in the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I specifically address my comments to the parliamentary secretary, who is here representing the minister. The point I would make is that we can talk about these education bills, but what <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1325"> the government has to understand and what the government must do&mdash;I said this in opposition and I will continue to say it in government&mdash;is address all of these issues because addressing just particular sectional areas is not going to fix the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is about increasing funding until the turn of the century and restructuring the Aboriginal special programs in this area to make them more responsive. This bill is about moving primarily, in one sense, to a per capita system. It is about looking for who can best provide education. I think that is important. Often the providers may not be from the conventional sources. I think that is a more relevant factor in indigenous areas than perhaps in many other parts of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is particularly about looking for outcomes and not just inputs. I have been critical of many of the things the previous government did in this and other areas but I never basically questioned its good intentions. One of the things that struck me in the life of the previous government and that caused me concern was that we did not get the improved results. I think there was too much focus on providing the inputs and not enough on saying, `Has it been effective and have we got the right results?' So I think that looking at outcomes is fundamental.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is about providing certainty for the education providers, not living year to year on short&hyphen;term time frames, because you cannot organise anything properly on that basis. It is about performance and outcomes, and it has also established quite clearly an objective to achieve educational equity for indigenous Australians by the turn of the century. It is about improving the lot of indigenous teachers as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, whether you were on this particular visit, but I have graphic memories of one visit we paid to a school which I think was in Mission Beach in Queensland where outstanding Aboriginal teachers really were teachers' aides, if you like, and had nowhere to go. There was no advancement and the level of pay was derisory. Anybody who had real ability in the Aboriginal teaching field was often lost to the field because they went to other jobs where they could get better advancement. It seems to me that there are special needs in terms of improving the lot of indigenous teachers. Of course, it is important to make education culturally appropriate, and we need&mdash;above all, perhaps&mdash;to take a practical and not a doctrinaire approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As members of the House would be aware, I have spent some years as the coalition's representative in opposition and now in government on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. Reconciliation is something to which the Prime Minister has reaffirmed his commitment on a number of occasions since 2 March. In that context, let me say that next week we are going to celebrate National Reconciliation Week in this building. There will be a major function on Monday at lunchtime, co&hyphen;hosted by the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the Leader of the Democrats (Senator Kernot), and there will be a special motion moved in the House at the start of business on Monday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I mention that is that you do not and will not achieve reconciliation until you have addressed many of the problems that are almost endemic in the disadvantage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. Improving that disadvantage, it seems to me, is one of the issues at the core and that is why bills such as this are so important. I would just remind members of the House that in the second reading speech the minister said that this bill was all about funding levels that reflect an increase of $7.85 million on the existing appropriation. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1326">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is talking about major changes to the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program from January 1997 with a new funding triennium. It is talking about cultural appropriateness and a more cost&hyphen;effective, transparent and manageable system, and it would do this in two basic ways: on the basis of either per capita entitlement or strategic results projects. It is all about value for money and about getting results. As I have said before, I have never doubted that the previous government wanted to try hard in this area, but I have concerns that they did not achieve outcomes, and that is why it is important that we develop a new way of going about some of these things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In doing that, we must of course remember that we need to involve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander parents in their children's education process. You cannot just devise a system and expect that it is going to work. Given the many tight&hyphen;knit communities, it is important to involve parents because without that parental commitment&mdash;and that often is not there these days&mdash;and given some of the problems of health, housing and so on that I referred to earlier, you will not get children motivated to do the work they need to at school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to very much improve the preschool education level because, unless you can set at an early age the right approaches, attitudes and even disciplines to education, you will get the wrong attitude set at an early age; and if a few years later you come along trying to change the attitude of the young people to education, you will not be successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, it must be about employing and training Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education workers. There simply are not enough of them in the field and we need to encourage far more people into that area. The employment and training of those workers&mdash;acknowledging that it may have to use techniques that are not necessarily standard in terms of the main community&mdash;will be important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The appropriate professional development of staff at all levels involved in indigenous education is important, and I have mentioned the cultural sensitivity of curricula as also being important. Probably more than anything else, we have to make sure that in all the things we plan and do; in all the changes we look at and the things we implement, we have indigenous involvement in how we develop the programs, in the measures that we take and in the mechanics of the system. History has taught us that we cannot impose those things from the outside. Unless there is indigenous involvement the measures will&mdash;in all sorts of ways&mdash;not be appropriate and there will be no commitment in the communities themselves to make them work successfully afterwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation seeks to achieve for indigenous Australians literacy and numeracy outcomes that are similar to those of non&hyphen;indigenous Australians. It also seeks to make sure that we regularly review progress so that we can try to achieve the objective, or get very close to it, by 2000. I do not think we are going to bring everybody up to scratch in the next four years, but we have to make significant progress. Everybody in our community, whether an indigenous or non&hyphen;indigenous person, is very frustrated with the fact that all the effort and all the talk that has gone on for some years has not produced the outcome. I am not attributing blame or pointing a finger, but we all acknowledge that the improvements are not there and, therefore, people are getting frustrated. We must start to see some impact being made on some of these areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that we give priority in that process to addressing the development of sound foundation competencies, particularly in literacy and numeracy, so that we can help Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make the transition from education and training, where they <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1327"> get those basic skills, into the work force. Until you have the basic skills, you will not get a job; if you do not get a job then you cannot afford the housing; and if you do not have the housing then you do not get the health standards. If you do  not have a job and money, you get into substance abuse, because you have been sitting around doing nothing. This happens when you have time on your hands&mdash;we all know the cycle. So this bill is a very fundamental part of providing intervention at an early stage in that cycle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all recognise the need in this area and it is no good standing up and making emotive speeches. That has happened over the years. There have been a lot of problems and mistakes made in the past. What we have to do now is sit down with legislation such as this and put in place some practical measures for dealing with the problem. This is one small part of the jigsaw. This is the educational piece of the jigsaw. There are other parts: health, housing and so on. We have to recognise the special circumstances of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians: not only their disadvantages but also the cultural differences, and we have to have them involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill not only continues what was set in place before&mdash;and some of the special measures worked, and some of them did not work&mdash;but also improves what was there, based on experience. I think that is to be commended.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a cure by itself, but it certainly helps. The thing that we must do, as a nation and as a parliament&mdash;the lead has to come from the parliament&mdash;is to put aside party political differences in these sorts of areas. Those of us who have worked in indigenous affairs over the last few years have tried to put aside a lot of those party political differences because, as a nation, we have a responsibility not to fail our citizens. In so many areas, including Aboriginal education, we have failed them in the past and it is important that we now address these problems. This bill will go some considerable way towards doing that, and I therefore commend the bill to honourable members.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do feel at home, as the honourable member has said. I rise to support the bill, which will amend the Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act of 1989. The bill will ensure that a significant portion of funding to the states and territories, under the act, is paid on the basis of the number of indigenous students. It will also provide some extra money to Aboriginal education as approved by the Expenditure Review Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Poor retention rates, particularly at higher levels of secondary schooling, are a major factor in the educational disadvantage of indigenous Australians. For example, at year 12 level the retention rate is 33 per cent compared with 76 per cent for other Australians. Current funding arrangements under the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program, AESIP, are based on submissions which failed to provide certainty and continuity. Funding levels are not currently linked to outcomes and do not reflect levels of enrolment of indigenous students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides for a new approach to funding arrangements for AESIP from 1997. Most funding will now be provided through per capita based arrangements which will ensure that the bulk of the funding is predictable and based on changes in enrolment demands. An element of the available funds will also be set aside for strategic projects which will be time limited and outcomes orientated.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1328">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The strategic results projects will, in general, be jointly funded by the Commonwealth, state and territory governments. The strategic results projects will deal with the major barriers to educational attainment, such as the high drop&hyphen;out rates, which cannot be addressed by mainstream programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new formula for funding recognises the different needs of various educational sectors: preschool, primary, secondary, and vocational education and training; the greater costs involved in servicing remote communities; and the needs of non&hyphen;government institutions not in receipt of funding from other government channels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will also give practical implementation to the government's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander policy commitments: to review all Commonwealth programs for indigenous students to assess their relevance and educational outcomes; to liaise with the states and territories to determine how to improve outcomes; to support in principle the 21 goals of the national review for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, while recognising that indigenous complaints voiced during the consultation phase were not necessarily reflected in the final recommendations; and to ensure that indigenous people have a greater voice in determining indigenous educational needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under current financial arrangements, funding is submission based. Based on the formula supplied in schedule 1, the territory would receive&mdash;on 1995 enrolments as provided under the Australian vocational education and training, or VET, statistics that include non&hyphen;government VET providers&mdash;a decrease in funding for the vocational education and training sector. Based on these preliminary calculations, it is felt that this will result in a decrease in funding for the vocational education and training sector in the Northern Territory in the government and non&hyphen;government sectors of some $3 million per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Current funding arrangements have been intended to be supplementary to delivery funding. Historically, however, institutions have used the funds for delivery purposes. The impact of the per capita arrangements may affect the number of indigenous enrolments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is clearly cost shifting, which the new formula is trying to address. Institutions will make claims of additional territory recurrent funds to maintain their current enrolment levels. The new funding arrangements will lead to a significant rearrangement in the relative shares of funds received by different states and territories. Transitional arrangements will ensure that the shift to per capita funding is as smooth as possible. However, these changes will negatively impact upon the most disadvantaged Aboriginal students in the remotest areas of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While there are a number of positive aspects to this bill, the Northern Territory is greatly concerned that the level of funding available to the Northern Territory government school sector will decrease by 33 per cent, from approximately $10 million in 1996 to $6.4 million in 1997. Given that the government school sector has responsibility for providing education to 10,930 indigenous students, the large nature of this cut will have a dramatic negative impact on the programs which the department of education will be able to offer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, two positive aspects of the bill which address the concerns of Northern Territory Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are a guaranteed funding base to provide employment and the recognition of greater delivery costs incurred in delivering educational services to remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major problem for the Northern Territory is that the main focus of the bill on improved academic outcomes will be diminished because the funding necessary to maintain programs which address improved outcomes will be greatly reduced.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1329">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reduction in funding also places in jeopardy the implementation of the Aboriginal education strategy as agreed by the Commonwealth, state and territory ministers at the meeting of the Ministerial Council for Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs in December 1995. At that meeting, ministers agreed to continue the partnership between the Commonwealth and the states and territories, particularly to improve outcomes for indigenous students. It will be very difficult to continue the partnership when the Northern Territory government is maintaining its financial effort, only to be confronted by a reduction by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indigenous people in the Northern Territory have been asking for some time to have their jobs as Aboriginal resource officers made permanent. The Northern Territory government has always said that, as soon as the Commonwealth makes funding permanent, the Territory would make these jobs permanent. Under this new legislation, the funding will be on a recurrent basis, and therefore the Northern Territory government will be able to offer Aboriginal resource officers in urban locations permanent employment, providing the current level of the 1996 funding is maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the important role that Aboriginal resource officers play in providing support for Aboriginal students in classrooms and the example they set as role models for non&hyphen;Aboriginal students, this could be another significant step in assisting with the improvement of academic outcomes for Aboriginal students and promoting a better understanding between the Aboriginal and non&hyphen;Aboriginal Territorians. There must be a concerted effort to improve access to education and training in remote communities and to address poor health, housing and other problems that militate against educational achievement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While academic standards in Aboriginal schools are generally far below what I consider acceptable, it has to be recognised that progress is being made. With four Aboriginal principals in charge of Aboriginal schools and more in training, about 100 Aboriginal teachers and nearly 300 Aboriginal assistant teachers, we can expect the rate of improvement to increase significantly. In some isolated Aboriginal schools, the electronic classroom is already a reality, with students receiving lessons and tutorial support by computer from the Northern Territory Secondary Correspondence School.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 10 of this bill is also very important because it acknowledges the higher costs of education delivery in remote areas, although the definition of `remote' fails to differentiate between vastly different degrees of remoteness. I advise the honourable minister that, in terms of remote, for a primary school student the government rate is some $600 and the non&hyphen;government rate is $2,000. In terms of remoteness, the definition is that, as I understand it, if you are more than 300 kilometres from a population base of 50,000 people you come into the remote category.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We provide educational services in the major regional centres of the Northern Territory&mdash;which are Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, Katherine and Nhulunbuy&mdash;and all those Territory centres are more than 300 kilometres away from a population base of 50,000. Darwin is the only centre that has a population base of 50,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Alice Springs and the other Territory centres, we are funded for the remote rate per student, which is $600. At places away from those Territory centres, like Borroloola&mdash;a community some 788 kilometres from Tennant Creek or, in driving time, between eight and nine hours&mdash;education services are provided at a higher remote cost, as if it were in Alice Springs.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1330">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With another smaller community, Kiuna&mdash;a station 580 kilometres, or six to seven hours drive, from Tennant Creek, with a population of about 35 students&mdash;if the 35 is multiplied by the $600, it finishes up at about $21,000. With the services that are being provided by the education department of the Northern Territory, a schoolteacher at that level in a remote area would probably be on about $45,000 to $50,000 a year with overtime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, it is far more expensive to provide educational services to people in remote areas, which this particular per capita table will not really pick up. I would ask the minister to evaluate that in relation to the Northern Territory and other parts of the vast outback in North Queensland and Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important thing is that, nationally, literacy levels are unacceptable and there is strong evidence that, in some remote areas, parents are more literate than their children. In fact, to pick up the points that were made by the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), bilingual education is being accepted as the conventional approach, yet there is an increasing clamour from traditionally orientated communities that language maintenance is Aboriginal business and the medium of school based education ought to be English. That is really what the honourable member for Aston was saying. Obviously if people&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="ABBOTT" NAMEID="EZ5">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EZ5">Mr Abbott</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Was he really saying that?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5M6">Mr DONDAS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think he was. If I can finish what I was saying, if someone is Yirrkala and their children go to school through Yirrkala, when they come out of the education system and do not speak English they cannot find work. As the member for Aston said, the mining company is unable to employ them as they do not have a decent command of the English language.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should be looking seriously now at what languages are being taught in schools because around the Northern Territory there are a number of children aged between 18 and 25 who are still somewhere in the education system and who do not have a reasonable enough command of the English language to allow them to go into the work force. So they will always be forced to stay within their community because of the dialect that they use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of this bill should have been seen as the major step in continuing the improvements of outcomes for all indigenous students in the non&hyphen;government sector. There has to be great concern about the bill's availability to address the needs of indigenous students in the government school sector. The provision of a 33 per cent cut in the level of funding available to the government school sector is probably the most damaging event to occur in the history of Northern Territory Aboriginal education. This cut will directly impact on the attainment of educational outcomes at a time when more, rather than less, funding should have been devoted to this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accepting the fact that the former government left the new coalition government in a financial mess, I would hope that the minister responsible for this bill will recognise the important fact that not only is the Territory disadvantaged, but other states with large rural and isolated areas are also in need of special funding consideration. As this legislation is most important to the future for those persons in the indigenous education sector, I commend it to honourable members.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the first time I have spoken in the Main Committee and I am looking forward to it. I am also looking forward to speaking on the Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1996 which will certainly have a very pleasing outcome for the electorate of Herbert. I want to support the bill because <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1331"> every Australian has a right to expect fair and equitable access to education, but for many years indigenous Australians have, in the main, been unable to live out this right. This, unfortunately, is not unusual.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people lag well behind non&hyphen;indigenous Australians in just about every social aspect of life. Health, life expectancy, employment and the representation in our gaols are just a few of the areas where indigenous Australians continue to lag well below the acceptable so&hyphen;called `average' standard of living.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In education, the same can unfortunately also be said to be true. Someone once said that knowledge is power. It has been oft quoted, but I do not necessarily subscribe to this point of view. I prefer to believe that knowledge is empowerment. The difference is fundamental and the amendments presented in this bill further the quest for empowerment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aim of this bill&mdash;to facilitate increased participation and improved education outcomes for indigenous Australians&mdash;is a positive action indeed. We can only increase participation rates for indigenous people if we improve access to educational facilities. It is important to do this from the ground up and to start at preschool and primary school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Immediately before coming here this week I officially opened the new Good Shepherd community school in Townsville. It was my first school opening and a very proud moment for me. Part of my speech called on the education department to facilitate more culturally relevant learning environments for our kids; environments which take into consideration the needs and requirements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and their parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Townsville has one of the largest per capita metro-indigenous populations in Australia. It is great to see indigenous and non&hyphen;indigenous children mixing so freely. That is the great thing about children. They do not carry the prejudice and racism that older people seem to carry. Getting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people involved in the educational and teaching side is an important element not only for the provision of better, more culturally relevant education programs for indigenous Australians but also for all Australians. This then needs to be carried through to secondary and tertiary levels of education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end, I think one of the most important educational outcomes we all hope for for our children is, of course, employment. When I was young&mdash;and I am not saying that I am not young now&mdash;an arts degree was a pretty big deal and the sign of a very well&hyphen;educated person. Today an arts degree will not get a young person terribly far. Ordinary degrees are becoming double degrees with honours. I dread to think, for my own children's sake, how competitive the job market will be when they graduate from their university studies in a few years time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not many things in politics today seem to attract bipartisan support. I think it would be a very brave member indeed who would stand up and oppose the sensible amendments proposed in this bill. I am particularly supportive of the new section 7A which defines the object of the act, which is `to develop culturally appropriate education services for Indigenous people.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To expand on the importance of this, I want to take you to a great indigenous school in my electorate. About 40 kilometres north&hyphen;east of Townsville is Palm Island. Sister Geraldine Kearney runs St Michael's Primary School on the island. I have had the honour of meeting and being with Sister Geraldine; she has been at the cutting edge of indigenous education on Palm Island for some five years now. I was speaking to her just yesterday and she was telling me quite frankly that Palm Island, sadly, has averaged one suicide a week over the last two months. She sat with the families and attended the funerals. The most worrying part of it is that the people committing suicide are aged between 17 and 25. Some of those people have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1332"> children of their own. Of the 4,500 people who live on Palm Island, 50 per cent are under the age of 25.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Palm Island's case, when we talk about education outcomes we are talking well beyond primary, secondary and tertiary education. We are talking about life and death. I asked Sister Geraldine how important education is to the future of the people on Palm Island. `Vital' was the simple answer she gave. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) said in the second reading of this bill that the need for quality was clear. Dr Kemp said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . social justice concerns require education to provide a basic foundation of opportunity for all people.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I spoke to Sister Geraldine yesterday, she had no idea about the aims or the details of this bill. Yet, when I started to ask her about what areas of indigenous education she thought were of greatest importance, she instantly identified several of the key strategies identified by the honourable minister in his reading of the bill. `Get the kids while they're young,' she said, `and, with the direct assistance of parents and the island elders, provide them with a culturally appropriate education and a continuous overdose of self&hyphen;esteem. In the long run, it will save lives.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Literacy and numeracy are one thing, but we cannot afford to ignore other areas of indigenous education. The development of culturally sensitive curricula on Palm Island has extended to lessons on the environment, the identifying of bush food sources, and the telling of the history and cultural traits of the Palm Island community. Importantly, it has also started to involve education in areas of nutrition. Bad nutrition habits are one of the major sources of the continued health problems suffered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we can start educating people in good nutritional habits at an early stage, then we can greatly avoid many of the health problems we see now in the indigenous population. If we can prevent certain health problems from ever arising, then we will not have to continue pouring money into funding their treatment. A proper diet can prevent many health problems, including diabetes, digestive problems, renal problems, high blood pressure and heart disease. When we talk about education outcomes in relation to this bill, it is not unreasonable to look into such positive areas as this. The problems on Palm Island are many, but education is an area where a real difference can be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Get the parents involved. They want to be involved. When parents on Palm Island were given the opportunity to contribute to their children's education and have a say in the planning and development of the school's education program, they eagerly took it up. If we want to find out how to develop culturally sensitive educational environments, then we have to involve the parents. In the five years that Sister Geraldine has been at Palm Island, she has seen a marked increase in parental involvement in education, and that is wonderful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parents have been involved in education surveys to establish what things they think should be included in the school's curriculum, and they have also been closely involved in the planning and development of a new school building extension. This has had a positive effect on the Palm Island children at St Michael's. They can see their parents taking an active interest in their wellbeing. It has also had a positive effect on the parents in that they feel they are contributing to something very important, and they are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Get indigenous elders involved. That was something else Sister Geraldine continued to stress, because the elders know the history, culture and heritage of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people better than anyone else. Elders are also the highly respected members of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1333"> community. Just before Anzac Day, there was an article in the Townsville press advocating veterans going to schools to talk to kids about their experiences of war&mdash;what life was like, the sights, the smells, the sounds, the home front and so on. If we are going to do that, then let us also get indigenous elders involved with indigenous education. That is what this bill is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already, justice programs are being applied on Palm Island and trialled elsewhere in Queensland. Aboriginal elders sit down with juvenile offenders and try to instil in them a sense of responsibility and self&hyphen;respect. On Palm Island such programs are increasingly having positive effects. Give elders the support they need to get involved with education. In Palm Island's case, that support is urgently needed. About 50 per cent of the population of Palm Island is under 25 years of age, as I have already outlined. If Palm Island's elders are not given the necessary support, in a few years their generation will not be around anymore, and that will have a serious consequence for that community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Push to get indigenous people directly involved in education training. That was another point stressed by Dr Kemp and identified by Sister Geraldine. All teachers' aides and ancillary staff at St Michael's are indigenous people. They are the ones who are really teaching the children there. They are the ones who are the full&hyphen;time role models for the children during the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the second reading speech of the bill, Dr Kemp identified the importance of the transition from education to the work force. But there are also other important transition points that cannot be ignored. We need to explore the possibility of introducing a preparatory year for all students, particularly those in remote centres, who are making the transition from primary to secondary school. In the great majority of cases in distant rural and remote parts of Australia, secondary education means travel to major regional centres. This involves separation from family and friends, boarding school and, in effect, an entire new way of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is definitely the case on Palm Island. In 1995, all students from Palm Island entering secondary schools had to be placed in mainland boarding schools. Four have already dropped out. They dropped out, not because they did not want to go to school, but because they were not able to handle the dramatic adjustment in lifestyle. In some cases, children in remote centres are just not ready for mainland high schools and the change in the structure of education that they come across. Primary school indigenous students have three times the literacy and numeracy problems of other students. Twenty&hyphen;five per cent of indigenous students do not complete year 10. These figures can be improved by providing culturally sensitive educational environments. I believe they can be improved by easing children of all backgrounds into high school and introducing them to that environment only when they are ready.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have preschool to introduce kids to the idea of going to school and, in certain countries, preparatory years before entering university. For many children in remote Australian communities, both indigenous and non&hyphen;indigenous, a preparatory year could prove vital in making the transition to a different way of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having inherited the economic legacy of the ALP, the need for strict application and distribution of Commonwealth funds is more important than ever. The Australian public, both indigenous and non&hyphen;indigenous, not unreasonably expect value from their taxes. A more accountable process for the distribution of funds will help to ensure that money goes to those areas where it is most needed. Greater accountability requires better planning of how funds will be spent. It also requires better consultation between politicians, the department, the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1334"> educators and the parents. We should be encouraging schools to develop needs analysis programs in consultation with indigenous parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what this amendment bill is, in part, well and truly addressing. These amendments will, through the restructuring of the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program, contribute to ensuring that such improvements are achieved in indigenous education. I am particularly proud that this bill is outcomes oriented. For the sake of my electorate and the sake of indigenous people in the whole of this nation, I certainly commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In seeking the passage of this bill, the coalition is honouring another commitment made during the election campaign. It is not the first time, and it certainly will not be the last time, we will be making good an election promise. Nonetheless, we who are committed to justice for Australia's indigenous peoples believe it to be an important promise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the life of this government, it is imperative that we address some of the concerns and issues confronting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. The land rights issue continues to dominate the indigenous politics debate&mdash;but it is not the whole story. If indigenous people are to enjoy their full and rightful share of this nation's blessings, we must ensure improvements in at least two other fundamental areas. Of these, health is perhaps the most publicised concern; but it is certainly not my intention to broach that issue today. The other is education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This parliament is not the first to recognise the need for action in this all&hyphen;important area. Indeed, the act we seek to amend was first passed in 1989. In the seven years since it was introduced, the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy has been a qualified success. For the most part, it has received bipartisan backing and has been overseen jointly by the Commonwealth, states and territories. It has produced considerable improvements in both education and training participation for indigenous people. However, there is still a long way to go. The national review of education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples shows the need for new approaches and increased joint efforts if we are to see our indigenous people achieve educational parity with non&hyphen;indigenes over the next four years&mdash;which, incidentally, was the goal set by the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs in December 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As with every goal set, there is a preferred route to travel. In this case, the determined course is a series of national priorities for the three years of the Aboriginal education policy, beginning in 1997. There has been agreement amongst indigenous people, the Commonwealth, state and territory governments and education providers that these priorities are critical to the achievement of their goal. The priorities are wide ranging and include the development of career structures for indigenous education workers and a rise in levels of parental involvement in their children's education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having received a very good education myself, I recognise these two components as all important. It is very difficult for educational authorities to plan and to provide the best when there is a cloud hanging over their future. Like almost all Australians, they want and need security when making plans for the future, and it is gratifying to see that this need has been recognised. This bill guarantees funding through to the turn of the century, and that will be welcome news for the education providers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1335">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome, too, the move to involve parents in the education process. Teachers can only do so much, and a real love of learning can be instilled by a child's parents, who can encourage creativity in their children long after the formal lessons are over. Parents are very often responsible for instilling a love of learning in their children at a very early age&mdash;at the very least, the greater their interest, the greater the child's.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another of the defined priorities is the need for indigenous children to attend preschool education programs. The national experience has shown that children who attend kindergarten or other preschool programs have a significant head start on those who do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The forced separation of Aboriginal families over the years has led to a decline in the use of their own languages. I am very happy to see that the program will offer encouragement for students to study indigenous languages, which are very much part of their heritage and their culture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had hundreds of government programs in these past 20 years attempting to fix one situation or another. Some programs have been a downright failure, particularly those where governments have simply thrown money at a problem. This we will not do. However, it is a necessary element of an election promise that this is funded fully. This government plans to do just that. Over the next four years, we will be more than doubling expenditure on this program. In all, nearly $180 million has been earmarked for supplementary assistance to the education of indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this increase in assistance will come increased accountability. The funding structure of the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program will change. From January next year, AESIP resources will be distributed to eligible providers on a per capita basis. This is not to say that providers will be worse off than they are today. For the first year, at least, funding minimums will be set at the current rate. But per capita spending is, in the longer term, an inducement to increase participation rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the new arrangements, each eligible provider will negotiate an indigenous education agreement that identifies specific targets to improve performance in one or more areas deemed a priority. Current performance levels will be the point from which potential improvements are targeted and measured. The per capita funding should enable providers&mdash;whether they be Commonwealth, state, territory or otherwise&mdash;to address the high costs of education in remote areas and the many disadvantages experienced by indigenous students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With these agreements signed, the Commonwealth will be interested in participation rates and, obviously, results. The methods will be of the providers' choosing and, given the diversity of situations, I am sure that providers will go about their tasks in different ways. The annual performance reviews will judge if they have been successful in achieving their defined targets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to the per capita spending, this bill also provides for the strategic results projects. These funds, which represent only a fraction of the total expenditures, will be allocated toward researching and implementing measures that will improve results across the education sector. Universities will be eligible to participate in these projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will improve the chances of indigenous people participating in and receiving a better education. An education has always been vital, never more so than it is today. Many of life's options are decided for us by the standard of education we are offered and whether we take up that offer. I believe this bill offers both opportunity and encouragement. I commend it to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to be able to sum up and conclude this debate on behalf of the government. This is a bill which keeps one of our pre&hyphen;election commitments to spend an additional $143 million on Aboriginal education, and it is one pre&hyphen;election commitment that obviously the government is extremely happy to keep.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take the point of the member for Aston (Mr Nugent) that Aboriginal education depends on many things apart from simply educational funding. It depends upon good health and good housing, but education is what we are addressing today, and I am delighted to have the member for Aston's support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the glories of our nation is the tremendous efforts that have been made over the last 20 or 30 years to bring our Aboriginal people into full communion with the rest of our society. A sign of success, amidst all the gloom and doom we so often hear on this general subject, is that Aboriginal retention rates, while not good enough, while nowhere near retention rates for the wider community, are now at least at levels which would have been regarded as quite acceptable for the wider community just 15 years ago. It is sad that Aboriginal year 12 retention rates are only 30 per cent, but let us remember that this is where they all were just 15 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take also the point of the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) about the importance of education in English. I recall a story that was once told by our friend and colleague the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) of a visit to a remote Aboriginal out&hyphen;station by the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand. The minister came to the out&hyphen;station and he sat down and made a lengthy speech&mdash;in English, of course&mdash;explaining to the elders how important it was that their kids were educated in their Aboriginal languages. At the end of the minister's long speech, the elders stood up and said, `Minister, are you aware of the Pitjantjatjara word for helicopter?' The minister said, `Well, I'm sorry, I'm not.' They said, `The Pitjantjatjara word for helicopter is helicopter, and, if you don't educate our kids in English, how on earth are our kids ever going to get on, and how on earth are they ever going to compete in the wider society?' So I very much take the member for the Northern Territory's point; it was well made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for the Northern Territory also referred to what he says is a $3 million drop in funding that the territory will suffer under this bill. I want to point out that that statement is predicated upon transitional arrangements which have yet to be finalised. I am very confident that the territory government will have a strong ally in the member for the Northern Territory in negotiating the best possible deal for the territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also take the point that the member for the Northern Territory made that education in remote areas is vastly more expensive than education in urban centres such as Katherine, Alice Springs and Darwin. But I want to point out to the member that there are additional programs that will at least go part of the way to accommodating the problems that he so rightly refers to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is establishing the principle of per capita funding in Aboriginal education. Essentially, per capita funding means that if you have the students you get the money. In other words, this is the best possible way to ensure that educational institutions are doing the right thing by their clients. Until now, funding has depended upon an annual negotiation. The trouble with annual negotiations is that you are never quite sure exactly how much money you <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1337"> are going to get from one year to the next, and you are never quite sure whether&mdash;this year, next year or the year after&mdash;your mates or someone else's mates are going to find themselves in positions of authority on the distributing panel. By moving to per capita funding we are establishing more transparency in the funding of Aboriginal education, and that is something which I think everyone in this House would applaud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As my friend and colleague the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) pointed out, this bill also provides for performance reviews so that the providers of Aboriginal education should be subject to the same kinds of standards and performance testing which we expect of everyone else. The thing which always impresses me, Madam Deputy Speaker, whenever Aboriginal issues are debated in this parliament, is the care and the compassion which every member of the parliament brings to the subject. On this subject I want to say how delighted I am that Senator John Herron is the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. John Herron is a man of extraordinary integrity and great compassion. He is a great Australian. John Herron is the kind of person who could very well end up giving politicians a good name.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When discussing Aboriginal subjects, I am always somewhat reminded of the words of Ken Slessor in his famous poem, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Beach Burial</EMPHASIS>. He was writing about a different subject; nevertheless, I think the words are apt:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And each cross, the driven stake of tidewood,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bears the last signature of men,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Written with such perplexity, with such bewildered pity,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The words choke as they begin&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>We have struggled to come to grips with this issue&mdash;we have struggled for 208 years to come to grips with this issue&mdash;but we are getting there. When we do manage to bring about complete reconciliation, or reconciliation as complete as is humanly possible, between black and white Australians, it will be to the great glory of our nation and it will be one of the greatest days, if not the greatest day, in Australia's history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The way to do that is to remember that the things that unite us are always more important than the things that divide us. We white Australians have a lot more in common with black Australians than the newspapers would sometimes give credit for. Aboriginals' cultural memory extends back 40,000 years&mdash;and which of us white Australians can say that? They have had the stewardship of our nation for all but the last 200 years, and they will always have great honour for that. But the important thing to recall is that the average black Australian, like the average white Australian, wants to get ahead, wants a better deal for himself or herself, and in particular wants a better deal for his or her children. As my friend Charlie Perkins memorably said, `We have got to get off our black butts, too'. That is something that is well remembered whenever we are discussing this subject.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to conclude by pointing to something which I think is a very welcome development. A lot of my friends and colleagues have been most disconcerted by some of the things that have happened with ATSIC recently and some of the controversy surrounding the Hindmarsh Island Bridge. They have worried that these controversies have brought Aboriginal Australians into disrepute. That is one way of looking at it&mdash;and certainly there have been some bad headlines over the last 12 months. But another way of looking at it is that there is now a new pluralism in Aboriginal politics. We now have Aboriginal people, on both sides of Aboriginal issues, standing up and speaking for themselves. It was not, as it happened, white fellows who raised some of the problems with the Hindmarsh Island Bridge; it was the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1338"> dissident Ngarrindjeri women. It was not, in fact, white fellows who raised some of the problems with ATSIC; it was people like Sharon Firebrace, Peter Yu and others, who were standing up and saying, `We, the Aboriginal people, have got to be judged by the same standards of fairness and honesty by which everyone else is judged, and we have got to abide by the same standards of fairness and honesty which we expect to be delivered to us.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think what has become apparent over the last 12 months or so is that some of the people whom we are accustomed to go to as spokesmen or spokeswomen for the Aboriginal people no more represent Aboriginal people than, say, the Liberal Party or the Labor Party represents the Australian people. Often we do speak for the whole of the Australian people, but more often we do not. Occasionally there is a transcendent moment when the representative of one party or one party can speak for the whole of the people. But mostly it does not happen, and one party is simply speaking for a faction, or indeed a fraction, of the Australian people. And so it is now with Aboriginal affairs as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I want to indicate the government's strong intention to continue speaking to everyone in this debate&mdash;not just the people who agree with us, not just the people who disagree with us, but everyone. That is the only way that we are going to do justice to all Australians.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this bill is to amend the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1989 to ensure that Australia can discharge its obligations under international instruments relating to the control of transboundary movements of hazardous waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal act was passed at the time that the Basel convention was negotiated and in the chamber of December 1989. By coincidence, I actually took the bill through the House on that occasion on behalf of the then opposition. At that time the major concern regarding trade in hazardous waste related to hazardous waste sent to another country for what is termed final disposal, that is, for incineration, landfilling or the like. As a result, the principal act defines waste as material which has been rejected as worthless or otherwise falls within the ordinary definition of waste. As such it generally does not cover material sent for recovery. In the years since the convention was negotiated the emphasis in international debate has shifted to its coverage of materials which are traded for recovery operations, that is, for reclamation of metals or recovery of other useful materials.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1339">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as the trade in hazardous waste for final disposal led to an active process of transferring the environmental costs associated with the generation of hazardous waste from one country to another, and in particular from developed to developing countries, so the trade in hazardous waste for recovery operations can similarly lead to the transfer of environmental costs in an uncontrolled fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Basel convention was drafted to cover both kinds of processes, that is, both final disposal and recovery operations, and both kinds of processes are included in the convention definitions under the single term `disposal'. The Australian act does not cover a wide range of hazardous wastes from which valuable materials are to be recovered; these hazardous wastes have not been rejected as worthless or do not fall within the ordinary meaning of waste. The major purpose of amending the act is to remedy this discrepancy between our international obligations and our domestic legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Basel convention is the primary international instrument under which trade in hazardous waste is controlled and, as I said, in 1989 we endorsed that. It is the set of rules for this trade on which Australia and the many other countries which are parties to the convention have agreed. As virtually all of Australia's trading partners are either parties to the convention or parties to similar sets of rules established by the OECD, it is in Australia's trade interests, as well as within our international obligations, to abide by these rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interpretation of the convention as expressed in the principal act and with the amendments now put forward is in line with the views of other parties to the convention. In the absence of these amendments, Australia will continue to be out of step with other parties in its capacity to give domestic effect to the convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In accordance with the primary intention of the bill, the object of the act is to be amended to make it clear that one of its major aims is to give domestic effect to the Basel convention and other international instruments relating to trade in hazardous wastes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The definition of hazardous waste, now to be adopted, is aligned with that in the convention. This will ensure that in future Australia does not find itself in breach of the convention by virtue of having adopted a definition which is at odds with the interpretation of the convention followed by others. Nevertheless, the question of definition remains central to the operation of the act and, indeed, definitional questions remain the subject of very active debate in Basel convention meetings. In Australia a higher degree of concern has been expressed because of the uncertainty of the definitions in the convention. The bill addresses these concerns through the establishment of a process to provide greater practical certainty regarding what is and is not a hazardous waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides for the establishment of a technical group of scientific and technical experts who will advise the minister on definitional questions. The advice of this group will be of great benefit in enabling the minister to decide whether he or she believes that a material falls within the definition of hazardous waste and so is regulated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister will have the power to issue evidentiary certificates which will be prima facie evidence that a given material is or is not a hazardous waste. Also, by compiling a list of materials for which evidentiary certificates have been issued the minister will be able to provide greater certainty to those subject to regulation on what materials will be controlled and what will not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This means, for example, that it will be possible to issue an evidentiary certificate stating that a material such as clean ferrous scrap is not a hazardous waste subject to the act and that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1340"> it can be traded without any controls. At the same time, flexibility will be retained to respond to incremental progress in international discussions on what materials should and should not be controlled. As an example, recent international discussions suggest that the existence of internationally recognised product specifications will be influential in deciding what are and are not hazardous wastes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidentiary certificates will not be conclusive but will be prima facie evidence and the definitions in the act would remain as the final means of determining the definitional question. In practice, the advice of the technical group will provide the government with the capability of issuing clear guidance on definitional issues and should satisfy the needs of those who are subject to regulation for a clear understanding of their obligations under the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many who would prefer to replace the uncertain Basel definitions with Australia's own list or set of criteria. To follow that course, however, would inevitably lead to Australia once again being at odds with the convention and the views of our trading partners on what constitutes hazardous waste under the convention. This would risk not only a breach of our international obligations but could well lead to shipments acceptable under our definitions being rejected at foreign ports to the embarrassment, cost and inconvenience of all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The convention itself recognises that the hazard criteria it establishes are in need of further development. There is provision for the development of national tests which would provide greater precision in determining whether a waste is hazardous. That provision is included in the relevant annex to the convention by reference to which the bill defines hazardous waste. Over time the technical group will advise on national tests to establish hazard on a more certain basis, taking account of international developments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another key concept in the convention now adopted into the act is the definition of `environmentally sound management'. The convention requires not only that an exporting country obtain prior consent from the country of import before allowing the transboundary movement to proceed, but also that the country of export requires that the waste to be shipped is managed in an environmentally sound way in the country of import.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concept of environmentally sound management of hazardous waste is defined in the convention as taking all practicable steps to ensure that the hazardous waste is managed to protect human health and the environment. The technical group will advise the minister to assist in the determination of what constitutes environmentally sound management and whether particular facilities or processes meet the definition. For that reason it will include people with expertise in scientific and technical, social and economic, environmental and public health fields.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concept of environmentally sound management as set out in the convention replaces the phrase in the principal act, `dispose of safely'. In the principal act, `dispose of safely' is defined in terms of an outcome, that is, that hazardous waste is disposed of safely provided there is no damage to human health or the environment. By contrast, `environmentally sound management' is defined now by reference to a process, that is, taking all practicable steps to prevent damage to human health and the environment. On the other hand, the definition of `dispose of safely' appears to exclude any assessment of effluents and emissions from the disposal process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In practice, pragmatic considerations are likely to prevail. Within the Basel convention process detailed guidelines on what constitutes environmentally sound management have already been drafted and these will provide the context of the technical group's advice to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1341"> minister. Australia will put its efforts into ensuring that those guidelines are sound. Once again the need to ensure that our legislation is fully in line with our international obligations is the overriding consideration in the changes set out in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the convention, the general rule is that parties must not trade in hazardous waste with non&hyphen;parties. An exception to this is provided for in article 11, whereby parties may enter into agreements or arrangements either with other parties or with non&hyphen;parties. These agreements or arrangements can set out controls which are different from those prescribed by the convention itself, provided those controls do not reduce the level of environment protection intended by the convention. The main such agreement to which Australia is a party is the OECD decision on transboundary movements of hazardous waste destined for recovery operations which regulates transboundary movements of hazardous wastes among OECD countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides explicitly for regulations giving effect to such agreements and arrangements and for those regulations to give domestic effect to rules different from those in the convention. The materials covered by the agreements or arrangements may also differ to some extent from those covered by the convention, thus the OECD decision covers some wastes which are not hazardous wastes under the convention and trade in these must comply with the controls set out by the decision. Conversely, the decision classifies some materials as non&hyphen;hazardous wastes, known as the OECD green list, and these materials may be traded without a permit provided countries outside the OECD are not involved. The provisions are general and can be applied to any further article 11 agreements or arrangements which Australia enters into.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The procedures by which the minister reaches a decision on whether or not a permit should be issued for a transboundary movement have been amended once again to bring the act more closely into line with the convention. Among the changes are those ensuring that the notification and consent procedures established by the convention are followed. Another amends the existing provision that the minister have regard to the prospect of processing hazardous waste within Australia rather than allowing export to take place. This is in accordance with article 4(2)(d) of the convention which requires parties to `minimise the transboundary movement of hazardous waste consistent with the environmentally sound and efficient management of hazardous waste.' The intent of this article is met by requirements that disposal in Australia must be efficient, safe and environmentally sound. The intent is that a local disposal facility must be more than merely an experimental or test facility and must operate on a commercial basis. There must be some cost&hyphen;effectiveness factor which is brought to bear when the minister weighs up the pros and cons of local versus overseas disposal in deciding whether or not a permit should be issued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal act already provides that there must be appropriate insurance for shipments of hazardous waste before a permit is issued. A new provision in the bill allows the minister to require bonds or guarantees in addition to or instead of insurance. This recognises that where there is contravention of a permit for one reason or other, an insurance policy may not be paid out and in an appropriate case a bond would allow the Commonwealth to ensure that there was some coverage. In other cases insurance may not be available and a guarantee would provide the opportunity for a permit to be issued in such cases. The principal act allows the sum total of such arrangements&mdash;insurance bonds and guarantees&mdash;to be assessed when the minister comes to a decision.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1342">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other procedural amendments are aimed at ensuring that the administration of the act proceeds smoothly and efficiently and that all convention requirements are met. Because the convention itself contains detailed rules, it has not been possible to simplify the administrative system beyond a certain point. That is why both the principal act and the amending bill are complex. Where possible and appropriate, provision is made for the making of regulations to set out requirements under the act in order to ensure that its administration will be flexible and responsive to the needs of industry. A detailed set of administrative procedures is being developed in consultation with interested parties, including industry, and will be completed by the time the amendments are ready to come into force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act also addresses a number of aspects of the convention which were not picked up in the original drafting process. One of the most important of these is the issue of transit permits&mdash;that is, for Australian consent or its denial to the transiting of waste from another country on its way to a third country for disposal. There is also explicit provision for more than one shipment of the same hazardous waste to be covered by a single permit. The convention allows such a procedure up to a maximum of 12 months provided that certain conditions are met and that is now reflected in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current system for recovery of the government's administrative costs in respect of issuing permits is unnecessarily inflexible. The bill provides for fees to be set in regulations on the basis of administrative costs of each type of permit. The minister has discretion to reduce these where appropriate. The fee level may not be above the fee currently prescribed in the principal act. Penalties under the act have increased in order to provide a deterrent to illegal traffic. Prevention of illegal traffic is specifically required by the convention and the value of some of the transactions involved requires that penalties be raised to ensure that companies are deterred from failing to comply with the act's requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A new provision is that executive officers of companies will be personally liable for contraventions by companies with the onus of proof resting with the Commonwealth. That is, liability will not be automatic. Liability for executive officers of companies is an important step in ensuring compliance with the act, as it would be difficult for other compliance measures to be effective. For example, identification of hazardous waste at customs barriers when materials leave the country would often be difficult given that hazardous waste cannot readily be distinguished from a variety of other materials.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Third party standing under the principal act is already very broad with respect to appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Standing under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977, known as the ADJR Act, has been extended by providing standing for Australian organisations and associations which have matters which relate to the act as part of their object or purpose. This section is intended to extend but not limit the existing standing provisions which are provided under the ADJR Act. This will provide further legislative clarity to the standing rules for the purposes of the ADJR Act and as an extension of the standing rules already recognised in recent cases under other similar legislation. The extended standing provided by the bill relates only to persons or organisations living or incorporated in Australia, but persons or organisations from outside Australia could still obtain standing if they could otherwise demonstrate that they were `persons aggrieved' in terms of the ADJR Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill has been the subject of extensive consultations with a variety of groups, both inside and outside government. In particular, detailed consultations have been held with a policy reference group made up of representatives of industry, environment groups, development and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1343"> cooperation groups and unions. State and territory governments have also been consulted. An exposure draft of the bill was provided to members of the reference group and to the states and territories and comments have been taken into account in finalising the bill. In the course of the consultation an issue which has stimulated more discussion than any other is the prospect of bans on transboundary movement of hazardous waste from developed to developing countries. This issue was the subject of a decision at the second meeting of the conference of parties to the Basel convention in March 1994 and an amendment decision at the third conference of parties to the convention in September 1995. This latter decision, known as the ban amendment, implements an immediate ban on the export of hazardous waste for final disposals from countries listed in annex VII of the convention&mdash;parties and other states which are members of the OECD and the EC and Liechtenstein&mdash;to non&hyphen;annex VII countries and phases out by the end of 1997 and bans from that date the export of hazardous waste for recovery operations from annex VII countries to non&hyphen;annex VII countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its explanation of vote at that meeting Australia said that, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is essential parties have a common understanding of what is prohibited.</PARA>
<PARA>and indicated that it would, and I quote again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">only consider ratifying the ban amendment when the work on hazardous characteristics is completed to Australia's satisfaction.</PARA>
<PARA>The work referred to is being carried out by the Basel convention's technical working group and is aimed at clarifying the wastes covered by the convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note that the bill does not implement the ban amendment. This government is yet to consider its position on ratification of the amendment, and before any decision is made on ratification the government's new process for treaty&hyphen;making must be observed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The export of waste for final disposal to developing countries, however, is not generally regarded as an acceptable practice. This is now reflected in the bill. Indeed, if I cast my mind back to 1989 when this bill was originally introduced, that was a matter of concern then. Indeed, the bill extends that policy by limiting exports for final disposal to any country to exceptional circumstances, such as where there is a direct risk to human health or environment if the waste remains in Australia, or if the wastes are being exported for research or testing. Each permit issued under this provision of the amended act will be specified in the regulations to ensure that the application of the concept of exceptional circumstances is transparent, and subject to scrutiny by the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extension of the definition of hazardous waste from that in the principal act to that in the convention will inevitably result in regulation of a far wider range of hazardous wastes than is the case at present. Studies which have been carried out recently into the range of wastes that may be covered by the Basel convention, and Australia's trade in them, suggest that the total trade may be somewhere between $100 and $200 million each year. The vast majority of this trade takes place with OECD countries, and is therefore subject to the less rigid controls set out by the OECD's decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The kinds of materials in which we trade with developing countries of our region include spent lead acid batteries; metal bearing wastes, such as sludges, slags and drosses; and a miscellaneous range of wastes variously containing metals, such as lead or arsenic. These are the kinds of materials which will be regulated under the amended act.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1344">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Suggestions that ferrous and most non&hyphen;ferrous scrap metal will be caught up under the convention are mistaken. In general, the amended act will not cover trade in products, mineral ores and concentrates; processed minerals and metals, petroleum products; and forest products, including uncontaminated waste paper, textiles or materials produced to meet commercial specifications intended for recycling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The distinction between wastes on the one hand, and non&hyphen;wastes on the other, will be subject to consideration and advice by the technical group and it will exclude co&hyphen;products, intermediaries and by&hyphen;products from the definition of hazardous wastes. The technical group will also be giving priority to assisting the minister in determining which of the OECD green list materials are clearly inside the scope of the act and which are clearly outside it, with a view to the minister's reflecting this in evidentiary certificates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consultations with all interested parties will continue, as regulations and supportive administrative arrangements are developed. Bilateral discussions between Australia and our developing country trading partners make it clear that they wish and expect Australia to abide by the rules to which so many of the countries of the world have agreed. A continued failure to do so may lead to retaliatory action by these countries which, in turn, could threaten trade far more seriously than the controls required by the convention and now established by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clearly time, in the government's view, for Australia to give effect to the obligation it has taken upon itself, just as the vast majority of its trading partners have done. I have pleasure in commending the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill, the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1996 is a consolidated version, as we have heard, of the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1995, which was introduced by the Labor government in 1995 during the life of the last parliament. It incorporates a number of amendments moved by the previous Labor environment minister. The opposition, therefore, supports this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we have heard, the major reason for amending the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1989 was, and is still, the requirement to remedy the discrepancy that existed, or exists, between Australia's international obligation under the Basel convention and our domestic legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Basel convention is based on the following principles: the generation of hazardous wastes must be reduced to a minimum; where it is unavoidable, the waste must be disposed of as close as possible to the source of generation; hazardous wastes may not be exported to Antarctica or to states which are not parties either to the Basel convention or a treaty established under equivalent standards, or to parties which have banned all imports of such wastes, and in the case of any transboundary hazardous waste movements, the principles of environmentally sound management and disposal must be observed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aim of the Basel convention is therefore to reduce to a minimum the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes consistent with their safe management and disposal. The convention covers wastes destined for recycling as well as for final disposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal act's definition of hazardous waste, however, does not cover material sent for recovery operations. The principal act's definition of waste is confined to material which is worthless. This definition has previously been construed as excluding wastes destined for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1345"> recovery or recycling operations. This means the act does not comply with Australia's obligations under the convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition clearly supports making Australia's legislation conform to the international convention as closely as possible. We also support the establishment of the technical group of scientific and technical experts to advise the minister on definitional questions. This group will provide advice to the minister on what is and is not a hazardous waste under the bill's definition of hazardous waste. The technical group will provide the government with the capability of issuing clear guidance on definitional issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment bill removes the phrase `dispose of safely' and replaces it with the concept of environmentally sound management. Environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes or other wastes is defined in the convention as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . taking all practicable steps to ensure that hazardous wastes or other wastes are managed in a manner which will protect human health and the environment against adverse effects which may result from such wastes.</PARA>
<PARA>We have been assured by the minister and his department that the replacement of `dispose of safely' from the principal act does not translate to a weakening of Australia's commitment to environmental protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We accept this assurance, although obviously we will be checking it very closely, and we also acknowledge the wisdom in our domestic legislation mirroring the international convention as closely as possible. But it should not be to the detriment of standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, since the opposition has actually done all the work in developing this legislation, it would like an assurance from the minister representing the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) that the amended legislation receives the administrative support that is required to see it properly implemented. This is the most important point I want to make today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been informed that the new government intends&mdash;and this is very alarming&mdash;to dismantle the Environment Protection Agency's waste management branch. This is the body in the federal government which administers a number of international conventions including the Basel convention. It also develops protocols on important environmental matters such as sea dumping and agricultural chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would seem rather ironic, to say the least, that, at the very same time this parliament is passing amending legislation that will ensure Australia's law accurately reflects its international obligations, the Minister for the Environment is dismantling the arm of government responsible for the legislation's proper administration. It would be a very curious outcome indeed. Indeed, I think it would be an outcome that would be condemned widely not just by environment groups in this country but also by industry and by our international partners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Are we today creating a legal facade, legislation without the necessary administrative and technical support? I would like the minister representing the Minister for the Environment, although he is not here at the moment, to guarantee that the EPA's waste management branch will not disappear and indeed, will be resourced at the same level or better than it was under the previous Labor government, otherwise what we are going through here right now is a farce and Australia will not be able to guarantee that it can meet its international obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill has been subject to an extensive consultation process and has wide industry support, and the opposition will support it. But we do so, knowing that the whole process of meeting our international obligations will be placed in jeopardy if the government disbands that section </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1346">
<PARA>of the environment department under the Environment Protection Agency which is responsible for ensuring that we meet our international, let alone our domestic, obligations and I for one do not want to be seen to be party to such a farce. So I put the government on notice that any attempt to dismantle, diminish or reduce in any way the resources to the sector will be viewed by the opposition as a significant betrayal of trust.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has introduced new rules to ensure that Australia does not take on international obligations without proper scrutiny in the parliament. But that does not imply that we are proposing to take our international obligations lightly. Quite the contrary: our intention is to ensure that we fully understand what international rules mean for Australia before we give effect to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation rectifies a situation in which Australia took on international rules without properly understanding their implications. As a result, the legislation that was passed has been found to be out of step with international practice and international law. We are now putting into place a more thorough legislative instrument to ensure that Australia meets conscientiously the obligations taken on almost exactly four years ago when the convention came into force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only in accordance with our international obligations that the current act needs amendment. The act as it stands is cumbersome and inflexible, and needs adjusting to ensure that it can be administered efficiently and with the flexibility needed in the various circumstances that are likely to occur from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extension of the ambit of this act to include wastes for recovery and recycling is highly significant. It brings under the act a far wider range of materials than has been covered up to now. These materials include many metal bearing weights. Some of these are things such as spent lead acid batteries which are heavily traded around the world, and where most parties accept that the trade can easily involve subjecting other countries and their communities to significant environmental risks associated with secondary smelting of lead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other materials are the secondary materials produced in metal refining. There are processes established by this act to ensure that careful attention is paid to whether these materials should be judged to be wastes or not, and whether they are hazardous or not. In general, only if they pass both tests&mdash;that is, that they are both wastes and hazardous&mdash;will they be covered by the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These processes are necessary to ensure that the act does not inadvertently pick up materials which do not present an environmental threat and should not be regulated. Most of Australia's trade in hazardous waste, especially in the last couple of years, has occurred with other countries of the OECD. In 1992, OECD countries agreed on a separate and particular regime for managing trade in hazardous waste, using a listing system dividing hazardous waste into red, amber and green categories on the basis of comparative hazard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Basel convention such an agreement is possible and the act makes provision for such agreements to be given recognition and for their rules to be established by regulation. One of the conditions is that the rules established by such separate agreements would not reduce the level of environment protection provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill has been the subject of extensive consultation processes. As is the nature of things, not everybody involved in those consultations finds every aspect of the bill ideal. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that the bill has been substantially improved by the discussions that have taken place on it and the final outcomes represent the most satisfactory reconciliation of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1347"> competing interest that could be arrived at. Industry interests have advised that they support passage of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All international instruments relating to trade in hazardous waste have been troubled by controversy on how to accurately define hazardous waste and also on the degree to which hazardous waste should be treated as a range of materials for which separate arrangements are needed. Countries of the OECD solve this problem by drawing up detailed lists of wastes and developing a control system with varying degrees of restraint, depending on how hazardous the waste is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Basel convention set up a somewhat different system which relied on a short list of waste streams and contaminates, and a list of hazards. The trouble with this system was that it did not provide the level of certainty which countries actually needed when they were trying to give effect to the convention on a case by case basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In September last year, at the third meeting of the conference of the parties, there was agreement that priority attention should be given to reducing the uncertainties surrounding which wastes are covered by the convention. Several meetings have now been held. Progress has been encouraging, and at the most recent meeting of the convention's technical working group in Kuala Lumpur last month delegates arrived at a provisional listing of wastes, which goes some considerable way towards providing the certainty that Australia and other countries have been seeking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The draft lists drawn up include those agreed to be subject to the convention, those agreed not to be subject to the convention, those on which a decision has yet to be taken, and even some which perhaps ought to be subject to the convention but appear not to be. These lists as yet have no legal significance and that cannot be expected for some time. However, they do provide useful guidance to countries in making decisions about what materials should and should not be covered. I would merely note here that many of the materials of most concern to Australia have now been settled, including many now on the list of non&hyphen;wastes. That has provided considerable reassurance to parts of industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been criticism in some quarters of the Basel convention as a piece of international law. Most international conventions are inherently imperfect, negotiated as they are by compromise amongst countries whose vital interests all differ. On the other hand, most international conventions allow a degree of flexibility in their application. Concerns over the Basel convention will not be resolved by pointing out its flaws. They will only be resolved by working within the convention forums for a process of incremental improvement. These are the rules that our trading partners have agreed to and we must proceed hand in hand with them in the process of debate and discussion aimed at generating better outcomes both for the international environment and for Australia's trading interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate about trade and the environment is a very active one and the Basel convention is a concrete example of that debate. We can use the convention in some ways as a test case in order to find solutions which provide the best level of environment protection for the vulnerable, without imposing unnecessary constraints upon trade. The debate on these issues in Australia has been a lively one and we are now well positioned to contribute to international discussions in a constructive and helpful manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is plenty of lively debate in Australia these days on environmental issues&mdash;and I would say so there should be. Last year there were significant protests over nuclear testing in the South Pacific and expressions of fears and concern for that environment and the South <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1348"> Pacific in general. Now we will have, and I am sure we will continue to have, community discussion and, I believe, ultimate anger as minority groups join forces in the other place to prevent the implementation of our $1 billion Natural Heritage Trust of Australia. Some in the other place seem to have no understanding of the good commonsense of selling off one&hyphen;third of one national treasure to invest in another national treasure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such an investment would fund a national vegetation initiative to tackle Australia's land and water degradation problems; the rehabilitation of the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin through the implementation of the Murray&hyphen;Darling 2001 project; the undertaking of a national land and water resources audit; the implementation of a comprehensive national reserve system to protect Australia's biodiversity; and the coast and clean seas initiative to tackle the pollution problems in our coastal areas. The people attempting to block these initiatives are the very ones who claim to have special interests in our environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Environment and hazardous waste issues should be considered globally and locally. There are in my own electorate a number of local environment issues that I have addressed on other occasions. One such issue is a very important one, and that has been the dumping of over 200,000 tonnes of hazardous waste at the Australian National site at the Islington Railyards at Kilburn. The former Minister for Transport and now shadow minister for foreign affairs (Mr Brereton) announced a $5 million clean&hyphen;up of part of that site, believe it or not, three or four days before the election was announced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This happened after two years of agitation on my part; after criticism of the Health Commission in South Australia about a previous proposed clean&hyphen;up; after intervention on the part of South Australia's Environment Protection Authority; and only after a report which the then minister himself in fact ordered from the CSIRO which found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its current condition the Islington Railyards northern site area represents a potential health hazard to nearby residents and workers.</PARA>
<PARA>The pre&hyphen;election announcement was just one more political stunt, but I should put on the record that, following the change of government on 2 March, I have already had meetings with the Minister for the Environment in South Australia, David Wotton, the federal Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) and the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill), and have made representations to the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am now quite determined that there will be proper action on this issue, action made essential after previous neglect, and made more difficult because of the Beazley black hole. I reiterate: we have national obligations, international obligations and local obligations to the environment, which is now considered to be such an important issue&mdash;and, I would argue, belatedly considered so. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very glad to see the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill make a return to the government's political agenda. It was first introduced by the previous government last year. The bill covers areas of the transportation of hazardous waste where Australia is certainly lagging behind the rest of the developed world. As the previous Minister for Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, put so succinctly in March last year when he introduced the bill, `The existing Commonwealth legislation fails to meet our obligations under the Basel convention.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Basel convention&mdash;as indicated by other speakers&mdash;was adopted in 1989 and ratified by Australia in 1992. It ties its signatories to a stringent code of conduct in the transportation and trade of hazardous waste&mdash;a code which we have been guilty of neglecting. As a nation <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1349"> which prides itself on its integrity in its dealings with the international community, as a nation which regards its diligence in meeting its international obligations as an example from which others can learn, we cannot afford to drag our feet any longer on such an internationally important issue as the transportation of hazardous waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last 10 to 20 years, as we have become more attuned to the needs of our environment, we have been led to ask ourselves some difficult questions about the transportation and disposal of toxic waste products. This bill is another example of how we have slowly begun to educate ourselves. It is an example of the steps that we must take in order to reverse our environment's dire state of health. Some say that these lessons are being learnt too late and too slowly. It is hard not to disagree when one can see all around us the devastation of our environment continuing, seemingly unabated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose only our children will know whether we have acted soon enough; whether we are now acting with enough speed to reverse our environment's decline. I think I can say, without being glib, that perhaps we would be better off to not be around when our children are old enough to answer that question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Depending on whom we talk to, we find that Australia's record on protecting the environment on both a national and an international level is either commendable or contemptible. It is true that we have led the way on certain environmental issues. The former Labor government's Landcare program was an attempt, on a vast scale, to begin the process of reversing the steady erosion of the Australian land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we are presently viewed with a jaundiced eye by our neighbours in the South Pacific for not supporting the Association of Small Island States' proposal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2005. In fact, in regard to setting targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we have now been left behind by the western European nations and are in danger of being isolated further by the United States and Canada.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the trade of hazardous waste, our recent history is similarly chequered. Per capita, between 1990 and 1993, Australia exported three times more hazardous waste than did the United States&mdash;a shameful position to find ourselves in. Those responsible for trading Australia's waste overseas have in the past taken advantage of a loophole which exists in the present act&mdash;namely, its definition of waste differs from that used by the Basel convention. Thankfully, the present bill will change this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past, under the guise of `recycling', Australia has sent thousands of tonnes of toxic waste to darken our neighbours' doorsteps, rather than face the problem ourselves. This has all been done without contravening the 1989 act, but it is, I believe, still against the spirit of the convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because waste products intended for recycling were not covered by the previous act, there was no requirement for companies to report the export of such products to the Australian authorities and in turn no prior informed consent was obtained from the countries of import. Nor was there any inquiry made as to whether these wastes would be managed in an environmentally sound manner by the importing state. The environmental organisation Greenpeace has since reported that waste exported by Australia for recycling has routinely been treated by importing countries in south&hyphen;east Asia in an unsafe manner which has resulted in damages to human health and the environment in those countries. I wonder, how many Australians are aware of this state of affairs? Who would not be appalled at the thought of our waste destroying the lives of others?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1350">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As was mentioned in the other House during debate on this bill, in 1994 Australia was the main exporter of lead acid batteries to Indonesia. In 1992, we exported more than 11,000 tonnes of lead acid batteries, compared with the United Kingdom's 700 tonnes in 1993. In the following year, we exported 20,000 kilograms of lead battery waste to Hong Kong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Up until now, lead battery acid would be considered a hazardous waste by anyone's definition&mdash;anyone's definition, it appears, but ours. Lead battery acid is a destructive pollutant and, if not disposed of correctly, can seriously affect people's health and safety. However, in the past we have considered such waste as a `good, intended for recycling' and, as such, it was excluded from control under the act. Again, this is a situation which I am pleased this bill will now rectify.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet as much as I commend the bill, I also think it raises just as many questions as it seeks to answer. It raises questions, not just about our past conduct in regard to the trade of serious toxic waste, but also it raises basic questions which reflect upon the desire of government and of the Australian people to change the way we live in order to produce less waste and in so doing, save our collective hides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am pleased to see that we are strengthening our position on such an important environmental issue as the transportation of hazardous waste, I think that we have largely missed another central provision of the Basel convention, and that is that the contracting parties shall:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">minimise the generation of hazardous and other wastes.</PARA>
<PARA>Simply by taking a look around our cities and our towns&mdash;not just at the factories and the waste stations, but also at our homes and our local rubbish tips&mdash;we can see that this is quite obviously not happening. Our generation of waste continues without interruption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We often hear our leaders talking about the economic ramifications of living beyond our means. But I doubt that there are many Australians who understand or appreciate the extent to which we are living on environmental credit and in the process, that we are destroying our country forever. The hazardous waste bill we are debating today is just the end result of our nation's insatiable appetite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing that alarms me, and which the debate surrounding this bill has constantly raised, is that despite the warnings and the future global emergencies which scientists and naturalists alert us to, Australians continue to produce waste at an alarming rate of knots. Approach virtually anyone in the street and ask that person about the state of the Australian or, in fact, the global environment. More than likely, if he or she has read a newspaper or watched the television in the last 10 years, that person will say, `Oh yeah, it is dreadful, isn't it? We have got to do something about that.' Or, the comment will be, `Don't worry, they'll find an answer.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In a poll taken by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in May of 1992, 70.3 per cent of respondents considered that environmental concerns and economic growth had equal importance. And 18.8 per cent considered that environmental concerns were more important than economic growth. Yet despite their good intentions, most Australians are inadvertently part of the waste&hyphen;producing juggernaut. Australians may feel strongly about the environment, but we continue to buy products wrapped in excessive and unnecessary packaging. When we shop, we fill up half a dozen plastic bags, which we promptly dispose of upon returning home&mdash;and I am as guilty as others. The vast majority of Australians have not twigged to the link between our devastated environment and our rampant waste&hyphen;producing consumerism. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1351"> When people say, `We have got to do something about it,' most mean `we' as referring to the government. Or, when people say, `They will find an answer,' most mean the teams of scientists and researchers in whom they place all their trust. And yet while the government and the scientists have enormous responsibilities, part of which we are fulfilling here today, Australians have to start recognising that they can, and must, play an important role in doing something about it as well. We can no longer live our lives on this earth saying, `Damn the consequences,' or we will find the consequences have, in fact, damned us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As evidence of this point, I would like the members present to pay particularly close attention to some of the following figures, which I have researched. In 1988, every man, woman and child in Sydney generated the equivalent of a tonne of waste. That is over three million tonnes of waste in one year. Eight years ago these figures were taken out. Considering the fact that our nation's population is growing at the rate of 1.2 per cent each year&mdash;similar in size to Wollongong's population of 220,000&mdash;this is a situation which I doubt would have improved. Rather, it is one that would have become worse. Members should also be aware that this figure does not include the 70,000 motor vehicles and two million tyres discarded by Sydneysiders in that year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The domestic garbage disposed of by Sydneysiders in our bicentennial year included paper to the equivalent of one million trees&mdash;enough timber, incidentally, Mr Deputy Speaker, to build 40,000 homes; enough glass to make 200 million soft drink bottles; enough metal to construct 75,000 new cars; and two billion drink containers' worth of plastic. This was all discarded just in Sydney. From these figures, it is not surprising that it has been estimated that Sydney, in particular, will run out of landfill sites before the turn of the century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the ecological footprint, or ecological impact, made by Sydneysiders, it takes 4.5 hectares of productive land now to support each individual in this campaign of consumption. That is 4.5 hectares compared to an average of 1.7 hectares across the world. Putting it plainly, every Australian affects the environment 20 times more than every Indonesian. Sydneysiders and, I assume, all Australians have lived with what environmentalists call the myth of disposal for far too long. For far too long we have taken it as a given that we could take out of the earth whatever we wanted and we could throw away whatever we liked and it would never affect us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the age of recycling has also well and truly begun; yet I am afraid that recycling on its own is not going to be enough. What we need to do is reduce our waste, be it toxic, hazardous or otherwise. If we can succeed in reducing our incredibly high levels of waste, then the question of how to dispose of it&mdash;whether by landfill, incineration or export&mdash;will no longer be as pressing. It is obvious that the message is just not getting through to average Australians. As I have said before, they have not yet twigged to the link between their lifestyles and the damage to the environment. We will not be able to cut down our levels of waste while continuing to live in the way to which we have become accustomed. Compromise, unfortunately, will not get us there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As with most things worth doing, there will have to be some level of inconvenience. As the worldwide respected environmentalist David Suzuki writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This new sacred truth of raised consciousness&mdash;that we can fit saving the planet into our lifestyle&mdash;is as patently false as are the inherited ones we cling to. And it is dangerous. We can't negotiate with a faltering life&hyphen;support system. We can't buy a future for our children. The only thing we might be able to buy them&mdash;if we act now&mdash;is a little time; the time it takes to embrace a new way of living, a new world view.  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1352">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further to the questions the bill raises about our level of waste production, I think it also raises serious questions about the extent to which Australia wishes to lead the world on environmental matters. Does Australia want to show the flag, or will it continue, as is the case with this bill, to play catch&hyphen;up, doing only the bare minimum required by its international obligations or when pressured by its trading partners or the sway of world opinion?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been stated by other speakers, this bill is all about bringing ourselves into line with the other signatories to the Basel convention. But we are not going any further. We are not inspiring our international partners such as the United States&mdash;which, incidentally, remains conspicuously absent from the membership roll of the convention&mdash;to go further with us. We are simply doing the bare minimum required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the second reading speech on this bill, the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is in Australia's trade interests, as well as within our international obligations, to abide by these rules.</PARA>
<PARA>Those rules are the ones laid down by the Basel convention. But does he not see our adherence to the convention as also being an important environmental statement to the rest of the world? Does he not see it as also being an important step in putting an end to Australia's role in the shameful environmental degradation of our neighbours through the exportation of our toxic waste? This is the sort of political approach that we need to change. And to do so we need to change opinions at ground level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recent tragedy in Port Arthur showed how quickly politicians and governments were able to come together and produce a solution to the problems of gun control in this country. The plans devised by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the state premiers have received almost total support from the Australian people. Unfortunately, it took a tragedy in order to get action from our leaders and to change the opinions of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before that terrible day, most Australians recognised that controlling guns would be in everyone's interest, yet the issue failed to make political waves. The people did not ask the governments and, by and large, we failed to act. I fear that it will take an environmental tragedy on the scale of Port Arthur to bring about the ground swell of opinion needed to force the kind of action we need from government, at all levels, to solve our environmental problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, Senator Hill's second reading speech on this bill was indicative of the political mind&hyphen;set we need to overcome if we are to salvage our environment. While I appreciate that the political realities of economics and business continue to tie our hands, and while I understand that blind idealism will never get us anywhere, I hope that one day we will reach the point when environmental legislation is passed not because we look bad or suffer economically if we fail to have it passed, but because it makes environmental sense&mdash;first and foremost. Perhaps it is too much of a homily, but if we do not change the way we think now, as Australians and as international citizens, those same economic ties will become like anvils around our necks as the chance to restore this country's environment slips beyond our grasp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the opposition has stated, while supporting the bill before the House I am particularly pleased that we have finally got it there. I am not saying that this present government is at fault any more than the past government. But I am saying that the conventional wisdom which we always seem to put in environmental legislation before this House must change. It is about <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1353"> time that all of us, as both legislators and leaders, stopped to think, but most importantly to look, learn and listen to what is happening within Australia, to what people's concerns are and how we should be meeting our obligations to overcome those problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In commending the bill, I believe we should go that step further. We should lead by example. Australia, as a country that we continually say has come of age, and Australians, as citizens who stand up and say we are so proud of our country, should not follow. We should stand up and we should lead. If it means that at times we are going to suffer for it economically, I believe the average Australian will understand and appreciate that if it is explained to them what the long&hyphen;term ramifications of not taking these decisions could mean to them, to their children and to their children's children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot continue to complain and to whinge when a particular bill comes before the House. The pressure must be applied continually to make sure that legislation is enacted so that Australia stands proudly as a nation; to make sure that we will lead by example and start cleaning up at our own doorstep the environmental problems we have created through industry and through grabbing the short term economic return for so many years in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not condemning the people of the past. Perhaps inadvertently, they did not understand or appreciate some of the mistakes they were making at the time. But, with the knowledge we now have available to us, I do condemn anyone today if stringent steps are not taken to make sure that we have a country we are not only proud of, but one that environmentally will sustain all future generations within this continent. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge the vigorous contribution from the previous speaker, the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), and her interest in this topic. I also wish to make a contribution on the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill, which is generating considerable interest in the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The object of this bill, as stated in the act, is to regulate the export, import and transit of hazardous waste to ensure that exported, imported or transited waste is managed in an environmentally sound manner so that human beings and the environment, both within and outside Australia, are protected from the harmful effects of the waste. The aims of the bill are to give effect to the Basel Convention on Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, and to agreements and arrangements of the kind mentioned in article 11 of the convention&mdash;that is the article that is particularly concerned with bilateral, multilateral and regional agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Briefly, the Basel convention was adopted in the city of Basel in Switzerland on 22 March 1989. It entered into force, as they say, one year later in March 1990, and Australia acceded to it on 5 February 1992. The Basel convention is the primary international instrument under which trade in hazardous waste is controlled. It is the set of rules for this trade on which Australia and many other countries that are parties to the convention have agreed. As virtually all of Australia's trading partners are either parties to the convention or parties to similar sets of rules established by the OECD, it is in Australia's trade interests, as well as within our international obligations, to abide by these rules. If we do not do so we may find ourselves in an embarrassing situation when we send this sort of waste overseas, as we do from time to time, that shipments may be rejected at other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act, when implemented, will also give greater certainty as to what is and is not hazardous waste. A technical group will oversee that and make recommendations to the minister, who will issue evidentiary certificates.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1354">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe total trade in hazardous waste around the world is not massive. There is about $100 million to $200 million worth each year, the majority of which takes place within OECD countries. As I understand it, something of the order of 350 million tonnes of hazardous waste is generated in the world annually. Australia, at present, does not have the facilities to deal with some of these wastes generated in the processes of making hexachlorobenzene, polychlorinated biphenyls&mdash;the PCBs; and the dioxins. These are found in plastics, pesticides, refrigerants, fire extinguishers and solvents et cetera, so certainly Australia, as a developed country, does have an interest in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to contrast the handling and the problems of hazardous waste that previous speakers have mentioned with similar problems that have been encountered with nuclear waste. There are lessons in that industry that I think are pertinent to this industry. Most radioactive waste in Australia is generated from ANSTO, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, at Lucas Heights in Sydney. We produce radiopharmaceuticals, radioisotopes and radiochemicals, which we use in the field of medicine and in many industries and for research purposes. Australia has benefited from those for some decades now because they improve our health. They are used for diagnoses in particular, as well as for the treatment of certain diseases such as cancer. They have saved lives in this country; they have enhanced the environment in the way we have been able to use them; and they benefit many industries, particularly the agricultural industry. In fact, so fast is nuclear medicine growing at present&mdash;I believe the growth rate is about 14 per cent cumulative every year&mdash;that of everyone alive today about 50 per cent can expect to have some nuclear medicine procedure, whether it be for diagnosis or treatment, some time in their lifetime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In saying all this, I want to stress that the reactor at Lucas Heights is a very small one. The total fuel load is only about seven kilograms compared with, say, a power generating plant which would have about 190 tonnes of fuel there and it is enriched to about 60 per cent uranium 235. The vast bulk of the waste that comes from the nuclear industry in Australia is not high&hyphen;level waste at all&mdash;in fact, only about three per cent of it by volume, even though that contains about 95 per cent of the radioactivity. We send overseas most of the high&hyphen;level waste and in that regard we abide by international treaties, not unlike the Basel convention on hazardous waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the low&hyphen;level waste, and the way we have treated it in an irrational manner in Australia, that I just want to make some comments on. This low&hyphen;level waste is about 90 per cent of the volume, even though it is only one per cent of the radioactivity. There is of course the intermediate&hyphen;level waste which takes up about seven per cent of the volume and makes up about four per cent of the radioactivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The low&hyphen;level waste comes from hospitals, laboratories, industries such as the aircraft industry and primary industry, et cetera. It is not some dreadful hazardous waste. It is mainly clothing such as overalls and goggles. The low&hyphen;level waste is made up of other things such as paper and rags, tools, air filters in buildings, et cetera. It does not require special shielding during its handling and transport. In fact, it is suitable for shallow land burial. It is usually compacted into 200 litre drums&mdash;the old 44&hyphen;gallon drums&mdash;or it is incinerated and the ash is put into drums. A certain amount of intermediate&hyphen;level waste comes from resins, chemical sludges, reactor components, metal fuel claddings and so on. This is also solidified and needs some shielding in concrete or bitumen.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1355">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Australia needs is a national repository for this relatively harmless waste. Previous governments, including the present opposition when it was in government, recognised this and a search was conducted throughout Australia for a low-populated, arid and seismically stable area. In the early 1990s, eight such sites were identified. One of those sites falls partly in western New South Wales&mdash;the Olary area. It is an area of about 48,000 square kilometres, taking in Broken Hill on its south&hyphen;eastern boundary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting to see the reaction to that when these announcements were first made. I have a newspaper article from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Barrier Daily Truth</EMPHASIS>&mdash;the union controlled and owned paper in Broken Hill, in my electorate&mdash;of 17 March 1994.

<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"It is plain that the majority of Australians are opposed to the siting of a repository in their region, not for factual or scientific reasons, but because of lack of knowledge of the true situation caused by the continual sensationalism of media reports and the weak `win votes at any cost' attitude of most politicians who speak out against the siting of a repository in their electorates," he said.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The area of concern to the inhabitants of this city"&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to Mr Best's report to Council, the city is located on the very edge of the region near the southern boundary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The nearest potentially suitable site in the region is about 50 kilometres from the city and most of the sites are more than a hundred kilometres from here," he said.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to mention the sorts of things that would be stored there if that site were selected&mdash;for instance, glassware, metal scraps, industrial gauges, luminous exit signs, watches, electron tubes, smoke detectors and lightly contaminated soil and so on. He drew attention to the fact that such sites have been set up overseas. He said that mainly solid wastes would be transported and disposed of at the national repository.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All that is fairly unremarkable and logical to some extent in itself, but it shows the problem that we have in this country with waste&mdash;whether it be hazardous waste or nuclear waste. Only on 26 April this year, the same paper, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Barrier Daily Truth</EMPHASIS>, ran the same photo from two years ago of the mayor standing near the sign which reads `City of Broken Hill Nuclear Free Zone' and on the same page had one headline which read `Revolt over nuclear dumping' and another which read `Council united against waste'. I was interested to read that the same mayor, Mayor Peter Black, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it was distressing to find yet again Broken Hill has been placed on the short list . . . one of eight sites . . . as a potential nuclear dumping site in Australia by the new Federal Government.</PARA>
<PARA>It was the old federal government that did it, of course. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mayor Black took the view the Commonwealth government was finding itself in the same bind as the old government, that in Sydney there were quite literally acres covered in drums containing low level nuclear waste.</PARA>
<PARA>I rang ANSTO this morning to find out the volume of waste involved. They said it is all housed in one building about 30 metres by 10 metres, and that building contains about 80 to 90 per cent of the waste in Sydney. So it does not take up acres of ground. Mayor Black continues to say in this article:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Truly the governments in Australia have to come to terms with the fact this waste has to be disposed."</PARA>
<PARA>This is quite correct. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Equally truly, it's got to be disposed of in such a way it's not to infringe the rights, indeed the entitlement, of any community in Australia," Mayor Black said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Council has resolved to pursue the matter vigorously, he added.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mayor Black said he hoped Mr Cobb&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is me&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would come out in full support of the position adopted historically by the people of Broken Hill.</PARA>
<PARA>If you look at the history, he was taking a totally different attitude only a couple of years before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raise all this to put into perspective the outrageous scaremongering that seems to inflict all of us from time to time when we talk about waste&mdash;whether it be hazardous waste or nuclear waste&mdash;in this country. We are all guilty&mdash;backbenchers, ministers, mayors of cities and others&mdash;and a lot of the comment is based on ignorance. People cynically misuse people's fear in grubby chases for votes and other sorts of things. I find that distressing indeed, if we are to have any hope of getting some sensible policy in this country. Those recent comments of Mayor Black's in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Barrier Daily Truth</EMPHASIS>, I believe, came out of a statement made by New <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1357"> South Wales acting environmental minister, Bob Debus, when he addressed state parliament. This was published on Anzac Day in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> this year. The article said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government yesterday revealed that Broken Hill had been shortlisted&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>it had only come out two or three years before&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as a potential dump for nuclear waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This would mean that nuclear waste would have to be trucked through a number of undisclosed western Sydney suburbs&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>to get there. He threatened to withdraw the police escort from the thing if this was done. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said weapons&hyphen;grade nuclear waste would be transported from Lucas Heights in Sydney through western Sydney, the Blue Mountains and the cities of Bathurst and Orange&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>on to Dubbo and Broken Hill. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">And he said the plan would turn Broken Hill into a `nuclear wasteland'.</PARA>
<PARA>We would be putting only low&hyphen;level waste on the site we are talking about. If you slept beside a drum of it for a whole year, you would probably get the equivalent of about two, three or four millisieverts, virtually what people get in background radiation anyhow. If we went to Bondi Beach for half an hour and exposed ourselves, we would probably get twice that amount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is talking about weapons&hyphen;grade nuclear waste. We do not have any weapons&hyphen;grade nuclear waste in Australia. It is only enriched to 60 per cent, as I said earlier. For weapons&hyphen;grade, you would need enrichment to at least 80 per cent, if not in excess of 90 per cent. He talks about turning Broken Hill into a nuclear wasteland. Even if we were taking weapons&hyphen;grade waste out there, there is no suggestion from either the previous government or this government that it would be put in Broken Hill itself. It will be hundreds of kilometres away, most likely, even if that site were selected. It is just breathtaking to see the way these things are misstated&mdash;and often deliberately, I believe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He goes on about the Howard government turning Broken Hill into the nuclear waste dumping ground of Australia. The relevant minister had not even made a statement about it at all. It is quite disgraceful and sad that we have these examples around in Australia. I mention all this because I believe that increasingly we are going to get similar sensational statements about hazardous waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A previous state government in New South Wales tried to set up a toxic waste incinerator and find a site so that we could get rid of some hazardous waste in Australia, rather than shipping it off overseas as we are talking about in the bill today. Everybody went so bananas about it that there could be no rational debate in this country about it at all, and all political parties shelved it. I can understand the emotion, but a lot of it was based on total misinformation. If we pass the bill today, it will be a step forward. I know that it arouses emotions, irrationality and difficulties, and these will tend to increase as people become more aware of the toxic and hazardous wastes that exist in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I want to say that we need uniform and properly thought through rules and procedures on how we handle these wastes, both within Australia and overseas. We have to draw on the wisdom of the experts not only within this country but overseas as well. We have to have cooperation between states and between countries. We have to have a greater <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1358"> understanding in the community of what we are talking about. A proper education program&mdash;which has been sadly lacking, I believe&mdash;is a necessary part of this. We have to have greater openness and transparency and less point scoring. We need honesty in our debate and discussion of these issues. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support this legislation. It is quite clear, as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) said, that we need uniform legislation and we need legislation for the safe storage of waste material. The alternative, of course, is unsafe storage. I get mightily confused by those people who protest at every attempt to seek safe storage for this material but who are quite happy to leave it lying scattered around our cities. It is a nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the previous speaker said, there is a close correlation between hazardous waste and nuclear waste. Nuclear waste is an area in which I do have some expertise. In 1974, the policy of the Australian Labor Party was to mine, process and reprocess uranium. I was one of the people instrumental in changing that policy, and I thought I had achieved a great thing when we completely reversed the policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So enthusiastic was I that I went to France at my own expense to campaign against nuclear energy because I rightly divined that Australia is really irrelevant in the world scheme of things and that we had to stop it in France. I spent many months travelling across France, standing up in picture theatres and heckling the French on the evils of nuclear energy, and standing in supermarkets doing surveys, assisted by my wife, who did the French speaking. I also visited establishments and talked to people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It took me some months to realise that what I was saying was absolute nonsense. So I changed my mind. I have made it a policy in life that, when I am wrong, I change my mind. I have found that that policy has generally stood me in good stead. So I came back to Australia convinced that we had made a mistake, and I have been trying to rectify it ever since.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It appals me that I hear today, some 20 years later, people regurgitating the arguments I used to put&mdash;and, I think, generally not putting them as well. They are exactly the same arguments, which have no substance. In my electorate I have the Monte Bellos, where there was significant nuclear testing in the 1950s. It is a great part of Australia. The fishing there is like none you have ever seen before, and now it looks like being a very important oil province. It is interesting that a large part of Sydney's Chinese cafe trade fish comes from the Monte Bellos, and no&hyphen;one seems to be suffering ill effects from it whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might add something from my own experience. When I was campaigning&mdash;I think it was in the election we had in the mid&hyphen;1980s&mdash;there was talk about storing waste at a place just out of Southern Cross called Koolyanobbing. It was an iron ore mine that had ceased operation on economic grounds. They were talking about putting in a destruction plant there, principally for the destruction of PCBs. I arrived at Southern Cross and was met by one of the local state members. I said, `Give me a bit of advice.' He said, `Oppose this installation.' I said to him, `But I do not oppose it. I actually support it.' `It does not matter,' he said, `oppose it. The election will be over in a couple of weeks.' I said, `I cannot do that. I am going to support it.' I guess I was buoyed in my integrity by the fact that I knew I could survive without any votes in Southern Cross. But I went out there and said that I thought the material could be stored safely and this was what we should do, and my vote in Southern Cross, in fact, went up. So I believe that people are amenable to reasoned arguments. Unfortunately, they tend not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1359"> to get them&mdash;as the previous speaker, the member for Parkes, said&mdash;from people in responsible positions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You see this all the time. I was sitting in my office, listening to the previous debate on Aboriginal education. I must say that I do not think I have heard so much hyperbole, cant and nonsense&mdash;some of it well meaning&mdash;from speakers on either side. You have seen the reaction of John Howard, the leader&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CF4">Mr CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. You have seen the reaction of the Prime Minister of the Howard centralist government to gun law. He is raising fear in the community, putting forward things that are totally unworkable. He does not care about the end result. All he wants to do is project himself as dynamic Johnny so that he can be up there for his double dissolution, which he is expecting next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a totally different reaction from the measured response of John Major in England&mdash;a man under enormous pressure, who clearly does need to raise his profile. What did they do in Britain? They sent the gun issue off to a committee, under a peer of the realm, to be discussed in all aspects. The result is that the British will know what went wrong at Dunblane. They will know why it did, whether it could have been predicted, all the ins and outs. In Australia we will not because we have taken our action&mdash;we are just going to ban guns, which will have no effect whatsoever on the outcome. Of course it will not, because what happened in Hobart was a mental health problem, not a gun problem. I am digressing there, and I thank the chair for his tolerance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me get back to waste storage. I have in my electorate one of those areas designated as a suitable site for waste storage&mdash;Mount Walter. It is 70 kilometres west of Coolgardie. I remember that a few elections ago an anti&hyphen;waste dump party ran in Coolgardie against the state member, on the basis that they did not want the stuff in their backyard, some 70 kilometres away. They do have large backyards out there! The result of it was that the state member, Julian Grill, increased his majority. So, I think, if you take the trouble to explain to people the hard facts&mdash;the truth&mdash;you can convince them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mount Walter would be a suitable site for fairly toxic waste and certainly for medium&hyphen;level radioactive material. In fact, a French company, Rhone&hyphen;Poulenc, is mining around the Pinjarra area and it is seeking to downstream&hyphen;process, to extract from this material the rare earths, which have a clear value and a much greater value than simply in exporting the raw material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the company first started, the argument coming from the Green movement was that we could not trust the French to ship the stuff overseas because it contained the radioactive element thorium, which of course is included in every bit of granite. I can tell new members of parliament that this new Parliament House is certainly many times more radioactive than the Old Parliament House. The background radiation here would be considerably higher than you would get in lots of parts of Australia, owing to the enormous amount of granite here and the enormous concrete platform on which this place floats&mdash;because we have built it on a geological flaw. But do not worry: the radiation is still well within any safe limits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The company was told that, because it was French, it could not be trusted to export the stuff, because the wicked French would extract the thorium and maybe make bombs. The French company said, `Yes, we understand that. What we will do is process it here.' The argument then became, `You must now make the wicked French take their radioactive waste with them. They can export the rare earths, but they must take the radioactive waste with them.' It was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1360"> never an argument about the environment; it was always an argument about stopping any economic development or progress. I think there is always a lot of confusion in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyhow, I accept radioactive waste in my electorate. It is, I guess, medium&hyphen;level waste. It would be mainly gamma&hyphen;radiating and, if it is stored as proposed&mdash;in plastic containers six feet below the ground&mdash;we return, of course, to background levels of radiation. Mount Walter is ideally suited. Firstly, it has a low rainfall; secondly, it has internal drainage; thirdly, if there is any underground water at all, it is hyper&hyphen;saline and there is not much of it; and, fourthly, it is geologically very stable. I have made it clear that I would be prepared to store high&hyphen;level waste in my electorate, and this is a position I have always made clear to my constituents. Since they have always returned me, it would seem there is some measure of agreement there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the goldfields generally are booming. This is an area of dynamic growth in Australia. The same cannot be said for Broken Hill, and it may well be that this is an industry that Broken Hill needs, if it is going to continue to exist at all. Unless there are more ore bodies found at Broken Hill, it is inevitably going to become another ghost town or one depending increasingly, as it appears to be, on tourism. I left Broken Hill in 1959. I left just ahead of the police. I had not been back for many years but I was disappointed, when I went back, to see that it had become very much a tourist place, and not the working town that I knew it as.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Geologically stable areas are ideal places, if you have them, for the disposal of high&hyphen;level waste using the synroc technology. The Australian synroc technology is 1,000 times safer than the borosilicate glass technology favoured by the French. That is not to say that the French borosilicate glass is not safe; it is. I am convinced it is perfectly safe. It is just that synroc is much safer, although it is slightly more expensive, and it is something that I believe should have been pursued with vigour. Had the Australian Labor Party had the policy it had in 1956, there could have been be a future for it, because mining, processing and waste reprocessing could have led to the establishment of a big industry in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the requirements that make us a very good country to look after waste. Firstly, we have stable government and a trustworthy system. Secondly, we have the best geology in the world for the safe storage of this material. Thirdly, we have the best distribution of people, as we have areas of very low population. I am sure that there is a multi&hyphen;billion dollar industry that Australia could run very well, and Australia could play a very important part in providing this service to the world. That is far better, in my view, than to not know what people are doing with their intractable waste, and I think there is a lot of fear raised in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you visit these nuclear power plants in Britain and France, one of the things that you notice, particularly in the cold winters, is ponds with a bit of steam rising from them. That is where the French store their very high&hyphen;level waste. They store it there for 40 years to cool it down. It is hot because of the high rate of atomic decay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed that there were always plenty of seagulls floating around on the top because the water was warm. I was assured that the seagulls were at no risk because water, of course, is a barrier, being a dense material. In fact, distance is a barrier to radiation and that is the defence mechanism we use against the sun. The denser the medium, the less distance required. There was no threat to the birds and they were obviously enjoying it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) talked about Australia's responsibility and how we must act in terms of the environment. It was all good emotional stuff, with little basis in fact, but very good for grabbing the heartstrings. You have seen the situation in New South Wales, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1361"> where a totally irresponsible premier stopped a mine at West Wyalong&mdash;also in the electorate of the member for Parkes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had a look at this mine and it is a very ordinary engineering enterprise. There is nothing difficult about it and it is very straightforward. There is absolutely no doubt that if it had any effect at all environmentally, it would be marginally a plus because it would marginally reduce the rising ground water which, of course, is the big environmental problem there. It would also create a lot of employment and a lot of wealth for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a lot of emotion about Parkes where some birds had been killed on the tailings dam. This can actually happen if cyanide levels are not properly controlled&mdash;and the birds died. What affects populations of birds and, in fact, the population of any animal, including the human animal, is the availability of food. If 10 per cent of the bird population had died&mdash;it was nothing like that figure&mdash;that population would certainly recover in a couple of years. I think that really, we have to keep these things in perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was talking to a fellow who was the third generation of a family that pioneered the Kellerberrin area, and he was adamant that the pink and grey galah, the Kakadu rosy colour, is not a native of that area. You see it absolutely everywhere, but he is adamant that it was not there until the wheat farmers came. It obviously followed the wheat farmers because there was an exponential increase in food.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that I find a little concerning when these people are so concerned about the environment is that we have increased the food potential for these birds exponentially&mdash;for all the cockatoo family, basically&mdash;but we have decreased the habitat so they tend to overcrowd existing trees. Their method of survival is to ringbark around their holes to protect themselves from goannas and, because they are nesting there in such numbers on the few remaining trees, they are tending to ringbark those trees, and the trees are dying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet, if you were to say, `Let us commercialise these birds. Let us sell them to reduce their numbers,' you would meet with instant white&hyphen;hot anger from a lot of these people who profess to have real concern for the environment. I guess that that is very much the nature of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we do need here is good education. It appals me. I received a letter from grade 5 at a certain school where every student in the class had written to me, begging me, as their member of parliament, to do something about greenhouse gases which were enlarging the hole in the ozone layer. This obviously came from the teacher. I wrote back to every kid individually and said, `If you ask your teacher, she will tell you that this is wrong and that you do not know what you are talking about. The greenhouse gases have no effect on the ozone layer.' I hope that by this mechanism we are able to educate the teacher. I am concerned about the misinformation that is made available through our education system, and which often appears to be supported by governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is, at the end of the day, no real alternative to having scientific and rational discussion on these matters. I am all for that. There should be much more of it. As I have said, if I am shown to be wrong, I will be very happy to change my mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is a commonsense bill. In my view, it does not do a lot to look at the economic advantages that can be achieved by these measures. But I do want to say just one thing: the hyperbole we have been faced with from the `Paul Howard' centralist government about selling Telecom to fund the environment is an intellectual disgrace. If you want to do something about the Murray Valley&mdash;and we certainly need to do something about the Murray Valley&mdash;it really does have to have an economic base. There is certainly no doubt in my mind that the mass <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1362"> planting of Eucalyptus camaldulensis has the capacity to lower the rising ground water level. It will be effective only if there is an economic base for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we should be doing is seeking to establish a timber or a paper industry based on those trees. It is young trees that suck up water. If we can keep turning those trees over, we can keep pressure on reducing that rising ground water, which is the main basis of the problem with the Murray Valley. But, of course, giving an economic basis to it is often seen by the environmental movement as tawdry, and it will, therefore, most likely be opposed.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1996 is to bring the existing legislation governing the trade in hazardous wastes into line with our international obligations under the Basel convention and with the practices of our trading partners. The issue of the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes raises significant moral questions, which the Basel convention attempts to address. Developed countries should not be profiting from the practice of dumping their hazardous wastes on developing countries, as those countries have a reduced capacity to deal with the wastes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the economic and social advancement of many developing countries must, indeed, receive the greatest possible assistance from Australia, we have a responsibility to provide that assistance in a manner which does not compromise the ecological integrity of those countries or the health of their people. In fact, many of the world's developing countries are paying a very high ecological price for their economic advancement; and their consequential social advancement is, therefore, significantly compromised. They also pay a very high price through the exploitation of workers whose health and, indeed, whose lives are put at risk for rewards that are often negligible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1989, when the initial bill was enacted, Australia has found ways to circumvent its obligations under the spirit of the convention. We have transported hazardous waste on the basis that we are exporting materials for recycling. Australia is not currently required to notify the country of destination or obtain its consent under existing legislation. Nor is there any effective requirement on the exporter to ensure that the materials will be dealt with in an environmentally responsible manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the materials we are exporting is lead battery waste to the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia. I will use this as an example of the shortcomings in the present act. There is considerable anecdotal and scientific evidence of lead contamination around lead acid battery recycling factories in Indonesia. I would like to quote from a recent Greenpeace report about the effects of a local lead processing plant on the surrounding community. The report, dated March 1994, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clouds of smoke from the factory have been descending on the community since (the company) began operation. Waste water from the plant is discharged into local waterways, which are used by villagers to irrigate their rice fields. Local residents complain that ashes from the factory often fall in their wells <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1363"> and on their food, and that the effluent from the factory is draining into the local irrigation system. Many villagers complain of being sick, that everybody has a cough, and half of them cough blood.</PARA>
<PARA>Tests performed by the Indonesian government on a sample of workers in the industry found that they had blood lead levels in the range of 40 to 80 micrograms per decilitre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable members will remember the outcry in the Australian community in 1993 over blood lead levels and their health consequences. The National Health and Medical Research Council revealed that new research indicated that previously accepted blood lead levels of 25 micrograms per decilitre had been too high and that an alarm should be raised when blood lead levels reached 10 micrograms per decilitre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian community was angry in 1993 when it was realised that we had a problem with lead levels in our own children. Yet Australian companies are transporting hazardous wastes to countries where the processing of the materials contributes to the poisoning of their environments and their people, some of whom have blood lead levels up to four to eight times higher than the level we find acceptable. It is unconscionable that we should be outraged at the lead levels in our own children, but continue with practices that contribute to the lead poisoning of children in Indonesia or any other country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's second reading speech summarised the major features of the bill. But one of the most important features is that it will require exporters of hazardous wastes to ensure that the waste materials will be managed in an environmentally sound manner which protects human health and the environment before exportation is permitted. This is a significant advance to ensure that Australia meets its obligations under the Basel convention and I commend the bill to the committee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1996 is an important bill in that its main objective is to improve the regulatory regime relating to the transportation of hazardous wastes. It is a bill that the opposition does not oppose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I reflect on the consumer society that we live in and ponder the enormous wastes that are generated by our modern industrial processes, I am reminded of a brief poem that I once read in a provincial newspaper. This poem was written to the `Letters to the Editor' column by a writer who was lamenting the environmental damage caused to a hill formation where red scoria had been mined for public and private road construction. It was a very simple poem that went like this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They've mined the hills for our highway construction</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our roads have been built on nature's destruction</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the councillors voted they were all well intentioned</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But a scar ridden landscape&mdash;well nobody mentioned!</PARA>
<PARA>It is a simple poem but, in its simplicity, it encapsulates the position that Western economies are in today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are all well&hyphen;intentioned in our consumption patterns. We believe it is our birthright to enjoy the high material standards of living we have here in Australia and in other Western <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1364"> countries. But nobody really wants to think too much about the consumption of non&hyphen;renewable resources or to talk too much about the pollution of our precious environment or the generation of hazardous waste materials.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a sad reflection on our modern industrial society that we are only now coming to grips internationally with the problems associated with our own economic development. Western countries have a long and regrettable history of exploitation in less developed economies. Today, Western multinational companies are engaged in a range of exploitative practices relating to labour and the environment in underdeveloped economies, and&mdash;as has been mentioned in this debate today&mdash;the trade in chemical waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular bill will give tighter domestic effect to international conventions which have been negotiated by Western countries to this point in relation to the transportation of hazardous wastes. One of the more objectionable practices in recent times by Western companies has been the virtual dumping of chemical waste products in countries which do not have the appropriate infrastructure to store or handle poisonous wastes. I am very pleased that the amendments in this bill do provide for greater transparency in the process whereby ministers make determinations as to whether hazardous waste may be exported to another country for final disposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This debate is in a sense a timely one, as there is a very important community debate occurring in my electorate at this time, relating to a decision by the Victorian government to relocate the Coode Island chemicals complex to Point Lillias. As members may recall, in August 1991 a disastrous fire occurred at the Coode Island chemical storage facility, which prompted the then Victorian government to undertake an extensive review of alternative sites in Victoria for the construction of a facility to replace the Coode Island chemical waste facility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Coode Island review panel nominated several sites as being the most appropriate ones for the transfer of the Coode Island facility, and one of those sites was West Point Wilson which was eventually determined to be the site of the east coast armaments complex to be relocated from New South Wales to Victoria. Interestingly enough, when the Coode Island review panel examined these issues, the site at Point Lillias was not one of the sites recommended in that review; yet the Kennett government has determined that the Coode Island facility will be relocated to Point Lillias.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That decision has certainly excited a great degree of local opposition. The Coode Island complex has had some improvements done to it after the fire, and it is now regarded as being safe. Many people in my community in Geelong are asking why, if it is so safe, the facility cannot be turned into a state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art facility where it is&mdash;located close to chemical industries in Victoria&mdash;and not moved to the Geelong area, where there are significant environmental, heritage, economic and transport concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to briefly go through some of those concerns. As far as the environment is concerned, the area around Point Lillias is a significant wetland area with saltpans and salt marshes. It is one of the remaining underdeveloped areas of Port Phillip Bay. As far as Corio Bay is concerned, it is a shallow bay and it has sluggish tidal movements that would worsen the effects of any unintentional spills from a complex at Point Lillias.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wetland areas around Corio Bay and the Point Lillias area have international conservation status and are an important habitat for migratory wading birds, such as the double&hyphen;banded plover. The area is protected under the Ramsar agreement, which is an <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1365"> international convention with between 80 and 90 signatory nations. Of particular concern to the environmentalists is the threat to the orange&hyphen;bellied parrot, which one of the rarest birds in the world with only 200 of them remaining in existence. The community is also concerned that the dredging and shoreline filling works will cause significant environmental damage. Keep in mind that the original Coode Island review panel did not even rate Point Lillias as one of the five major recommended sites for the relocation of the Coode Island complex.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are significant transport concerns with the Point Lillias site. The chemicals that are to be stored there would have to be transported from Melbourne and this would mean significant truck movements, estimated to be in the order of 100 to 200 a day, along the Princes Highway. That particular highway is estimated, at the turn of the century, to be a pretty clogged highway&mdash;if I can put it in those terms&mdash;and the additional truck movements on it will not only cause congestion problems but also pose a significant environmental threat in their own right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the heritage concerns, they have been articulated by the Aboriginal community. There are significant Aboriginal sites in the Point Lillias area. Community groups are really angered by the state government's lack of consultation or interest in local concerns of Aboriginal and other groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an economic sense, the Point Lillias project is not a desirable development because it is located some three to four kilometres from Avalon airport, which is currently up for sale. There are some very interesting developments being proposed for Avalon airport that involve the creation of a clean&hyphen;green production zone in the environs of the airport and the establishment of a dedicated airfreight facility there for the export of perishable foods directly into Asian markets. That particular concept involves the development of the Avalon area as a clean&hyphen;green production zone for perishable foods and flowers. The big marketing angle for that development will be the clean&hyphen;green image of the foods that are produced and exported through Avalon. The Point Lillias chemicals complex some five kilometres from the runway may stifle the potential economic benefits that could accrue to the region and, indeed, to Australia from the development of the Avalon complex.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that here we have a contrast in the styles of the Commonwealth and state governments when it comes to these very significant matters. As far as the Commonwealth relocation of the Newington armaments depot to the Point Wilson site is concerned, we have seen an exhaustive process of consultation with the local community and evaluation of the appropriateness of that site. This contrasts with the Victorian government which has just plucked Point Lillias out of the air in ignorance of the recommendations of the Coode Island review panel that listed five potential sites and did not even rate Point Lillias on that list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a real environmental evaluation by the Commonwealth of the effects of its proposal. That extensive consultation has taken place with environmental groups, the local community and other interested parties, and what has emerged in the Commonwealth's proposal to relocate the Newington armaments depot to Point Wilson is a project which has won the acceptance of environmental and community groups in the Geelong region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the Victorian state level, we have seen a farcical environmental effect statement. Basically, the gun has been held to the head of the community. This particular environmental effects evaluation process, which the Victorian government has been engaged in and which ended last Friday, can only be termed a farce. The decision has already been made, and the environmental effects evaluation panel is just really going through the motions.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1366">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really want to conclude on the point that we have here in the Point Lillias relocation proposal and in the ECAC proposal a real contrast in the way governments ought to go about community consultations on these very sensitive propositions. I think that this is a very important bill that is before the House today and I am pleased that it is winning bipartisan support from both sides of the parliament. It is a bill which is long overdue to ensure that we have in place domestic mechanisms that conform with international conventions relating to the transportation of hazardous wastes.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Often people would have invited me to contain my verbiage, so I am at least pleased that the word `eloquence' was used. I am a bit concerned that you were placed in that position so early in the session about the conduct of the Main Committee. It is a bit difficult for me, as a third person, to make comment on what has actually happened, but I understand that there was not strict agreement about that course of action. In fact, it was only coincidental that I came up here to listen so that I could more properly play my part in the debate and I sensed that perhaps the debate was carrying on. I then went back to my room and it was when I was in my room that you by your comments confirmed that the debate was to go on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I just take this opportunity to place on record that I and, I believe, other members&mdash;especially of the opposition&mdash;who have placed their names on the speakers list have done so with a genuine desire to enter into the debate on the legislation, and that, if we are to see this Main Committee operate properly, I hope that we will see continuing cooperation about the hours of sitting and like decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, because I don't know in the tactical sense what my next move could appropriately be, despite suggestions that I should not be speaking at this stage, I will proceed to enter into the debate. Mr Deputy Speaker, my comments were not reflective on you or a direct criticism. I know directly by personal experience that when you are sitting there sometimes you are not aware of what is going on. That is proper, because you are here to make sure that standing orders are upheld. There are other agreements that are made about the conduct of the Main Committee and in the last parliament it was as a result of those agreements that the Main Committee was able to be so successful. I am not sure whether there was any reason why this bill had to be completed today or whether it could have been held over to next week's sittings of the Main Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now talk about the bill, the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1996. The Basel Convention on Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal was adopted on 22 March 1989. Australia acceded to it on 5 February 1992. This bill aims to end some discrepancies which have emerged during the operation of the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act, an act designed to give effect to the Basel convention in Australian law. One such discrepancy is the definition of what constitutes hazardous waste. These amendments will ensure that the definitions used <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1367"> in Australian law meet those that the convention intended and that Australia is no longer out of line with international opinion on this subject.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the problems of the previous definition of hazardous waste was that it was confined to material deemed to be worthless. This definition excluded wastes exported for recycling or for recovery. Because Australia does not require approval for these types of exports, follow&hyphen;up inquiries are not undertaken about whether the waste is to be treated in an environmentally appropriate way in the destination and transit countries. This is in clear breach of the Basel convention. The convention specifically calls on signatory countries to prohibit exports when they are not going to be treated in an environmentally sound manner once they have left the exporting country. Amending the definition of hazardous waste to include recycling exports will make certain that these are subjected to the same level of scrutiny. Even if Australia's environmental legislation and monitoring programs were the best in the world, Australia would always, to a large extent, be dependent on the environmental actions of other nations. That is why it is in our best interests to see that international standards are adhered to in other countries as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a global context, there does not seem to be much point to handling hazardous waste in an environmentally sensitive manner if the waste is then exported to a country where it leads to untold damage to the environment. Technical terminology is an important issue in the operation of any convention. It is especially important that definitions and standards are uniform so that the intent of the convention is not undermined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously the government acknowledges and accepts the importance of uniform definitions and standards enough to put this amendment bill up. I take this to mean that the government accepts that there is a role for the Commonwealth when it comes to establishing standards and definitions and, indeed, measuring outcomes against these criteria. With talk of handing powers back to the states on a whole host of issues, including the environment, sadly the government does not appear very committed to this concept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time as the House debates a bill about world standards of the disposal of hazardous waste, talk continues about the Commonwealth devolving environmental responsibility to the states. Abolishing organisations like the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency, which has a vital role to play in monitoring standards across the nation, will only make achieving uniform standards that much more difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An argument is put that, so long as you have a national standard, it is really irrelevant whether the Commonwealth or the states do the monitoring and policing of that standard. This argument contends that, as long as a national standard is in place, the state environmental protection agencies can be responsible for the monitoring and the Commonwealth agency can be abolished. However, the experience in Victoria would suggest that there is a definite need for increased, rather than decreased, involvement of the Commonwealth in these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I might need some guidance here. It would probably suit me if there was a mechanism where I could move the adjournment of the debate and seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should also point out that while the standing orders provide for the Deputy Speaker to fix the time of meeting, and although the convention is that we meet from 10 a.m. till 1 p.m., there is no fixed time of ending. The convention is one o'clock. Once we start, the proceedings may continue, and will continue, until there are no other speakers or there is no quorum. So the one obvious option for both sides of the House is to withdraw a quorum at any time they want to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not advising that you do that, but I thought I should, in fairness, tell the committee that those are the options open to you. The present situation is that you have the call&mdash;the honourable member for Scullin&mdash;and leave has not been granted for you to move the adjournment.</PARA></INTERJECT>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HH4">Mr JENKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will bat on. I accept what you have said. I should indicate that the reason I was nearly caught short on even getting the call was that I was trying to seek advice about what I could do under the standing orders to adjourn the debate and protect my right to be involved in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my real problems is that I believe the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) who is to follow me was led to believe that because the debate was to be adjourned he would be able to speak on this matter in the Main Committee next week. As the honourable member for Reid and I have a friendly rivalry about the numbers of speeches that we are able to make, he would understand that my trying to make sure that he got to speak is against the rules of that contest. Having said that, I will bat on. I just might add that it is a bit difficult even to use the quorum option as I would be the member of the opposition who would make the quorum if I stayed here on my feet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was talking about the acts of the Victorian EPA. For example, about two years ago, a study of Melbourne's sewerage system was completed by the sewerage review project team of the environment group, Environment Victoria. It found that very little is actually known about the content of the hazardous waste that is being pumped into Melbourne's sewerage system. This was in part because the monitoring undertaken by the state authority, Melbourne Water, was claimed to be infrequent. Furthermore, the sewage was only tested to quite a limited range of traditional factors, like the pH level, and it neglected more harmful substances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Melbourne Water's licences to pollute are specific on the concentrations allowed to be discharged but there are no indications of total amounts pumped into the sewerage. Environment Victoria claims that it is simply not known how much aluminium, arsenic, cobalt or manganese, among other substances, there are in Melbourne's sewers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point of this example is to illustrate that if the Commonwealth expects to hand back environmental responsibility to the states, it is going to be sorely disappointed by the adequacy of work carried out by these state authorities in monitoring standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that the government can be convinced to accept the value of the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency and national forums for intergovernmental cooperation, like <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1369"> the National Environment Protection Council. These institutions at a Commonwealth level do have an instrumental role to play and should not be sacrificed because of some kind of bizarre, ideological whim on states rights. At a time when the government is attempting to berate the opposition by quite inappropriately and misleadingly linking the sale of one&hyphen;third of Telstra to a commitment to the environment, there are currently some interesting reports appearing in the media.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note with interest and concern that funding for key programs dealing specifically with the area of hazardous wastes is set to run out at the end of the financial year. The programs affected include the national pollutant inventory, which would specifically force industry to give detailed information about types and amounts of hazardous waste that they create. As part of its `all things to all people' strategy before the last election, the coalition promised to maintain the existing environmental programs funded by the previous government. If these very substantial and worthwhile programs are allowed to be wound up because the government will not devote funds to them, that really exposes their true colours on environmental issues. Attempts to create some kind of false link between Telstra and the environment will not give the government any amount of credibility on environmental issues then.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Watson for his contribution. I inform the committee that the chair, through the clerks, did receive advice from the parliamentary liaison officer that it was hoped that that would continue. I raised the question. There were no government members available or wanting to speak beyond one o'clock but opposition members did continue to rise. I agree totally that the whole spirit of this committee is to work in a sense of consensus and cooperation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might just expand on the remarks I made earlier so that everybody is quite clear that, once this committee starts at the nominated time, whether it be at 10 o'clock in the morning or four o'clock in the afternoon, the business of the committee can finish only by one of four means: the lack of a quorum; the House rises; the committee runs out of business; or there is a motion to adjourn.</PARA></INTERJECT>

However, I place on record my delight that, in the atmosphere of the Main Committee, we were able to come to some resolution on this. It is now not a precedent that will cause upset in the way that the Main Committee is conducted. In the spirit of the way that the Main Committee operates, this was resolved in that spirit.</PARA></TALK.START>
