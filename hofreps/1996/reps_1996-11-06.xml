<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to be able to move the introduction of a piece of legislation that will make the law fairer by removing or limiting protection for unjustified discrimination. The bill if enacted will remove or limit exemptions in subsections 40(2) and 40(3) of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Sex Discrimination Act was enacted, exemptions for specified legislation were included to ensure that a person would not be in breach of the act by complying with the requirements of another law. Over the years, the scope of these exemptions has been reduced and the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1996 takes that process one step further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill implements the outcomes of the review required under section 40A of the Sex Discrimination Act. In accordance with that section, on 31 May 1996 I completed a review of the operation of exemptions in subsections 40(2) and 40(3). Although the form of the bill does not exactly follow the drafting style proposed in the recommendations of the review document regarding repeal, the outcomes are the same. These differences have arisen simply as a result of advice from parliamentary counsel. I stress that the outcomes are the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The review document, which was tabled in both houses of parliament on 26 June 1996, contains a useful summary of the history of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> section 40 exemptions. As indicated in that document, the review was carried out in consultation with relevant federal government departments, ministers with responsibility for the legislation currently specified in the exemption provisions and with the government of Norfolk Island. The Sex Discrimination Commissioner assisted with that part of the review dealing with the federal social security legislation and was also consulted in relation to exemptions by reference to taxation legislation. I will return to the social security aspect of the review later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, subsection 40(2) of the Sex Discrimination Act currently provides an exemption for anything done by a person in direct compliance with specified legislation in force as at 1 August 1984. These exemptions will be described in the context of the changes to be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Taxation legislation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Paragraphs (a), (c), (d), (f) and (i) of subsection 40(2) of the Sex Discrimination Act provide for exemption by reference to the Gift Duty Assessment Act 1941, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the International Tax Agreements Act 1953, the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935 and the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Act 1982 respectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exemption currently applies to all grounds of discrimination covered by the Sex Discrimination Act&mdash;that is, sex, marital status, pregnancy and potential pregnancy. After consulting with the Treasurer (Mr Costello), it has been agreed that the exemption by reference to the taxation legislation referred to will be amended so that it is limited to an exemption for marital status discrimination only.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reasons for retaining an exemption for marital status discrimination are set out in the review document tabled in June 1996. They include factors such as the unfairness of exposing people to the retrospective operation of legislation and the need to adhere to provisions which give effect to international agreements. In other circumstances, it has been agreed that it would be inappropriate for taxation policy designed to protect the public interest to be overridden by the objectives of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Sex Discrimination Act. Thus, certain anti-avoidance provisions designed to protect the revenue will continue to be protected by the exemption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsection 40(3) currently provides an exemption by reference to section 6 of the Sex Discrimination Act&mdash;which deals with marital status discrimination&mdash;for anything done by a person in direct compliance with any regulations, rules, by-laws, determinations or directions made under the Gift Duty Assessment Act 1941, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 or the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935. Again, after consultation with the Treasurer, it has been agreed that the exemption by reference to the Gift Duty Assessment Act 1941 is no longer required. The reference to that act will therefore be deleted from the subsection.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Social Services Act 1980 of Norfolk Island</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Paragraph (j) of subsection 40(2) of the Sex Discrimination Act currently provides an exemption for the Norfolk Island social security legislation. This exemption covers all grounds of discrimination covered by the Sex Discrimination Act 1984&mdash;sex, marital status, pregnancy and potential pregnancy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After consultations with the Norfolk Island government, it has been agreed that there is no need for such a wide exemption. The Norfolk Island legislation discriminates on the ground of sex in that it provides for differential access to age pensions for men and women. The government of Norfolk Island has sought a continuation of an exemption for this discrimination but will give consideration to phasing in a common age for eligibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Additionally, the Norfolk Island government has sought to narrow the existing exemption so that it covers marital status discrimination only, arising in the context of the rate of benefit payable. The government of Norfolk Island has identified potential discrimination on this ground in the application of different income thresholds and the fact that a person's marital status will affect the amount of benefit paid.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">National Health Act 1953</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Paragraph (b) of subsection 40(2) provides an exemption by reference to the operation of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6608"> the definition of `pensioner' in subsection (4)(1) of the National Health Act and by reference to the operation of the definition of `concessional beneficiary' in subsection 84(1) of that act. The definitions affect the administration of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Because they mirror the provisions that apply different pension ages for pension eligibility for women and men under the social security regime, it is ensured that women and men who are eligible for pensions are also eligible to receive pharmaceutical benefits at concessional rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, because differential access to age pensions based on sex is being phased out, the bill amends the existing exemption by providing for it to expire concurrently with implementation of the phasing out of differential access to age pensions&mdash;that is, the exemption will have no effect on or after 1 January 2014.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Papua New Guinea (Members of the Forces Benefits) Act 1957</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill proposes repeal of the existing exemption by reference to the Papua New Guinea (Members of the Forces Benefits) Act 1957 as the exemption is no longer considered necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to consideration of paragraph (h) of subsection 40(2), which provides an exemption by reference to the Social Security Act 1947. As indicated in the review document, this aspect of the review raised complex and difficult legal issues concerning the validity or operation of this paragraph. On one view, the paragraph is redundant because the 1947 act was repealed and replaced by the Social Security Act 1991 prior to the coming into force of paragraph (h) of subsection 40(2). On this view, repeal of the paragraph would have no substantive effect. However, there is an alternative view, which is that the paragraph operates to provide an exemption, albeit of a limited nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the ambiguity surrounding the operation and effect of paragraph (h) of subsection 40(2), the steering committee, established by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to assist with the social security aspect of the review, examined the provision of social security against the benchmark of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> legislation and practices which may constitute `in principle discrimination'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill proposes no action in relation to paragraph (h). However, as indicated in the review document, I will, in conjunction with the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman), make recommendations for appropriate action regarding this paragraph when we report back to parliament in June 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the matters identified by the steering committee as potentially problematic were referred to the Minister for Social Security for consideration. I reiterate that it was clearly stated in the review document that we will jointly report back to parliament in relation to both the `in principle discrimination' identified by the steering committee and in relation to paragraph (h) of subsection 40(2) of the Sex Discrimination Act. That joint report will be made no later than 26 June 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The financial impact of the bill is negligible. This bill reflects the government's commitment to equal opportunity and the prevention of discrimination. It is also consistent with and an indication of our policy that exemptions in the Sex Discrimination Act should be limited and that where possible all federal legislation should be consistent with the objectives of the Sex Discrimination Act. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Dobell from moving a motion to refer the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 to the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs for consideration and an advisory report to the House as soon as possible. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6609"> </PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And the support of the honourable member for Chifley. We are seeking, in this particular motion, to allow all members of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs and all members of the House of Representatives an opportunity to consider this matter in detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) will tell us that a Senate committee is also going to look at this particular matter tomorrow for a few hours&mdash;if it is lucky, if it has time, to consider this bill and a couple of others. It is quite clear that the matters and the issues raised in this bill are very complex. The difficulty that we in this House face is that the few hours at the most that the Senate committee will spend considering the bill tomorrow is woefully inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I learnt yesterday that, for whatever reason, Senator Knowles, the chair of the committee, convened a meeting of that committee last Monday morning with very little notice being given to some of the opposition members of that committee. A decision was taken at that meeting not to allow people such as Tony Lawler, the interns' representative on the AMA Federal Council, to appear and give evidence at that committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That does not place a great deal of credit on the government. If they were seeking to claim that they have won this debate on the force of their argument&mdash;and given that the minister, in some cases, has been quite generous with his time in speaking and listening to the views of the medical students and interns&mdash;I find it hard to understand why the minister has personally not been prepared to speak to Senator Knowles. If he has, maybe he could tell us what he has said to Senator Knowles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would certainly be interested to know whether the minister is now prepared to give the House an assurance that he will seek to ensure that all those who are stakeholders in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this issue&mdash;in particular, all those who have worked hard to try to ensure that the interests of medical students and interns are protected&mdash;have the chance to be heard on Thursday before the Senate committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly think it is an interesting development to listen to the concerns that have been raised by people&mdash;the medical students and the interns. These are the people whom the minister at the table used to represent not too many years ago before his entry into the Australian parliament.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It just feels that long.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It probably feels even longer. I can assure the minister that, having represented those people in days gone by, they feel especially hurt, if not betrayed, that the person who used to represent them is now not prepared to take some action to try to persuade his Liberal colleagues to at least give them a chance to be heard before the Senate committee. I would ask the minister to give some consideration to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In speaking earlier in the second reading debate on this bill, I outlined the opposition's grave concerns about the bill. In particular, we believe that the retrospective nature of the bill makes it very difficult to support. In the second reading debate I referred to comments that had previously been made by the current Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith), who has made it clear that he considers that  retrospective legislation that tries to enact the intentions of government decisions that are announced in ministerial press releases are a contempt of the parliament. In fact, the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) referred to retrospective legislation as a fairly dangerous animal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is therefore quite interesting that within six months of this government being elected, we have this minister introducing legislation which is clearly retrospective. If passed by the Senate later this year or early next year, this legislation will take away the opportunities for people to obtain a Medicare provider number. It takes effect as of last Friday, so it is clearly retrospective. That is the first point&mdash;it is retrospective legislation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6610">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is that we believe that it has quite an unfair impact on the students and the interns who in some cases have dedicated up to seven years to study and training. It will also to some extent neuter the investment of more than $100,000 of taxpayers' money in training those students and interns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also continue to have concerns about the impact it will have on the career options for medical graduates, particularly women medical graduates, who may not wish to proceed immediately to full-time postgraduate training. Current patterns of practice indicate that there is a high percentage of women who do not choose to undertake full-time postgraduate training immediately. Finally, we are very concerned about the impact that this legislation will have on the provision of medical services in rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister for health has continued to assure us that there will be more than enough places for all Australian graduates. I will say a bit more about this later in the consideration in detail stage&mdash;that is, if this particular motion is unsuccessful. The minister has repeatedly said that it is his belief that there will be enough places for all of the Australian graduates. When the interns and the medical students meet the minister and he tells them that that is his belief, they go one step further and ask the minister to give them a guarantee that his belief will actually be a fact. They ask the minister to give them a guarantee that every Australian trained graduate who is up to the right standard and passes all the exams will be able to obtain a Medicare provider number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the minister is unable to give that guarantee, because he does not have enough faith in the figures that he quotes in the House, on radio and on television&mdash;he clearly does not have enough faith in his own figures&mdash;why should the medical students and the interns, whose careers will be decided by this legislation, have sufficient faith in him?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has also claimed that these reforms will encourage more doctors to practise in rural areas. I hope that the minister is right in these claims because, despite our efforts, it seems unlikely that he will be able <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to prevent the passage of this unfair and retrospective bill. But the opposition remains unconvinced of Dr Wooldridge's assurances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion that we are considering at the moment seeks to suspend standing orders so that we can refer this bill to a House of Representatives committee, which clearly the Labor Party does not have a majority on. This is the way that I think this House, and not the Senate, can give proper consideration to this committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the committees of this House were reformed and given an expanded role in 1987 many of us thought that more legislation would be referred to House of Representatives committees. To give some credit to the Senate, certainly in opposition I have been attracted to this enhanced role for House of Representatives committees. In New Zealand, for example&mdash;of course, they only have the one house&mdash;it is pretty standard that all of their legislation goes before a  committee before it goes to the whole house.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue has been a matter of great controversy. It will only affect a small number of Australians. It will not change the lives of millions of Australians. But for this small number of Australians who have dedicated many years of their lives to studying medicine, this will have a very dramatic effect on their futures. We at least owe it to those people and to the people whom Dr Wooldridge used to represent before he was a member of parliament to allow the House of Representatives Family and Community Affairs Committee a chance to consider this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When asking in my motion to suspend standing orders to allow me to refer this legislation to the House of Representatives committee for consideration and advice as soon as possible, I do not mean a quick and nasty Senate legislative committee report where they give people a couple of hours to present their evidence and there is a report back within a few days. If we wanted to do justice to the legitimate issues that the minister is wanting to debate and if he has enough faith in the arguments that he put to the House two days ago, he would be prepared to allow perhaps several weeks for people to give evidence and be able to put <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6611"> their opinions before members of this House and to allow the members of that committee, even though it clearly has a majority of government members on it, to present a report to this chamber to allow us to consider the mechanisms in detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those reasons, we are seeking to suspend standing orders to allow this reference to the House of Representatives committee. We would hope to have the support of not only the Independent members of the chamber but perhaps even one or two members of the government who think that this is an issue that is worthy of deeper consideration.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion. I will not take up much of the time of the House. In seconding the motion moved by the shadow minister for health, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), my understanding is that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) claims that the moves he is taking seek to preserve the long&hyphen;term future of Medicare. I have to say that, whilst we might debate the mechanism, we do not disagree with that aim and objective. So this is a case where both sides of the parliament are committed to such a course of action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister has moved that the legislation be referred to the family and community affairs committee of the parliament. Of course committees, as the shadow minister has mentioned, are only a relatively recent institution in this House. They have always had a legislative responsibility. I have to say that I believe we have not made best use of the role of the committees of the parliament. Indeed, when I recall some of the speeches by now government members in the last parliament, they were very critical of the way in which legislation was rushed through the parliament. I think all parliamentarians ought to stand and support the idea that such an important bit of legislation as the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 should be referred to a committee of the parliament for consideration and report back. It is something that the Senate committees do quite regularly. I would like to see the House committees utilised in this way.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spoken in this House before about opportunities for people to enter professions and to undertake university courses. I say to the minister that one of the pleasing features I note in the western suburbs of Sydney is the increasing number of students enrolling for medicine; probably one of the most difficult faculties to enter. I would ask the minister whether he can advise the House if he thinks it worthwhile for the committee to examine whether or not people from ordinary working&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6612">class backgrounds will be precluded from seeking a career in the medical profession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had many speeches in this parliament about the viciousness of retrospective taxation. With this measure somehow retrospectivity is given a noble cause. Again, we agree with the aims of the minister. We are not convinced of his methodology. If we refer it to the committee, we can see whether or not the bipartisan approach normally adopted by committees can be adopted in this case. The arguments and the reservations can be thoroughly examined and reported back to the House. I certainly support the motion moved by the shadow minister at the table.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on clause 1&mdash;and with a bit of luck I will not get gagged by the Chief Government Whip, the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), who is just departing from the chamber. This government promised to raise parliamentary standards. I am holding my breath waiting for that because all I was trying to do this morning was represent the interests of my state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) would be only too happy to answer my concerns and only too happy to expand on them because I know he has strong views. I wanted to represent the interests of medical students and the interests of the state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the member for Swan (Mr Randall), the member for Canning (Mrs Johnston), the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) and the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), who are not members of the ministry and do not have to follow the edicts of the ministerial line, the cabinet solidarity, on this matter that the Western Australian government has indicated very strong concerns about this particular move because it <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6614"> impacts in an unfair way on Western Australian interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Western Australia has some unique characteristics in relation to medical practitioners, as the minister well knows. All I was endeavouring to do by supporting the motion of the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) was to allow there to be a greater examination of those particular interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the members of the Labor Party take any comfort from what I have done this morning, I point out that this is a response to the Labor Party's administration of our health care system for 13 years. In essence, the coalition went to the election very strongly committed to preserving Medicare and preserving bulk-billing. Clearly they had become popular because people like to go to the doctor and like to not have to pay, and that is understandable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the difficulty is that, at the end of the day, there is a reckoning and part of the reckoning is this process. Unfortunately, in endeavouring to genuinely solve this particular problem&mdash;that is, the oversupply of GPs, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne&mdash;we see a uniform standard being applied to the entire continent. That is the problem. This is where Western Australia's interests, unfortunately, in this particular case are not being properly looked after. That is why I believe that the shadow minister's motion to have the matter referred to a parliamentary committee was a positive move.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can recollect only too well from my experience as a member of the Liberal Party that in the party room the coalition parties when they were in opposition were very keen to have bills referred to House of Representatives committees for review. In some instances decisions are made in not so much a hasty way but in a way that is not necessarily in the best interest of all concerned and not necessarily in the best interests of the administration of policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, unfortunately, there are some aspects of the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 that would unfairly impact on Western Australia. As the minister well knows and as Mr Prince, a WA minister, has already indicated, Australia's oversupply of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> metropolitan doctors is a Sydney and Melbourne problem and WA has got the numbers about right. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have introduced changes meant to fix a problem that does not exist in this state&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the state of Western Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">WA relies on its city&hyphen;based junior doctors to man a highly successful locum support program for country doctors, which has led to doctor vacancies in all rural towns, except Laverton, being filled.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even in the metropolitan area we have problems; in my electorate. My job as the member for Moore is to represent the interests of my constituents first. I am still trying to get a locum service for the areas of Merriwa, Clarkson and Butler, which are metropolitan suburban areas. We cannot get locum services there and I am told by the Western Australian minister, `Go to the doctors and ask them to do it.' I have been to them and I have tried. Unfortunately, the private market for services is not able to fill that particular need and so we have a situation where the problem is going to be compounded by legislation introduced by the coalition. It is going to unfairly impact on the families in my electorate. As their member I am going to represent their interests first ahead of any philosophical view that somehow this is going to solve the problems created by 13 years of incompetent administration of our health care system by the previous Labor government. I know that the minister is sincere; I have seen him at work. I know that he has the best interests at heart but Western Australia's interests in this matter are being overlooked. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a pity he was gagged by the government whip&mdash;it is a very disturbing event to take place in the House at such an early hour&mdash;but I can say to the honourable member that he has obviously raised a very serious issue and that is the concern he has that his constituents do not have access to after&hyphen;hours medical care and hence his support for the locum service. Perhaps both of us could ask the Minister for Health and Family <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6615"> Services (Dr Wooldridge) if he could tell us how this particular piece of legislation will affect the people who provide these services; not just in Western Australia or Perth but right around the country. If there is already a shortage of doctors in some of the outer metropolitan areas, and we all know there is a shortage of doctors in rural areas&mdash;particularly at hospitals&mdash;how will this bill address that?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to pick up one issue that was raised by the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Cadman) in the second reading debate in which he claimed that his local hospitals were mainly staffed by temporary resident doctors. Minister, certainly in the last few weeks you have been claiming that all Australian&hyphen;trained graduates will now be able to obtain a provider number because there will be sufficient training places for someone to either go onto the general practice training program or onto one of the specialist training programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that assurance that you have given the doctors and the figures you have outlined to them&mdash;it is not a guarantee; it is a belief&mdash;are accurate. Let us assume for the moment that your figures are correct. How does that put one extra Australian&hyphen;trained doctor into the hospitals in the electorate of the honourable member for Mallee? That is a very important point because we get people such as the honourable member claiming that because Australian&hyphen;trained doctors will not get Medicare provider numbers there will be few options open to them other than to become a salaried doctor in one of Australia's rural hospitals. I think that is certainly the argument that the honourable member was making and there does seem to be a bit of a contradiction between the claim by the Minister for Health and Family Services that every Australian&hyphen;trained doctor will get a Medicare provider number&mdash;if they are up to the appropriate standard&mdash;and the honourable member's apparent belief that in some way his measure is going to deliver more doctors into rural public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I would be very grateful if the Minister could expand on those two issues. Surely this legislation is going to mean it will be even harder to staff the locum services, not just in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Perth but in other metropolitan areas, and will it not also mean that, if the figures produced by the honourable member for Mallee are correct, there will be no extra Australian&hyphen;trained doctors in rural hospitals.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(10.27 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must express my disappointment in one sense with the comments of the member for Moore (Mr Filing) about 13 years of mismanagement. We have this constant diatribe running that somehow Labor mismanaged health for 13 years and there is a massive disaster, then they massively endorse Medicare. They want it both ways all the time; there is this constant attempt at rhetoric and reality. They are all staunch Medicare supporters but they also say it has been a dreadful 13 years of mismanagement. For God's sake, what an insult to people's intelligence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This whole issue is a fabrication and a distortion. It is a government trying to find ways to project savings when it does not actually do so. This is a Clayton's savings in a sense: the minister says to students, `It will not really affect as many as you think, it is nowhere nearly as bad as you think it is.' On the other hand he tells the financial markets, `This is going to be a massive saving on government expenditure.' He does not say it is going to be a massive cut in the health budget; it will not change, there will be more than enough doctors, the students will all be okay. They are running five different lines for five different audiences. What is really difficult is working out how the savings will occur. How many people are there like the minister with Medicare numbers who do not use them; how many Medicare numbers are out there being used once a week; how many doctors are retired but still have their Medicare numbers? The range of Medicare provider number usage should be available. Medical students and young doctors are entitled to know a lot more than they have been told so far. If the statistics are not available, well, okay, tell them that; tell them you do not know. But to come out with categorical savings and fixed numbers and somehow then extrapolate from that that this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6616"> is going to protect Medicare is patently absurd&mdash;patently absurd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I chaired a parliamentary inquiry last year into access and equity for people from non-English speaking backgrounds. A large part of that inquiry became caught up in the question of recognition of overseas skills, particularly medical skills. Around Australia overseas trained doctors and communities made submissions to us about the complications that existed&mdash;and they were quite difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had one witness who told us that he was here as a temporary resident practising medicine and that he came back regularly. In other words, he repeatedly came over on a short-term visa, went away and returned on another short-term visa. If he stayed here permanently, he could not practise because he would have to go through the whole accreditation process. These TRDs&mdash;temporary registered doctors&mdash;were a fact of life in much of Australia. At the same time, there were a lot of people here with overseas skills and training who could not practise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those things evolved over decades. They were not caused by Medicare; they were not caused by the last government. They have been a feature of our system for a very long time. In that inquiry last year, it become obvious that these things needed to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So dispersed throughout this issue is a whole range of questions. We have the distribution of doctors; adequate career paths; retraining and maintenance of skills for doctors who have been trained and are practising now. We have the question of overseas trained doctors. We have the question of rural and remote areas. There is a whole range of issues, all of which are affected by this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On budget night the government announced this massive change&mdash;massive in the sense that it appears to do something, but it only affects a certain group of people. It does not address anything else at all which hangs off it. It impacts on a whole range of areas but affects very few&mdash;it just affects a group of people. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context the logical thing for the government to do is to have some discussion, to canvass all the issues involved in an attempt to reconcile the contradictions inherent in this legislation with its associated competing attitudes and interests. But most importantly of all, it should be done generally to try to improve the health system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation will not improve the health system. If anything, it will create sufficient angst, discontent and distrust amongst the medical fraternity to undermine the health system. It will not help Medicare. It will not help the hospitals. It will just create greater numbers of angry people in the health system. We know there is enough frustration in there now, with the uncertainty that they are facing. All this legislation does is undermine the health system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government came in with a mandate to support Medicare and improve it. This legislation does not even attempt that. The minister should start to answer some of these questions. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`If you do not reform Medicare, it dies' and `unrestricted access into general practice is a time bomb waiting to destroy Medicare'. They are not my words; they are the words of the former Labor Deputy Prime Minister Brian Howe in April this year. Brian Howe of course was health minister and someone who was very committed to Medicare. Brian Howe is right: if you do not reform Medicare, it dies. And Brian Howe is also right: unrestricted access into general practice is a time bomb waiting to destroy Medicare. In the end, if you have an open-ended fee&hyphen;for&hyphen;service system, as we do&mdash;and we are one of the few countries in the world now that looks like maintaining this system&mdash;and if you have a very large supply of doctors, you have costs that are completely out of control.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's tough on the current crop of medical students, very tough, but it's the only way forward . . . The AMA was told in 1993 that restrictions on Medicare provider numbers were inevitable. I told the AMA this would happen regardless of who governed Australia . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That was Graham Richardson, a former Labor Party health minister as well. You do not have to believe my words; believe the words of two former Labor Party health ministers. Yes, this is a tough piece of legislation. It is one I have given very serious thought to. But if we wish to see our health system survive, it has to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did not speak on the suspension of standing orders. I did not have a prepared speech either, because we did not know it was coming on. But I was happy to accommodate the shadow minister. Let me just refer to some of those points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government does not support a reference to the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, although we did give it serious consideration and I thank the shadow minister for giving me plenty of notice that that was his intention. In the end it would only exacerbate the problem of the start&hyphen;up date. The start&hyphen;up date was last Friday. That does not really disadvantage any existing medical students because they do not graduate anyway until 1 January. November 1 is important as a start&hyphen;up date because of the large number of overseas trained doctors going through the AMC process at the moment. It was announced on budget night and, like much budget legislation, it does take some while to get the legislation through. But, unless we want to find ourselves with another 300 or so overseas trained doctors whom we were not intending to have unrestricted access to Medicare get through, 1 November has to be the start&hyphen;up date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the Senate committee, I can tell the minister quite honestly that I found out about that at about 9 o'clock this morning. Although I believe that my staff knew about it, I was only told this morning. I personally have had no input into what Senator Knowles has done whatsoever. I cannot speak for my staff; I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> really just do not know. I certainly have not asked Senator Knowles to do or not to do anything. I think that would be, quite frankly, improper. I let the other place carry out its affairs as it sees best, although I will try to find out what has happened and who has been asked and who has not been asked. But, as I have said, I was only made aware of that first thing this morning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the interests of the medical students being protected, I was not elected to federal parliament to protect the interests of medical students; I was elected to the federal parliament to protect the interests of the Australian public&mdash;and I will do that first. I am concerned about the genuine anxiety that medical students seem to feel because of this piece of legislation. However, much of that is ill-founded and based on the fact that many of the claims being made by their leaders are simply factually incorrect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, I understand they feel hurt and they feel betrayed. They would feel more hurt and betrayed if we allowed the ridiculous system we have at the moment to continue, whereby 50 per cent of Australia's medical school graduates are coming in again each year as overseas trained doctors. If we let that happen not only would Medicare collapse but also we would have the real prospect of doctors&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister mentioned this would unfairly disadvantage women. Again, that is something I have taken very seriously. It was something that was part of the original announcement on budget night. I don't think this will be the case. These were claims made by me in the vocational registration debate in 1989. It was a concern of mine then. My concerns of 1989 have not been borne out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I look back at the concerns that I had at the time, seven years experience has shown us that they did not come to pass. If you look at the group of other medical practitioners, the non&hyphen;vocationally recognised general practitioners, women are underrepresented in that group, not overrepresented. If anything, we could perhaps run the argument that men have been disadvantaged but certainly women. Before the shadow minister gets too excited about my speech in 1989, I have reread it and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6618"> I am prepared to admit that time has shown my concerns to be unfounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Moore (Mr Filing) talked about the shortage of doctors in his electorate and in Western Australia. Western Australia does not have a shortage of doctors by any objective measure. This is a misconception that most people in Western Australia have. The honourable member for Moore is certainly not alone. It is a misconception that a good number of my Liberal Party colleagues over there have. The facts are that in terms of doctor&hyphen;population ratio Western Australia is just about right. Its rate of graduation of medical students is just about right. Certainly, it is not low.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Western Australia, like many other rural parts of Australia and countries that have vast rural regions to cover around the world, has trouble getting doctors into country areas. I was in Indonesia a couple of weeks ago. One of their major problems is getting doctors into rural areas. They actually force every young doctor to go to the country for two years if they go to a remote area and three years if they go to a rural area, without exception. It is not a problem alone for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have taken this very seriously. I do not wish to do anything that disadvantages rural areas. Western Australia has a particularly good set&hyphen;up with respect to local services. The Western Australia College of Rural Medicine, WACRM, is a model that other places in Australia could follow. We have been able to meet their concerns by allowing WACRM to issue temporary provider numbers. So what is happening currently in Western Australia will continue to exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister asked me about extra doctors in Mallee. It will do a couple of things. First of all, the temporary registered doctors will still be able to come to Australia and this will not harm those areas that rely on temporary registered doctors in any way. What it will do beyond that is make rural hospitals attractive to young doctors in a way they are not attractive at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will mean that if you are a young doctor wanting to go into general practice you can go into Mallee and get a guarantee of a place in the general practice training program after <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a period of time. So the honourable member hopefully will find it easier to get the staffing positions in his hospitals. As part of this, there is an amount of money to improve training in country hospitals. We will be looking at ways we can do that so that these young doctors are not left alone and can substantially benefit from the experience they have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) raised a couple of points. To address them will take more than the minute I have left. He questioned substantially how you make savings. The budget process is such that you have to make your best estimate. As we found out with many Labor government budgets, that did not prove to be precisely correct. But you make your best estimate. That is done by the Department of Finance, not by any individual department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal savings will come from overseas trained doctors. They will come from turning off the tap that Brian Howe himself said was threatening to destroy Medicare. I have not made any categorical statement of savings. What I have said is that we have put some numbers in the budget and that is what the Department of Finance determined. `That this is going to protect Medicare is patently absurd' was the claim of the member for Newcastle&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has let the cat out of the bag. In response to my questions about how the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) can claim that additional Australian trained doctors will be employed in his hospitals, the minister said words to the effect that if Australian trained doctors work in the hospitals in Mallee there is a guarantee that after a period of time they will get a place on the training program. I think that is what the minister said. I hope I have not misquoted him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely, Minister, that means there is a pool of people who are not going to get access to a training place. Therefore, they have to make a choice. They can go to the hospital in the electorate of the honourable member for Mallee, which will please the honourable member for Mallee, and then the students <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6619"> have to wait a period of time before they get a training place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can the minister please explain the contradiction between his often stated belief, certainly in the last few weeks, that every Australian trained medical student and intern will get a training place and his statement a few minutes ago that there will be more doctors in the hospitals in the electorate of the honourable member for Mallee because students will have to wait some period of time and be given accelerated status if they do go to these rural hospitals? That is the first question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point to make is that the minister claims this is the only way to address concerns that he has about the number of doctors affecting the total cost of Medicare. If this parliament is willing to consider draconian, retrospective legislation that limits access to provider numbers, why aren't we prepared to introduce tough legislation that might have upset the deans of the medical schools and the vice&hyphen;chancellors but would have allowed this parliament very clearly to assert that the government should have the right to set the number of students who start medical training in each of the schools at universities right round the country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can tell you, Minister, that that would have been a measure that we would have been prepared to consider because that would have allowed us to try to address the problem at the start of the training system, not after these students had put seven years of their lives into training and studying and not after the taxpayer had spent $100,000. That is the first point I would make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are alternatives to this, and alternatives that do not involve affecting people who are halfway through their careers. If the minister goes back to the argument that everyone will get a training place, can he please explain the contradiction with that statement that the honourable member for Mallee will be a happy man because he is going to get extra doctors sent to the Mallee, or forced to go to the Mallee&mdash;even though I am sure they will be attracted by the beautiful lifestyle and everything else in the electorate of the honourable member for Mallee.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I made clear, he has claimed that more doctors will go to Mallee because they will be keen to get the accelerated status and the guarantee that they end up with a training place, to quote him, after a period of time. Minister, doesn't that prove that your guarantee that every Australian trained doctor will get a training place is in fact incorrect? Haven't you now let the cat out of the bag by saying that every Australian trained doctor will not get a training place when, in fact, they will have to go to rural hospitals to get a chance to get a training place in future years?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) for his responses, although I am still not quite sure about the position. I must say that I am sorry I did not avail myself of the briefing that was offered yesterday. Unfortunately, we were unable to get a commitment this morning. I think there was a bit of a celebration going on last night for the minister's birthday, and I wish to retrospectively wish you a happy birthday for yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am interested in the policy mix because, quite clearly, one of the aspects of restricting a number of Medicare service providers is going to be that that puts the existing GPs into a superior market position in terms of their ability and, obviously, in terms of pressure on service costs.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to dwell on the response the minister made in relation to Western Australia again. I am sorry to appear ignorant, but how is the change going to beneficially affect Western Australia, given that Western Australia's mix is now about right and that the number of graduates is pretty well a reasonable trend in relation to the demand for GP services?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am interested in that because, as the minister acknowledged, the Western Australian country locum service program has been particularly successful. So I think there is some validity in the comments made by the Western Australian government that, in essence, this is going to unfairly impact on Western Australian GP service provision. In particular, I would like the minister to expand on what other alternatives were suggested in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6620"> the budget talks in relation to the problem that has been created after 13 years of Labor administration of our health care system. For instance, you have mentioned Brian Howe on a couple of occasions. Of course, one of Brian Howe's great failures in the previous government was his inability to get a co&hyphen;payment around the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating. I would be interested to know exactly what is likely to be in store for us next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that this is only a temporary measure&mdash;in other words, this has a one-off effect of adjusting the ratio of general practice services available to the community&mdash;what is the next element in the move to create the right mix of GP services to the population? Will it be, for instance, a co&hyphen;payment for GP visits? If not, what is the government going to do in the future? That is why I was interested in having the matter referred to a House of Representatives committee, because I think there would have been an opportunity for the community to see perhaps a little more clearly exactly what is at stake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the coalition made its commitments to the electorate and is endeavouring to be sincere in keeping those commitments&mdash;in other words, the retention of bulk&hyphen;billing and that Medicare will be retained, more or less, in its present format&mdash;but this is a really significant change and it is a change that impacts in different ways in different areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect I would like to touch on is the fact that one of the coalition's much vaunted moves to reform our economy is to introduce more competition, and in particular to reduce the restrictive practices that are presently going on in a number of professional areas. I would be interested to know exactly how this particular move is consistent with overall coalition policy given that, in essence, you are restricting the number of people who can practice in a particular professional area. So, on that note, I will conclude and ask the minister if he would care to respond.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just a couple more questions. I would like the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) to tell us if, in the government's consideration of these savings, and they are attacking the newly graduated <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> doctors, the government also considered the other end of spectrum? Did it look at doctors who perhaps should be retiring? If you are going to pick on one group in the medical field, why not pick on the other end of the spectrum? Are there doctors who are very old who should not be practising? We put tests on people's driving licences. I am not saying that this is what we should do&mdash;it would be just as discriminatory&mdash;but at least people could see there was some attempt to be fair across the spectrum. It is similar with his own provider number, and I think we will start calling him Mr Moonlight. How many doctors are there like him and the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) with provider numbers who distort all the figures?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Seriously, if the only way to do it was to put a cap, if you like, on the number of Medicare provider numbers, which is what they are effectively doing, then why not say so and why not look at all the implications as to where that cap could apply and who it could in fact affect, or why not offer incentives for doctors to retire?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a whole range of choices available in this. If that was the conclusion that was drawn&mdash;and I think it is potentially a flawed conclusion anyhow&mdash;what other option did they consider to maintain that cap and, if you like, to remove any surplus supply? The shadow minister referred to the previous government's attempt with the medical schools, for which we got no support from the now minister and hence our citizens, I suppose. The other one is the possible early retirement of some people in the field who perhaps would do us all a favour by moving out.</PARA></SPEECH>

I hope he will forgive me for being a little cynical about his interests being somewhat disingenuous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all the representations I made to the previous government on this issue, I got very <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6621"> little response. The shadow minister has made reference to an attempt to adjust the level of graduates but, sadly, it did not work. The vice-chancellors said that there were only 20 possible positions that could be declared. That approach did not work and certainly did not deliver in terms of the needs of my electorate, my 24 hospitals and the number of private clinics that all seek support in some way from Australian doctors.</PARA>

Tell that to Brian Howe because Brian Howe seems to think that it will.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of questions have been raised. Is it inconsistent to say that a guaranteed place in the country means, therefore, that not everyone will get places? I have never said everyone will get places in general practice, but it will mean that maybe, as a country, we can fill some of the places in psychiatry, occupational medicine, rehabilitation medicine <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or emergency medicine&mdash;training places that are currently going unfilled. You can walk into a training place in any of those areas tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that would have been incredibly in the national interest. I thought that would have been the sort of thing the opposition would have supported because these are areas that are required in the national interest. These are areas that are not popular or fashionable, yet they are areas with very great community need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I feel no obligation to guarantee everyone who wants to go into general practice should be able to do so, just as I feel no obligation to guarantee everyone who wants to do brain surgery should be able to do so. If you look at the number of training positions, and if you look at the number of doctors graduating, there should be a training spot for everyone. It will not necessarily be in what is their first choice, not necessarily where it is their first choice to go, but that has always been the way in medicine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested to note the comments about medical schools. The member for Newcastle said they tried to do it and got no support from me. For your information, I actually went to the previous minister, the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence)&mdash;and she will confirm this. I said to her, `I think you're making the right decision. I will give you 100 per cent support. I will not criticise you for anything you do with trying to reduce medical school numbers.' That is a free kick in politics that is not often given. I felt so deeply about it 12 months ago I was prepared to do that for the then Labor government. So before you say, `We got no support,' perhaps you might inform yourself that I gave support in a way that very few shadow ministers ever give to a government minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to do something with medical school numbers. I am having some discussions with deans. My feeling is that deans understand there is an issue of national interest here and they are being helpful. While the deans are prepared to talk, I do not wish to foreshadow legislation. The trouble is, though, we cannot wait six years for this. We cannot graduate another 7,200 doctors and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6622"> have another 3,600 overseas trained doctors come into the country before we implement it, otherwise the system would collapse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Moore (Mr Filing) raised some points. I will answer them together. Health is different, and it is different for two reasons. First of all, the demand curve is very inelastic. People tend to demand as much health as they can at whatever cost. This stands to reason because if you are ill you say, `Get the best person.' You do not say, `Where can I save $10?' Secondly, there is a dramatic mismatch between the information of the consumer and the information of the provider. In those two circumstances, a normal market does not work well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a fairly simple point which economic parrots and commentators around the place seem to have failed to grasp. The OECD, for example, would say that 40 per cent to 75 per cent of the health costs are generated on the supply side, but I think it is closer to 75 per cent. Most countries which are trying to control their health costs are looking at supply side issues. This would have been quite proper under economic fashion 20 years ago. The current economic fashion happens to be different, but that does not mean this is incorrect. In the end, health is largely supply driven. We are looking at the supply side just as we do with pharmacy, just as we do with new technology. In those areas, we lead the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is no contradiction between competition and restrictive practices. It is sensible economics, if you can think of 30 years of economics, not just what has been fashionable in recent times. I make no reference to the member for Moore in that; I make reference to the wonderful thing about health portfolios, which is that there are so many people in the press and other areas who seem to think that they understand it and are willing to give you advice. But it would be lovely if two of them could occasionally agree.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, in taking on board your counsel, I will try to make this my last contribution on this clause, but I still would be grateful if the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) would respond to some of the points that I would like to make. I am happy to give him the undertaking that, if he does respond to these remarks, I will not take up this clause again. He will not get a better offer than that today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister, who is at the table, claims that he offered the former Minister for Human Services and Health bipartisan support for action reducing intakes into medical schools. That is something which I acknowledge. But I would like to inform all honourable members that I also made the minister an offer which he did refuse. It offered the Labor Party's support for tough action to tighten access for overseas trained doctors to practising medicine in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do acknowledge that eight days ago the minister made an announcement in the House that he was intending to tighten access for overseas trained doctors who arrive after 1 January 1997. But, unfortunately, he was not prepared to take up the second part of my offer, that is, to take action against overseas trained doctors who are already here or who arrive before 1 January. So, just as the current minister for health made the former minister for health an offer, which he mentioned, we in opposition also made him an offer which he has not seen fit to take up. That is unfortunate, but I am sure he has his reasons for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought it very important, quite revealing, that the minister in his last response did not take up the issue that I raised about how this legislation is going to send extra doctors into the electorate of the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest). I would be grateful if he would address this. There is a basic contradiction. The honourable member for Mallee has obviously been told by the minister that the legislation will send more Australian trained <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6623"> doctors to rural areas such as Mallee. That is what the honourable member for Mallee said in the second reading debate. The minister confirmed it in one of his earlier comments today when he said that if Australian trained doctors go to Mallee they will get a guarantee that they will get into the general practice training program after a period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, does that not mean that some Australian trained doctors are going to be missing out on training places and that they will have to wait, they will have to go to Mallee for a period of time&mdash;to use your words&mdash;before they get a training place? When you say that every Australian graduate will get access to a training place, are you saying that it is not necessarily immediate, that you might have to spend some time in the bush? How long? What is the average period of time these people are expected to go to the bush? There certainly might be a wait of a year or two in the next couple of years, but, if you look at the projections in the number of doctors coming through the schools, it is quite clear that any waiting period will grow dramatically in future years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to pick up the point made by the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) about what happens to doctors who currently are registered and have provider numbers. The minister has explained to the interns, the medical students, that they have many other career options. They can work for his department, they can work for the private sector, and they can even become the federal minister for health or even a member of parliament, like the honourable member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would simply like to put to the minister the question that I know the medical students, the interns, have put to him: if he has now taken on a new career in politics and government administration, has he considered whether or not he should surrender his provider number and whether he and other people who have retired from medicine or taken on other careers should hand back their provider number so that there is an extra spot for one of the Australian medical students or interns?</PARA></SPEECH>

I had to decide what we would do with overseas trained doctors who are already here. These are people with whom I have had discussions over several years. I came to the view that most of these people are Australian citizens now. They may be trained overseas, but many of them, like Dr Siddiqui, came here at a time when we were actively trying to recruit doctors. It struck me as unfair to say to them, `You are now Australian citizens; we are not going to give you the opportunity to see whether your skills can be assessed and whether you are up to the standard.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have toughened it by not having it open-ended. All overseas trained doctors currently registered with the AMC will have only five years now, and they will have two attempts at the exam. It is patently absurd to give someone 10 attempts to have a go at passing the AMC exam and give them 20 years to do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The system is, quite frankly, a mess. This will enable us to sort it out and at least, at the end of five years, be able to tell all overseas trained doctors registered with the AMC whether their skills are up to standard or not. If they are, they can go into practice. If they are not, they can get on with the rest of their lives and try to do something else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have an awful mess here. I thought it would have been unfair&mdash;that is why I made the decision that I made. Limiting it to two attempts within five years will have a similar effect, in a way, to a quota, but it will not be an arbitrary quota; it will be a quota on the basis of ability, which, in the end, is the fairest way to do it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not that I should respond to interjections, but no, we will try to make the standard as close as possible to that of final year medicine. With regard to the extra doctors in the electorate of Mallee, I thought I had answered that. The guaranteed places you do not have to take up, but that will make it more attractive for people to go to the electorate of Mallee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said `a period of time' not because I thought there was some queue or that people would have to wait, but because the discussions we have had so far with the RACGP have been on the basis that if someone did three or four years in a country hospital they would then have shortened training in the GP training program. At the moment, people do one or two years in a hospital and then three years in the GP training program. We would expect they would do three or four years in a hospital and then 18 months in the GP training program. So the whole process may take them only an extra six months over what they would normally do, but they would be providing a service to rural areas and we would be rewarding that with a guarantee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing that will help the honourable member for Mallee is that, because we are still allowing overseas trained doctors who come to Australia to have their skills assessed but not get a provider number, those who have had their skills assessed as appropriate and who pass the AMC exam will be able to go for salaried positions, but not into private practice. I think that will make the salary of those positions in the honourable member's electorate, which may not be appropriate for a young doctor, much more attractive. Over time, it will help country areas. I am not promising that it will fix it overnight, but it will help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third thing the shadow minister suggested was that I take up the students' offer to hand in my provider number. I have two comments on that. First, I have agreed to do so if Dr Woollard would care to do so. Second, if he looks at the legislation to see how it is framed, it would be a fairly pointless activity, although that would not be the first time that has happened in politics. If I did hand it in, the legislation would allow me <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to go tomorrow and reapply for it because I am already registered. Any doctor already registered can get as many provider numbers as they like and change them. So it would be a largely symbolic, hollow gesture. I am not big on those.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that these amendments implement part of the government's new 10-year moratorium on overseas trained doctors. We have spent some time during the consideration of clause 1 on the opposition's offers. I will not repeat that in the consideration of this clause.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We welcome these amendments. We will not be opposing them; we will be supporting them. But we think they are only half measures. We think the government should have gone the extra step. The minister should have accepted the Labor Party's offer of bipartisan support on revisiting the issue of a quota on the number of people who are able to sit for the AMC's clinical exam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the former government, that quota was 200. As many members would know, there was a decision of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission that struck down that quota of 200. That has been overturned by the Federal Court. While I am not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6625"> a lawyer, it is my understanding that it would be open to the AMC to reimpose that quota of 200.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other Western countries, including Canada and the United States, are very tough on the number of Australian and other overseas trained doctors allowed into the country. It is very difficult for Australians to practise in those countries. I personally do not see why the government is not prepared to revisit the question of a quota on the number of overseas trained doctors who are already here. Dare I remind the minister of a comment he made in the House on Tuesday last week when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we have been mugs to allow ourselves to be one of the last Western countries to allow unrestrained medical migration.</PARA>
<PARA>We are accepting the proposal that you have in this legislation. However, we think that we are less of a mug because of your proposed amendments, but we are still partial mugs and that, if we really wanted to make sure that we were taking all possible action to close off medical migration, you would have accepted the opposition's suggestion that we also reimpose a quota. It is something other countries do and something the government should have given greater consideration to. Because of this legislation, every time one of the overseas trained doctors gets a place in the training program, the danger is that one of the Australian trained interns or medical students may miss out.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To come back to this issue of a quotas, I say to the shadow minister that the clinical exams started in October and it really would be grossly unfair to implement a quota, even if you could do it after the clinical exams started. That was the difficulty with this year. Any quota would have had to have been imposed for next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because we are limiting provider numbers and because we are allowing two attempts over five years, if we implemented a quota, in a sense it would only be symbolic because we are expecting perhaps 275 doctors to get through this year and a bit more than 100 in subsequent years. But it will not be on an <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> arbitrary basis; it will be on a basis of skill. I perhaps hold myself partly to blame for this because I may not have explained it sufficiently adequately to the shadow minister. I think the effect of what we are doing is to do that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have two brief points to make. Firstly, I would be grateful if the minister might explain to the House what impact he believes the latest changes will make to the savings that the government expects to make from this legislation. I know that the explanatory memorandum for the original bill had quite detailed figures, but if there are figures available for the latest changes, I would be interested in them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is that, as I understand the minister's proposal, even overseas trained doctors who arrive after 1 January 1997 can go to the electorate of our friend the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest)&mdash;if they pass the AMC exam&mdash;and can practise in the hospitals of the honourable member for Mallee. Given that the honourable member for Mallee was arguing very persuasively a few days ago that he was keen to see Australian trained doctors, where possible, practising in his hospitals, would the minister give consideration to some form of work test or priority being given to Australian trained graduates if there is competition between the Australians and the overseas trained doctors, especially to the overseas trained doctors who are arriving after 1 January?</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(11.17 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first point that the shadow minister raised related to savings. This will increase savings. However, we have not sought to quantify that. Quite frankly, I was not planning to seek to quantify that. While it may increase savings, I think the net effect of that will be that maybe for a change the Medicare benefits schedule component of my budget might come in on line rather than dramatically over. The previous government had real trouble over many years trying to control the rate of increase of growth coming in over budget. It is a moot point. Some of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6626"> the effect will be way beyond the forward estimates. For that reason, the cost will be negative, but I have not sought to quantify it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, all we can do is make best estimates, but we believe that this will substantially reduce the desirability of Australia as a destination for overseas trained doctors. So we would expect the number seeking to migrate to drop fairly dramatically. Those who still come here for a variety of reasons&mdash;many legitimate, some not&mdash;will be able to have their skills assessed. I did consider not allowing new arrivals to even sit the AMC exam. I looked at that very seriously. In the end, it is pretty tough to say to someone, `You can't even have your skills assessed.' That is the reason doctors who arrive after 1 January 1997 will be able to sit the AMC exam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not envisage a situation arising where there will be a practical difficulty. I think the simple fact of life is that an Australian trained doctor fluent in medical English will have a very substantial advantage over an overseas trained doctor, given that many of the doctors arriving in Australia are from countries where English is not the first language.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not see the situation arising whereby you have a whole stack of overseas trained doctors forced out of positions because of overseas trained doctors. I think the overseas trained doctors will help this country by taking up positions that Australians are not prepared to fill. If in the future&mdash;it will be quite some years before we see any effect here&mdash;the shadow minister was correct, I would be prepared to look at it, but I do not envisage that happening.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept the assurances that the minister has given on the second issue relating to training places in the electorate of the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest). It will be interesting to watch what happens over the next couple of years as to whether or not Australian graduates do get a fair go in trying to get those places.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Returning very briefly to the first question I asked about savings, the reason why the opposition is asking questions about savings is that the figures that are in the explanatory <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> memorandum are the budget savings figures that were announced on budget night, if my memory serves me correct. There have been a few changes since budget night. In particular, the minister has had a number of different figures about how many training places there will be. For example, as recently as Monday morning, when the minister very generously provided my office with another briefing on the issue, we were given a document that spoke about around 1,200 training places in a year. On Monday evening in his summing up he spoke about 1,300 training places. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> almost always gets what we say right. Yesterday in question time he referred to an exact figure of 1,102, but he did not quantify the number of training places which may be available in some other areas that he mentioned again in the debate here this morning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are just a bit confused about whether or not there is an exact estimate of how many training places there will be this year and to what extent that will vary in future years, given that I understand there is no guarantee that if there are a certain number of training places offered next year, that will be the same in the following years. I would be grateful if the government&mdash;even if the minister takes this on notice&mdash;could do another assessment of what the savings will be as a result of this legislation if, as amended by the  government, it ends up passing the Senate. We would be very interested to know whether the savings are greater or less than that claimed in the budget papers.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(11.22 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The difficulty in the calculation is that not all training places are taken up. At the moment we have training places that are unfilled. It is quite possible that there will still be training places unfilled after all of this. That is the big variable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second difficulty is that we are talking about new first&hyphen;year training positions in 1996. In many cases they are only eligible to doctors three and four years out. Certainly with some of the very advanced ones such as neurosurgery or cardiothoracic surgery, in effect, doctors may be seven or eight years <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6627"> out before they take them up. So that actually makes it very difficult to predict what is going to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third thing is that not all doctors seek training positions. I have not tried to make this point too much. But it is absolutely guaranteed that not all the 1,200 graduates will seek training. It has never happened before and it should not happen now. Some people choose other careers. I chose a career in politics. There are many other careers that doctors are now looking to take up outside clinical practice. All those things make it very difficult to put a precise figure on it, particularly when we have got four&hyphen;year forward estimates and when some of the training positions&mdash;as in the case of neurosurgery&mdash;might come into play seven or eight years after graduation. It would be a fairly pointless exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, it is hard to say what these amendments will do in limiting overseas trained doctors. It may be they have no effect. It may be they just bolster the savings that were in the budget. It may be that they have a negative effect in that they provide greater savings. We have said in the explanatory memorandum that the financial impact is actually zero. It may be that it turns out to be negative. But, as it is, the figures announced on budget night stand.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps I could use this occasion as an opportunity to ask the minister for an assurance that, after he has made some inquiries about what has taken place in determining who will appear before the Senate committee, he would be prepared to make representations to Senator Knowles or write to the Senate committee asking that Dr Tony Lawler and the other stakeholders have a chance to have their views heard and considered by the committee. I understood that his office was advised yesterday that might not have been correct. I accept his statement that he does not control the decisions of the Senate committee. But, given the influence that this powerful minister has over his Senate colleagues, I am sure a letter from him or even a telephone call could play some part in encouraging his colleagues to reconsider their decision.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We thought this was the most appropriate item for a division to express the opposition's concerns about the government's legislation. This is the item that really does determine whether or not provider numbers are available to those Australian medical students and interns. Our concerns remain that you keep saying that no Australian trained medical student or intern will miss out on a training place because of the other changes that you have made in taking those halfway measures to tighten up access for overseas trained doctors. Our concern is that the figures have been very rubbery. Whether on the John Laws program, statements you made on television or different claims that you have made in this House, the claims that you have made about the total number of training places available has varied significantly. I quoted them earlier today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have also made many different claims about how many overseas trained doctors would be affected by different measures that you were going to introduce or that you were thinking of introducing. As a result, medical <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> students and interns out there have asked you to give them that guarantee. You say that every one of them will get a training place and, therefore, a provider number, but you refuse to give that guarantee. If you will not give that guarantee, it is obviously because you do not have full confidence in the figures that you are quoting to us. That is no surprise, given that they have varied so much. Why should the medical students have faith in you and in your figures, given that they have changed so dramatically?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also believe that the government should have allowed proper consideration in detail of the measure. Two hours to consider this very important bill and, I understand, one or two others is an insult not only to the people whose careers are at risk from this legislation but also to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) and his department, and all the other people who have no doubt put in a lot of hours to get this package together. When I saw the minister in a private meeting several weeks ago, I suggested to him that, if we could have a thorough parliamentary committee, even if it did take two months, that would have been a much better way for the parliament to reach a conclusion about whether this draconian legislation is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the government has not been prepared to countenance that thorough parliamentary committee, we are simply getting a quick and nasty inquiry over in the Senate in a couple of hours. As a result of that, the opposition is left with no alternative but to oppose the legislation by seeking a division on this particular item. For all of these reasons, the opposition continues to remain concerned about the impact of the legislation&mdash;the impact on Australians who live in the bush, who are already suffering a shortage of doctors and the impact on women doctors who often, after graduation, get married, want to have a couple of children and are the ones who often have to postpone their postgraduate training and need options for part&hyphen;time training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While it is true, as the minister claims, that many of the colleges, even though they are dominated by males, do allow, in theory, for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6629"> women to take a couple of years off or to do their training part time, in practice those women who exercise that choice&mdash;I am told, by people who should know&mdash;seem to be the ones who are less likely to get training positions. There seems to be a theoretical acceptance that you are allowed to do this, but in practice it is the women doctors who will be hardest hit by these changes. For all those reasons, we think that this legislation should have been sent to a committee for proper consideration. Because the government has not been prepared to allow that proper and thorough consideration, we are given no alternative but to oppose it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To answer the shadow minister's statement that the figures are rubbery, there are several reasons why it has been difficult to get figures on this, although I certainly deny they are rubbery. The first is that the Commonwealth does not control training positions, except in general practice. We know exactly what happens in general practice because we pay for it, but we do not know in other specialities because they are wholly state based. In a lot of cases the states do not know either. To try to get an exact number we got to the point of having to ring individual hospitals, and that caused some fun. Hospitals are not used to getting calls from the Commonwealth to ask how many training positions they have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last three months, we have found substantially more training positions than we realised. We found a lot of training positions unfilled. So the numbers of training positions have increased over time, I guess because there has been no good national data on training. This is an issue in itself and something that we are hoping to remedy over time through AMWAC, the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee. The figures have changed over time, too, because it has been very hard to get precise numbers on overseas trained doctors. This is a system I have inherited. The number keeps changing all the time and, as a country, we are not set up to give any precise details on this. This will be remedied by what we are doing now. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Even on something as simple as trying to understand how many New Zealand trained doctors come to Australia, Australia is not able to tell me and New Zealand is not able to tell me. I have had several discussions with New Zealand and, in the end, we have thrown our hands up in the air and said that it clearly shows a major deficiency in the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why it is an imprecise science. Add to that the imprecise things, such as we do not know how many people pass final&hyphen;year medicine, we do not know how many people take a year off and we do not know how many people will seek to go into other areas that do not require clinical practice. But each of these makes it easier for medical students, not harder. Each of these puts lie to the fact that there will be 400 doctors who will miss out. This is complete rubbish and scaremongering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While there is imprecision in the figures, the best I can say is, as far as I can see, there are more training positions than there are young doctors and there is no reason people should miss out. It will require a bit of flexibility. It might mean we actually have enough psychiatrists, enough rehabilitation medicine physicians or enough occupational medicine physicians, and that will be a great thing for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister asked me to give a guarantee. I will not give a guarantee. No&hyphen;one else gets a guarantee and I do not know why young doctors should be any different. I will seek to do everything that I can to make it fair as I have done for overseas trained doctors. We should not be giving guarantees to doctors. We do not give guarantees to lawyers, architects, dentists or anybody else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the parliamentary committee, as I said, we do have difficulties with a start&hyphen;up date. I cannot delay this until next year. Potentially, we would have real problems next year and that is why it has not been possible, although I seriously considered a committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bush will be no worse off and I believe that they will be marginally better off in the ways that we have discussed. There is nothing in this that will hurt the bush. It is patently absurd to suggest that you fix an undersupply in the bush by flooding the city with doctors. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6630"> We already have an oversupply of 4,500 doctors in the city and a relative undersupply of 500 in the bush Australia wide. You could probably have an oversupply of 9,000 in the city and you would still have an undersupply in the bush: you would just have a Medicare system that was about to collapse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for women, I am not sure that what the shadow minister says is correct, that they are less likely to get training positions if they want part&hyphen;time work. Were that to be the case, I would act decisively and aggressively and no&hyphen;one would be in any doubt as to my view on that. I intend to announce in the next couple of weeks something that I am not prepared to talk about here but that will actually look at those issues. I would take it very seriously if there was any evidence that women are being discriminated against because they wanted part&hyphen;time training or interrupted training, particularly in general practice. But I do not believe that is the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, all this is predicated on the fact that there is an option at the moment for doctors who are not properly trained. If you look at what is going to happen in the next 10 years, I think that anyone who is not properly trained would not have a future anyway.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to support the shadow minister, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), in opposing this item in the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996. I have had representations from medical students and also, interestingly enough, their parents, both in my electorate and in my capacity as Secretary of our Caucus Social Policy Committee. These students have come to see us because they are concerned, firstly, about the retrospective nature of this legislation. Whilst the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) is correct in arguing that no group, be they doctors or anyone else, should be singled out for special treatment, I think that there is a general principle. This parliament should accept that these students have embarked on their training effectively on one basis and midway through that basis will be changed. Some of these people could have already been six years into <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their education; they could have given up substantial income during that time in order to be trained. At this late stage to retrospectively say to them that they cannot be guaranteed a provider number is a retrograde step which should be opposed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, I think there is no doubt that the anecdotal evidence that I have received from both students and their parents is that this will have a particularly savage effect on women. Women do provide a high percentage of the people who choose to defer full&hyphen;time postgraduate training, particularly those who wish to have families. Certainly, women doctors in my electorate have indicated that that is the case. I accept that the minister has responded by saying today that he would be prepared to do something about it, but I believe that it would be better for the minister to fix problems before they arise rather than wait for them to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the rural and regional impact of this will be regressive as well. There is no doubt that it will have a bad effect in terms of providing medical services in rural and regional Australia. They are areas which can least afford this sort of change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister in his response to the shadow minister's remarks today has said that the figures have changed over time. They certainly have; they change very quickly. On Monday morning the figure was 1,200. By Monday night the figure had changed to 1,300 and by yesterday in question time the minister came up with a very precise figure of 1,102. The minister certainly has got it right that the figures change over time but he has got it wrong in both the policy and the politics of this issue. Those sorts of dramatic changes and jumps show why the opposition's proposal of a committee and the opposition's proposal to consider the impact of this in detail should have been supported by the minister. If he does not know, and can jump around from 1,200 to 1,300 back to 1,102 in the space of 24 hours, what hope is there of medical students and their families agreeing to these sorts of changes?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the opposition has been very reasonable on this. That is why it is not surprising that he says that they will not get a guarantee. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6631"> It is not surprising at all, because it is clear that the minister just does not know. To dismiss the opposition to this with `It is hard to give precise figures' and `No, we can't give a guarantee' really is not good enough. The minister will be forced to reconsider this&mdash;there is no doubt about this&mdash;when the impact of its retrospective nature on women and on rural and regional Australia comes through. I am no great fan of the AMA but the fact is that the AMA are the representative body and to exclude them from the process is also a negative step. The minister should give this reconsideration. The opposition have already indicated through the shadow minister that we intend to divide on this. We believe this item in the legislation is indefensible and should be opposed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with colleagues in opposing item 14 of the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996. I do so on behalf of medical students in and around my electorate who have made representations to me. The first representation I received was from 17 fourth-year medical students at the University of New South Wales based at Liverpool Hospital in the south-west of Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the heading `Demolition of the future for medical students and interns' they made a series of very telling points about the folly of the proposal of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge). There is one point in particular I wish to draw to his attention and also to the attention of the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey), quite appropriately, seeing as he is in the House. The 17 medical students write:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a cost of around $126,000 per medical student for six years of undergraduate training without incorporating significant education costs of interns, it is economically unsound to refuse graduates the opportunity to repay community investment. In addition to $50 million spent on wasted training, the government has allocated $20 million per annum to assist in medical work force adjustment to this budgetary measure. This cost of $70 million to the community in 1997 should be compared to the government's projected saving of $26 million.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very telling point. I hope it is a point that the Minister for Finance has absorbed. This is a false economy. The govern <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ment claims to be saving $26 million when it is washing $70 million of public resources down the drain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I saw the other day, 12 months after the drought, that the Minister for Finance to some extent is asleep at the wheel on drought assistance for farmers. I suggest that he takes note of that false economy, to note the $70 million of public resources that are being wasted because of the government's decision on medical students and the provider numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that this is a false economy and the government should recognise that. It is not a savings measure; it is a measure in net terms which will cost the taxpayers of Australia $44 million in 1997 through the wasted investment in medical training, because the measure is retrospective, plus the $20 million adjustment package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next representation I received was from a young medical student living in Prestons in my electorate. She made a whole series of telling points against the government's proposal. I wish to read to the House the final point she made which was at a personal level:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I intend to become a rural GP and have made choices as a student which reflect this. To follow this career path which has been strongly promoted by both government and opposition it appears under the coalition's proposal that I may have no choice but to enter the training program early to ensure a position and maintain an income and to, therefore, postpone having children until at least part way through my postgraduate training. This will be at significant personal cost to my husband and me and I would not have dreamed that this would become a problem when I started my medical training way back in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the sad retrospective nature of this provision. That medical student in 1990 could not have dreamed that six years later her future would be jeopardised in this fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is something very authoritarian about a government that relies on retrospective provisions and legislation. I detect in many areas of this Howard administration an authoritarian streak&mdash;be it on the family tax initiative, telling women that their place is in the home and no other place in Australian society and economy; its sponsorship of euthanasia laws to tell terminally ill people <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6632"> how to spend the last days of their life; or this measure telling young medical students how they must now turn upside down all their family planning and aspirations because of a false economy this government is applying in its health budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First and foremost I believe in liberty in the relationship between government and citizens&mdash;not authority, not the strongarm right wing authority of this Howard administration. I stand for the liberty and rights of these medical students in and around my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that, if the so&hyphen;called Liberal Party had any grain of belief or commitment to small `l' liberalism in the 1990s, it would not be pursuing this measure. It is a party of authority, a party which is trying to tell people how to live their lives. On this particular aspect of its legislation program, it is putting forward a retrospective measure which is unfair, inequitable, unjust and, most of all, a false economy. There is no saving out of this measure and the Minister for Finance more than anyone else should wake up at the wheel and recognise that the government is committing an act of folly on its own finances by pursuing the recommendation of the Minister for Health and Family Services. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wanted to make a further point not so much connected to constituents in and around my electorate but on the basis of competition policy, for which I have a shadow responsibility. For a long time I have been interested in the principles of competition as they apply to the medical profession. I know the Minister for Finance did half a thing in New South Wales with regard to the legal profession, but his mates there at the big end of town held him up a bit. But at least on the medical profession we should be applying&mdash;</PARA>

It is only against resistance in their own ranks that any of these measures come through.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, seeing that the Minister for Finance has given a lead and seems to be smiling with satisfaction about that measure with regard to the legal profession, maybe he can do something with regard to medical professionals. Why is it that the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons in Australia is still engaged in anti-competitive practices? Why is it that, when the government is supposedly trying to save money on its health budget, it is not addressing the anti-competitive practices identified in the Baume report relating to the college of surgeons?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are talking about the medical profession, the number of GPs and the number of surgeons in Australia. The big saving, the big inequity, the big anti-competitive practice the government needs to tackle first and foremost is with the surgeons. Report after report after report&mdash;everyone from John Patterson in Victoria to former coalition colleague Peter Baume&mdash;has identified that the lack of supply of surgeons in Australia is a critical factor in driving up costs on the national health budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again the government has its priorities wrong. If you were given a choice between tackling the question of limiting the supply of GPs where costs are capped on the medical budget and increasing the supply of surgeons where costs are uncapped and excessive in current charging practices, you would start with the latter. You would start with the anti-competitive practices of the college of surgeons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only is this government engaging in a false economy and in retrospective legislation damaging the aspirations of young medical students around Australia but also it has a false sense of priorities. The real saving, the real return to the Commonwealth budget and to the medical system around Australia, would be to crash through the anti-competitive practices of the college of surgeons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why has the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) not done that? Why is he picking on interns and medical students? Why is he not going to the Bruce Shepherds and the other rorters in the medical practices of Australia who are deliberately keeping down the number of surgeons in this country? </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the truth of it for the Minister for Finance. They may not have shown him this at the ERC when he came in as the new boy from Macarthur.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister should go back to his papers and to the ERC agenda and find the big savings and benefits to the medical budget in Australia that should be the first priority of this government. It should not start with GPs or by trying to limit the supply of doctors where their costs are capped. It should start with the basic proposition of increasing the supply of surgeons where the costs are uncapped and excessive by current charging practices.</PARA>

<PARA>The opposition has sought to do this in such a way that it is not opposing the introduction of the multiple services rule for diagnostic imaging. That is something which the opposition is supporting. We believe that, just as the former government took action in the area of pathology through negotiations with the profession, the government has come up with some changes that will seek to reduce the cost of diagnostic imaging over the long term, and that is something we will be supporting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our concerns are with two other changes that are included in items 2 to 9. They are, first of all, the increase in the maximum permissible gap. I think all honourable members would be aware that when Medicare was first introduced Medicare provided you with an 85 per cent rebate. If your doctor charged you a fee for service, a fee up-front, then the Medicare rebate covered 85 per cent of the cost and out of your own pocket, if your doctor does not bulkbill, you were expected to pay 15 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that 15 per cent exceeded the maximum permissible gap, then Medicare would top up the Medicare rebate increase to keep that maximum permissible gap at a reasonable level. This is not to be confused with the gap people often talk about, which is the gap between what the doctor actually charges and the Medicare schedule fee. That is a different gap. Basically, this amendment by the government in this legislation, which in effect increases that maximum permissible gap from $30 to $50, is simply going to result in an increase in the cost of essential medical care for patients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Before the last election, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) promised that Medicare would be retained in its entirety. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) promised in his many letters to his constituents that rebates would not be changed. He could claim that he has kept that promise as far as rebates for GP consultations are con cerned because they have been frozen. That might have the unintended effect of making it less likely that doctors will bulkbill, but he has broken that pledge to his constituents by increasing that maximum permissible gap from $30.60 to $50.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not small beans. It raises nearly $60 million over four years. This money will be raised from people who are seriously ill and require medical services where the schedule fee is in excess of $200. So it is quite substantial. It is hard to imagine how anyone could consider this to be a fair and reasonable measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second element we have objections to is the change in the provisions in the legislation that deal with the NBAC's power to award higher fees for unusually long or complex services. Perhaps that is another example of the government's arbitrary cutbacks and arbitrary changes in Medicare rebates and in health generally. The government expects this change will save around $5 million a year by removing doctors' rights to claim for unusual items. It simply means that doctors will be forced to look for an item amongst that long list of items under the MBS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps I could repeat for the minister's benefit an example that was drawn to my attention, which he might like to respond to. For example, if someone is badly injured in a country area, we could imagine that a rural general practitioner might be called to an emergency on a remote property. She might drive for more than an hour to reach the property and then find that the patient has had an accident with a piece of farm machinery and has sustained a serious injury. The GP would treat the injuries as well as possible, treat the patient for shock, assist the family and then accompany the patient to hospital. That whole episode could take four hours, yet there is no item which would properly cover that afternoon's work by that GP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the current arrangements, that GP could write to NBAC and explain the circumstances of the case and the committee would then determine a fair fee. If the same GP had instead done 16 15&hyphen;minute consultations in their surgery, Medicare would have paid them <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6637"> around $300. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> Under the amendment to the legislation, that GP could now only claim $70 for those four hours of work. That is the rebate for a long home visit consultation. We do not think that is a reasonable fee in those circumstances. My concern is that the patients will be the ones who ultimately end up out of pocket. For these reasons, we oppose these changes in the maximum permissible gap and the changes in the rebates which are awarded for unusually long or complex services.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Briefly, on the issue of the maximum permissible gap, we are increasing it, but it in no way diminishes Medicare. It keeps Medicare in its entirety. I would point out that the safety net is not changing. So those people who are chronically ill or those people who use medical services a lot will not pay anything more over a whole year, because the safety net will be reached a bit sooner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is in fact far less onerous than what the previous government did in the 1995 budget when it increased the safety net for pharmacy from $400 to $600, which did hit people who had a chronic illness. It hit anyone who had a chronic illness an extra $200 a year. Because the safety net has been kept in place, this will provide significant protection for anyone, as I said, who has a chronic illness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part is the ability of the MBAC to award higher fees. We have done this on a swings and roundabouts basis, and I can speak with quite some personal experience here. The point is that, while people are happy to write in and ask for a higher fee for something of unusual complexity, I am not aware of a single case in 13 years where someone has written in and offered to give some money back because they were overpaid for something that was relatively simple.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end, there are very substantial swings and roundabouts in medicine and they do average out over time. Sure, some things are more complex and take longer, but I can tell you that a lot of things are relatively simple and take a very short time. It is fair over a period of time to average these out. At the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> moment they are not being averaged out, they are skewed, and that is the reason that the government is making this change.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This schedule seeks to implement a number of changes to Medicare rebates. The government also gazetted some regulations that made a number of other changes to Medicare rebates. The government obviously is in the fortunate position where it can change some Medicare rebates by regulation, but others require legislation, thereby giving the parliament a chance to debate them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My great concern is that, while the government has said that Medicare will be retained and Medicare rebates will not be reduced&mdash;they were the promises before the election&mdash;its actions after the election have been very different. I have made the analogy before that it is like Medicare has been turned into a salami down at the local delicatessen. Medicare is up there on the salami slicer and with every budget we are going to get a few more slices of Medicare taken off by the slicer at the deli.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to these changes which increase the maximum permissible gap and the rebates for unusual and complex operations, there is an increase in costs for women who are on the IVF program. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> a few days ago mentioned that many families who do go on the IVF program have to go through several cycles before they are, in many cases, fortunate enough to have a successful conception.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result, it is important for some of these families on tight budgets that an increase of a couple of hundred of dollars can make all the difference between whether or not they can afford the full number of cycles or whether they have to stop after a lower number. Certainly, one slice of that Medicare salami has come off as a result of this government's cuts or reductions in rebates for women on the IVF program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, there have been some reductions in rebates to cover surgeons offering assistance for operations. We have had reductions in rebates for a number of operations, including knee surgery and eye surgery. In many cases I do not expect the surgeons to be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6638"> reducing their fees. I think that those changes will certainly result ultimately in patients having to pay more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had a change in the rebate which is payable after 50 visits to a psychiatrist in the one year. I would draw to the minister's attention an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Herald</EMPHASIS> last Saturday which mentioned a particularly tragic case of a woman who had been sexually abused when she was a child and how she is quite distraught because of the changes that have been made by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister does appear to have strong views on this. He has spoken in the House a couple of times on this in question time, but I would draw to his attention that there are a large number of not just psychiatrists who are obviously concerned about the decision but patients who have written to me directly&mdash;no doubt they have also written to the minister&mdash;and I would ask him whether it is in fact true, as was admitted in the Senate, that there was no clinical basis for picking the number 50. It is very difficult to know which types of patients will be the most likely to be affected by this decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who write to me are often the victims of abuse, people suffering from drug abuse and people suffering from anorexia. Isn't there a concern, Minister, that as a result of these changes we are simply going to cost shift from the federal government to the states by having people treated as in&hyphen;patients?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, there is the decision to freeze the rebates for GPs. That decision of course increases the pressure on GPs to cease bulk&hyphen;billing which, in the long term, also increases the cost of health care for Australian families on tight budgets.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not bring the list into the House with me, but I may get the opportunity later to remind the shadow minister of the changes that the previous government, of which he was a part, made to Medicare. I keep a list like this handy. I just did not bring it into the House at this moment. Again, I would say to him: if you don't reform Medicare, it dies. They are the words of Brian Howe, the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> former Labor Deputy Prime Minister and former health minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the specific decisions the shadow minister raised were very difficult to make. I agonised over and gave quite close scrutiny to them. If we had not been facing an $8 billion deficit, perhaps we might have been able to be more generous. But some of the decisions, quite frankly, needed to be made. IVF has undergone very substantial technological change and economies of scale. When that happens it is quite reasonable for the rebates to go down. In the end, if you do not do that, all you do is artificially prop up very high incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">IVF physicians are at one of the highest levels of remuneration, if you have a look at billing. Admittedly, they have some costs probably higher than some other areas but, off the top of my head, I think the average IVF physicians are billing about $1 million a year&mdash;that is gross of course, not net. Even net, it is a very substantial income to a very limited number of doctors, and they may choose to charge their patients more. Certainly, a small number of them, in the most outrageous way, have tried to work up their patients into a frenzy, but the government has a right where there is technological change to expect that it should not just go into the pockets of doctors and that the taxpayer should be able to benefit from that too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are changing assistance in operations for a number of procedures, but for no procedure where there was an assistant already helping at more than 70 per cent of the cases. So the complex operations&mdash;cardiac, neurosurgery, most orthopaedics and eye surgery&mdash;will be unaffected. We are doing what is being done overseas. Again, technological changes make many of these quite properly able to be done without an assistant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was hoping to have more cooperation from the medical profession than I have had on this. I did say I was prepared to review it and look at specific cases. There was one specific case, for example, with varicose veins that I was prepared to reverse, but I am not going to reverse the whole thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of psychiatry, again, this is illustrative as to how some members of the medical <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6639"> profession choose to behave. It is a problem that all health ministers face. I have had lots of calls in my office. I had someone who said, `I am seeing a psychiatrist once a day and I am only halfway through my therapy.' I said, `How long do you have to go?' and they said, `Five years.' The fact is the majority of people affected by this decision are undergoing psychoanalysis for which there is no proven cost effectiveness. We had one case where there was a psychiatrist seeing a patient 747 times in a 12-month period for 75&hyphen;minute consultations. That is, three times a day, Monday to Friday excluding public holidays and weekends. Honestly, the majority of this is a rort that should have been fixed ages ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There may be a small number of cases, a very small number of cases, and then the rebate is not being cut out altogether. The rebate is going back to that for a general practitioner long consultation rate. If psychiatrists were prepared to accept swings and roundabouts, it would mean the average psychiatrist, given there are about 1,600 practising in Australia, could expect to have their income reduced by $1,500 over a year. So a net income drop from $200,000&hyphen;odd a year to $198,500 for an average 48&hyphen;hour week is probably pretty fair remuneration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for freezing the rebates for GPs and its effect on bulk&hyphen;billing, the previous government froze rebates for a four-month period on three occasions, which is the same as a 12&hyphen;month freeze. That did not cause bulk&hyphen;billing to go down. Also, they froze rebates for other medical practitioners for the past four years at $17.85 and bulk&hyphen;billing has gone up and is in fact the highest percentage of any group of doctors amongst that group who have had their rebates frozen for four years. So I do not think there is any evidence at all to back up the shadow minister's claim.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to shock the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) by saying that it would be pretty hard to find anyone in this chamber who does not support the continuing scrutiny and reform of Medicare. That is something which I am happy to sign up for, and that is why the opposition is quite happy <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to support you in the changes you are making in pathology. This builds on the savings that were introduced by the former Labor government in this area. Because of our support for continuing refinement and reform of Medicare, we are supporting you on the changes to diagnostic imaging.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not going to support you when you break your promises which you made before the election to maintain rebates. You did not tell people before the election you would cut back rebates for women on the IVF program. I think there are almost a quarter of a million operations a year that currently have surgical assistance, but you did not tell them before the election that the rebates for that would be cut back. You certainly did not advise people of many other changes that have been made&mdash;for example, increases in pharmaceuticals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps I can finish on one point and one question, which goes to the heart of many of these changes. Can the minister please explain why he thinks the Medicare system is in a state of crisis and why he thinks it is necessary to implement all of these changes, given the fact that, in the 10 years Medicare has been in action, since Medicare has been introduced, the cost of total health care in Australia has risen by one per cent of gross national product? I think it is now about 8&half; per cent. It has gone up by one per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are certainly in a much better position than the United States, which is a totally private health care system. I think they are up around 14 per cent or a higher percentage of their gross national product. Minister, if Medicare is not in such a crisis, and if you are having to apply all this shock therapy to Medicare, how do you explain the fact that, as a percentage of gross national product, health delivery in Australia has not been growing dramatically?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Health care in Australia has only increased by one per cent in the last decade. I think most Australians would admit that there are problems in our health care system. Medicare is not perfect. There are problems, particularly in our public hospitals. That is why we have expressed such strong opposition to this government's cutbacks in federal funding for public hospitals&mdash;$800 million over the next <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6640"> four years. That is why, when I go around to the various states, I criticise state health ministers when they cut back state funding for public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that we try to get these changes in perspective and we do not allow the minister to create the impression that in some way the Medicare salami has to be sliced at the delicatessen because he argues it is unsustainable. The Medicare system we have does have problems, but when you look at the percentage of our gross national product we are putting into health care you cannot argue that the costs have exploded over the last decade.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister asks why we have a crisis. A crisis can be a turning point, if you look at a dictionary definition, as well as a point at which everything is about to collapse. The problem that Australia has compared to overseas countries is that the age distribution of its population is quite different from that of Europe or most of our OECD partners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a young population structure. In fact, the 8.6 per cent of GDP that we spend on health is not as good as it seems if you look at the age structure of our population. Most European countries are 20 years further advanced in that their age structure is what we will have in about the year 2015. When you factor in that age structure, and the fact that we are dealing with a younger population compared with most OECD countries, you see that we do have a substantial problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is making it worse? It is cost shifting. It is absolutely rife. Previous ministers have talked about it but have done nothing about it. I have done something about it. Rorts are making it a time of crisis. Previous health ministers have talked about it. I have fixed it. Supply is causing a crisis in health care. Previous ministers have talked about it. I have delivered on it. I cannot fix the ageing population, but I can try to give us a health care system that is sustainable into the long term. Because, if we do not make these changes now, people will not have any access to a health care system, let alone a fair one, at a reasonable price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the notion that this is a salami change and that Medicare is some solid icon that has not changed since 1984, I would remind the honourable shadow minister that he deferred fee increases at least three times for Medicare. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6641"> In the last three years, GP fees were indexed at only half the rate of specialists. In 1995, the annual fee increases were not applied to pathology, and coning was introduced. In 1986, there was a 25 per cent cut to the most commonly used pathology items. In 1987, there was a 30 per cent cut to cataract surgery. In 1991, there was a 17 per cent cut to ophthalmology consultations at which glasses were prescribed. In 1993, there was a 20 per cent cut to computerised perimetry. In 1995, there was a 25 per cent cut to percutaneous endoscopy. In 1995, there was a 50 per cent cut to faecal occult blood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Included in that, in 1987 the after-hours loading for GP consultations was removed, and GPs were expected to absorb it. In 1987, venipuncture items were removed so that procedures became part of the attendance item. In 1993, cryotherapy and serial curettage for skin lesions were expected to be part of the normal attendance items.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So Medicare has been changing. It does evolve. We have to take account of new technology. We have to take account of areas where costs are rising dramatically and rapidly. If we do not do this, Medicare dies. I have worked overseas and have worked in a country that does not have universal access to health care. I do not ever want to see that happen in Australia. I want to see our system sustainable. Unless we make some of these decisions which the government has delivered in this budget, we will find ourselves as a country that will have to have solutions imposed on it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take it that the final comment relates to the fact that, because there will be fewer doctors, there will not be the people to work in locum services. I am disturbed to hear what the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) tells me. I would be happy to try to follow it up. I do not know the particulars of this case, nor the locum service involved. There is at least one locum service in WA that I hold in high regard, and I would be surprised if it was that one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be a worry if a locum service was saying, `We will treat you if you are profitable; we will not treat you otherwise.' How I approached my time as a medical practitioner, I would have thought that was unethical, and I think many doctors would feel the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do have a real problem with trying to provide access to after-hours services. It is patchy around the country. Locum services have brought in temporary resident doctors because they have not had Australian doctors who have been able to fill those positions. It is something we do not have a solution to now&mdash;I do not mean as a government; I mean as a country&mdash;let alone in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">General practice strategy is looking at this, amongst other things. We do give general <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6642"> practitioners, in a blended payment sense, a reward through the better practice program for providing a comprehensive service. I guess I would want to know, in the honourable member's case, what happened to this person's normal GP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many general practitioners would cover the after-hours calls of their regular patients, although I have sympathy for GPs. No-one can be expected to work seven days a week 365 days a year. It is a bit rich when you get calls from people you have never known expecting you to have your home or family life disrupted. Many GPs would provide that sort of service for their longstanding patients. That is clearly the best sort of service you can get. The lady in question should be taking it up with her own general practitioner and perhaps should be looking for a new general practitioner if she is not satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the medium term, we will solve this by further changes to a blended payment system that rewards those general practices that provide a comprehensive service. General practice is going through a time of big change. It is one of my highest priorities. To me, it is the key to the whole basic primary health care system in Australia. If you are going to fix general practice, you have to fix the problems of it being progressively deskilled and you have to fix the morale problem. A third of GPs in Australia would leave tomorrow if they had anything else they could do. That should be a major worry to every honourable member in this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard Peter Baume's name mentioned. In the same report, Peter Baume said that general practice has been progressively deskilled over 20 years. What these changes will collectively do is dramatically increase the status of general practice. I make no apology for that. General practice has been the dumping ground for the medical profession for too long. General practice has been of low status for too long. General practice has been, by and large, poorly remunerated, particularly for those people trying to provide a comprehensive family GP service. They have found their easy patients are skimmed off because people go to the 24-hour bulk-billing clinic and say, `We didn't want to bother you. It was easy.' <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> They go to their GP only for the harder stuff. So their case loads change. Even though before the election we said that we were going to take $400 million out of the better practice program, it is for that reason that we reversed that change&mdash;because the better practice program is providing a blended payment that gives us the capacity to reward GPs who are doing things that may not be properly remunerated, such as providing after-hours care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can provide no immediate answer to the honourable member except to say that I do not believe these things will make it any worse. I do hope that these strategies that we are employing over the medium term offer some prospect. If he would care to take up with me or my office the particulars of his case, I would be happy to look into it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(12.42 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot help but respond to two points the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) raised in his last contribution. The first thing he raised was the issue of cost shifting. He has once again repeated his claims that state governments are cost shifting onto the federal government. When the minister makes these claims, he does not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6643"> concede that there are certain changes the federal government has made which, in effect, cost shift from the federal government back onto the states. Whether it is a shortage of nursing home beds, which requires people to stay in state funded public hospitals a bit longer, or whether it is changes for psychiatric patients' access to their psychiatrists, which requires more people to be treated as in-patients, these things end up shifting some obligations back onto areas which are funded by state governments. So it is not a one-way street.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister, in this budget&mdash;not in this particular piece of legislation, but the minister raised it in his speech on this particular clause&mdash;has implemented a cutback of $75 million this financial year in federal funding for public hospitals. I am sure the minister will concede that that is the case. It is in the budget papers&mdash;$75 million this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The information I have received is that at the moment the state departments of health have only indicative indications as to how that $75 million will be split between the different states. Given that we are now in the first week of November, almost halfway through the financial year, I would find it a bit disturbing if the federal Department of Health and Family Services or if the federal Minister for Health and Family Services has not advised his state colleagues of how much of those cutbacks they will have to carry in their state public hospital systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be grateful if the minister could either advise me, now or on notice, of whether state ministers have been advised of how the cuts will be distributed. I am sure he would think it is rather difficult for state health ministers and the administrators of public hospitals right around Australia to be able to implement federal reductions in funding for public hospitals if they do not yet know how much New South Wales will have to carry or what proportion Tasmania or Western Australia will have to carry. That is the first issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue is that on that last occasion the minister got back to the number of general practitioners. I would like to finish with a very brief question to the minister. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Does he expect that there will be a reduction in the number of intakes in the medical schools this coming year? I think there was a reduction of 30 last year. I am not sure of the exact figure, but I thought there was some negotiated reduction last year. Has there been any progress made in the last six months? Is the minister prepared to give the House an undertaking that if his discussions with the deans prove not to be successful, he will be willing to bring back legislation to this House that does give the Australian people the ability to influence the intakes of the medical schools around Australia?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, in response to the shadow minister, cost shifting does go both ways. I have always conceded that, although we do not do things anywhere nearly as blatantly or to the volumes that the states do. We have not had the gall to have a public hospital with 62 so-called privatised outpatient clinics. We have not had the gall to have a hospital casualty with a Medicare bulk&hyphen;billing clinic in it specialising in plaster removal.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It might have slipped my mind for the moment. In the end, the issue of cost shifting is one that is putting immense strain on the Commonwealth Medicare budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The $75 million in the budget will be a serious disincentive for states to cost shift. When I rang up one state health minister to tell him about it&mdash;again, not trying to dob him in&mdash;I got him on his mobile phone and he said, `Actually, that's okay, mate. We don't cost shift; we were waiting to see what you did in the budget and if you didn't do anything, we were going to go for it.' In the end, the Commonwealth cannot sustain that sort of shift in cost. It is quite irrational that the states will have to shift $10 of cost on to the Commonwealth to save $1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6644"> We are looking at a cooperative approach as part of the COAG process that will be discussed by chief ministers, premiers and the Prime Minister next week. Even if that does not come to a resolution, I hope we can make progress on a measure and share basis where by we look at efficient ways of doing things at the margins of Commonwealth-State programs and jointly share in the savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is correct that I have yet to advise the states of the amount, although I will be doing this in the very near future&mdash;probably within the next week. I understand that the states have already figured this into their budgets. I have had some indication from state ministers what they think they have cost shifted or what they will be up for. All of them feel quite guilty because if you add them up, it is far more than what we think they are doing. Whether that will lead to a cut in public hospital funding, I actually doubt it. It depends how the states respond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end, all we are doing is taking back money that is rightfully ours that they promised not to cost shift in July 1995 at the health ministers meeting in Alice Springs. There was a health ministers meeting in Melbourne on Friday. No health minister raised it with me then. They all had the opportunity to do so. That is not to say that they might not have written to me about it. When they saw me in person last week all of them had the capacity to raise it and no-one did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second question that the shadow minister raised related to medical student intakes. Yes, there has been some progress, but I am not in a position to make an announcement at the moment. I would be prepared to take him into my confidence on that another time if he wishes to be briefed. I do not wish to threaten legislation at the moment, because the deans are, by and large, being cooperative. While they recognise that there is an issue of national interest, I do not think I should wave sticks around.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Moore (Mr Filing) asked if we could be a little flexible in how this is implemented. The answer is yes and no. I have to make substantial savings in health because we have a big budget deficit and it is dramatically in the country's interest that that is addressed. So I am not prepared to back down on the savings we have to make. But in terms of implementation, in terms of trying to be reasonable and in terms of unintended consequences&mdash;there are always unintended <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> consequences; perhaps more so in health than any other area&mdash;I am prepared to look at those things, particularly when people come to me and quietly and calmly point out that there is a problem here that we have to sort through. Often it can be done. I am more than willing to look at that. I am a little bit less willing when people feel that the first course of action is television cameras because if I blink, everyone will think I am a soft touch, and in health that would be a disaster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end, I want to see a health system that works. I want to try to be fair about what we are doing. At the margins there is some flexibility. There is this particular concern with locum services. I have a very big one in my own electorate. It is not my desire to close them down. If you look back at the original press release on budget night, you will see that we understood that there was potential difficulty with locum services. Given that this will take several years to implement and have an effect, we have a bit of time to do that and I am more than willing to do so. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I was interrupted by the adjournment debate last night, I was speaking in support of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill 1996 and against the amendment moved by the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it would be instructive for those opposite to consider the history of the Hindmarsh Island saga. It has been around now for about 16 years. The Chapmans were looking at putting in a marina development and various approvals were received. There was a change in government in South Australia. There was an investigation by Justice Jacobs <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and a recommendation that a bridge proceed. About 1993, the Aboriginal legal rights movement, aided and abetted by the Labor Party, asked the South Australian minister for aboriginal affairs and the then federal minister, Robert Tickner, to halt construction of the bridge. The relevant act which gave the federal minister power is the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984. Under that particular act, under section 9 and section 10, the minister has power to make declarations which can effectively stop a development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister issued an emergency declaration and then referred the matter to Professor Saunders for a report. That report was handed down and found that `women's business' did in fact exist. The Chapmans took the report, on appeal, and in the Federal Court the Chapmans were successful. The Saunders decision was overturned on a number of grounds. One of those grounds included the fact that the then minister failed to look at all of the evidence. A little after that there was a suggestion that the so&hyphen;called `secret women's business' was entirely fabricated. And one could imagine the concern in the community generally, and indeed the concern among the Aboriginal community in the area, over the fact that `women's business' allegedly had been fabricated for the purposes of stopping construction of the bridge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The South Australian government established a royal commission, and that was the appropriate course of action. The royal commissioner was Iris Stevens, a former judge. Her decision was mentioned by me last night. She found that the whole of the women's business was a fabrication, and in particular the claim that there was spiritual and cultural significance of Hindmarsh within the Aboriginal tradition of Ngarrindjeri women which was crucial for the reproduction of the Ngarrindjeri people and of the cosmos which supported their existence was fabricated; and also the claim that the women's business required the prohibition of the construction of the bridge was fabricated; so, in effect, the claims of those people who sought to stop the construction of the bridge were rejected in the decision by the royal commissioner.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6647">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal minister, however, was not happy with that. He referred the matter off to Justice Mathews for a further report. Justice Mathews brought down a report which did not say that the construction of the bridge would amount to desecration of Aboriginal heritage. However, the Full Court ruled that the Mathews appointment was invalid and so in effect the Mathews report was not worth the paper it was written on. Consequently, when we came to government with the tremendous landslide and mandate we received from the Australian people on 2 March this year, the new minister was faced with a predicament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This saga had been around for some 16 years. The legal advice given to the government was that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs would have either to commission a further report under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984&mdash;and already some $6 million in costs had been incurred and a new report would have taken the costs to more than $7 million&mdash;or he could bring in legislation. What the minister has decided to do is to restore certainty. He has decided to bring in legislation to make sure that this bridge can go ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last night I paid tribute to the women of the Ngarrindjeri tribe who exploded this myth for what it was. They were the women who had the intestinal fortitude to stand up and say that they did not want their heritage trampled on and that they were not prepared to allow people to claim that the `women's business' existed when it did not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party has behaved disgracefully. The shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs and the Labor Party should have their tails between their legs. They should be ashamed of the way they handled this. They have been prepared to use false evidence of alleged Aboriginal traditions with a view to stopping development of the bridge at all costs.</PARA>

If the minister overturned the legal advice which he has received from a range of advisers to the government then we would end up in court and delay would continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister ought to be congratulated for having the decency, for the promptness, for bringing in this legislation. What he is saying and what the people of Australia are saying and what the Ngarrindjeri women are saying, those who oppose the fabrication of their history, is that this matter should be allowed to proceed, and it should be allowed to proceed expeditiously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, I have been appalled by the vilification of the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan). The Minister for Defence would be one of the most honourable people I have met since I was elected to this place. The Minister for Defence has spoken very strongly in favour of this bill. I think that it is sad when those opposite are prepared to condemn an individual who has made such a tremendous contribution to this country both in his former life, before his election to parliament, and now as Minister for Defence. I must say that when people endeavour to rort and to fabricate secret women's business, what they are doing is destroying the natural sympathy in the Australian community for the plight of Aboriginal people.</PARA>

In every one of our first four years in government the coalition will spend more on indigenous specific programs than Labor did in any year other than 1995-96.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The secret women's business involved in the Hindmarsh Island Bridge affair will probably go down in the annals of political history along with the Zinoviev letter in British political history, because, quite clearly, we have witnessed in recent years one of the greatest political forgeries of our times. The fact of the matter is that this House was conned into treating the secret women's business&mdash;which was a forgery&mdash;with the seriousness that ordinarily members would give to important traditional materials, by the then minister who was not only prepared to use a forgery to vilify his political opponents but actually unprepared to make the proper, necessary, investigation to ascertain the veracity of the documents in the first place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make no reflection on the shadow minister although, of course, he was part of the Labor Party that stood by the minister in this particular matter. I might add also that there were some coalition members who wilted under the pressure at the time. Unfortunately, the then shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs did not do herself proud by the fact <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that she refused to take the disallowance motion through this House after it had been passed by the shadow cabinet which, at the end of the day, was an obligation required of the then shadow minister, the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), who, of course, was the subject of this vilification campaign undertaken both within and without the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Barker, as the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) has said, treated his role in this matter with an honourable&mdash;I think&mdash;degree of conduct.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have my differences from time to time with the member for Barker, but I must say that in his conduct in this place and his conduct as a member of parliament and as a shadow minister he acted with the utmost honour. But the irony was he was hanged for an offence he could not possibly have committed. That was, of course, this so&hyphen;called offence of handling documents that, at the end of the day, were quite clearly utter forgeries. Not only forgeries; they were forgeries used in a way that demeaned this place because they were used to try to vilify someone who had acted only to represent his constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The irony is that at the end of the day the member for Barker, in whose electorate the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6649"> Hindmarsh Island Bridge was to be constructed, in fact opposed the construction of the bridge personally. So, in other words, he was not, in fact, exercising or grinding his own personal political axe. He opposed it. But he thought that in this case the principles were worth fighting for and in essence all he did was to represent his constituents properly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can recollect this particular debate only too well because it was in November 1994. The reason I recollect it is because at the time we had only recently in Western Australia witnessed that in response to calls to make a similar order in relation to the old Swan Brewery, both he and his predecessor had refused to act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that in that particular instance the person who stood to benefit the most from the refusal to take out an order was, of course, a substantial donor to the Western Australian Labor Party, the party that became so thoroughly and utterly discredited as a result of the WA Inc. saga. As a consequence, quite clearly one could have taken not only the inference being drawn from it, but one could also have taken it that the reticence to act, on the part of the minister, in this particular instance was because they did not want to upset somebody who had donated many hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Western Australian Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mention that because in more recent times we have seen some attacks, based on potential conflict of interest, on members of the frontbench in relation to their personal affairs. I would have thought that in that particular instance there quite clearly was the most substantial conflict of interest on the part of the minister. It was interesting in relation to that particular criticism that I raised with him that he had very little to say other than to try to vilify me as being some sort of racist because I had the audacity to stand up and ask him quite simple questions about the way in which he conducted his business as a minister of the Crown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation here revolves around the desire and intention of the Chapmans to build and develop a tourist resort on the island that would have been serviced by the building of the bridge. The development also included a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> marina and zoning for private dwellings. At the time the Chapmans went through all the processes of obtaining relevant approvals, including those required under the state's Aboriginal heritage act. Thorough archaeological and anthropological studies were undertaken and approval was granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly enough, these were done under the previous Bannon state labor government which is of interest and significance. Despite these approvals, a group which had been unhappy with the clearance to progress took their case to the federal minister of the day to override the decision. At issue at the time were three sacred sites and a belief that linking the island to the mainland would have been an act of sacrilege. This view was sustained by the minister, though the island was already connected to the mainland by a barrage, which had been there for 50 years, separating fresh water from salt water. It was something that obviously was overlooked in the case of those who felt it was going to provide a very dangerous threat to the health of local Aborigines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The then minister for Aboriginal affairs placed a temporary ban on the construction in 1994, exercising his rights under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, and another inquiry was established under the act. So at this stage we saw the Commonwealth taking action to overrule one of the states in the belief that it was not acting in the best interests of a group of its own indigenous citizens. That inquiry that was commissioned by the then minister was undertaken by Professor Cheryl Saunders, who met with 35 of the Ngarrindjeri women, only four of whom claimed to have heard of the so&hyphen;called secret women's business. On receipt of her report the minister then placed a 25&hyphen;year protection order on the island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point I wish to make some observations on the manner of the defence of this position taken by the minister in particular, and the Labor Party in general. A public debate on indigenous heritage was generated and I think most of it was negative. As a member who spoke on this matter in 1994, I can remember the unsavoury style and the innuendo that was being attached to this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6650"> debate by the then government. The shadow minister, and I must say to his credit, has not indulged in the same sort of rhetoric and attacks that the previous minister used to undertake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, he had this stock phrase, `Never in all of my career have I&mdash;.' That would usually be the opening comment of some personal attack on anybody who had the temerity to actually challenge his actions as the minister. Any attempt to question the procedures adopted by the government was responded to with condemnation for being somebody incapable of understanding the situation of the Aboriginal people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the debate here at the time, I recollect the then minister claiming that a great many of the then opposition members, of which, at that time, I was one, had disparaged the spiritual beliefs of Aboriginal people in a way that they would never do in respect of non&hyphen;Aboriginal beliefs, be they Christian, Jewish, Islamic or other religious beliefs. He then claimed that we had exhibited attitudes implicitly based on racial superiority. This was the tone in which this debate was being conducted. The shadow minister ought not to shake his head because he was there at the time; he would know about this because no doubt it was discussed ad nauseam in the caucus room, as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time, I rejected and protested about this unfair and untrue allegation. With the benefit of time, we have been presented with the proof. We were dealing with a government that was too arrogant and too interested in political attacks not only to examine properly the details of this particular secret women's business, but also to do its job properly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister was being paid. He had the responsibility to perform his duties as the minister in a way that was conducive to fairness and proper due process. The patronising attitude of the minister was such that he knew what he wanted to find and he knew what action he wanted to take before the inquiries were called. The rest is history. The true story of the secret women's business did come out but, even then, the then minister, Mr Tickner, still refused to accept it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of this decision in South Australia was significant in terms of polarising public opinion and stimulating debate. Government co&hyphen;funding of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge project complicated the issue in the minds of taxpayers. The protection afforded by the act prevented construction on the island by prohibiting bulldozing, grading, drilling, excavating or any act done for the purpose of constructing a bridge in any part of the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect this action had on the construction was clearly dramatic. It had a dramatic effect on the Chapmans. Obviously, their project, which had already progressed to an extent that it had absorbed significant funding, was halted without prospect of renewal for at least 25 years. The financial effect of this was devastating. The psychological effect of it must have been pretty great too. However, the Chapmans continued to fight the Commonwealth, and they made successful appeals to the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I add for the benefit of the shadow minister that it is interesting, as I mentioned earlier, that none of this opposition to the project occurred while the Bannon government or the state Labor governments were in office. Apparently, while they were in office, it was not something that substantially stimulated opposition to the extent of asking the minister to undertake an order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of commitments made by the predecessor of Bannon or the state Labor governments, the state government of South Australia had inherited some substantial financial liabilities. In May 1995, media reports in South Australia claimed that the secret women's business was a fabrication. The controversy, fuelled by the delays and costs involved in this issue, caused the state government to appoint a royal commission to look into the secret women's business, its veracity and origins. The commission found that the business was a total fabrication. That view was supported by a group of courageous Ngarrindjeri women, known as the `dissident women'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, it found that the business had emerged in response to a need for the anti&hyphen;bridge lobby to provide something of sufficient cultural significance to warrant the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6651"> making of a declaration by the federal minister. The purpose of the fabrication was to prohibit construction of the bridge. Even so, notwithstanding the commission's findings, the then minister continued to fight all of the evidence and facts staring him in the face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He took an appeal to the full court of the Federal Court. That appeal was also dismissed in December 1995. As I have already said, the real scandal is that Mr Tickner was able to be conned into blocking the building of a bridge by information which was false. Then, having done so, he defended himself and his position, at enormous financial cost to the taxpayer, until the Labor government was removed from office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The handling of the matter has done significant damage to and has had a serious effect on the Aboriginal heritage debate. I have no doubt that public cynicism and resistance to claims for protection of legitimate heritage sites has been fuelled by the previous government's actions in this matter. No doubt it will contribute significantly to the native title debate in that state and others, because here we have seen a flagrant case of the use of a forgery in order to try not only to move public opinion and attack and damage the reputation of an honourable member of this House, but also as the basis of a decision of the minister to place a 25&hyphen;year prohibition on the construction of the bridge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Labor Party claimed to have a monopoly on looking after the interests of indigenous Australians, and yet it was prepared to seriously undermine public faith in the operation of the act designed to protect the heritage of the very same people. This occurred through poor judgment at senior levels in the government and an inability to accept that an error had been made. The former government defended the indefensible, at great cost to the taxpayer, until it finally lost office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The cost to the Commonwealth, apart from the financial expenditure on inquiries and court processes so far and the loss of confidence in the electorate at a time when native title claims are growing, will increase. There will be further costs and compensation resul ting from other litigation by those involved in the matter and I do not expect that this will be an inconsequential amount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The damage to the minister in the former government is obvious and self&hyphen;explanatory. I am confident that the handling of this issue, in conjunction with the Labor Party's other faults&mdash;the insensitive and irresponsible approach taken by the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, especially in the lead&hyphen;up to this year's election&mdash;had a profound effect on Labor's election result in South Australia. Not only did the then minister, Mr Tickner, lose his seat, but also in South Australia the Labor Party took a particularly savage beating and lost seats to the extent that now, from memory, the Labor Party has two seats and the Liberal Party has 10, which is an historical high&hyphen;water mark as far as the Liberal Party's election fortunes in South Australia are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The members of this parliament are now in a situation where we must act. There is no other option which can lead to any sort of satisfactory result. For those who are in any doubt I will list the main reasons in the time I have available to me. Unless we act in the way the government has decided there is not just the likelihood but the requirement for conducting yet another inquiry. After years of waiting, court cases and inquiries and expenditure of almost $6 million of taxpayers' money, I, and the great majority of Australians, are appalled at the prospect of another inquiry that could cost up to $1&half; million more. The time to act is now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the flawed procedural treatment received by the people involved in this matter there is a need for the government to stand back and deliver a just outcome. It would not be appropriate for the Commonwealth government to be driven to such a position through litigation. Justice should not be restricted just to the people involved in developing the Hindmarsh Island projects but also to the Ngarrindjeri women, both those who fabricated the central issue in this debate and those who had the courage to stand up and expose the fabrication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government needs to regain the confidence of the community in its dealings with <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6652"> indigenous heritage. To fail to do so will not serve the interests of any Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders in this country, and I believe that it should be a precursor to a review of the way in which we handle indigenous heritage and native title. The question of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge will go down as a sorry affair in Australian government. We must act now to adopt this bill if we are to avoid an even more sorry situation. I commend the government for taking the action to remedy this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will turn briefly, if I may, to the amendments proposed by the member for Banks. Unfortunately, I could not catch all of his speech last night because I was interrupted whilst listening to it. I try very hard to listen to his speeches because I believe he does make a sincere effort to present the views of his particular philosophical grouping in this place. I think that of all the members in the Labor Party, he is one of the most sincere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I must say that in the circumstances he is mistaken. The way in which he has conducted his party's interests in relation to the debate since the Labor Party lost government and has been in opposition has been suspect. Quite clearly, the Labor Party has a substantial problem in relation to the wash&hyphen;up of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge affair. Obviously, there are those who would like to stand and defend the indefensible, as I mentioned, but there are others who are much more ready to concede that they were dragged into this sorry affair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find both his second reading amendment and his amendment relating to the Racial Discrimination Act prevailing redundant. He might be able to advise us at some stage as to how any particular act, given the decision by the High Court in relation to the Racial Discrimination Act in the Mabo decision, that infringed the Racial Discrimination Act could be considered to be constitutional.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I conclude by reminding members of what I said at the beginning. This whole affair ranks with the Zinoviev letter&mdash;I think it came to light in the 1927 general election in the United Kingdom&mdash;as one of the great political forgeries in the English&hyphen;speaking world, if not all of the world. The silly thing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is that many of the members of the Labor Party who are now here were, as a consequence of the actions of Mr Tickner, made into accomplices to one of the most sorry and sordid affairs that this particular parliament has ever seen. All I can do is urge Labor Party members not only to acknowledge their sins in relation to this matter but also to ensure that the matter is speedily resolved. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In joining this debate on the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill 1996, I must admit I do not know whether I can be quite as charitable as the member for Moore (Mr Filing) in looking at the way the Labor Party has played politics and done some very sorry and sordid things over this whole Hindmarsh Island affair. Listening to what the member for Banks (Mr Melham) had to say, it reminded me a bit of the Bourbons. I think Labor has learnt nothing and forgotten nothing when it comes to approaching this whole issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Still, according to what the member for Banks has said, Labor has not even made up its mind how it is going to deal with this bill, which I find quite extraordinary. Does that mean that they are still confused? Does it mean they are embarrassed&mdash;probably not. Does it mean that it is another example of the sheer arrogance that brought them so undone on 2 March? Whatever it is, I think it really is a disgrace that the Labor Party has not been big enough to come in here and at least admit where it went so terribly wrong and the damage that it has done to so many people because of that. What has happened in the Hindmarsh Island affair is that we have seen a victory for truth. We saw how, when a minister started to interfere in state matters, he well and truly got his fingers burnt for that meddling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that really does come to mind is the appalling approach of the Labor Party towards this whole thing, and particularly towards anyone who raised any questions about what was being done. When anyone questioned the validity of some of the things that the minister was saying, the general response was to go straight into personal <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6653"> abuse. I really think the whole issue is a very appalling thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What amazes me about it all, though, is that, now that the truth has come out, now that those who had the courage to stand by the truth have come through, we still do not see the Labor Party being big enough to actually apologise, and not only to those Aboriginal women who had the courage to speak the truth. Instead, all we get is mealy&hyphen;mouthed insults and so on. Not only should the Labor Party be apologising to those very courageous women, they should be apologising to all Aboriginal people for what they have done. It really was a very tawdry affair. Not only did it bring the then minister into total disrepute but also it caused quite a lot of damage in relations with the wider community. There ought to be some accountability on the amount of money, over $6 million already, that has been spent on behalf of taxpayers over this whole tawdry affair for the minister to try again and again to suppress the truth. I think that this was utterly irresponsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Labor Party had any courage, if there were some real men or women amongst the Labor Party, they would have the decency to apologise to the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan). There were some outrageous things said about the member for Barker when he had the courage to stand up for the truth and see it through, and he has been vindicated totally. I guess this piece of legislation is the final chapter, but nonetheless I would have thought that the Labor Party would have had the decency to apologise on all those counts, if they were quite serious about their standing in the community and about the way they have approached this whole affair and the dreadful mess they have caused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been pointed out by other speakers, this bill should bring to an end a very shameful saga that occurred over recent years. There has been nothing but damage done by the whole approach of the Labor Party on this matter. Not only have there been great social costs but also, as I mentioned, there have been significant economic costs. If the opposition were to have its way, presumably we would be having yet another inquiry, and that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> could cost anything up to another $1&half; million, which was the cost of the Mathews inquiry as part of this whole saga.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of this bill is to prevent a declaration being made under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Protection Act 1984 in relation to the Hindmarsh Island Bridge. This should have occurred with a commonsense decision but when this affair is long behind us it will show that this government, and this minister, have acted properly. What it will show is that the previous government were totally inept, incompetent and were prepared to try and push for a travesty of justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been increasingly clear out of all this just how little understanding the Labor Party has of Aboriginal issues. We only have to look back to September. On 17 September the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) tabled the Mathews report. Soon we had the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs on radio saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not going to take a recommendation to shadow cabinet to support this. It hasn't got a chance at passing in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>Then he went on 4BC saying that this legislation would breach the Racial Discrimination Act but he forgot to check with his leader and at the same time Mr Beazley said in a doorstop when asked whether he supported it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I said we will take a look at it.</PARA>
<PARA>When he was questioned again he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to take a close look at it.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he was not prepared to back his own shadow minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it also shows is that after two and half years when all the facts and the truth have come out, Labor still does not know how to respond. What an appalling indictment on the whole of the former government. I suppose that is not altogether surprising when we look at the track record of Labor when it comes to Aboriginal affairs. After 13 years we look at some areas like, for example, health. We find that still the infant mortality rate is two to three times higher than for non&hyphen;Aboriginals in that area. The male life expectancy of Aboriginals is 16 to 18 years less than for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6654"> non&hyphen;Aboriginal males. Diabetes is four times higher in adults and the rate of smoking is double the national average.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at housing, after 13 years of Labor we still have problems such as 40 per cent of Aboriginal houses in rural areas needing repair or replacement. In October 1995, 120 remote Aboriginal communities lacked adequate water supply, 134 communities lacked appropriate sewage disposal and 250 communities had no electricity. Looking at education, from 1985 to 1992 the rise in retention rate to year 12 of indigenous students was 11 per cent below that of non&hyphen;Aboriginal students. In 1991 the proportion of 20&hyphen; to 24&hyphen;year&hyphen;old indigenous students at university was one&hyphen;third of that of non&hyphen;Aboriginals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Deputy Speaker, the Hindmarsh saga comes on top on a number of other sagas that we saw under the Labor administration. We had the Ros Kelly sports rorts saga; we had the great duel that went on between the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and his successor, Mr Keating, but I really think this saga topped them all. In February 1994 we had a report that was delivered to the South Australian government by Justice Jacobs which said, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women's business never arose.</PARA>
<PARA>On 23 May that year Professor Cheryl Saunders was appointed by the then Minister Tickner to report on the section 10 declaration. On 10 July the then Minister Tickner made the famous declaration banning construction of the bridge for 25 years. On 15 February 1995 there was a judicial review by the Federal Court that quashed the Tickner order but he was not going to give up. On 24 February he appealed the court ruling. On 19 July 1995 the South Australian royal commission into the Hindmarsh Island issue was set up, headed by Justice Stephens. On 13 November 1995, the royal commission concluded its hearings. There were 6,000 pages of evidence under oath and, extraordinarily, the proponents of the women's business did not even turn up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 7 December there was a quashing of Tickner's section 10 declaration by the Federal Court and on 19 December 1995 Justice <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Stephens delivered the report. I quote parts of the major findings:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The women's business emerged in response to a need of the anti&hyphen;bridge lobby to provide something of sufficient cultural significance to warrant the making of a declaration by the federal minister and the women's business was unknown to the 12 dissident Ngarrindjeri women who gave evidence to the commission and who were described by the royal commissioner as credible witnesses.</PARA>
<PARA>Looking at the whole of the evidence, including the history of events&mdash;the anthropological evidence and the evidence of the dissident women&mdash;the whole claim of the women's business from its inception was a fabrication: it was a fabrication. Clearly, the purpose of the fabrication was to obtain a declaration prohibiting the construction of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge under the Commonwealth's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just come back to that point: the whole claim of the women's business from its inception was a fabrication. It seems extraordinary that the minister was prepared to continue when it was so obvious to everyone but him. Yet, on 16 January 1996, Senator Crowley, who was a deputy for the then Minister Tickner, appointed Justice Mathews to report to her under section 10. On 11 April this year, Piper Alderman, solicitors in Adelaide, lodged a notice in the High Court on behalf of the dissident women questioning the validity of Justice Mathews's appointment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 30 June this year, the Mathews report was handed to Senator the Hon. John Herron, Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. On 24 July this year, Justice O'Loughlin lifted the stay order on the section 10&mdash;on the bridge. On 6 September this year, the High Court&mdash;nothing less than the High Court&mdash;determined six to one that Justice Mathews's appointment by Tickner was invalid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is just quite incredible when you look at that whole saga: it just went on and on and on. The minister getting it wrong and wrong and wrong, and always leaving the bill for someone else to pick up. So we have this extraordinary saga, this extraordinary bungle, and look at the damage it has done to so <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6655"> many people and look at all the other negative results from it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at the results of this dreadful bungle by the Labor Party, it was costly both economically and socially. In the social sense, it created distrust and animosity in the community. It was a despicable addition to an already appalling record in the administration of Aboriginal affairs and, of course, it did nothing for the cause of Aboriginal heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Economically, it cost the taxpayers $2 million alone for the royal commission, including legal aid. It cost $1&half; million for the Mathews inquiry, and add another $&half; million in legal aid granted by the Commonwealth through legal aid or through ATSIC. There was $1 million for the Federal Court case; $800,000 for the internal Commonwealth costs and the minister's costs on this matter; and $200,000 for the internal South Australian government costs&mdash;the two Draper reports, the state Aboriginal affairs internal costs and the minister's internal office costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One can only speculate as to what the possible implications would have been if this women's business decision had gone ahead. There are implications for mining, for development, for agriculture and, of course, there are the other costs. Look at the further increase in animosity that would have come through this. We are supposed to be working for the opposite; we are supposed to be working for reconciliation and here the Labor Party was doing everything it could to do the exact opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The voters in Australia realised what a dreadful thing it was and not only did they throw out the government, of course, they also threw out the minister himself. Just look at his court record on this. There were four court rulings: Tickner v. Bropho&mdash;all four judges against Tickner; Tickner v. Chapman&mdash;all four federal judges against; Tickner v. Douglas&mdash;all four judges against; and the High Court ruling on Judge Mathews's appointment&mdash;six from seven judges against. If you include the royal commissioner, 19 out of 20 of our senior judges ruled against the Labor government and against the then Minister Tickner.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even Tickner's attempt to get a favourable ruling from Justice Mathews was ruled invalid and her report stated that there was `insufficient material' to justify the argument that the area would be desecrated by building the bridge. Of course, the final arbiter for the people of Australia, Tickner versus the people of Hughes&mdash;11.4 per cent swing against. Now the seat of Hughes, of course, is represented by my colleague, the very effective Danna Vale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we ought to look at the aims of this bill itself. The bill is part of the overall coalition government plan of action for Aboriginal affairs. It is part of addressing some of those areas that I mentioned earlier. Over the next four years, this government will be spending an extra $97 million on Aboriginal health. We will be spending $23 million to open 35 additional Aboriginal medical clinics. There will be a 28 per cent increase in indigenous specific health programs. In the area of housing, over the next four years the Commonwealth government is going to spend $1,323 million on indigenous housing and infrastructure.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we look at the area of education. Over the next 12 months, the government is going to spend $344 million on indigenous education and training. But this bill itself is going to give support to the truth, to the real situation. It shows that Labor supported people who invented the women's business and refused to listen to anyone who disagreed with this. As Judge Stephens said after the South Australian royal commission:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I conclude that the whole claim of the women's business from its inception was a fabrication. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6656"> </PARA>
<PARA>What a damning indictment on the Labor Party. As I said earlier, I really think Labor ought to be doing a lot more in this. First of all, they ought to be apologising to those 14 Ngarrindjeri women who questioned the claims, who had the courage to come out and speak up for the truth. It should not be forgotten that, when they showed that courage, they faced threats and abuse from their opponents and they suffered the insult that the government of the day would not even listen to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that, if the Labor Party wanted to start to make amends, it ought to be supporting this bill. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) clearly knows that it would be wrong to suggest that the minister should have been allowed to use his discretionary powers over this whole question of the bridge. I would have thought it was important that the Labor Party start to recognise its mistakes before it faces yet another bout of claims from militant groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill ends the wasted time and money and it seeks, most importantly, to heal some of the divisions that were created by this whole sorry saga the Labor Party put together. But I do think that, as I say, Labor members ought to be coming clean on this. They ought to be man or woman enough to actually stand up and say, `Yes, we did get it wrong. Yes, we caused a lot of heartburn amongst many Australians, both Aboriginal and non&hyphen;Aboriginal.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because we are in this chamber, I would have thought that the other thing the Labor Party ought to have the decency to do is to unreservedly apologise to the member for Barker for what they tried to put him through. He has been totally vindicated in his stand on the whole matter. He has shown great courage against a lot of adversity in seeing this whole matter through and in helping to make sure that the truth did come out. I would have thought that he deserves full commendation for doing that and a full apology from the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have great pleasure in supporting this bill. I would hope that by the time this debate finishes the Labor Party can actually make up its mind and show that it is big enough to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> come out and support what it should have supported long ago and in fact admit that it got it totally wrong when Minister Tickner was in charge of this sorry saga.</PARA></SPEECH>

I do so because I think the amendment simply muddies the waters and serves no useful purpose. It also requires an act of trust by both politicians and the legal profession, both of which I find very difficult to accept.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have listened with interest to some of this debate. What was said by the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) was reminiscent of what was said by many other speakers. The truth is that many people in the Liberal Party were as confused as and as hooked on this nonsense as the members of the Labor Party, and those people are still a problem for the Liberal Party. I do not have to identify them because the Liberal Party knows very well who they are. They are an impediment to Aboriginal advancement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also listened with interest to the member for Wannon talking about the intention of the government to increase their funding in the area of Aboriginal affairs. In many of the areas in which they intend to increase the funding they will simply compound the problem, not solve it. I have said before in this place that Aboriginal medical services are an expensive way of delivering inferior services. If we are genuinely interested in the delivery of services to Aboriginal people, we should be looking at the best form of delivery. It is certainly not through the feuding family fiefdoms that we have set up with the Aboriginal medical services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of Aboriginal housing, until an effort is made to involve Aboriginal people in the construction and ownership of their own houses, we are never going to be able to build enough houses to overcome the acute housing shortage. Until we do that, we cannot address the problems of Aboriginal affairs, which I believe are related to housing, hygiene, health, education, training and employment. If we miss out even one of them, the wheels will fall off the cart and we will not make any <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6657"> progress. That does not seem to be comprehended. People on both sides of the House are still talking about land as though land were some key objective in Aboriginal advancement, when quite clearly that is white nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In speaking on this bill, I must say that I believe that Dorothy Wilson and the people who stood with her are great Australians and should be recognised as heroes. What they did was extremely difficult. I know how difficult it is in this House to buck party discipline. I have voted for things I did not agree with simply because it was much easier than bucking the party system&mdash;although I think I have probably bucked it more than most. It is terribly difficult. The effort and intellectual courage that was required by those women was enormous. I believe that Australia owes a great deal of respect to those women. I hope that those women are honoured in the annals of Australian history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been suggested that Mr Tickner did not know what he was doing. The truth is that Tickner knew exactly what he was doing. That is where the damnation of the then minister lies. On several occasions as a minister he said to me, `I am a minister without portfolio. Keating and ATSIC have all the power.' I told my Aboriginal people that and, frankly, they did not believe me. Tickner went to Fitzroy Crossing and told them the same thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Dickey Cox hit the nail on the head when he said, `Why are you taking the money?' It was quite clear that Tickner was prepared to go along with these things, pandering to a constituency which he thought was important, a constituency made up of a very small elite who had these views. As it is almost question time, I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later date.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Finance. Is the minister aware of policy objectives for the privatisation of publicly owned assets that differ from the objectives announced by the government? What role will privatisation play in assisting Telstra to succeed in the global market for telecommunications?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="6660" SPEAKER="Fahey, John, MP" NAMEID="HQ5" ELECTORATE="Macarthur" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Finance" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HQ5">Mr FAHEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. It has long been the view of the coalition that the primary role of government is to foster and promote a climate of equitable opportunity, to provide for those in our community who cannot provide for themselves and to regulate where necessary the activities of the private sector. They were the policies that the coalition took to the community prior to 2 March and for which we received overwhelming support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reasons for our privatisation policies and the reasons they received overwhelming endorsement from the electorate include a number of things. They include a recognition of the fact that it brings about a significant reduction of government debt and the interest obligation that is attached to it, it brings about improved efficiency and quality of service, it brings an incentive and provides for the maximising of corporate performance, and it gives a chance to the ordinary people of Australia to invest in shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For years the Labor Party platform demanded resolute defiance of the idea of government selling assets. It was a sop for those in the Labor Party, the rank and file, and the executive wing of the ALP never took any notice of that. This government has made it clear that there is no Labor Party-styled dash for cash involved in our privatisation objectives because the proceeds of asset sales will not be used by this government to artificially inflate the budget bottom line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was encouraged when I read the speech delivered by the Leader of the Opposition to the National Press Club in August 1994. No-one on this side of the House would object to anything stated in that speech. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The primary objective driving the privatisation program is to make Australia an efficient, internationally competitive economy&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6661"> </PARA>
<PARA>of course we agree with that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and that means introducing competition into our enterprises and into our market sectors.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on in that speech to say that privatisation creates jobs&mdash;we hear a great deal about jobs from that side of the House. The Leader of the Opposition indicated that privatisation supports that. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The "net gain" can take many forms: potentially better services and lower prices for consumers; stronger enterprises and greater competition for our economy; and in the broader sense, making government funds available for new policy.</PARA>
<PARA>They are fine words and there are no arguments from government members about any of those objectives. Unfortunately, we saw&mdash;and history will show this; history already shows this&mdash;that the sale of government assets by Labor was simply a ruse to hide the need to take the cash to cover its deficit addiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was a little disturbed to see last week that there has been a change clearly in policy on the part of the opposition. In the debate in another place in respect of the CFM bill, the now spokesperson on privatisation made a number of statements. He indicated that there were six tests which must apply for privatisation. He indicated that the principles that allowed the Labor Party to support the sale of CFM was that CFM operates in a competitive market. The reason they were not prepared to support the partial sale of Telstra, according to the spokesperson, was the market for Telstra was not competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where has the Labor Party been? Does it not recognise the fact that, as from 1 July next year, Telstra moves into a deregulated market. There is no regulation. It has to operate very much in full&hyphen;blooded, unhindered competition. That is exactly the reason why the government argues the need for the partial sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is so that Telstra can survive in a deregulated market. It will give Telstra greater opportunity to emulate the sort of deal that the former government owned British Telecom has just done in merging with the US phone company MCI. Glenda Korporaal in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> said&mdash;I think this is a very valid point:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A domestically-focused, government-owned BT could never have dreamed of pulling off the megadeal British Telecom has put its name to over the weekend. It's not just the financial ability for a merger provided by a stockmarket listing; it is the whole gamut of operational efficiencies made possible by being freed of political masters and the more entrepreneurial, competitive leading-edge managerial culture which is allowed to develop in a corporation that reports to shareholders rather than politicians.</PARA>
<PARA>The other five tests given by the spokesman in respect of privatisation are just as confusing. But they come down to a simple little policy, which clearly the Labor Party supports, that there ought to be funds put into providing for the services that can be best done by the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that jobs can be created through the sale of government assets in the appropriate circumstances. In respect of Telstra, the competitive edge that will be there from 1 July next year demands&mdash;not simply puts the question&mdash;that Telstra gets out there and gives a service to the community, at the same time allowing government to retire debt and allowing for the best environmental program in this nation's history to be implemented.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. As most members would be aware, this morning the Reserve Bank of Australia announced that it would cut the official cash rate by 50 basis points, to 6.5 per cent. Already I am aware of three of the major banks that have announced a reduction in the standard variable mortgage interest rate by 50 basis points. When this government was elected, the standard variable rate was 10.5 per cent. As a result of the reductions that have taken place today, the standard variable mortgage rate is 8.75 per cent. For an Australian on an average mortgage that represents a saving in interest of $145 a month. There is nothing that makes this government prouder than being able to deliver to the families of Australia benefits of that kind in a reduction in home mortgage rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that said it would stand by the battlers and the families of Australia; and today this government delivers again. This government has now delivered a 1&frac34; per cent reduction, $145 a month&mdash;after tax&mdash;on the average mortgage to the average Australian family. Nobody in Australia could greet this as other than unqualified good news. It is a disappointment to us to see the Labor Party so churlish in the face of such a great achievement. `Good news,' the Acting Leader of the Opposition says sotto voce across the table but he cannot go out to the media and say `good news'. He does not have it in him to congratulate the government on its performance. All he can do is go out and talk in Kerinesque&hyphen;speak about deeming rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do want to make another point in relation to this: when one takes into account not only the standard variable mortgage rate but the average rate, including fixed term rates, basic rates and honeymoon rates&mdash;which means the average mortgage rate paid by the average Australian, taking into account mortgage originators&mdash;one sees that the average rate paid by the Australian home buyer today is now at its lowest level since 1974. We are now back at pre&hyphen;Whitlam levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess that when we think of all the damage that was done to the Australian economy by the Whitlam government, one of the proudest boasts of this government will be that in this area, at least, it can undo the damage of the Whitlam government and return Australians to the opportunities they had before the prices&hyphen;wages spiral of the failed Whitlam government in 1974. We concede that it will take a long time to undo the damage that was done in relation to the current account, to undo the damage that was done in relation to foreign debt and to undo the damage that was done in relation to Commonwealth debt. It will take us years to turn those things around; but today we can stand and say to the Australian public that these are the best opportunities since 1974.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can point out to Australian families not only the benefits in relation to home loans but that the family tax initiative on 1 January will give families the opportunity for tax relief in relation to their children and the opportunity <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6663"> for a good Christmas and a better New Year, opportunities which could only have been dreamt about under the failed Labor administrations.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are some very weak interjections, Mr Speaker. I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. It is a very important question. Let me just make it perfectly clear that this government does stand committed to a substantial aid program which does assist with the reduction of poverty through sustainable development. Our aid program addresses, in particular, humanitarian concerns for those people who live in great poverty and obviously, to some extent, it does promote our national interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that there are varying degrees of public opinion on the issue of overseas development assistance. But I think many Australians feel very strongly about making a contribution, including making one directly themselves, to those who are disadvantaged around the world. Many Australians, for example, have been able to express their genuine concern for the plight of others by giving to the work of Australian non-government organisations. These non-government organisations are, at the moment, looking at responding to the emergency that is taking place in Zaire. I have already announced to the House that I have called upon NGOs to put proposals to me for rapid response to that emergency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important that the debate be properly understood and that it is perfectly clear that many Australians wish to provide humanitarian assistance. They wish to give to people who are very substantially disadvantaged. The scenes we see on television night after night in Zaire are the sorts of scenes that, I think, do generate a great deal of compassion amongst the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say though that there has been since the election, and indeed well before, a considerable debate in Australia about the issue of development assistance. One of the contributors to that debate who has gone unheard of is none other than the member for Canberra, who very recently addressed a forum I think here in Canberra. The speech he made regrettably did not get the publicity that, in my view, it deserved. So I brought it along with me to question time today because it is important that we know what the Labor Party thinks about development assistance and what <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6664"> the Labor Party thinks about government spending and taxes&mdash;not just talking behind closed doors, but making sure that what they say behind closed doors becomes publicly known.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us take just one of the remarks made by the member for Canberra&mdash;and he is a member of the shadow cabinet. He said to this aid seminar:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Like most of you here, I've been making speeches about 0.7&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>meaning the target of aid to GDP of 0.7 per cent&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I've been making these speeches for as long as I can remember. But we are being blunt amongst friends today&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is code for `at least no-one will report on this'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think we've wasted our time.</PARA>
<PARA>So now we know that, despite all your advocacy&mdash;and, in particular, the advocacy of the member for Holt, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition&mdash;of 0.7 per cent, you always believed that you were just completely wasting your time. But what I think is particularly revealing about the speech of the member for Canberra was when he said&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think you will all be interested to hear this, because I do not think many of you were there. Gordon Bilney, the former member for Kingston, was there. He was there&mdash;he who was the minister for development assistance whom you were all defending furiously up until 2 March. He was arguing that aid to Papua New Guinea should be reduced from over $300 million to $50 million. Is this the position of the Labor Party? Is this an entirely credible position? You will not even deny the argument of the former minister. The Labor Party's position, we conclude, is that aid to Papua New Guinea be reduced from around $320 million to $50 million. I am sure Sir Julius Chan will be interested to hear that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Canberra, of course, is a member of the shadow cabinet. He went on in his speech to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the tax revenue stays as low as it is, if the commitment to public expenditure in Australia <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stays as low as it is . . . if those two things happen, we will not get a significant increase in the aid debate. It is not possible. It does not add up. You cannot go on and say, `We are going to take it off all other levels of expenditure.' It has to be part of the broader debate. That is one reason why we are losing.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the member for Canberra is saying: the Labor Party is about increased outlays and increased tax. If he denies that, you will have to ask yourself one question: why in that speech in relation to those remarks did the member for Canberra say:</PARA>

Over the next four years, the total Commonwealth spending on government schools will be an additional $2.3 billion over the amount that government schools would be receiving if the 1996 funding levels were maintained over that period.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think that blue&hyphen;collar Australians who have a stake in the businesses of Australia will have not only incentives to see them profitable, not only incentives to see Australian industry perform and improve, but also the opportunity to secure for themselves the kind of financial independence this government would like to see.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The value of shares or rights that can be exempt under a qualifying employee share scheme will be doubled from $500 to $1,000. The employee participation requirement for a qualifying employee share scheme will be eased from three-quarters to two-thirds of permanent employees. These are measures to give $15 million worth of benefits to the blue&hyphen;collar workers of Australia so they can invest in the companies that employ them. This will be good for the employees concerned. This will be good for industrial relations. This will be good for company profitability.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government which is committed to the blue&hyphen;collar employees of Australia.

Our commitment to blue&hyphen;collar Australia is not only a commitment to give them a stake in the companies of Australia but also a commitment to give them a stake in their homes with high affordability, to give them a stake in low interest rates, to give them a family tax initiative, which gives them recognition of the costs of raising children, to give blue&hyphen;collar Australia the kind of opportunity that the Labor Party could never ever develop.</PARA>

Can the Prime Minister confirm that Max Moore-Wilton is receiving payment of more than $200,000 from his various public sector positions?

Yes, I am indeed concerned about the failure to meet the recruitment targets. Indeed, we have met only 92 per cent of the targets that were set. I am sorry to say that navy is the worst in relation to this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are several problems that lead to targets for recruitment not being met. One of the first is that separation rates remain far too high, which in turn leads to the establishment of higher enlistment rates. There is also the fact that we need to recruit technical and professional personnel at higher standards of recruitment because of the tasks that are now required to be undertaken.</PARA>

I go back to the question I was asked, which is an important one, and it relates to meeting the recruitment targets for the ADF in order that we may keep a self-reliant defence force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other problems is that inquiry rates are down. Part of this problem is due entirely to the former government, in particular, the Price report. One of the difficulties in recruiting cadets for ADFA is the fact that the Price report said that undergraduates should be excluded from ADFA. We have entirely rejected that report and, of course, undergraduates will continue to be taken into ADFA. There is a further problem: the target population from whom we recruit, that is, 17&hyphen; to 24-year-olds, is in fact smaller than it was. Indeed, more of them are going on to higher <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> education and, therefore, fewer of them are available for recruitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are some of the problems. So what are some of the remedies? The first thing is that we are putting a high priority on effective marketing, advertising and an increased public relations program. I might add that one of the first things we will be doing there is to counter what the previous government did, and that was to say that a career in the ADF is merely an introduction to what may be your final career. We say it is important to bring yourself into the Australian Defence Force as someone who is committed to a long-term career.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are further putting together packages which are in accordance with six initiatives, and they are software packages for ADF employment opportunities in secondary schools, new advisory kits for secondary schools, improving access to work experience in the ADF, increased focus on cadet units, the placement of recruiting information on the Internet and sponsorship of national youth sport championships.</PARA>

Firstly, he implied that the statement was made behind closed doors in some way that is designed to be secret, whereas, in fact, it was a public meeting. More than 100 people attended. It was tape recorded and the transcript was released and one of the co-speakers on the panel was the foreign affairs correspondent for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, when I suggested that those people, including me, who had previously advocated 0.7 per cent GDP and the ODA to GDP ratio had wasted our time, he implied in some way that I had therefore not been genuine in my advocacy of that cause. I am simply advising those people that I felt that they and I had been pursuing a goal that was no longer capable of being achieved realistically in Australia. That was the point I was making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, he implied that I had advocated dramatic changes in tax and revenue. I did say to an interest group&mdash;perhaps they did not wish to receive the message&mdash;that you cannot advocate increased expenditure in one area without addressing the comprehensive issues of the rates of expenditure and tax in the community as a whole.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am actually developing a kind of admiration for the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp). You really have to be astounded by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6675"> the sheer audacity of his misrepresentations where funding decisions are concerned. Last Friday, the minister put out a press release claiming that, as a result of his government's decisions, funding for schools in total for the four years of the forward estimates will go up $1.5 billion. Apparently something pretty significant happened over the weekend, because by last night the increase for government schools alone had gone up to $2.3 billion. There has been increase of $800 million in four days. By jeez, if things keep going at this rate, before long funding for education will consume half the gross domestic product&mdash;that is, if we are to take these sorts of propositions seriously, which of course we do not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that it is simply preposterous and absurd for this minister to lump together incremental payments through grants to the states that are the result of standing arrangements to index for enrolment changes, price movements and other factors. These are standard arrangements which are in place and which produce the overwhelming bulk of the increases he has been talking about. All he has done to produce this $2.3 billion figure is take the total amount going to the states either through direct payments or through financial assistance grants, take every nominal increase over the past four years, add it all together, quadruple count the whole thing and then claim that it is the result of his benign carriage of the portfolio and the government's concern about education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is ridiculous. The analogy would be if I, when I was Minister for Social Security, had taken all the increases in pensions over the next four years which will flow through as a result of normal indexation arrangements and had tried to present them as some sort of massive discretionary increase in funding that I was making available for age pensioners to improve their circumstances in real terms. It is just nonsense&mdash;and he knows full well that it is nonsense. He really ought not undermine the quality of public debate on education issues by going around making those claims. I have to say that there are some people in the media&mdash;for example, one of the writers for the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>&mdash;who actually bought the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> story hook, line and sinker. But, fortunately, most members of the media are sufficiently sophisticated to see through that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has made a whole range of claims. He seems to be relying on a lot of material which is contained in a submission that his department made to the Senate Employment, Education and Training Committee, which was presented last Friday. On that day, the minister issued his press release claiming a $1.5 billion increase. He has gone on to say, amongst other things, that when you put it all together, Commonwealth per capita assistance for government school students is going up 17.9 per cent and the per capita increase for non&hyphen;government school students is going up 14.9 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That sounds very attractive on the face of it, but what is the reality underlying that? There are four major things wrong with this piece of analysis that the minister has presented. Obviously, firstly, we are not talking about real increases. The fact is, as I said, these adjustments are indexed to the schools cost index and the figures represent a nominal, not real, increase. Secondly, if you look at the table from the department's submission, there is a little footnote on calculating the amount going through to the states via financial assistance grants, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Assumed state fiscal contributions, 1996 Premiers Conference do not affect FAGs funding for schools.</PARA>
<PARA>How on earth you can attribute, on the one hand, 24 per cent of financial assistance grants to the states to schools and then say that if you lop that in effectively by $1.5 billion over three years it has no bearing on the capacity of states to fund their schools? It is just absolutely ludicrous.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. It is just a ridiculous proposition and the states themselves have repudiated this in no uncertain terms, both conservative and Labor states. If I could quote a Queensland Treasury official who gave evidence to the Senate committee last Friday, Mr W. Ivessa, Assistant Under Secretary, Treasury Department, Queensland, says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6676">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are under pressure from the fact that Commonwealth general purpose funding to Queensland and other states has been reduced in real terms as a result of that Premiers Conference. So those compounding impacts, plus the potential impact of this enrolment benchmark adjustment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the reduction in funding for government schools which was announced as part of the budget&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will have a substantial impact and will force government to look at the level of service provision in education and other areas.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that these decisions must constrain the capacity of states to do as much as they might otherwise have done in the education area. It is very good if states in a particular year raise their total education expenditures despite these cuts by the Commonwealth, but the fact is that their capacity to do more is obviously constrained by the cuts in effective funding that this government has imposed through this FAGs reduction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from the FAGs reduction, there are four points I want to make on these claims about the rate of growth of funding for government and non&hyphen;government school pupils. Firstly, it is not a real increase. Secondly, no account has been taken of the effect of the FAGs cut. Thirdly, I come to this so&hyphen;called enrolment benchmark adjustment. This is the reduction in recurrent funding for government schools which is said to be a consequence of the windfall saving to the states arising from the movement of each child from the government to the non&hyphen;government sector. There is no argument that there is a certain amount of savings flowing from that. That point is not in dispute. What is in dispute is the amount of that saving and its relationship to the amount that has been taken off the states through the enrolment benchmark adjustment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New South Wales government, for one, have argued cogently that the way this amount has been calculated is fundamentally flawed. They make the point&mdash;and it is an unarguable point&mdash;that you cannot simply equate the average cost difference to the states of a child in a government and a non&hyphen;government school with the marginal saving arising from enrolment drift from one to the other. Government school systems have to sustain a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> very substantial amount of overheads, both at the system level and at the individual school level. That point has been made and the New South Wales officials have quantified their argument and have set out the savings which are, in practice, realisable and which, they argue&mdash;and their case has not been refuted&mdash;are substantially less than is being presumed by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New South Wales government have argued that point in detail. Their position was explicitly supported by Queensland Treasury officials at the hearings on Friday. Other states such as Western Australia and a number of the others have stated quite clearly that they do not accept the Commonwealth's position on this. That is the third point&mdash;the spurious windfall saving that is being claimed. There is some saving, but it is not accurately reflected in the amount being taken off the states by the enrolment benchmark&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, the New South Wales officials argue that they are out of pocket to the tune of $20 to $30 million as a result of this. That is the net upshot of the whole thing. The final point I make is that, even allowing for all of these things&mdash;we are talking about the capacity of states to support government and non&hyphen;government schools&mdash;I think it is very important to look at what the states, in practice, have been doing. If you look at what happened over the years 1988&hyphen;89 to 1993&hyphen;94, a very interesting position emerges and one which I think supports the concerns about the impact of this government's decisions on the relative funding circumstances of government schools compared with non&hyphen;government schools.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have asked the Parliamentary Library to analyse the relevant statistical documents relating to the funding of schools over this particular period and the picture that emerges is pretty disturbing, I would have to say, when you look at what has been going on over a period of years. I seek leave to incorporate a table which is based on the work by researchers in the Parliamentary Library.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6677">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave not granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr PETER BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh, Mr Openness! The man who is concerned about the cult of secrecy does not want to incorporate this table! You've got a whole department of state to assist you in refuting any claims contained in this table. Why don't you want it incorporated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> ? These figures are not absolutely right&mdash;I have a note from the researcher&mdash;because some of the adjustments are made not in terms of the schools cost index but he used the gross non&hyphen;farm product price deflator which makes a slight difference, but the broad picture will no doubt be accurate. He makes the point that from 1988&hyphen;89 to 1993&hyphen;94, total state spending per student in government schools has gone up one per cent a year on average.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you turn to the Commonwealth, the average annual increase in recurrent funding for students is 7.9 per cent. Overall for government schools as a whole, when you combine both Commonwealth and states, you are looking at 1.8 per cent as the average increase in funding per student each year. If you turn to non&hyphen;government schools, by contrast, you find that Commonwealth funding per student on average over this period has gone up 4.3 per cent but state outlays have gone up 7.4 per cent. So you have 7.4 per cent average annual increase in recurrent grants by the states for students in non&hyphen;government schools contrasting with one per cent for government schools. This is the pattern we are seeing. As I pointed out, the states capacity to fund increases is being reduced as a result of the cuts from the Premiers Conference but, even apart from that, in practice the states have tended to fund a growth rate in funding for non&hyphen;government schools which exceeds that for government school students by quite a substantial margin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister at various times has tried to argue that the incentive for cost shifting will be reduced as a result of his measures and that therefore, if anything, the actions that this government is taking might retard the flow from the government to the non&hyphen;government sector. That, of course, is belied by the basis on which his own budgetary calculations are done. His budget calculations assume that, as <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a result of his budget decisions, there will be a further shift to the non&hyphen;government sector over and above that which would have otherwise occurred. That is the only way that the policy to abolish the new schools program can produce a cost of $150 million. That cost occurs if the average cost to the Commonwealth of a student in a non&hyphen;government sector is greater than in the government sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no good for him to argue or to seek to imply that, because of changed cost&hyphen;shifting incentives, the flow from the government to the non&hyphen;government system is in some way going to be stemmed. That is explicitly belied by the very basis on which the calculations and costings of his budget measures have been done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Returning to the overall picture, if you look at what the impact of this government's decisions has been, the reality is, as I pointed out in question time, that his own department estimates the impact in outturn terms of his budget decisions on the schools program over the next four years of the forward estimates is a total of $128 million extra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact of a $1.5 billion cut in FAGs is to diminish the capacity of the states to support government school students by close to $400 million. If you put those two elements together, the undeniable result is that the capacity of state governments to support their government school students has been diminished unambiguously and significantly as a result of the totality of decisions taken thus far by this government. That is the undeniable reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no good the minister talking about what the states do. If the states had more financial capacity you would not be seeing the sorts of things that you are seeing in Victoria&mdash;continuing school closures and merges. The capacity of states to support government schools has been clearly diminished as a result of what this government has done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6678"> The minister tries to say that the abolition of new schools policy is all about ideology. Just about everybody&mdash;whether in the government or the non-government sector, whether they be Catholic or Anglican&mdash;with responsi bility for operating major school systems acknowledges the importance of some element of planned educational provision. The minister would have us accept that he is transferring that responsibility to the states. It is manifestly obvious that the states do not have a framework in place that can substitute for the role played by the new schools policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The registration requirements vary enormously from state to state. The DEETYA officials who gave evidence to Senate estimates after the budget made it clear that those requirements varied from the almost non&hyphen;existent to requirements which at least have some degree of substance to them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a debate which really shows how the case that has been put by the Labor Party of constant disinformation and fear talk directed at parents in government schools is collapsing before our very eyes. When confronted by the true facts that the government has presented, there is nothing of substance which the Labor Party can put down to substantiate its claim that government schools will be worse off as a result of the funding decisions taken by the government in the budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regret very much the campaign of disinformation that has been waged by the opposition, because it can only confuse parents, can only confuse people in the government school system and can only be to the detriment of those people wishing to make decisions about the future schooling of their children. I want to reassure parents today that the result of the government's budget decisions is that government schools will be better funded as a result of the budget and that there will be significant <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6679"> increases over the next four years in per capita funding on our best estimates for students in government schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We estimate that Commonwealth funding for government schools, taking into account both the specific purpose grants to the states and the financial assistance grants to the states, will increase by some 17 per cent over the next four years. That contrasts with the increase for non-government students of 14 per cent. That funding includes the whole range of factors which will influence funding over the next four years. These figures are in outturn prices. They include a supplementation and, therefore, provide a fairly realistic picture of the funding position for government schools through Commonwealth funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister has constantly made the point since the budget that the reductions to the financial assistance grants agreed to at the Premiers Conference will impact very severely on government school funding. There is absolutely no evidence to support this. It is a purely hypothetical argument that is being put forward here. When we look at the actual state budgets that have been brought down, it appears that the states have decided to absorb these reductions in other areas because the overall funding for schools through the state budgets has increased by some 6.37 per cent. That is the factual matter: funding for government schools has increased in state budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party relies on the complaints that the states have made in submissions to the Senate against some of the budget decisions. The budget decision they are objecting to is the decision in relation to the enrolment benchmark adjustment, which will adjust Commonwealth funding to the states according to the flow of students between the government and non-government school sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We take the not very surprising attitude that we should fund students where they are. If students are in the non-government sector, we fund them there. If students are in the government sector, we fund them there. If the respective shares of the total number of students of those two sectors alters, that inevitably affects the funding that is provided.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The movement of a student from the government sector to the non-government sector produces a saving of some $3,400 on average. Over the last 10 years or so, the states have obtained a windfall gain of something like $3 billion as a result of the movements which took place under the previous government's policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have none of this nonsense that these purported defenders of government schools have actually defended government schools in any effective way because, during the whole period of the new schools policy, the flow of students from government to non-government schools sped up. One of the reasons it sped up may well be a result of the very significant financial incentive that states had to encourage this flow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We propose to half that incentive. The Labor Party in its usual confused way wants to amend our legislation in the Senate to double that incentive for the states to encourage the movement of students from government to non-government schools. It is simply unable to think straight in this matter. It is not at all surprising that the state governments have taken the attitude that they would prefer to retain the whole savings from this cost shifting exercise rather than half of the savings. It is no wonder at all that state treasuries are complaining to the Senate that they might be better off if the Commonwealth had not taken a decision to allocate this saving between the Commonwealth and the states instead of allowing the entire saving to accrue to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also worth making the point that this shift in enrolments has the effect of increasing the funds available for government school students per student. New South Wales has put in a particular complaint about this because its system is less flexible than those which exist in the other states. It tells us it is unable to recover the savings that other states have been able to recover. That is a matter for New South Wales to look at very closely. It has admitted in its submission that there is a saving attached to this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have a series of decisions which will greatly improve the funding available for government schools over the next four years <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6680"> with a specific emphasis on improving the resources available for literacy and for vocational education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The poor shadow minister for education is complaining that we seem to use different figures on different occasions. He finds this confusing. If he just read the budget papers carefully, he would have no difficulty in following us through these papers. The $1.5 billion additional extra spending relates to the total spending on schools through the specific purpose grants program for schools. The $2.3 billion additional spending relates to the combined impact of the specific purpose grants program and the financial assistance grants, which have been allocated on the basis of a very standard distribution that has been identified by the Grants Commission over the last few years of some 24 per cent to education through those grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister got up today and said, `Isn't the net effect of all these decisions $128 million?' That is not the case. I thought he was referring to the enrolment benchmark adjustment, which is $128 million, but it turns out that he is confusing that with a figure related to a limited series of budget initiatives.</PARA>

I would like to make some comments in this debate in a broader context about the future of govern <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ment schools and their importance in Australian education&mdash;because this government is the true defender of government schools. It is the true defender of government schools because, unlike the previous government, not only has it put aside the funds that will improve the position of every student in government schools over the next four years but it has put in place a comprehensive strategy to rebuild the faith of Australian parents in government schools.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have no desire to see one sector or another sector grow. Our concern is that all Australian children have access to high quality schools. Parent choice is a particular concern of ours because the ability of parents to choose their school is one of the most powerful incentives within the school arrangements in this country for the improvement of quality and the monitoring of performance of schools. It is just as powerful an incentive and just as powerful a monitoring device within the government school sector between government schools as it is between government and non&hyphen;government schools, and within the non&hyphen;government school sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sad thing is that the attitude taken to government schools by the Labor Party over the previous 13 years was one which essentially was an ideological position which said that whether schools are performing or not we are going to try to stop parents determining that fact and then reduce their capacity to choose the best school for their child. The Labor Party put in place decisions which impacted particularly severely on low income families, on the battling families, because under their new schools policy they said that if a new low fee school was established to cater for low income families, they would not fund that school according to its real needs; they would fund that school only up to category six which, the experts would know, is only a moderate government funding category. They denied that school the level of funding to which it would normally have been entitled, given its level of resources and the children who went to it. The shadow minister at the table has no answer to that because he knows it is true. So the decision impacted&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a fraud the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) is! The Commonwealth needs to have a national perspective in schools, yet the coalition has always run away from its responsibility. I ask the minister: what about the headland speech in June last year when your now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will revert to the practice of former coalition governments of winding back section 96 for specific grants to the states.</PARA>
<PARA>What about your now Treasurer (Mr Costello)? He said that federal involvement in school education results in waste and duplication. Tell the truth, Minister: you just simply want to walk away from education&mdash;and the community out there is beginning to know it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 23 October in my electorate of Port Adelaide, the Mayor of Hindmarsh Woodville called together a public meeting&mdash;and this is quite unusual in my electorate&mdash;to oppose the South Australian government's intention to close the Findon Primary School. But the mayor had much more on his mind than just that. Currently, the Findon Primary School has about 175 students, is sited on five hectares and, with the continued trend of near city living, is more than a viable concern for the near future. However, the mayor, John Dyer, instinctively knew the closure of Findon could be the beginning of a campaign that would put existing government and non-government schools in his municipality at risk. His instincts are correct and his leadership is outstanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this public meeting, attended by well over 200 people in the Woodville Town Hall, the mayor, John Dyer, invited Rob Lucas, South Australian Minister of Education&mdash;he likes you, and we will get back to him in a minute&mdash;Carolyn Pickles, South Australian shadow minister for education, Mick Atkinson, the local MP, parent representatives and me to address the community concerns. Surprise, surprise, Minister! The state minister failed to stay. He left the meeting early, even before having giving us the courtesy of listening to the parent representatives, let alone the state and federal MPs. The reasons <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6682"> for his doing this were obvious&mdash;and I will come to them later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The state minister wanted in no way to be associated with this minister or this government and what they are doing to schools and have them compared with what the federal Labor government did in the past. He knows that his state government is getting into quicksand&mdash;and he mentioned this a little later which, again, I will come back to. Those things with which he did not want to be associated are the abolition of the new schools policy; the enrolment benchmark adjustment; the $1.5 billion cut in untied grants; and the very real, and irresponsible, risk that you are going to bring up again the very poisonous debate of state aid. That is your contribution, isn't it, Minister. You just stonewall. You think that by repeatedly stonewalling, untruths will become a reality for you. Well, you are in for a few shocks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before focusing on those three matters, it is illuminating to briefly examine the record of the former Labor government and contrast that with what this government is doing, which amounts to the creation of a two-tiered system of education. Under Labor direct funding to schools, both government and non-government, increased by nearly 58 per cent in real terms. That growth, real growth, would have continued under Labor with commitments of an extra $395 million for schools, including $120 million on new capital funding for government schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By contrast, this government went to the last election with a slogan for all of us which, as far as education went, essentially said, `Steady as she goes, she'll be right.' You tell that story to universities and university students now; they do not have the same view. You tell that story to TAFEs in Australia, and you will get a very different response. You tell that story to teachers and parents in government schools, and you will get a very different response.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The arguments put up by the government in support of the abolition of the new schools policy are very illuminating. If it is to create a two-tiered system of education, it is no more than malicious intent. If it is to create so-called choice, then it amounts to just simply blatant incompetence. Labor's new schools policy allowed for the orderly development of non-government schools, without the wastage of resources and duplication. Do you remember your Treasurer saying that last year? In areas of growth, funding was approved. In areas of non-growth or declining enrolments, of course funding was rejected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A review of this policy by Professor Ken McKinnon used the term `residualisation'. You used that term last night, didn't you, Minister? Well, I will tell you: the parents in my electorate know what residualisation means. It means `disappear'. The people in Victoria, your home state, know what it means. It means `disappear', you are not wanted. It means a government walking away from its responsibility in a free, democratic society to the democratic principle of universal access to a government school.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6683">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All schools should be properly resourced. State governments, the principal source of funding for government schools, have not kept pace with the Commonwealth in recent years in financial support for schools. In regard to government schools in particular, the direct Commonwealth contribution amounts to only 12 per cent anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Education in South Australia, Mr Lucas, in answer to a question yesterday from Carolyn Pickles, the shadow minister, said this about enrolment benchmark adjustment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have indicated that the South Australian government does not support a completely free market for schools in South Australia&mdash;or in Australia for that matter. The notion of a laissez-faire environment for the establishment of new schools is not one that the South Australian government supports a position where the new schools policy is abolished and nothing replaces it.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a bit of a wack in the solar plexus, Minister, from your Liberal colleague in South Australia. He goes on to comment on the consultative process&mdash;or lack of it. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . have expressed concern to the Senate committee about the lack of consultation prior to the announcement in the Commonwealth budget of the enrolment benchmark adjustment . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That says it all really, doesn't it, Minister, about the folly of this government's action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what is probably more invidious for government schools, in addition to the abolition of the new schools policy, the enrolment benchmark adjustment, is that all of this operates in a scenario of the cuts to untied grants to the states made in June of $1.5 billion. That equates to about $300 million less for government schools in Australia. This government, which includes this minister, is walking away from its responsibilities to government schools. In doing so, the very likely event of encouraging again that very destructive debate&mdash;that poisonous state aid debate&mdash;we had in this country in the 1960s and 1970s is about to rise again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cherrell Hirst&mdash;the member for Moncrieff knows her&mdash;the chancellor of the Queensland University of Technology said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> on 5 October that federal government changes could take higher education back 30 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> years. It appears that the government is intent on doing the same to schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This minister should be very aware that universal access to local government schools is a highly valued principle of a free democratic society. The coalition seems to have great difficulty in accepting that access to a quality government school education is a fundamental right of every Australian child as well as being just a sensible economic investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this government, a fair go for government schools is on the way out. Under this government, quality education for government schools is out. Under this government, universal access to government schools is out. In its place we will probably get the poisonous state aid debate. In its place we will get a diminished government school system and therefore a diminished democratic society. In its place we have a government totally unprepared for the necessary leadership in the future of education.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I listened with some interest to question time and the questions from the member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin) on the subject of funding.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of things in the table that he did not mention that the member for Port Adelaide ought to know about and that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) himself referred to, relates to per capita funding of students. I raise this because the member for Port Adelaide made the statement that there is not a real increase here, that the increased funds are because of things like inflation, numbers of students and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that table 3 from the document that the shadow minister quoted from shows that there will be a decline in the projected number of students enrolled in schools in the four years we are talking about&mdash;1997 to 2000. The numbers will decline from 2,211,173 this year to 2,205,194 next year&mdash;the first of the four years in this funding proposal&mdash;to 2,187,649 in the year 2000.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The grants to the states and territories for school education through specific purpose payments are going to be not only maintained&mdash;certainly not cut&mdash;but increased by 18.3 per cent over the next four years. The total Commonwealth funding for schools, including specific purpose payments and financial assistance to states and territories&mdash;these are the figures from the table the shadow minister referred to&mdash;will rise $7.2 billion this year to $8.6 billion in the year 2000. That is an increase of 20 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Between 1997 and the year 2000, total Commonwealth funding per government school student will increase by 17.9 per cent and for non-government students it will increase by 14.9 per cent. So the rate of increase is faster and higher for those in government schools than for those in non-government schools. By whatever yardstick one looks at the matter the member for Sydney has brought up&mdash;`The adverse impact on public education of the federal government's funding decisions', to use his words&mdash;you just cannot find the substance in the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6685"> Time is very short for a second speaker on an MPI, but the member for Port Adelaide made reference to some schools and a situa tion in his electorate. I think my electorate is a very good example of what has been happening under the new schools program. I represent, and have represented for as long as I have been in the House of Representatives, an area which has a very high rate of population growth, with that growth occurring in two age groups&mdash;the retirees and the young families. Statistics for my part of the world shows that it has an average population well above the national norm in both those groups. So it is not just a matter of my electorate having a lot of people who do not go to school. In fact, compared with the national average, I have more pressure on schools in my electorate than most members of this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a number of government and non-government schools established in Moncrieff since the previous government's new schools policy was introduced. I have to say right up&hyphen;front that I have excellent government schools in my electorate. They are outstanding. Not all of them are new; some of them are old. One had to be rebuilt it was so old. They are really outstanding. Despite that, there is a very high level of demand for education in independent schools. All but three of the oldest independent schools on the Gold Coast&mdash;which happen to be in my electorate&mdash;are new, and they have mushroomed because the demand has been there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have not been funded at the same rate that the schools that have been there longer have been funded. That has led to a skewing and an unfair competition between schools. It has led to more difficulty for parents who happen to live in areas that have only developed in the last decade because they happen to be the schools to which they have access. There is no comparison, for example, with cities like Sydney, Adelaide or Melbourne, because my city is not yet big enough to have the sort of infrastructure of public transport that makes geographic location a choice between schools of no consequence. There is a very big difference indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any event, whatever the member for Port Adelaide has to say about what is happening in his state, no new government school is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> funded by any Commonwealth government&mdash;Liberal or Labor&mdash;unless that school has been approved by the state government. So, in the end, it is up to the states what they do and which new schools they approve. It is all up to them. They can set any rules they like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government only comes in and subsidises in the cases of approved schools. We are not intruding on state governments' rights to do what they like in relation to schools. Neither do we approve of laissez faire. If a state government does not approve of laissez faire, and is not going to approve a school under laissez faire, then that school is not going to get anything out of us either. We have never supported laissez faire. What we have supported is equality and equity between parents and students according to their own free choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, from my experience of education in Australia&mdash;which goes back many years in both the government and the non-government sector&mdash;without a doubt a major pressure on governments to fund government schools, to keep up standards and to keep up resources has been competition with non-government schools. It has only happened since there has been real competition, and the real improvements have happened when there has been some support in fees. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was saying before question time that I support this government's bill on Hindmarsh Island. I think it is important that it puts beyond doubt the ability to go and construct the bridge at Hindmarsh Island.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that I have had some misgivings about the environmental impact of that bridge, and I did feel, at the beginning, that it might turn out to be a way whereby the South Australian government in fact subsidised private development of the land, which I would have found disagreeable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the performance surrounding this bogus women's business, I think it is important that this legislation proceeds and is strongly supported. It indicates the extraordinary lengths to which elements in our pseudo&hyphen;academia, which affect our universities, particularly in the area of anthropology, are prepared to go in the promoting of mumbo jumbo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Professor Cheryl Saunders is an example of this, but it is endemic in the University of Western Australia, where Sandra Bowdler et al, including, I might add, many Canadians who seem to fill positions over there, are foisting on the people some sort of latter day concept of the noble savage where they must, or feel compelled to, distort <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> history to justify the position they make. The record of these institutions is appalling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If nothing else, this legislation enables that lack of intellectual rigour to be highlighted. That is very important because, while it is manifest in the area of Aboriginal anthropology, it also affects other areas of university learning. If universities want the respect which they feel is due to them, it is about time we got a return to some academic rigour in these institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did mention earlier that former Minister Tickner had no excuse. He knew exactly what he was doing with respect to this legislation: he was pandering to a constituency that has no bearing whatsoever on Aboriginal welfare. It is a constituency of pseudo academics, of people associated very much with the Aboriginal industry, of trendy, warm inner glow lefties which afflict both parties in this parliament. It is not a matter of his simply getting it wrong. I suspect from the beginning he knew it was wrong but felt compelled to go down this road.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the use of the section 9 and section 10 declarations under the act, there have been some monstrous anomalies. In my own state of Western Australia, the brewery matter is a classic case. There was never any substance to claims by Mr Bropho in respect of the brewery. I recall leading a march of Aboriginal people to that brewery site when we had far more Aboriginals than he had in his support. His support came basically from everywhere else&mdash;I think we counted 20 people who may have been Aboriginal out of the 120 both sides approximately had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The crocodile farm in Broome was another classic case. There was never a scintilla of evidence to warrant that decision on the section 9 or section 10 declarations. If you add to this the enormous anomalies under state legislation where freehold land is being attacked, it is quite clear that we as a nation have to start taking this matter very seriously and look at these things in great detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I just want to return to this women's business. I represent probably more Aboriginals than any other member in this parliament. I represent, undoubtedly, the most tribal of Aboriginal people where Aboriginal <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6687"> law is still very strong. I was told right at the start by senior Aboriginal law people in my electorate that there was not a scintilla of truth in these claims. I said, `How can you possibly know? It's a long way away. It might be different over there,' and they said, `Yes, the law is different from place to place, but there are some things which are always constant.' They were adamant there was never a scintilla of evidence to support the enormous cost that was placed upon taxpayers by this abuse of process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) was appallingly treated in this episode. I am pleased that history has vindicated the member for Barker because I do not like to see people treated as unjustly as he was in this. I listened with intent to the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) and I can say this: the member for Melbourne Ports would have been among the first people to have taken the same steps as the member for Barker did. For him to come into this House and talk about ethics and integrity in situations like that I think is laughable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe this bill is useful. It does put it beyond doubt. It takes it out of the hands of fickle and capricious politicians and lawyers who have been the main beneficiaries so far of all the matters pertaining to this Aboriginal interest. Even in the land rights debate, there was no tangible benefit for Aboriginals; it has been overwhelmingly a benefit for lawyers. Anything that can clip their wings, I believe, is to be applauded.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The child-care centre to which the member for Brisbane refers had contacted my office during the week by telephone to see if I was available to attend a rally.

<PROCTEXT>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr MILES</EMPHASIS> (Braddon&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (4.32 p.m.)&mdash;I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill proposes amendments to overcome an anomaly in the Corporations Law which came to light in a court decision last year. Part 5.3A of the Corporations Law, which commenced in June 1993, provides a regime for companies to enter a scheme known as voluntary administration. The scheme allows a company in financial difficulty to enter into a deed of company arrangement with its creditors, which enables the company to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> continue trading for a period with a view to producing a better return for creditors than would be available if the company was wound up immediately. Using this method can ideally result in saving the business of the company and the jobs of employees. The mechanism may also serve to avoid costs and delays often associated with formal liquidations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The voluntary administration scheme is increasingly being used in substitution to other means of dealing with corporate insolvencies because of its streamlined procedures and minimal court involvement. In a significant proportion of cases, companies enter into deeds of company arrangement with their creditors in an effort to save the company or, at least, its business. However, there are cases where, after a period of trading under a deed of company arrangement, it becomes clear that the company cannot trade out of its difficulties. In such a case, the Corporations Law provides for an automatic transition to a liquidation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In June last year, His Honour Mr Justice Cohen of the New South Wales Supreme Court held in Re Crawford House Press Pty Ltd (1995) 13 ACLC 874; (1995) 17 ACSR 295 that where persons deal with a company under a deed of company arrangement&mdash;as opposed to dealing with the deed administrator&mdash;and that company moves into liquidation, those persons may not make a claim in the winding up for any outstanding liabilities of the company in relation to those dealings. His Honour stated that this was not a result that could have been intended by the legislature and therefore called for legislative amendment. Industry bodies, the legal and insolvency profession, and commentators have supported the call for amendment as a matter of priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In October last year, the Corporations Law Amendment Bill 1995 was introduced by the previous government. The 1995 bill was designed to overcome the anomaly uncovered in the Crawford House decision. However, the 1995 bill failed to be passed before parliament rose prior to the March election and, accordingly, it has lapsed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time the 1995 bill was introduced, the coalition&mdash;then in opposition&mdash;had some <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6689"> reservations about the form of the bill. In particular, the coalition had concerns about whether debts incurred while a company is under a deed of company arrangement should not only be provable but also receive priority over other unsecured debts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year the government consulted with key industry participants about the best means of overcoming the anomaly uncovered by the Crawford House decision. During the consultation process, the government was advised that a large number of insolvency practitioners have been acting on the assumption that the 1995 bill would become law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In those circumstances, the government considers that, in the interests of certainty and stability, the most desirable course is to retain the bill in the form it was originally introduced last year. To modify the bill in order to give certain debts priority could potentially give rise to some very difficult situations if liquidators have conducted administrations relying on the form of the 1995 bill. The most important thing at this stage is to ensure the debts are provable so creditors are not left high and dry and to prevent the voluntary administration scheme being compromised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, as the question of the priority which should be accorded to debts incurred by a company under a deed of company arrangement remains an important issue, the government will refer the question of priority for consideration by the Legal Committee of the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee, which is currently undertaking a wide&hyphen;ranging review of the voluntary administration scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the Law Council of Australia and the Insolvency Practitioners Association of Australia have expressed their support for this course of action in light of the time that has passed since the lapsed 1995 bill.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Content of the Bill</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill seeks to effect two substantive changes to the Corporations Law. The first change is intended to ensure that debts and claims arising while a company is under a deed of company arrangement are admissible to proof in a subsequent winding up. The second is intended to ensure the validity of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> acts of liquidators who admitted such debts and claims on the basis that they were provable, prior to commencement of the amendments in the bill.</PARA>

<PROCTEXT>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Debate resumed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr MILES</EMPHASIS> (Braddon&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (4.39 p.m.)&mdash;I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill. I want to begin by referring to a book launch which occurred today here in Parliament House. The book goes over the history of this particular episode in Australia's history. The book that has been launched is very significant. The material which is contained in it will provide a lot of people with a tremendous amount of information and interest in this particular story.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The name of this book is <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">It would be nice if there was some women's business</EMPHASIS>. I want to say to people who may be listening to this debate or who may actually read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> that this is a crucial point in this whole debate. Lindy Warrell, an anthropologist, went to a meeting in South Australia down near the mouth of the River Murray where various people had come together to discuss the difficulty of being able to prevent the building of a bridge to Hindmarsh Island. A range of conversation went on at that meeting and then <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6690"> Lindy Warrell said, `What a pity about the women's business. It would be nice if there was some women's business.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, they had assessed all the evidence which had been discussed as to how they could prevent this bridge being built and made a judgment that it probably could not be stopped on environmental grounds, that it probably could not be stopped by industrial action by the trade union movement&mdash;the CFMEU at the time&mdash;and that it probably could not be stopped by genuine sacred site grounds for Aboriginal people. So she said, `What we really need to bring into this is some women's business.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Flowing on from that incident, we have this situation and this debate today. Ultimately, what happened was that the former Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in the Keating government, Minister Tickner, moved to prevent this bridge going ahead for 25 years. So we are now here debating this particular issue because, as it has transpired, we now know that the women's business that was developed at that meeting&mdash;which meeting interestingly actually included men&mdash;was a fabrication. So we are back here today. For those members who were here two years ago and spoke to a motion for disallowance, it is important for there to be debate in this House in support of this particular bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two important issues which I would like to draw attention to in this debate on the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill. The first is the decision to take consideration of evidence as part of the process of ministerial decision making. The Full Bench of the High Court found on 7 December 1995&mdash;and this was not all that long ago&mdash;that the former minister had failed to follow the due process of the act for which he was responsible by failing to consider personally the evidence which was referred to as `secret women's business'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We raised that in the debate on the motion for disallowance. We said then that the process which was being undertaken by the then government was inappropriate, that it was not valid. We warned the then government that the way in which the cabinet <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> decision making process was being undertaken, the way in which the minister was undertaking assessment of this material, was not valid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A South Australian royal commission had previously found that the so-called women's business was a fabrication. This finding was supported by the views of another group of Ngarrindjeri women who said that there was no such secret women's business associated with Hindmarsh Island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 14 Ngarrindjeri women who disputed the claims of the proponents of the secret women's business faced the threats and personal abuse of the activists with great courage and fortitude. I would like to mention those women. One of the highlights of my time in parliament so far, which is over 11 years now, has actually been meeting Dorothy Wilson, Dulcie Wilson and Jenny Grace yesterday afternoon and this morning. It was a highlight to meet these Aboriginal women because they stand for a symbol in this country of tremendous courage and integrity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do think anybody in this House could overstate the difficulties that those women faced in their community when they realised the way in which the circumstances were arising in their own community in discussion about the building of the bridge at Hindmarsh Island. They were senior women in the area. They also spoke to Nana Laura, another very elderly lady who they had very close contact with. They recognised that the discussions that were taking place in their community were not wholesome. More than that, they knew them to be totally wrong and totally fabricated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to this debate, there are probably four words that really summarise this whole set of circumstances. The first is manipulation, the second is intimidation, the third is fabrication and the last is courage. The manipulation occurred from a long way back. I have observed the way in which the previous government undertook Aboriginal affairs&mdash;the management there. One of the fundamental things that was wrong during the 1980s in this great country of ours was the fact that the previous government raised expectations with regard to many areas in Aboriginal affairs and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6691"> failed to deliver. I will point to two particular areas. One was national land rights. They raised expectations. They went around in 1983, 1984, 1985 and up to about 1986&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, they said, `What we will do is bring about an agreement between our indigenous people and other Australians. We will have a treaty.' Again, they raised expectations beyond what could be delivered. It is that sort of approach which has actually frustrated many Aboriginal people in this country because those expectations were beyond what the government knew could be delivered, but of course for their own purposes, they tried to manipulate the Aboriginal people to believe that they would deliver on these outlandish claims, as they have proven to be.</PARA></INTERJECT>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BI4">Mr MILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is exactly what this government will do in government. We were in opposition at that stage, but we did talk about it. After 1988&mdash;a year or so later&mdash;when the coalition talked about reconciliation as a genuine need, the then government picked up the concept of a reconciliation council. There are many people who would disagree on whether that was a good or a bad idea. I think it is a good idea because reconciliation is very important. The coalition is very keen to see reconciliation occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reconciliation will not occur through a legal document called a treaty or a contract. It would never occur that way. It has to be a heartfelt thing. If we want reconciliation in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this country, it has to be something which actually occurs in our school grounds. It has to occur on our streets and in our pubs. That is where it has to occur. Genuine reconciliation will occur when our indigenous people have the same health standards as other Australians, when they have the same housing conditions as other Australians, when they are able to have the same access to educational opportunities as other Australians, and all that type of thing. That is where the hard action, practical outcomes and real results occur. That is when real reconciliation will occur in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work which was done by the Aboriginal women who were called dissidents has certainly helped tremendously with regard to reconciliation in this country. I will just list these great women. They include Dorothy Wilson, whom I have already mentioned, Dulcie Wilson, Bertha Gollan, Jenny Grace, Audrey Dix, Betty Tatt, Rita Wilson, Vena Gollan, Beryl Kropinyeri, Margaret Sinclair, Rocky Koolmatrie, Shirley Knight and Phyllis Byrnes. Their stance was also supported by the Campbell family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people did something which was absolutely marvellous for this country. They stood up against the pressures of the union movement. They stood up against the pressures from local people in the area who did not want the bridge to be built. They stood up against the pressures of anthropologists. They stood up against the pressures of a large number of lawyers and professors of law. Not only that, they stood up against the federal government of the day. They decided from a basis of honesty and decency that the Australian people should know the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, I do not think anybody in this parliament can imagine the pressure that existed on those women. I would like to pay tribute to them for the steadfast respect they had for truth and for the integrity of their own cultural heritage. The previous government, by the actions which it took, was doing everything to undermine the cultural heritage of the Ngarrindjeri people. Why? Because the previous government was standing behind and backing up a fabrication. Yet these women, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6692"> concerned about their traditions, stood up and spoke the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This fundamental respect for the truth and respect for the integrity of Aboriginal heritage was wholly absent on the part of the minister and his strident political supporters, namely, the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), Michael Lavarch, the Attorney&hyphen;General at the time, the former Minister for Justice, the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), together with a swarm of anthropological and legal advisers, including Professor Cheryl Saunders, who ought to have known, if not better, at least enough to protect their political clients from the inevitable debacle which followed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At no time&mdash;this is just amazing&mdash;did anyone from the former government do the dissident Ngarrindjeri women the courtesy of interviewing them in order to verify their stories. I find that absolutely amazing. Here we have genuine fair dinkum, decent, hardworking Aboriginal women who were not even asked to express their opinion. Their information was not sought at all by so many people. It is amazing that a government could actually make a decision without talking to these people and seeking information. It is absolutely vital in these processes that all points of view are sought&mdash;</PARA></INTERJECT>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, respected. In this case it is very clear that the previous government did not do that. Former Minister Tickner erred by not considering the contents of the secret women's business. He claimed that he was prevented from doing so because the evidence was for women's eyes only. In his eagerness to support the views of the original plaintiffs under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, he committed a fundamental injustice by making a ministerial decision without considering the merits of the evidence before him. We now know that it was an absolute fabrication. Every Australian has the right to expect that ministers will make decisions based on the fullest consideration of the evidence relevant to the case in question, just as we expect evidence to be examined and weighed impartially in the legal process. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This brings me to the second principle that I wish to consider in my argument: the role to be accorded to spiritual beliefs in the process of government. It was never going to be good enough for Mr Tickner to plead that his respect for what were claimed to be secrets should be sufficient to make them immune from consideration. The sacred beliefs of a particular section of the community deserve the respect of us all. But they do not require that everyone automatically adhere to them or that they be put forward as a substitute for empirical evidence. While we must have respect for all the different cultural and religious beliefs held by members of our diverse society, the fundamental point to be made is that none of these beliefs are able to inhibit the rules of evidence or interfere in the process of government or the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that this government respects people. We are a government which understands and fully supports people's respect for conscience and belief in life. Mr Tickner sought to deliberately subvert this fundamental principle in the matter of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge. In doing so, he acted with reckless disregard for the consequences for those clients who depended upon him to administer the provisions of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act. He acted with disregard for impartiality and without respect for due process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence of this fiasco, we have been forced to legislate to limit the operation of the act in this case. This sorry episode will do nothing to enhance general community respect for those whose claims rest upon the thoughtful consideration of spiritual or religious beliefs. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act was designed to provide protection for the religious and cultural values of Aboriginal people whose beliefs were transmitted orally and through ritual processes. We stand behind it. The validity of those beliefs deserves to be verified by the most serious, detailed and objective anthropological examination. The act was designed to protect indigenous heritage. It was not designed as a vehicle for cynical manipulation by particular interest <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6693"> groups or to support a particular political agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the Hindmarsh Island Bridge saga is a graphic illustration of what was wrong with the politics of indigenous affairs in Australia at that time. Objectivity and impartiality are the first casualties in the adversarial approach taken by those who stake their professional integrity on blind support for the former government's agenda at the expense of justice or commonsense. These women stood up for justice. They are an example to all Australians. When faced with a terrible dilemma as to whether to go along with the politically correct agenda of the day in their own community, backed up by the federal government of the day, these women stood up and fought a cause for justice, honesty and integrity. They are marvellous people. They are a tremendous example to the rest of Australia. I congratulate them at the highest level for that which they have contributed to Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></INTERJECT></PROCTEXT>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the second reading amendment moved by my colleague the member for Banks (Mr Melham). In so doing, I would like to canvass some of the issues which come before the House in relation to the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill as a whole and, in particular, to some of the comments which we have had in the debate so far from members of the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bridge has a very unfortunate history. Certainly, the debate surrounding it has taken on a magnitude which those who were part of the debate in the very beginning could never have contemplated. I think it is very sad that this debate has been magnified to the degree that it has and that it has taken on the political character that it has, not only in the previous government's term of office but particularly now in this government's term of office when we should be moving into a better phase of this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unfortunate and sad history of this bridge and of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander reconciliation, with which it has become intertwined, is one which I hoped never to see in this parliament. It is one which I would have thought we could have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> avoided and one which I hoped the present government would have gone out of its way to avoid rather than going out of its way to encourage and promote, seeking to profit by that division, seeking to capitalise on problems which the previous government experienced in relation to this matter and seeking&mdash;I suspect&mdash;to capitalise on those difficulties in a way which does not advance the debate towards reconciliation in any way and, in fact, takes us backwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had many opportunities as parliamentarians in the course of the last few years&mdash;and this bridge debate has provided us with those opportunities&mdash;to move towards reconciliation. There have been some on all sides of this debate who have, unfortunately, sought opportunities to capitalise on this debate in a cynical and political way. I know that that has not been confined to one side of the argument within the indigenous community; it has not necessarily always been confined to one side of the political argument. What I am particularly saddened by is the fact that, in the recurring debate which we have as a result of the bill, those who seek to speak in support of the bill have not always done so from what I would regard as the most appropriate position to promote reconciliation. Some have sought to use this debate in a way which I think promotes dissent, which seeks to promote a political view of this debate and which implies lack of good faith on the part of those in the previous government who administered this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I can accept some criticism in relation to the previous minister's operation of some of the procedural aspects of this debate, I do not think one could question the good faith involved in attempting to give credence to another culture's heritage and beliefs. That is the most fundamental point: how do you give appropriate credence to another cultural set of beliefs, another set of cultural understandings, a tradition, a history, which is handed down and passed on from generation to generation in quite different ways from that which most members of this House would be familiar, indeed comfortable, with?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the very difficult part to overcome in one's own thinking processes in relation to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6694"> this matter. It is the thing which many members of the public have difficulty coming to terms with, but it is something which I would have hoped members of this House, and indeed senior members of the government, would have been able to deal with in a proper way. It is very unfortunate that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) has now sought, through the device of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill 1996, to carry on the debate in a way which is far from conducive to reconciliation and promoting public understanding of cultural beliefs and traditions which are not those of most Australians, but which certainly deserve to be understood and respected by all Australians. That is the vital part of this debate to which I would like to contribute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill has a very straightforward and, on the face of it, a very simple proposition: in order to build the Hindmarsh Island Bridge it is essential to carry this single item of legislation which seeks to override the normal provisions of the heritage legislation in a way which is highly specific to this one project. But we have heard speakers from the other side of the chamber make comments about due process and  natural justice, all of those kinds of issues which one would normally invoke but which I find an absurd response to a single piece of legislation which is solely designed to undermine due process, to undermine the normal legislative processes of this country and to set aside this project, away from the normal mechanisms which this parliament has established to deal with issues of Aboriginal heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly, if we were committed to due process and  to ensuring that this matter was dealt with in the normal and appropriate legal way for an issue of this kind, we would not need single items of legislation which exclusively deal with the particular application. That way does not lie due process. I think that is where members of the government have confused this with a political agenda which I suspect some are seeking to pursue as a result of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just what is the purpose of this legislation? Is it, in fact, to achieve the building of the bridge? That would be its ostensible purpose. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> That would be the purpose you would suspect from the face of the record and that would be the purpose from which you sometimes gain the rhetoric, particularly of the second reading speech, the introduction speech. That seemed to refer just to this. But the supplementary speeches which we have had from members of the government, in effect, give the lie to that straightforward proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is not about what it is about on the face of the record. If it were, it would be a relatively simple proposition. But, of course, as my colleague the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, has clearly pointed out in his contribution, the bill is completely unnecessary. If our only objective here was to ensure the construction of the bridge, we would not need to proceed with the bill. Indeed, I would put the point of view that proceeding with the bill is the way of slowing down construction of the bridge&mdash;indeed, may be a way of subverting the construction of the bridge and probably puts more legal obstacles in the way of the bridge than any other process one could imagine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Had due process been followed then, I suspect, we could now have the bridge under construction as we speak in this place. That is not something which this side of the House would stand in the way of. We accept that the government won the election. We accept that the evidence which has come forward since this matter was first raised is such that the bridge could now proceed. We accept that. That is not something we are opposed to or something we stand in the way of; it is something which both sides of this House would agree on. The bridge can and should proceed forthwith. There is no legal obstacle to that. There is no determination by the minister in the way of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one determination which did exist was struck down by the court. There were appropriate and technical grounds for that proceeding. It was not struck down by the court on the basis of an analysis of the merits of the argument. It was struck down because of procedural issues which, of course, were fatal to the minister's determination. That is well understood. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6695">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a process of law, as due process being followed under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, that is appropriate. But we now have an entirely separate process. We now have a minister who advances the point of view that the only way to construct this bridge is by passing special legislation. That is simply not correct. That is simply not true. Because of the way this parliament operates, because of the government's inability to get legislation through this parliament on time, this bill will not be considered by the Senate until next year. The cut&hyphen;off date has already passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government itself has not put this on its high priority list. The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) has implicitly and explicitly conceded that this bill is not a high priority for the government and therefore, in effect, the government has deferred this legislation until next year. The government says that this is low priority legislation but that it is essential to getting the bridge built. That is a contradiction in terms and it is one which we must come to understand, if we are to understand why this legislation is before the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly, the present act, as it now stands, provides adequate mechanisms for ensuring that the bridge can be and is built forthwith. There is no determination under the act which is currently on foot. There is no prohibition under the act for the construction of the bridge. The reality is that if the minister wishes he can take full advantage of all the material which is now in the public domain. He can appoint someone of his own choosing who is quite able to be subject to direction and instruction, who is subject to the minister's guidelines and who can be required to report within a very narrow time frame&mdash;say, 14 days after representations are received. In that way, the minister can act quite properly, in accordance with all of the court decisions which we have now seen on the record since this matter was first raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that the matter has certainly had the effect of ensuring that the law in this area is very clear and well understood by all concerned. We certainly owe the former minister that. He has guaranteed that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> federal court and others have had ample opportunities to comment on this matter and I think all members of parliament are now very conversant with the necessary legislation. Certainly, the minister ought to be more conversant with it than he apparently is because, quite clearly, if he were to follow the procedures in the act, he would be able to ensure the construction of the bridge forthwith. Certainly, he could have the matter legally resolved well before this parliament rises in the December recess. That would have been quite simple for him to do. By bringing on this bill, he has introduced endless and additional complications to the matter which we do not need, which the proponents of the bridge do not need and which I would suggest are very damaging to the process of reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is nothing but a political device to ensure that the kinds of comments which we have had on the record in the last couple of days can be made. It is a device which ensures that, once again, Aboriginal culture and heritage are called into question. Despite the ultimate and perhaps begrudging acceptance of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) of the motion put forward by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) on reconciliation, on ensuring harmony and understanding between all Australians, whatever their ethnic or indigenous nature, the resolution was finally unanimously adopted by this parliament. I do not know what would have been the case had the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) been in her place at the time&mdash;but she wasn't, so we will never know. The reality is that the motion was adopted by all members of this parliament. It was promoted by the Leader of the Opposition quite properly and he very generously allowed the Prime Minister to pick up that resolution because he was more interested in the process of reconciliation, in the process of bringing Australians together, than he was in scoring political points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this bill, unlike the Leader of the Opposition's motion, is about scoring political points. It is not about achieving a legal objective of ensuring the construction of the bridge&mdash;that can be adequately contemplated by the present legislation. If the minister were <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6696"> to devote the same degree of attention to the present legislation which he has devoted to amending it in this very special and unique way, then we would have the bridge under construction by now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with this legislation, as my colleague has pointed out, is that it is discriminatory. It does breach the Racial Discrimination Act, contrary to the assurances of the minister in transmitting the bill to the Leader of the Opposition, contrary to coalition policy, stated in writing, that the coalition in government will respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act, and contrary to the rhetoric of ministers and the Prime Minister of this government when they say that all of their actions will respect the Racial Discrimination Act. The bill, as my colleague the member for Banks (Mr Melham) has said, is, in effect, one of our bills of rights. It is something which empowers all Australians. It is something which brings Australians together rather than something which should divide them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, this government has sought to exploit previous political and administrative difficulties over this bridge in a way which will ensure that that act is again subject to notional challenge. This bill certainly does challenge the RDA; it certainly puts that bipartisan respect for the RDA at some risk. Rather than the government accepting its position of leadership as it quite properly should in promoting that reconciliation, in promoting harmony between all Australians, indigenous and non&hyphen;indigenous, this bill is a mere device to bring about disharmony&mdash;a device which will not promote reconciliation, a device which will not even get the job done at the end of the day. I suspect the bill is flawed for those reasons. It is contrary to the Racial Discrimination Act; it is retrospective. It is all of those things which its minister says it is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The test of that will be the government's response. If the motion for the second reading is rejected by this House, the test will be what the government will do when confronted with the second reading amendment of my colleague to this bill, which, for the avoidance of doubt&mdash;which is entirely appropriate in this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> case&mdash;expressly declares that it is the intention of the parliament that the terms of the Racial Discrimination Act shall prevail over the provisions of this act and that nothing in this act shall be taken to authorise any conduct whether legislative, executive or judicial that is inconsistent with the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That amendment is critical to understanding the government's attitude to this bill. If the government is genuine about this bill, if its purpose is as it has stated&mdash;that it is simply to get the job done, simply to get the bridge built and not for any base political motive&mdash;then the government will accept that amendment and that will ensure the support of all concerned for this legislation, with the possible exception of some Independent members of this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that I suspect the government will not support this amendment. I suspect that its motives are not as pure, as practical and as utilitarian as it would have us believe but are set to a lesser purpose than that. The coalition's respect for the Racial Discrimination Act will be sorely tested when this matter is put to the vote&mdash;and be sure that it will be put to a vote. We want to ensure it is on the record of this parliament because respect for the Racial Discrimination Act is a fundamental touchstone of the government's sincerity of policy consideration in this area. It is a fundamental touchstone of its commitment to reconciliation and of its commitment to unifying Australians rather than dividing them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the test to which you will be put when this matter comes before the House in a vote. Does the bill discriminate against one section of the Australian community or does it not? We want to ensure that you are as good as your word. Your word that you will respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act will be tested by this amendment. I know that I and my colleagues on this side of the House will be supporting this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment goes well beyond the consideration of just this bill because it tests the whole of your policy approach to this area of government. This is a very critical area of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6697"> government not least because of the Hindmarsh Bridge issue itself&mdash;indeed, that is almost forming a lesser part of the debate in reality&mdash;and because of recent events in the Australian political landscape following the election on 2 March; not because of actions of the government but because of inaction by the government and actions by others in the Australian community who have sought to make race an issue in this community. The inaction of the government in the early stages of the debate allowed the debate to rage way further than it should ever have been allowed to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is always the obligation of the Prime Minister of this country to weigh in heavily and early on these things to ensure that the public well understand the position of the government when individuals in society raise issues which go beyond the normal rights of free speech and start to impinge on the very harmony and coherence of the community itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In those cases we are not just talking about political correctness or about the normal freedom of political debate in this country. We are talking about something far deeper&mdash;the very fabric of our society, the very understanding which the various sections of our community have of each other, of their sincerity and of their role. For the Prime Minister to remain silent and mute in the face of that kind of issue is a very serious dereliction of duty, one which, fortunately, he has recently started to correct at the behest of the Leader of the Opposition in this place and one which he has started to correct in the public arena because he has recognised the failing that has occurred.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Hindmarsh Island Bridge must surely be the world's most famous non&hyphen;existent bridge. Sadly, it is famous for all the wrong reasons, for never has there been in the history of this country a better example of how not to go about anything. The history of this non&hyphen;existent bridge is as long as it is sordid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If proper planning procedures had been followed and the then state government had not been desperate to cover up the condition of its ailing state bank, thus relieving its own burden of debt by propping up failing developers, the bridge would not be famous for never having been built. The saga of the bridge has divided the people of Port Elliot, the people of Goolwa, the people of Hindmarsh Island, many people in the wider South Australian community and, tragically, the Ngarrindjeri people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to understand my government's decision to introduce this bill, it is necessary to know the background to the decision to build the bridge. The story began before Tom and Wendy Chapman, the proprietors of Binalong Pty Ltd, approached the State Bank of South Australia to finance their marina development on Hindmarsh Island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of whether or not a bridge is needed to connect Hindmarsh Island to the mainland has been a matter of debate in the area for many years. Some island dwellers argue that the absence of a bridge contributes to the isolation and, therefore, the character of the island. The character and the isolation are the very reasons they choose to live there. Others argue that access to the island is poor and that a ferry is not able to cope with existing traffic demands, particular at peak periods, so a remedy is needed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6698">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Varying remedies have been suggested. A bridge is not the only answer, but it was an eagerly sought after option by those seeking to develop the land. Another option for the island is to commission a second ferry. This is considered by some people to be more appropriate on economic, environmental, aesthetic and heritage grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bridge was initially raised in the draft environmental impact statement released by Binalong for public comment in November 1989 for an extension of its marina development on the western section of Hindmarsh Island to the tune of an extra 800 allotments. The bridge at this stage was to be financed and constructed by Binalong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Planning approval for the first stage of 160 allotments was issued in April 1990 and progress beyond this stage was contingent on the building of the bridge, but the state government at this time announced that it would contribute $3 million towards the cost of the bridge. The $3 million was to be recouped by levies on the ongoing marina development. However, Binalong had been experiencing for some time what eventually became very well known financial problems, as were one of its financiers, the Beneficial Finance Corporation&mdash;the well-known cowboy lending division of the State Bank of South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since that time, as we all know, Binalong has gone into liquidation and the old State Bank of South Australia has become folklore in Australian banking history. Westpac, Binalong's other financier, was also at the time threatening to withdraw its financial support for the project. Throughout this period, senior project officers from the then Premier's Department, that is, John Bannon's department, were negotiating with the Chapmans, BFC and Westpac. BFC withdrew from the development in September 1990 and Westpac became Binalong's financier for the project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Soon after, in March the following year, the state government announced that it would fund and build the bridge and Binalong would only have to repay costs less $3 million after they repaid their debt to Westpac. Many South Australians saw this as a shady deal <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> motivated by the state government's desire to get money back onto BFC's books. In March 1993, a deed was finalised between the councils of Port Elliott and Goolwa, Binalong and the government which saw the state government taking over the responsibility for financing the bridge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision further angered many South Australians at the time for many reasons, so much so that in April 1993 the Environment, Resources and Development Committee of the South Australian parliament was given the terms of reference for an inquiry into the financial aspects of the decision to build the bridge. I would like to quote from some of the people who put submissions to the inquiry. A.J. Cattanach said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have been a multitude of businesses in South Australia that have gone bankrupt over the last few years that would have given their eye teeth for a deal like this.</PARA>
<PARA>There are hundreds of small businesses in my electorate which would be overjoyed if the state government offered them $3 million, or indeed any part thereof, to assist them with their infrastructure costs. The Adelaide Bushwalkers said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government seems determined to throw even more taxpayers' money into the mess that was the State Bank fiasco. It should cut its losses and leave development entirely to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA>Submissions from the district councils of Berri, Loxton and others pointed out that Riverland areas have been agitating for a bridge for over two decades, with much greater need. These views are widely held in the South Australian community because there is a lot more than just a grain of truth in them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On completion of the inquiry, the committee made five recommendations which were, in summary: one, that a reassessment of the bridge project be done with consideration as to whether a second ferry would meet the island's access requirements; two, that consideration be given to the introduction of a toll for non&hyphen;resident ferry users; three, `that the government seriously address the matters in this report relating to the competing interests of heritage, environment and development'; four, that government agencies <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6699"> should immediately involve the local community in the development of management plans for the whole of the Murray mouth, Coorong and surrounding waterways; and, five, `that any further residential development on Hindmarsh Island beyond the Goolwa Marina development should be subject to the most critical analysis in regard to its environmental impact'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, from the recommendations you can see that there were many problems relating to the approval process for the non&hyphen;existent bridge pertaining to a proper needs assessment, proper environmental assessment and proper community consultation. A further reason for the animosity felt by some in the South Australian community came from what was seen by many people as the most extraordinary abuse of the legal process. In March 1994, lawyers acting on behalf of Binalong's directors, Tom and Wendy Chapman, sought and gained interim injunctions in the Federal Court under section 45D of the Trade Practices Act to stop certain people, including well&hyphen;known and respected South Australians such as Professor David Shearman, the then President of the Conservation Council of South Australia, from speaking out against the building of the bridge. I would have to say that I, too, regard this as a most unfair abuse of the legal process, to stop a group of citizens who were rightfully concerned that due process should be adhered to for the construction of a project that they had every right to object to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hindmarsh Island sits just a few hundred metres from the coastline in the middle of the Murray mouth. The island is indeed a very special island, situated within a very beautiful region that is of tremendous significance to South Australians. Thousands of us over the years, along with interstate and overseas visitors, have enjoyed a weekend outing with our families, travelling over to the island on the ferry, and have spent Christmas holidays lazing on the beaches around the Murray's lakes and mouth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The natural assets of the region are a magnet for local and distant tourists who visit the area each year. The Fleurieu Tourism Association is actively working to ensure that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> many more people visit, an activity that I wholeheartedly support because then they will travel through my wine region, the McLaren Vale wine region, and will stop to experience the very outstanding wines that are produced in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major attraction in the entire region is its natural beauty. Already, human activity has altered the area dramatically and caused considerable degradation and environmental management problems that are now in the process of being better managed. In fact, the Murray mouth, Hindmarsh Island, the Murray Lakes and the Coorong are so significant ecologically that they have been listed under the Ramsar convention or the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, the Japan&hyphen;Australia migratory bird agreement, the China&hyphen;Australia migratory bird agreement and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, or the Bonn convention. Australia has obligations under these international treaties to protect the habitats of birds and other animal species that live in them at various times of the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The South Australian government, in conjunction with the Australia Nature Conservation Agency, is working to ensure that these obligations are met. Some $56,000 has been allocated to the development of a management plan for the entire Coorong Ramsar site and a process to develop a management plan for the entire site is now under way. The South Australian government has established a community reference group and a government agencies committee to oversee this process. Two project officers have been employed, one as a planner and one to undertake community consultation. This is a measure of great importance to ensure that future developments in the region, one of the fastest growing in the state, are in step with the expectations of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you think about it, Mr Deputy Speaker, there are few things in the natural environment that are more amazing than the instinct in some species which impels them to travel thousands of miles each year from as far away as Japan and China to spend the summer months in the waters around Hindmarsh Island. Around 45 bird species have been <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6700"> recorded in the waters surrounding the island. Several species have been recorded as being of considerable conservation value because they are rare, locally endangered, vulnerable or listed on one of these treaties to which Australia is a signatory. Over half these species have declined in numbers by at least 10 per cent and in many cases the decline has exceeded 20 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The definition of ecologically sustainable development says that development should not compromise biodiversity or contribute to a decline in local species. The evidence is clear: development in the region is already seriously impacting on the very precious local environment which plays host every year to migratory birds from thousands of miles away. This miraculous practice has been ongoing for more years than any of us in this place could understand and it has required a healthy environment to continue; and it will require a healthy environment to continue into the future. A healthy environment requires healthy water, something the Aboriginal people seemed to have understood long before non&hyphen;Aboriginal Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the degradation of the area is due to the interruption of normal flows and the pollution of the waters in the region since European settlement. Blue&hyphen;green algal blooms are no longer uncommon in the summer months in the waters in the Murray's lakes and mouth and restrictions on the use of water have to be put in place. Now, in the absence of an independent environmental impact statement, an extra 800 residential allotments and a bridge will be enticing more visitors and permanent residents to the area each year, placing more pressure on the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unthinkable in 1996 that approval for development of this scope could have been given in a Ramsar site before a management plan was in place. The planning approval for these developments was granted on the strength of the EIS that Binalong itself produced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party's approach to wetlands protection is in direct contrast to the approach taken by the present South Australian minister, the Hon. David Wotton, whom I am proud to say is a very decent man and a good <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> political friend. Minister Wotton sought to protect that very precious area, the Coongie Lakes, in South Australia's section of the Lake Eyre Basin by working with the pastoralists to develop and implement a management plan for the lakes. The South Australian government has been able to achieve what the Labor Party could never achieve which has seen the lakes fenced off to cattle for the better protection of its precious assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now this government has seen the need to introduce the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill in order to prevent this parliament's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 from further stalling the construction of the as yet non-existent bridge. There can be no doubt that the previous Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, the former member for Hughes, did not handle his responsibilities well in relation to the bridge proposal&mdash;because he was more interested in making political mileage out of the bridge debacle than he was in resolving the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I expect there is a lesson for us all in this. In fact, as we all know, the previous minister's shoddy handling of the issue was exposed by the Full Bench of the High Court in December 1995 as invalid under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, and his decision was overturned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next complication arising from his shoddy handling of the issue arose when a further application under the act was received by the former government in December last year and Justice Mathews was commissioned to prepare a report under section 10 of the act. As we also know, Justice Mathews was found to be ineligible to perform the duties that the minister appointed her to perform. All the while the minister was championing the cause of Aboriginal heritage and admonishing the coalition, yet he was not prepared to address the very damage caused to Aboriginal people by the inadequacies of his very own act until forced to by its exposure in the courts. He has paid the price for his incompetence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6701"> The South Australian government held an inquiry to determine whether or not Aborigi nal heritage issues pertaining to women's business existed in the area, and the inquiry found that such issues were fabricated. The problem, of course, was that the women who claimed to be the holders of the stories relating to the women's business refused to participate in the inquiry. The whole story was, therefore, unable to be told. I doubt that any non-Ngarrindjerri person can know the truth about the Aboriginal heritage issues surrounding the bridge or that anyone can confidently make the right decision pertaining to the construction of the bridge based on Aboriginal heritage issues alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like at this stage to express my sympathy to Mrs Sarah Milera. Sarah is described as being `recognised by Aboriginal people as the custodian of Kumarangk or Hindmarsh Island'. Her great grandfather, `King' Peter Pulami, was paramount Repulle of the mighty Ngarrindjerri nation whose people occupied the land, lakes and waterways of the lower Murray region. Sarah along with many other Ngarrindjerri women, both the so-called non-dissident and dissident women, have been deeply hurt and affected by the process that they were forced to go through and its effects on their people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the whole saga has shown is that our processes to address matters of Aboriginal heritage were sadly lacking prior to the public airing of the idea to construct a bridge to Hindmarsh Island. The South Australian government moved soon after coming into office to address this problem. They have sought consultation with the Aboriginal community in order that that community will inform the government on how a more effective process could be built. The Premier himself initiated consultation with the Aboriginal community which resulted in a number of measures, including the appointment of a full-time chair of the Aboriginal Heritage Committee, the restructuring of the committee to reflect the traditional structure of the South Australian Aboriginal community and a $300,000 site protection program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The previous federal government also moved eventually to address the problems with its 1984 act through a review which was finalised in August this year by Justice Eliza beth Evatt&mdash;a review supported by the government and now under consideration, as we are expecting to introduce amendments to the act early next year. So, if nothing else comes from this debacle, at least there will be more effective processes to identify matters of Aboriginal heritage&mdash;and we owe the overwhelming majority of Aboriginal Australians nothing less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe, as I said earlier, that the story behind the as yet unbuilt Hindmarsh Island Bridge holds many lessons for governments, for Aboriginal people and for those with an interest in development and environmental matters&mdash;that is, just about everyone in the Australian community. The Hindmarsh Island Bridge exposes the types of problems that caused me to seek a career in politics. There is no question that this country must further develop its unique and, indeed, its spectacular assets. We need further development to create the employment opportunities that too many people in this country so desperately need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, in doing so, we must get it right. Getting it right means consulting with local communities and putting matters of environmental protection and Aboriginal heritage very high on the agenda indeed. We cannot afford the types of messages that debacles like the as yet unbuilt bridge send to the development community and to the many millions of people in this country who have a strong interest in environmental matters and who expect more of their governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, I place on the record my personal sadness that the processes were either not properly in place or not properly negotiated and my sadness that the handling of the entire issue has caused grief within the wider South Australian community, and particularly amongst the Aboriginal community. It has done very little to assist with the process of reconciliation&mdash;and for that I am truly sad. Nor has it done anything to assist with the sustainable development of a very special region of South Australia in a way that protects its special resources&mdash;which are indeed its very attractions&mdash;for the use and enjoyment of future generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If only commonsense could have prevailed with all parties having got together and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6702"> reached some sort of agreement. Perhaps such an agreement could have included improved access for island residents through the introduction of a second ferry for their exclusive use. Perhaps such an agreement could have seen Built Environs building a structure that the South Australian people actually need. Perhaps such an agreement could have seen oil poured on the troubled waters surrounding the island and the pain felt by the Ngarrindjerri people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, however, it is probably too late, for we are stuck with the mess created for us by the previous state Labor government. It is therefore with regret that there is no other way and I support my government's need to introduce this bill into this House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I share with the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes) a certain sadness on this provision, a certain sadness about the government's decision to bring this Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill before the House. I also congratulate the member for Kingston on the tone and intent of her remarks because I think she brought a refreshing objectivity to the debate. I was quite impressed, indeed, when she spoke of learning lessons, when she spoke not of declaring right and wrong on this issue, not of declaring winners and losers but of learning lessons. She also spoke powerfully of consultation and the capacity for compromise on a question like this. I think that really is a style of debate and a way of approaching the Hindmarsh Island Bridge and associated issues that we could all learn from.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I sincerely believe that this is not an issue where the government needs to declare right and wrong, where the government needs to declare winners and losers. It is an issue where the government needs to learn lessons, where the government needs to learn from the experience.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say for the benefit of the member for Ballarat that the Australian Labor Party also needs to learn lessons from the experience. No-one on this side of the House can pretend, or to my understanding would pretend, that our administration and carriage <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the issue up until 2 March was 100 per cent perfect. I concede that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not here, unlike some of the government speakers, to declare right and wrong, to declare winners and losers. I speak very much in the tone expressed by the member for Kingston. The arguments she placed before the House with regard to the environmental significance of the area could be dealt with by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) if he was to exercise his responsibilities, his power, his discretion as provided for under the act. It is one of the great sadnesses of this bill that Senator Herron will not have an opportunity to consider the type of environmental issues that have been placed before the House of Representatives by the member for Kingston.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I do have one difference with her and her presentation it is the remarks she made about Robert Tickner. Being a member elected on 2 March when Robert Tickner was defeated in his seat of Hughes, she would not know him. But anyone who knows Robert Tickner well would not agree with her assessment that he would ever try to use Aboriginal issues and Aboriginal affairs for political mileage. Robert Tickner was not perfect in his administration of this matter. I think he acknowledged that himself when he appointed Senator Crowley to handle the issue at the end of last year and in the lead-up to the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing about Robert Tickner was his sincerity and conviction to stand up for the best interests of Aboriginal people as he saw them. Robert Tickner was not the sort of person who would ever, under any circumstance, use Aboriginal issues and Aboriginal affairs for political mileage. He was, without doubt, a person of great compassion and a person so well motivated on these issues. I think that needs to be placed on the record in all fairness to Mr Tickner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an issue of some sadness. The position of the Labor Party is very clear. We believe the bridge can be built and, in fact, we want the bridge to be built but not at the expense of the Racial Discrimination Act, not at the expense of Australia's bill of rights. Our assessment, advanced so capably by the member for Banks (Mr Melham), is that the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6703"> two objectives are not incompatible. We can have the bridge as well as respect for the Racial Discrimination Act. We can have the Hindmarsh Island Bridge as well as preserving the integrity of Australia's bill of rights. The two are entirely compatible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is one thing the government is doing through this process&mdash;and I think it is a great shame&mdash;it is declaring a vote of no confidence in Senator Herron. If the senator was allowed to exercise his power, his discretion, his responsibility under the act, there would be no need for this legislation. The government, in all its pious lecturing&mdash;we heard that last night from the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan)&mdash;is declaring no confidence in its own minister, Senator Herron. They are doing so, I believe, at the expense of the best interests and understanding of Aboriginal people in the community surrounding Hindmarsh Island. This has been an issue that has created division. It has been an issue that has created strongly held views both within that Aboriginal community and throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one thing that I learnt in the 1980s working for some time with a New South Wales Aboriginal land council; that is, Aboriginal communities are not homogenous. Aboriginal people and Aboriginal communities never deserve to be stereotyped. We should never make the mistake in this parliament of assuming that Aboriginal people are uniform in their views, uniform in their interests, uniform in their beliefs. We should recognise and respect their diversity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Across Australia there are differences of opinion and differences of strongly held belief in their communities, not unlike the way in which non-Aboriginal communities have differences. No-one in this parliament, without a single Aboriginal member, expects us to agree. Of course we do not. On so many issues we disagree. That is the pattern of diversity that is reflected in Aboriginal communities, and we have seen it with respect to Hindmarsh Island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not doubt for a moment the member for Barker and his assessment of the Aboriginal women and their courage. They stood up and argued their case. They stood up and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> argued their beliefs. I do not doubt for a moment that, if they had in their heart a certain perspective, a certain passion, a certain set of beliefs, they demonstrated courage to stand up and argue the credibility of their case. Just as much, I do not doubt for a moment that those who disagreed with them, those who expressed a different set of beliefs, a different set of views were also courageous and remain courageous to this day. I have no doubt that there are seriously held beliefs and views on both sides of this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> That, in many respects, demonstrates the government's folly in bringing this provision before the House. It is simply unnecessary in the resolution of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge issue. The government does not need to bring this legislation before the House to have the bridge built. But I ask this question: does it need to stand up on an issue like this to declare winners and losers as if somehow it is a game of sport?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the speech I heard last night from the member for Barker, and today from other government members, displays the worst features of our adversarial style of parliamentary debate. It is as if on every single issue they have an instinctive need to declare winners and losers, right and wrong. There is no doubt, for the benefit of the member for Ballarat, that I engage in adversarial politics, but there are some issues&mdash;and this is one&mdash;where there is no right and wrong, where there are no winners and losers. There are differences of opinion, differences of strongly held opinion and belief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Kingston raised the point so capably that it is not a question of declaring right and wrong, winners and losers, like it is some game of sport that does not go to the heart of people's life and their beliefs. There is no need to do that on this issue. It is a matter of learning. It is about learning lessons and understanding how this issue can now be dealt with. It is about striking compromises, if they are appropriate. This legislation is not required as part of the learning process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation effectively is an attempt by the government to celebrate its view that, on the Hindmarsh Island Bridge, there is nothing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6704"> but winners and losers and there is nothing but right and wrong. I think the government makes a mistake in trying to dance on the grave of this issue and celebrate what it perceives to be winners and losers in the fashion that we have heard from so many government members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that there is no need for this legislation to build the bridge. There is no need for the government to declare winners and losers in a divided Aboriginal community. I believe the government is motivated by three things. First of all, the desire for the member for Barker to be vindicated. The member for Barker was humiliated in this parliament last year on the Hindmarsh Island issue. He was humiliated to the point where he had to resign from the shadow ministry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those on the Labor side might have taken political joy from those events, but at a personal level no-one in this parliament would want to see a member so humiliated as the member for Barker was. He received correspondence that he knew was not his. He received correspondence through the systems of the Parliament House mail office that he knew did not belong to him. He then tried to come into this House&mdash;I remember the question time so well&mdash;to put questions to Mr Tickner that he knew were based on a falsehood. He knew that he should not have had access to that information. He should not have opened that mail sent to him incorrectly; he should have sent it straight on to the minister's office.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is almost as if this bill could be renamed the `Ian McLachlan vindication bill'. That is the way in which he argued his case last night. He felt an instinctive need to vindicate himself, having been humiliated in this parliament last year. He is a man of considerable ego; he is a man of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> considerable arrogance. It is a reflection of that ego and a reflection of the arrogance that he has argued the case as vindication for Ian McLachlan, not necessarily as benefits for Aboriginal people associated with the Hindmarsh Island issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing that is reflected in the government's view&mdash;this idea of celebration on the issue&mdash;is that the Liberal Party believe at long last they have finally discovered for themselves a winning issue on Aboriginal politics. That is one of the reasons they have had the cheer squad in here&mdash;everyone from the member for Braddon (Mr Miles), the member for Wentworth (Mr Andrew Thomson) who was here last night, and the member for Ballarat. I am surprised that he has been caught up in this tawdry cabal of Liberal Party members not so much interested in the issue but trying to celebrate the fact that the Liberal Party at long last think they have discovered an issue that was a winner for them in terms of base politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third area of celebration we saw in the gallery last night: three well&hyphen;known journalists, who often complain about opinion forming elites in Australia, conspiring around the idea of political correctness. But there they were, all comparing notes last night&mdash;three bigots on a stick&mdash;all here joining in the celebration of the idea that their world view has been vindicated. Again, three bigots celebrating the fact that their belief, their world view, had been vindicated&mdash;a world view that condemns political correctness and whatever that might stand for.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just return to the government's credentials on this issue. I would have thought that, if the government believed sincerely that this legislation was needed to build the bridge, it would be declared as a matter of urgency through both houses of this parliament. If this was an urgent piece of legislation, it would have absolute priority through the House of Representatives and the Senate. As the government has declared its priority on this legislation, it has also declared its sincerity. When one looks at the ranking on the Senate schedule that the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill has received, it is downgraded. As the government has downgraded its Senate legislative priority for this bill, it has downgraded its own sincerity on the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just give the House, and those people interested in the issue, the sort of grading and priority the government has given this provision in the Senate. It has been allocated under time permitting&mdash;not urgent; not a first rank priority, but time permitting&mdash;which of course is code for something that can wait till next year. As the government has downgraded its legislative priority in the Senate on the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill, it has downgraded its own sincerity. It has also exposed the folly and the absolute political opportunism of the legislation itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is completely unnecessary and totally inappropriate. The government argues that the only way to ensure the Hindmarsh Island Bridge is built is to prevent a declaration being made under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 by the enactment of this bill. Yet, in the current situation, under existing legislation, no barrier exists preventing the construction of the bridge. No protection order is currently in existence. The bridge could go ahead tomorrow. This bill breaches the spirit and letter of the Racial Discrimination Act, and that is why the Labor Party is so uncomfortable with its <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6706"> introduction into this House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also contradicts the very specific commitment the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) gave to respect the RDA. In question time early in this parliament the Prime Minister gave a clear commitment to respect the RDA. I am pleased to quote the words of the member for Banks in the racial tolerance resolution debated in this House last week when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This act&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Racial Discrimination Act&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is our bill of rights. This act makes us all equal. As parliamentarians, we should at all times strive to maintain the principles behind this motion and every subsequent piece of legislation in this parliament should respect the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA>This subsequent piece of legislation, this Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill, should respect the Racial Discrimination Act. That is why the government is engaged in a massive act of folly and insincerity in bringing the provision before the House. The bill is completely unnecessary to the construction of the bridge but, quite shamefully, it overrides the RDA. That is a very strong reason why no parliamentarian should support it in its current form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why then is the government introducing legislation to override the heritage protection act when the act presents no barrier to the construction of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge? The issue, quite frankly, is dripping in the politics of dragging this issue out until the South Australian election next year. That is why the government has given this legislation such a low priority in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been ranked, in terms of priority, with the education services for overseas students bill; with the Proceeds of Crime Amendment Bill about a few small alterations to the consolidated revenue fund; with the Trade Practices Amendment (Industry Access Codes) Bill, which I know to be a minor matter; with the Health Insurance Amendment Bill, another minor matter on immunisation registers; and, with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill, which makes small alterations to the powers of the Indigenous Land Corporation. It has been downgraded to the point where it has the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> same status as the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill, the Legislative Instruments Bill and the Flags Amendment Bill. It cannot even get higher on the government's legislative program than the Flags Amendment Bill, which was first introduced into this House three or four months ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the government is not serious in declaring this legislation as a matter of urgency. The government is not serious in getting this bill through as something that is essential to the construction of the Hindmarsh Island bridge. The government has downgraded the priority of this legislation in the Senate. It cannot be resolved until 1997. As it has downgraded the priority of the legislation, it has downgraded its own sincerity and its own credibility on this particular issue. The government, through its Senate program, concedes the bill is not necessary. The bill is a political exercise for which the government stands condemned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of parliamentary standards and process, this is a sad day for the parliament for another reason. That is, this unnecessary piece of legislation is being debated in this House of Representatives at a time when the government will not give priority or debating time to the Euthanasia Laws Bill. The government has shoved away to the side chamber, the Main Committee of this House of Representatives, a matter of life and death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought the member for Ballarat would know how important euthanasia is, as I would for the same reasons. He would agree with me in saying that something that important, something that goes to the rights of terminally ill people, should not be debated in the Main Committee when we have a piece of legislation here which is a low priority on the government's Senate program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My pupil master always told me that, when you have a hopeless case and you are addressing the jury, you remember three things: talk about anything but the facts of the case, be full of sound and fury, be unctuous. There has been a lot of that from the other side in this particular debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been argued that the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill breaches the Racial Discrimination Act, but nowhere in any of the speeches I have listened to have I seen particulars of that. The only particulars we have, from looking at the speeches and listening to them, is from the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) who said it discriminates against a class of people, but there are no particulars as to which class and in what way it so discriminates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing I wish to observe in relation to the speakers who have gone before me is in relation to the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) who said that we needed to get a better phase in the debate and we needed to think about reconciliation. Members should remember that reconciliation involves an apology to the dissident women. That is what I am speaking about here tonight&mdash;the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> perils and the tyranny that the dissident women faced in this whole thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history of this particular saga is characterised by the following elements: conspiracy on a grand scale; deliberate denunciation and denigration of individuals, particularly the dissident women; contumelious disregard of those voices raised in support of the dissident women; a biased and partisan Australian Broadcasting Corporation; outrageous wasting of taxpayers money; and, as I said to some of the dissident women whom I met last night, a grave injustice to them. If any one issue was capable of signing a political death warrant for a minister, this was one. I believe it fed through to the government of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was another example of the failure of an ideology clouding ideas and judgment. When that occurs not only the body politic as a whole suffers but also the effect on the Australian community is profound. It brings with it a deep sense of mistrust and resentment towards Aboriginal people, thus fomenting the seeds of a racially based loathing. It makes the community angry and that anger gets in the way of the real issues that need to be addressed in this country so as to uplift its indigenous citizens. Unfortunately, the heroes of Hindmarsh&mdash;those dissident women&mdash;have largely been forgotten in the wash up of all of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They all deserve our utmost respect and admiration. These were brave women. Bertha Gollam, Dorothy Wilson and Dulcie Wilson have been, in a sense, the leaders of the dissidents in that they spoke out first. That is not to underplay the similar courage of the other women. These women&mdash;as Bill Hayden in a broader context in his letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> yesterday said&mdash;stood up to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.. the . . . bullying . . . by several, largely self&hyphen;appointed, political elites . . . determined to have us toe the line on what they state to be politically correct.</PARA>
<PARA>They were ordinary people who were not listened to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history of the setting up of the royal commission is quite clear. The dissident women claimed that the secret women's business was a fraud. The report was released and found that there was a fabrication of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6708"> women's business, particularly the claim that there was spiritual and cultural significance on Hindmarsh Island relating to the Aboriginal tradition of Ngarrindjeri women which was crucial for the reproduction of the Ngarrindjeri people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cosmos which supported their existence was fabricated. The claim that the women's business required the prohibition of the construction of the bridge was fabricated. The purpose of the fabrication was to obtain a declaration from the minister pursuant to section 10 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act to prevent the construction of the bridge. In other words, it was a monumental conspiracy&mdash;a grand false pretence&mdash;to induce a course of action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from the dissident women, few anthropologists emerged from this whole sorry business unscathed. Those who did and who were prepared to stand up to the establishment are to be commended. Those who chose to get caught up in it and those who chose to be silent have done their profession no  credit whatsoever. It highlights the existence of a deliberate anxiousness to get involved in creative anthropology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does this bode well for the deluge of native title claims? Already we have seen the Century Zinc debacle, where $50 million has been squandered, where a $1 billion development has been quarantined&mdash;not one ounce of zinc, not one job and no Aboriginal has been advanced one iota.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was most impressed with an article by Dulcie Wilson, one of the dissident women, titled, `Telling the Truth'. The building of the bridge was of no interest to this woman, yet she wanted no gross misrepresentation of her culture and origins. Let us look at the genesis of the conspiracy. Until 1994, there had been no indication of women's business or the fundamental cosmological importance of the region around Hindmarsh Island in the extensive literature about Ngarrindjeri.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An anti&hyphen;bridge coalition had been in existence and, when political and environmental objections failed, they turned to Aboriginal heritage issues, even though no concerns had been raised in the developer's earlier consultation with Ngarrindjeri representatives. This <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lobby led to the involvement of the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement, who were advised by ATSIC that the federal minister could have intervened if something of `greater cultural significance' was found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At about the same time, anthropologist Lindy Warrell told two senior Ngarrindjeri activists, `It would be nice if there was some women's business.' This anthropologist had been studying the women's business of the northern desert people. Within a few weeks, secret women's business emerged. Its key proponent was the Aboriginal activist, Doreen Kartinyeri.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At one meeting in the embryonic stage of the invention, where men were in attendance, an aerial map was being considered. One of the men said, `Doesn't that remind you of a woman's private parts?' I always wondered about this gem, since any ancient tradition would have required there to have been the presence of aeroplanes to examine an aerial view of the area. This obvious anomaly escaped the pathetic ABC but did not escape Dulcie Wilson, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was dismayed that such people would cheapen and degrade Ngarrindjeri women and culture in this way. How would our ancestors have known what an aerial view of Hindmarsh Island looked like . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Dulcie Wilson went on to talk of Doreen Kartinyeri, who was actually her second cousin. They both share the same great grandparents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Doreen Kartinyeri went to work at the Adelaide museum, where she was asked to record what she knew about Ngarrindjeri culture. In her own handwriting, she clearly said that she did not know anything about it, since she was raised in a children's home in Adelaide since the age of 10. But if she needed to know anything, she would pay Dulcie a visit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Kartinyeri's credibility was further damaged when she claimed, according to Dulcie:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was grandmother Sally who told her about women's business on Hindmarsh Island. When I pointed out to her that grandmother Sally was not a Ngarrindjeri woman but from another tribe on the west coast of South Australia, Doreen changed her story that it was really aunty Rosie who told her about women's business on Hindmarsh Island yet <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6709"> aunty Rosie's own step&hyphen;daughter was one of the dissident women who gave evidence at the Royal Commission. She said she had never been told anything by her step&hyphen;mother about such business and that she had a good relationship with her . . .</PARA>
<PARA>But creative anthropology ignored the implausibility of Kartinyeri and desperately struck out to make the facts fit the nonsense and give it the authority and presence of a study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An initial inquiry carried out by Professor Cheryl Saunders, which led to the 25&hyphen;year ban of construction on Hindmarsh Island by Minister Tickner, omitted a piece of information that was absolutely essential for any proper ministerial assessment of the claim. Saunders claimed that, in the secret oral tradition of the Ngarrindjeri women, the Hindmarsh Island region was crucial for the production of Ngarrindjeri people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most authoritative account of the traditional culture, based on research carried out by Ronald and Catherine Berndt in the early 1940s, had specially noted that there was no evidence that Ngarrindjeri had any gender based secret domain. Saunders claimed in her report that she had consulted Berndt's book, but she made no mention whatsoever of their finding, even though the book's index contains the entry `secret&hyphen;sacred issues, absence of'. In the foreword of the same book by Professor Robert Tomkinson, this feature was also stressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Elementary research techniques dictate that it is almost beyond comprehension that Professor Saunders would not have been aware of these matters. The inescapable conclusion is that she deliberately chose to ignore them. Saunders also noted that she did not have an anthropologist attached to her inquiry, but she made considerable use of a separate report by Dr Fergie, an anthropologist from the University of Adelaide appointed to work for the proponents of the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Saunders knew that Fergie had no expertise in Ngarrindjeri culture, and, indeed, at the time of the appointment Fergie had not even read the Berndt book. Fergie told the royal commission that her findings represented `a significant anthropological discovery'. One <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would have thought that it was fairly basic that such discoveries, whether significant or not, be identified as such. But this was not done in Fergie's report. Thus the conspiracy firmed up and fiction assumed the respectability of an appearance of fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the dissident women spoke out in May last year, the major Christian churches, the Labor Party, the Australian Democrats, women's groups, green groups, Aboriginal groups and even overseas welfare groups publicly supported the conspirators. None had bothered to research the matter or speak to the dissident women. This is the part I found most offensive: nobody gave them the decency to even speak to them and deliver a bit of natural justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The activist women who were part of the conspiracy had strong connections to the established Aboriginal power structures in Adelaide. Through the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement and ATSIC, they have had financial and legal support. They worked closely with the ABC to mount a campaign against the dissidents and the royal commission, so the ABC joined the conspiracy. The support of the fabricated claims was rock solid. It also helped Mr Tickner float his defence that the fabrication claims came from journalists, politicians, developers and complicit Aborigines for financial, political and racist aims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Stuart Littlemore, that paragon of media virtue, dedicated a whole program to run a facinorous line attempting to discredit three journalists who had investigated the fabrication. Every point Littlemore made in his program has been proved wrong by the royal commission, but he has never made an admission of this on his own program. Why did no ABC journalist, no church leader, no anthropologist, no Tickner aide or no environmentalist actually meet the dissident women to discuss the issues with them, assess their credibility and test their claim? This I find reprehensible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two notable exceptions to the conspiracy, as far as the anthropologists were concerned, were Phillip Jones and Phillip Clarke, who knew the truth and made sure it came out and placed their careers on the line. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6710"> Tickner would have portrayed these men as conservative rednecks out to discredit Aboriginal culture. This was strange behaviour for people who had built careers on their understanding of that culture. Dr Clarke is married to a Ngarrindjeri woman and they have a child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems that the former Attorney-General did not speak to the dissident women either. Like so many others, he was drawn into the vortex with former Minister Tickner and the apparent alliance between the minister and the conspirators. In a censure motion that the former Attorney-General moved on 7 March 1995, and in inappropriately extravagant language for the first law officer of the Crown, he vilified the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), now the Minister for Defence. It is an almost delicious stroke of irony that in the penultimate paragraph of his speech on the censure motion he said, in referring to the member for Barker:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He then has to answer why he completely disregarded the advice and opened the envelope which contained the material which was so sensitive to Aboriginal women. He and his entire staff knew about the entire background of the matter and the impact that it would have on Aboriginal women.</PARA>
<PARA>But look at the truth of the matter. Now that it has been found to be a total fabrication, a massive conspiracy, does the former Attorney-General, Mr Lavarch, have any idea the impact of what he said had on the dissident women? Has he apologised to Doreen Wilson and her brave comrades for his being so insensitive to the Aboriginal women who were being truthful and faithful to their Ngarrindjeri origins? It is interesting to quote Dulcie Wilson where she pertinently observes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I read an article a few months ago which referred to the views of Marcia Langton, an Aboriginal activist with whom I don't always agree; although on this occasion, I agree with her wholeheartedly. She complained about those Australian people who will not criticise or contradict Aboriginal people in any educated discussion. Such patronising behaviour, she says, should be condemned for it is treating Aboriginal people like children on the assumption that they cannot take criticism and lack the same intellectual and emotional capacity as other human beings.</PARA>
<PARA>I respectfully endorse those sentiments. It has saddened me over the years to see judges, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> magistrates and prosecutors treating Aboriginal witnesses and accused Aboriginals in this way. I regret to say that I myself have probably been guilty of this from time to time. Dulcie Wilson goes on to speak about the future of Aboriginal affairs in this country, given the fact that Aboriginal activists call the tune and expect the rest to dance to it. They have the power and authority of ATSIC behind them. She continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I see similarities between the Aboriginal situation in this country and what is happening in third world countries. Billions of dollars are poured into various Aboriginal projects and organisations with very little return and very little accountability. The "Aboriginal industry", for that is precisely what it is, is one of the most sought after industries to be employed in today by both Aboriginal and non&hyphen;Aboriginal people. Huge sums of money are being allocated to that industry ensuring long&hyphen;term employment and excellent financial remuneration for all concerned.</PARA>
<PARA>This statement highlights the ill&hyphen;directed policies towards Aboriginals in this country. These have produced a monolithic bureaucracy like ATSIC, with the chief executive on a salary package in excess of $200,000, but it continues to fail miserably to improve the lot of Aborigines and leaves the Torres Strait Islanders out in the cold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most disgraceful claims in this saga was that made by the moderator of the Uniting Church in South Australia. The moderator said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have conveyed my willingness to meet Mrs Dulcie Wilson at any time she wishes to have an interview with me.</PARA>
<PARA>She goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our hope for Dulcie Wilson and others who share her dilemma is that she will know God's love for Aboriginal people and discover fully the richness for them and their Aboriginal culture.</PARA>
<PARA>The hide of this senior church figure to refer to the honesty and decency of Dulcie, who had nothing to gain by telling the truth, as equating the telling of the truth to being in a dilemma&mdash;and this when Dulcie was an active member of the Uniting Church. Not unnaturally, Dulcie Wilson was appalled by this. At no time had any person conveyed the moderator's wishes to speak with Dulcie Wilson, but the last sentence left her speechless. She said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6711">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The very reason that I stood up to be counted was because of my love and concern for the Ngarrindjeri people who were being manipulated not only by some of their own key people but by other groups such as the CFMEU, Greenpeace and some other conservationists, the Friends of Hindmarsh Island and various others. Today I am proud of the dissident women who had the courage to tell the truth, against all odds, for secret women's business was indeed proved by the Royal Commission to be fabricated.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, the anthropologists in favour of the proponents' position have continued to make extraordinary claims in order to justify their position. I refer honourable members to an article written by Mr Ron Brunton in relation to that particular matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where does this leave the real issues confronting the Aboriginal people of Australia and the Torres Strait Islanders living in the Torres Strait and those living on the mainland? It yet again raises the question of whether ATSIC can continue to justify its existence. More than $4 million has been wasted in relation to this farce. The opposition, not content with this waste of money, seems to be saying that there should be yet another inquiry. This is absurd. When are the crucial issues affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders going to be addressed? When are we going to fulfil our obligations to those disadvantaged and culturally repressed people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The clear picture that emerged to me from a recent visit to the Torres Strait Islands was that Torres Strait Islanders would, through their island councils, prefer to deal directly with government rather than through ATSIC and the Torres Strait Regional Authority. As one of them pointed out, echoing the words of Senator Herron:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We don't want a trickle coming out of the fire hose after it has been through all the commissions and bureaucracies before the money gets to us.</PARA>
<PARA>Having observed the obscenity of 35 barristers appearing in the High Court in the recent Waanyi case, and estimating the cost of those barristers, together with their instructing solicitors, as well in excess of $1 million, I say again that there is a cry for help out there amongst Aboriginal people and there is a cry for help amongst Torres Strait Islander peo <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ple. Are we, as legislators, in the best position to heed those cries or are we unfortunately becoming bogged down in the mire of bureaucracy and ineptitude?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the Torres Strait Islanders, is it not now their time to be recognised as a completely independent ethnic group, yet Australians nonetheless? Why are they lumped together with Aboriginal people? Likewise, why are Aboriginal people not recognised as a separate individual ethnic group of people? Why are they lumped together with Torres Strait Islanders? It is insulting and patronising in the extreme to so lump them together. Does this not recognise and perpetuate the continual errors that Australians make in the area of administration for policies for indigenous Australians? Why can't we look seriously at real autonomy for these people of the Torres Strait? I think it would be a tremendous thing for Torres Strait Islanders to be given a goal to aspire to, to develop real autonomy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my recent visit to the Torres Strait Islands I made the following note about autonomy: the evolution of ultimate autonomy for the Torres Strait comes from individual autonomy as per each island, for with island autonomy comes economic autonomy, which will encourage the return home from the mainland of Torres Strait Islanders. With economic autonomy comes the capacity to integrate ideas with other islands. With the integration of other ideas with other islands comes real autonomy&mdash;that is, the capacity to be an independent territory capable of existing as a governing territory for the peace, good order and good government of the whole of the relevant Torres Strait islands and their inhabitants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Likewise, I completely endorse views that there should be bottom end funding as far as Aboriginal communities are concerned. For many people out there self-interest unfortunately does prevail&mdash;those who only wish to see the never&hyphen;ending bucket of money supply for metaphysical issues that are not advancing the standards of health, education, job training and employment opportunities for any Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander and along the way perpetuating a myth of reconciliation <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6712"> when there can be no reconciliation under the present entrenched bureaucracies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill indicates that the government, along with the people of Australia, have had enough of what has been going on. In my view, we should hail it as a breakthrough in this area. We should belatedly hail Bertha Gollan, Dorothy Wilson and Dulcie Wilson as heroines of the Ngarrindjeri people. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am disappointed that, with the government's last speaker on the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill, we have come down to the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) outlining his conspiracy theory. Unfortunately, he left out the Communists under his bed, but everyone else was in on this grand conspiracy to stop the Hindmarsh Island Bridge going ahead. It is interesting that that view has been put forward before the House this afternoon because we all know&mdash;and the coalition knows&mdash;that there is nothing to stop the Hindmarsh Island Bridge going ahead right now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is just a publicity stunt. It is part of the government's campaign of code against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country. It is part of a code which says, `We'll single them out for special treatment.' But it will not be special treatment in terms of lifting up the most discriminated group in our society. It is not about that; it is a different sort of code. It is about applying two sets of standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dickson had the hide to raise the fact that the head of ATSIC is on $200,000 a year. Effectively, she is the equivalent of a departmental head. Really! This week we have had questions to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) about the head of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, who is known in my stated as `Max the Axe', who is on over $200,000 and picking up 50 grand for a part-time job as chair of a committee in Victoria, appointed by the Victorian government. That is okay because he is part of the establishment! We do not talk about excessive salaries in the bureaucracy there. We do not talk about how much those people are earning. We have the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Prime Minister standing up and saying, `Oh, well, he can't get his super.' Then we had him coming into the House and saying, `Well, he can get a bit of his super but he can't get all of it.' We continually hear two standards being applied on the basis of race by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have already indicated that the opposition believes that this piece of legislation is completely unnecessary. If you want to achieve the coalition's objective of getting the bridge built, whatever the cost, it simply can go ahead. It is just a stunt to demonstrate to developers that they can now feel relaxed and comfortable about the prospect of future projects without having to worry about minor details such as the protection of significant Aboriginal sites.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have already spoken about the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984. It is very clear that the minister has discretionary power. Elizabeth Evatt noted in her review of that act:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister can protect the area or site by making a declaration. This is a discretionary power. Even if the area is significant according to Aboriginal tradition, the Minister has to consider the report and take account of all interests, before deciding whether or not to make a declaration to protect the area or site. There is no right to a declaration of protection.</PARA>
<PARA>What is the point of this act before the House now? The government clearly has the numbers; it clearly has an overwhelming majority in the House of Representatives. The basis of putting this bill forward can be viewed only as being an ideological one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last night the person who wrote the legislation, the former minister, Clyde Holding, indicated very clearly the history of the bill to this House. The history of the bill was that the minister did have discretion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, this is a stunt, but it is a stunt at the expense of the Ngarrindjeri people of South Australia. The coalition has a shameful record in relation to the Hindmarsh Island Bridge issue and with this bill is further demonstrating their commitment to disenfranchising indigenous people in this country. With this bill the Ngarrindjeri will suffer the brunt of coalition ideology, which shows no <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6713"> respect to the spiritual beliefs of the original peoples of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition is not even prepared to investigate for themselves whether or not there should be protection for the site. They are introducing this legislation to override the Commonwealth Heritage Protection Act in one specific case so that they can ensure they get the result they want. Surely the job of Senator Herron as Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs should be to protect Aboriginal heritage, not to deliberately set out to undermine it and have it destroyed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout this entire affair the coalition has shown its ideological motivation again and again. I was interested to read, for example, a press release from the Minister for Defence, the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), last month in which he attempted to attack my colleague, the member for Banks (Mr Melham), about the opposition's position on this issue. Because it is the fashion, all the polls that the government is doing are showing that there is a political incentive to get stuck into Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people&mdash;that it is popular out there. The member for Banks has not walked away from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; the Labor Party will not be walking away either. I am proud to be associated with the member for Banks in his stance on this and on other issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members will no doubt recall that the member for Barker was forced to resign from the front bench last year over his involvement in copying and distributing information about the secret spiritual beliefs of Ngarrindjeri people. What a disgraceful affair that was. It is this kind of hypocrisy which marks the government's approach to indigenous affairs. The action of the South Australian Liberal government in staging the farce of a royal commission into the spiritual beliefs of a community of indigenous women, at great expense to the taxpayer, was shameful. In what other community has there been an inquiry into the community's spiritual beliefs? What other one?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over there you have got a mob called the Lyons Forum who have a particular spiritual belief. You can imagine the reaction of people <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> like the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) or the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) if we said, `We're going to have a royal commission into your beliefs; into whether you can prove the Holy Trinity exists.' What if we said, `We're going to have a royal commission into Islam,' or into any other religious or spiritual belief? It simply has not happened. There would be outrage if anyone suggested it. But, for the indigenous people of this country, it is fair game, open slather. You can accuse them of whatever you like. It is expected that it is all part of making that community accountable. Once again we see that the standard that is expected of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is a different one from that which is expected of those who have arrived in Australia, bringing their spiritual beliefs, in the last 200 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No other section of our society has to endure the contempt for its religious beliefs that has been shown by the coalition to indigenous people. Last year, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Michael Dodson, spoke about the Liberal Party's obsession with Hindmarsh Island when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The right to religious freedom and respect for spiritual beliefs lies at the heart of human rights. It is a right which all Australians are obliged to respect, and all Australians entitled to enjoy. And that principle holds, irrespective of whose beliefs are at issue, or on what basis those beliefs are held. What we have in [the South Australian] royal commission is the abuse of the human rights of Aboriginal people masquerading as lofty legal procedure. Pull off the mask and what you see is nothing short of state sanctioned racism.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pull off the mask and what is revealed is a royal commission which has been called at the behest of a political party with its nose out of joint.</PARA>
<PARA>Take note of this. It is not the Labor Party he is talking about; it is the current government. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A political party with its nose out of joint, a media industry desperate to drum up a scandal, and worst of all, that element of Australian society still determined to invalidate indigenous cultures and annihilate indigenous peoples.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I find it increasingly difficult not to be cynical about the fine rhetoric of cultural diversity. We can freely sing our songs and tell our stories&mdash;especially if those songs and stories can be marketed for a tidy profit. But the moment that the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6714"> protection of those songs and stories may come into conflict with the economic interests of non&hyphen;indigenous society, we are told they have no place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is both astonishing and contemptible that in this [international year of tolerance] the right to practice one's religion and freely hold one's beliefs can be called before a royal commission.</PARA>
<PARA>A report by Justice Jane Mathews was tabled by the current Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) in the Senate in September this year. In it, Justice Mathews referred to the sincerity of the applicants. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is necessary as a preliminary matter to assess the applicants' sincerity when they say that the Hindmarsh Island area is significant for them, particularly as the dissident women in the royal commission generally disclaimed any knowledge of the island as a significant place. I must say that in general I was satisfied of the genuineness of most of the people who made oral submissions to me when they asserted the significance of this area to them.</PARA>
<PARA>Justice Mathews went on to talk about the documentation which had been placed before the royal commission by Elizabeth&mdash;Betty&mdash;Fisher, who was an amateur historian. Mrs Fisher indicated to the commission that she had been told of the existence of women's business at Hindmarsh Island in the late 1960s by a Ngarrindjeri elder, Rebecca Wilson. Mrs Wilson is now deceased, and so is obviously unable to forward any evidence. This report actually looked at the validity of the notes that were made at the time&mdash;that is, in the 1960s&mdash;by Elizabeth Fisher. The report tabled by Senator Herron in the Senate in September says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mrs Fisher's original notes were included with the applicants' representation. At a time when it appeared that the issue of `women's business' was still a live one, I took the step of submitting this material for scientific analysis in order to determine its age. Had the notes been written in pen, the ink could readily have been dated. However pencil is not susceptible of dating, so it was only the paper which was analysed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The analysis proved to be a time consuming affair. It was not until the last weeks of the reporting process that the results came to hand. These are set out in Appendix 12 to this Report. As the Minister will see, the results generally favour Mrs Fisher's account that she wrote these notes in the late 1960s or early 1970s. One of the two groups of pages is said to date back to at least the early 1970s. The other set was less easy to date and the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> findings are inconclusive. Nevertheless it appears not to be of recent origin.</PARA>
<PARA>So I say to the member for Dickson that, when he speaks about facts being put before the parliament in this debate, there is one which has not been refuted by the other side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill really is typical of the coalition's approach to indigenous affairs. It is no wonder that someone with views like Pauline Hanson's could find themselves preselected by the Liberal Party. The member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), I am sure, will be voting with the government on this issue because the whipping up of racial hatred has been supported, in code, by some on the other side, either by their failure to speak out against those views or by the preaching of code by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in seeking to deny Australia's history and in seeking to allege that somehow Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders did not have it all that bad and that the education system is to blame for preaching the facts that occurred with the invasion of this country more than 200 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To introduce a bill which is specifically designed to override the existing legal rights of a particular community, rights to which all other Australians are entitled, and to do it in the way in which it has been clearly put before this parliament, this legislation not being necessary for the Hindmarsh Island Bridge to go ahead, it is little wonder that we see this attack as purely ideological.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very happy to be associated with the former minister, Robert Tickner&mdash;and we can debate which ministers' decisions were right or wrong&mdash;because he worked for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders with nothing but great motivation, nothing but the best intentions and nothing but hard work in a portfolio which no&hyphen;one gets any thanks for. To suggest, as those on the other side have, that he had some ulterior motive in putting this forward and in his actions on Hindmarsh Island Bridge really is a disgrace. It is just appalling. I do not step away from my association with Robert Tickner as a minister and as someone whom I am pleased to call a friend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no accident that since 2 March we have seen racial intolerance increasing in this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6715"> society. Compare the actions or the silence of the current Prime Minister with the actions of the former Prime Minister. At the same time in his prime ministership, when this Prime Minister is talking about not talking about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history, as if everything was okay, Paul Keating was giving a speech at Redfern, the greatest speech on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs ever given by an Australian leader. In it he acknowledged the past&mdash;he did not run away from it&mdash;and he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we took the traditional lands and smashed the traditional way of life; we brought the diseases and the alcohol; we committed the murders; we took the children from their mothers; we practised discrimination and exclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was our ignorance and our prejudice and our failure to imagine these things being done to us. With some noble exceptions we failed to make the most basic human response and enter into their hearts and minds. We failed to ask: How would I feel if this were done to me?</PARA>
<PARA>With the bill before the House today, I ask: would the government have the courage to move a bill such as this&mdash;talking about spiritual beliefs being rubbish, the sorts of speeches that they have given&mdash;against the Christian community, against the Islamic community, against the Hindu community or against any other section of our society? If there were an attempt to do this against the Christian community, all of us on this side would have the same view we have on this issue, but we would be joined by those on the other side because it would be an outrage. It is not a legal case. Spiritual beliefs are not something which you can simply cast an objective legal view over. That is not the way it works, and I suggest that it should not have worked in this case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only is this bill unnecessary to allow the building of Hindmarsh Island Bridge; it demonstrates the government's attitude, which has been pretty poor to date and shows no signs of improving in the near future. If it is the case that the amendments moved by the shadow minister saying that the Racial Discrimination Act should not be overridden by the bill are unnecessary, then vote for those amendments. This is your chance to prove how fair dinkum you are. At worst, it is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unnecessary. That is your argument. But there has been no argument that it should not go ahead. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) to stay in the parliament for five minutes, if he would, because I would like to give him a little bit of history in regard to the matters that he has raised in his speech, and I do so from a very authoritative work. Firstly, I want to speak to him in answer to his statements that this legislation is not necessary. He used words such as `giving Aboriginal people their legal rights'. This is not about people's legal rights so much as it is about people's rights to litigate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, as we stand here today, I have read newspaper reports referring to the legal costs that have been involved in this case. As I see it, the costs of paying the legal profession in this matter now exceed the cost of building the bridge. The purpose of this legislation is simply to do one thing: to stop the cash flow of taxpayers' money to lawyers. You mentioned that the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) has given us the benefit of his legal knowledge when he said that he could fix it. I hope on all occasions that he would be prepared and that his firm Holding Redlich, or whatever it was called, would be prepared to take both sides of any future action so that the taxpayers at least are not obliged to meet the costs on both sides, which, as I say, now exceed the cost of the bridge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is really what I wanted the member for Grayndler to listen to for a minute. I was interested in the member's total defence of people's right to their spiritual beliefs, and I see that the shadow minister agrees. I just want to acquaint him with a little bit of history. My folks have lived in Western Australia since the first ships and they became seafaring people. I have often said that, if my grandfather had not died when my dad was six months old, I would probably be the secretary of the Seamens Union. As it so happened, I got divorced a bit from that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having made that rather light-hearted comment, I want to come to a very serious thing. I happen to be Charles Wilson Tuckey <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6716"> and my great&hyphen;grandfather, Charles Tuckey, rescued two survivors of a shipwreck in 1857. It was the shipwreck of the barque <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stefano</EMPHASIS>, which had come out of Yugoslavia and was taking coal to Hong Kong. It was shipwrecked on the North West Cape. Ten people got ashore, eight perished and the Aboriginal people, a tribe living in that area, picked up the last two, probably because that was all they could feed. And I make that as a statement of view and nothing else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They looked after these two people. The tribe knew something that the survivors did not know, that once a year my great&hyphen;grandfather, on his return from Broome where he used to sail for pearling, would drop in there and drop off his surplus stores to this tribe. They knew that the time would come when he would come in and they could transfer these two Yugoslavs, one of whom was the son of the shipowning family and who later migrated to America. Anyhow, they were duly rescued and they were taken to Fremantle, got back to their native country and got hold of the village priest; and they wrote in great detail the story of their time on the cape with these Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The story was so authentic that, when a grandson of the shipwrecked person, now in his 80s, visited Western Australia some time ago with the decision to convert these detailed notes into a book which he called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The wreck of the barque Stefano</EMPHASIS>&mdash;and I have the cover sheet here&mdash;we sent him up there to this pastoral property. He said, `If we go in here and up there according to my grandfather's notes, we will actually find a small well', and the pastoralist said, `No well there, mate.' And they walked the distance and they found the well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say all of that because I want to establish the authenticity of what I am going to read to you. But further, I want to say something. This is not a story about Aboriginal people. It is about two white shipwrecked men. But this is just part of the story, quoted in the first case. It tells us:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was jolted out of my meditation . . . Loud, dolorous cries arose from the midst of the tribe&mdash;the cries of a poor mother who for the past few days had been watching over her sick child. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>The child died. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Meanwhile, funeral preparations were progressing. The parents of the dead child, in what I suspect was a gesture of grief or sacrifice, threw into the sea the fish they had saved from the precious catch. Nearby, a huge fire was started and it quickly became a deep bed of glowing coals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Somehow, I sensed what was about to happen even though not a word was spoken. The child's corpse was laid atop the glowing coals. All of us gathered around the pyre. Quickly and mysteriously, I realised that this was not to be a cremation. The young one was being roasted for a gruesome meal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It began with the first portion being offered to the father who had gone alone to the top of a nearby hill. The mother was served next as we all sat around the dying embers. Then everyone else was served until the small corpse was completely consumed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">After the feast, the bones were gathered with a semblance of religious ritual and devotion. I found myself participating in the ceremony without the slightest hesitation or any thought of impropriety.</PARA>
<PARA>What I am about to say is that, when we start being so singular as to say that the religions of the past must be respected, of course they cannot. We could not possibly condone that. I am not criticising it. It was their religion and it was not their mythology. It was their genuine religion. So I ask people who stand up and make those sorts of generalisations to think again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And I can take you to other examples that have been brought to my attention by mission people. We talk of the stolen children, yet many of the old mission people told me that they frequently took the girls of the tribe to prevent infanticide because there were too many girls. Again, we know that is still practised in parts of the world. I do not stand here to criticise it, but I say to you that you cannot generalise and stand up and say, as the member for Grayndler has just done, that people have an unfettered right to practise their religious beliefs&mdash;certainly not as they reside in culture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me also ask, in terms of all this, that people start to separate mythology and culture. I want to address that at the moment, when in fact I proposed to address it later in my speech. Surely, there is mythology but, when it comes to the conduct of business of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6717"> government, it is up to ministers, in particular when they are called upon to make decisions which have a very substantial effect on other individuals&mdash;also Australians, also protected by the Racial Discrimination Act&mdash;to ensure that those people get justice and that mythology is not allowed to override common and current scientific information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the whole Hindmarsh Island thing blew up&mdash;whether there was a belief or otherwise is another matter, but the royal commission said there was a fabrication&mdash;one would have thought that the minister&mdash;whether he was prepared to open those sealed envelopes is another matter also&mdash;would have taken account of some of the matters discussed in the press. What were those matters? A previous member made some comment on this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a reference to the shape of the island and its relationship with a woman's anatomy. We are not talking about today's circumstances; we are talking about culture. Where in the culture of Aboriginal people was cartography? Where was it? They, unfortunately, lacked even a written language. They were not cartographers. They did not have aeroplanes to do aerial photography. They would not have had any idea about the shape of that island 200 years ago. By the way, the situation I described in that other book was in 1857. The reality is that they would not have known. So how can that be part of their culture?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was also a suggestion that the Aboriginal women had a link with the island because they went over there to abort babies. I lived in the town of Carnarvon from 1958 to 1980 as both a hotel keeper and a local government person in various capacities, including shire president, and one-third of that town's population were of Aboriginal descent. During the time I was there we went to the camps on all the adjoining pastoral properties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all of my long connection with Aboriginals I was never once aware of an Aboriginal woman even seeking an abortion. The Aboriginal women became pregnant and did not seek abortions. To suggest that they did that because a white man was involved is patently ridiculous. I am yet to be told how they got <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the island because the making and using of boats was something that frequently even river people did not do&mdash;though sometimes they did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that these are silly propositions, but they get worse. They said, `If you build this bridge, all our women will cease to be able to conceive.' Modern scientific evidence says that could not be so. Consequently, it is silly. You cannot as a government or a parliament be convinced by these matters in this regard.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Grayndler also made the point that we have never had a royal commission into a religion. I think we had one into Scientology. Tell me it was not a religion&mdash;I think the royal commission said that.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We still have around the world a group of people known as the Flat Earth Society. I can concede them their beliefs, but they better not try to stop me from flying around the world in an aeroplane. They should not stand in the way of building airports. One might wonder when some minister is going to ban the construction of a new airport on the grounds that the Flat Earth Society suggests that the earth is flat and that, if planes take off from that airport, they will end up disappearing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Robert Tickner was called into a public works project in South Australia, he allowed himself to be influenced by very silly propositions. I think he ignored the Racial Discrimination Act because his responsibility as a minister was to apply it fairly&mdash;in other words, not discriminate for any people of any race.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We make a lot of the Racial Discrimination Act in these debates. We talk about it and ignore its provisions. As we know, the act is only a very brief piece of legislation, but <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6718"> attached to it is the United Nations convention, which forms part of the act. Article 1, paragraph 4, especially prohibits positive discrimination with some pretty tight conditions. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Special measures taken for the sole purpose of securing adequate advancement of certain racial or ethnic groups or individuals requiring such protection as may be necessary in order to ensure such groups or individuals equal enjoyment or exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms shall not be deemed racial discrimination, provided, however, that such measures do not, as a consequence, lead to the maintenance of separate rights for different racial groups and that they shall not be continued after the objectives for which they were taken have been achieved.</PARA>
<PARA>We have a heritage act. We have substantial legislation to protect Australia's heritage. Why then do we need an Aboriginal heritage act, other than to make money for lawyers? Why can the courts not deal with those matters as heritage matters? Of course there are items, things on the record, property, caves and other things that are of great significance, but even those issues should be taken in proper context. It is ridiculous for us to suggest that everything that some Aboriginal person says is right is right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although Mr Dodson is extremely well paid by the government to represent Aboriginal interests, when he stood for election to ATSIC, as I recollect, he got less than 20 votes. The reality is that he is not seen by people at the grassroots of the Aboriginal community as being one who supports their views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to repeat that the facts of life are that if we were to entrench every aspect of Aboriginal culture, heritage and religion we would be having some royal commissions all right. But in the case of the Hindmarsh Island matter the realities are that there is a lot of credit to be given to the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan). The member for Barker saw his responsibility as representing the interests of all the people in his electorate, not just a very special interest group which, from all the evidence we have seen, had one agenda. It was not an agenda to protect Aboriginal interests; they had taken the briefs from some <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people who were opposed to a public works development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point has been made by some speakers that those women who gave all the original evidence refused point blank, on some moral platform, to attend the royal commission. I have to say that they knew very well that if they went there and restated the sorts of issues they had put up, they would have had a great chance of being charged with perjury. The royal commissioner quite properly found the whole process a fabrication. But the point I want to make about this is the grave damage that is done by processes of this nature to the genuine needs of Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is always a fact that my time seems to escape very quickly&mdash;and that is a great pity. I wish we were not having this debate. I wish Hindmarsh Bridge was built and the Chapmans were profiting from it and people were able to buy nice blocks of land and enjoy the river view because I would like to be talking about what the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> told us on 30 October when it talked about Pat O'Shane's speech on black family violence and our inability to address that, along with the glaucoma, the alcoholism and the substance abuse. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, in its editorial, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is compelling evidence to suggest that domestic violence and physical and sexual abuse of children is widespread among Aboriginal communities but public acknowledgment of this is rare. . . There is other evidence the problem needs urgent attention. Statistics from the Northern Territory and the Kimberley region suggest that Aboriginal women are roughly 33 times more likely to die as a result of domestic violence than other Australians. The Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care has estimated up to 50 per cent of Aboriginal children are victims of family violence.</PARA>
<PARA>And the article goes on. They are the issues for us. We still have failed to address them as a parliament and as a past government. I think there are some intentions now to try to get to those issues but we are still arguing over a bridge on the basis of what people have put forward, people who live an urban lifestyle today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say that there are a few things that really start to annoy me. Fancy instituting into <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6719"> Aboriginal culture the word `business'. They never did business; they were self&hyphen;supporting groups. They did not trade to any extent. But all of a sudden that is a nice catchy word that the European community understand&mdash;women's business. Let me tell you something from all my knowledge of them: women were not consulted on very much and they did not have too many secrets. It was a silly proposition and a silly proposition for a minister to use a law in the way he did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what was the great achievement of all of that? You turned tens of thousands, if not millions, of Australians against Aboriginal people because the general population is not so silly. They know that building a bridge will not stop women having babies; they know that a minister, as the judge eventually told him, must open the evidence before making a decision. In the end, they took it out on the minister and his electorate and, more importantly, we hear all these other issues that are running around today. It is totally silly. When one reads the entire book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Wreck of the Barque Stefano</EMPHASIS> one will get a great idea of Aboriginal life in 1857 in a remote area. I can tell you that it was very tough and very difficult, and they lived on the verge of starvation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do know something about the act. I have watched it over a number of years and every occasion on which it has been used has been contentious. I do not believe the act is working in anybody's interest. There are times <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> when this act needs to be used and it is clearly to the benefit of Aboriginal people. In the end, Aboriginal people have the right to have their beliefs and, in the end, broader Australian society has to say, `Are we prepared to say that Aboriginal culture means something?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first occasion on which it was used was on the Alice Springs dam. I have to say I think that was a legitimate use. I was shadow minister at the time and provided very little criticism. There was culture that was in danger&mdash;and that dam did not go ahead. The second case in which it was used was at Broome where there was a walking track between two sites that were used for initiation and which were still in current use. Some of my colleagues would disagree with me but my view was that it was used legitimately then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been very difficult and very painful and has done the whole issue of Aboriginal heritage no assistance. In the end, you either take the position that any Aboriginal person has the right to make any claim whatsoever at any time without any challenge, even if that claim is not backed up by other Aboriginal people, even if there is no historical precedent backing it up; or you say that somehow these claims must be contestable. I do not see anything in between those two positions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of Alice Springs and that of Broome, they were contestable. There was independent evidence. There were things that one could look at whereby one could say, `Okay, there's some way of looking at this and some way of saying that it's probably fair and reasonable.' Where this has been different and where it has been unique is that, in its use of the act, it has been completely incontestable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end, I do not think society is prepared to accept a situation whereby any person can make any claim whatsoever, without any corroborating evidence. In the end, the consequences of that would be catastrophic. I think this whole episode has probably made the Australian public less tolerant of the notion of Aboriginal culture and its preservation than would have been <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6720"> otherwise. I have to say I am very saddened by this whole process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister has moved some amendments about which I think I should just put a couple of things on the record&mdash;and in this I am indebted to the minister who has given me advice on this matter. The government's legal advice is that the bill is consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. We have provided copies of this advice to the opposition on an in-confidence basis. Consequently, the government sees no need for the opposition's amendment. If the amendment were totally benign, perhaps we could look at it differently. But our first piece of advice is that agreeing to this amendment would provide grounds for a legal challenge which would have negligible chance of success and which would add further delay in terms of time and further waste of money in this case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing that we are advised is that this is a precedent that has not been set and would provide a precedent for other legislation. Thirdly, if we agreed to the amendment, and in the unlikely event that our advice was incorrect and the bill was in fact in breach of the RDA, then the bill would be ineffective to close off a section 10 process in relation to Hindmarsh Island and the minister would once again have to appoint a reporter. This would only delay the whole process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This saga has to be brought to an end once and for all. The legal advice that the government has is that this is the best way to do it. So, consistent with what we have said previously, the bill will do this. We have been advised that it is consistent with the RDA. In the end, we would hope that it would be supported by the opposition if they are serious about ending this whole saga.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night I made the comment in my speech on the second reading that the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill 1996 is the bill we don't have to have. All of the debate during the second reading speech confirms that is the case. The government has not been able to refute the claims that I made during my speech on the second reading that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) has absolute discretion. There is no protection order in existence and there is nothing stopping this bridge from proceeding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of this legislation can fairly be described as the Ian McLachlan payback bill. It should not be the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill 1996; it should be the Ian McLachlan payback bill. That is the real title that should be given to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill should not be allowed a commencement date. It would be a shameful thing if there is a Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill on the statute books at the time of the Olympics. It is not necessary. This bill needs to be trashed by the government. There is no doubt that there are the numbers in the House to pass this bill. It is questionable whether there will be the numbers in the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say that there should be no commencement date for this bill. It should not receive royal assent. There is plenty of time, between the time that this House and the Senate consider the bill, for the minister to follow due process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former minister for Aboriginal affairs, Robert Tickner, was attacked over his handling of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge affair. He attempted to follow due process. He was litigated against. What is the first act of this government with this new Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs? They introduce the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill that shows they have no confidence in the minister following due process. The new minister has the benefit of a number of Federal Court decisions and a number of High Court decisions. That is why this bill is not necessary. That is why the title of this bill really should not be the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill should not have a commencement date. One reason it should not receive royal assent is that it could be seen to favour one side over the other. There is no need for this parliament to take sides on this debate. The previous minister was criticised for taking sides. The same argument can be levelled against the current government. What should happen is that the current minister should follow due process and he should adjudicate accordingly in exercising his discretion. If he does that, the law is clear. His discretion cannot be challenged successfully in the court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will talk about RDA matters when considering the amendment that I will be moving later. This bill sends the wrong message to the community. Last week we had bipartisan support for a motion to do with race relations. I said then in that debate that the Racial Discrimination Act was paramount. We do not need the uttering of words; we need action. We need the government and the opposition banding together in a constructive fashion. That is what is so sad about a bill such as this going on the statute books.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government needs to do its homework. It has the benefit of Federal Court decisions now. It will have the cooperation of the opposition. It does not need this legislation to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6722"> allow the bridge to proceed. I find this legislation offensive in the extreme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If, as other speakers on our side have said, this was an attack on Christian beliefs, the Lyons Forum would be outraged. Instead, they have led the charge on this. That is why we say there should be no commencement date on this bill. That is why we say there should be no Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill. Let the minister follow due process and exercise his discretion accordingly. He can do it much quicker than the proposal&mdash;and that sends the right message. We want to put an end to this saga.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The truth is that the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill is totally unnecessary. Its true purpose is to make a political point and to identify that political point with some suggestion that there was a failing in the previous government. In truth, what is being sought is a blame shifting exercise. There is no plausible reason to do this other than the political intention of the government to pursue and to create a bogeyman and to blame that bogeyman for its own failure to act decisively and to put this matter behind us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that the genesis of this matter was most unfortunate. I do not believe that that course of events did anything more than to reveal that Robert Tickner, a minister of great goodwill and compassion, was confronted by a circumstance which he found difficult to resolve in a manner which made certain that he took into account all the very complex issues that came before him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In doing so, there is no doubt, however, that the process was unduly prolonged, but what we know now is sufficient to enable us to put this behind us. The failure of the government to do this&mdash;instead, it came before this parliament with quite unnecessary legislation&mdash;can only really be sourced home to the fact that they wish to make a political point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> It is most unfortunate they are making a political point in an environment where people are already less than moderate in some of their expressions about this issue. The truth is we know now that on the public record, as a result of various court cases and proceed ings, there is sufficient material for the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) to be able to exercise a discretion either to proceed directly to a decision to allow the bridge to proceed or, should he wish to use a belt and braces approach, to commission a very short process to give him a formal report and then proceed to allowing the bridge to be built. Either course is open to him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, legislation is being brought before the parliament which, on the government's own advice&mdash;as represented by the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs previously&mdash;is drafted in such a way that it will not accept a proposal by the opposition that would ensure that transparently on its face it is not in breach of the Racial Discrimination Act. The government asserts that its own legal opinion is to the effect that this bill does not violate the Racial Discrimination Act, yet it does not have confidence in its own legal advice so that it will accept an opposition amendment which will confirm that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole point of this, however, is that it ought not get to this stage. We are debating an issue, again in a partisan and an unnecessary way, which we ought put behind us collectively and avoid this blame and assertion of guilt as to whose fault it was, when in truth the whole interest of this parliament should be to see that the issue is resolved in a way which puts the interests of Aboriginal people and the interests of the community as a whole at the front and does not subject it to these kinds of quite unnecessary processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) is absolutely right in what he says. We hold advice that says this legislation is unnecessary. The minister can proceed directly to the course the government wishes to pursue. The minister does have a power under the act as its exists, but he chooses not to exercise it. The government has chosen to come to this parliament, and it is an abuse of this parliamentary process to do so. The true title of the bill should be the `Hindmarsh Island (Shifting of Blame) Bill' where the government is trying, through this political device, to simply make a political point at the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6723"> expense of the time of this parliament and the possible violation of the commitment of the parliament and both sides of it to the utmost paramountcy of the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to enter quickly into this debate on the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill. I do not want to delay the House. Last night I pointed out the damage this government by this foolish action, this unnecessary action, this unnecessary piece of legislation, was doing not to the parliament but to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first period of his ministry, as I have already said on a number of occasions, in the most difficult and complex portfolio that exists in this government, it is important for the minister to establish the confidence of the indigenous people of this country. From time to time, he will have to make decisions which will not be popular decisions. You cannot run this portfolio on the basis of being loved by all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When he was in a situation where all he had to do was exercise his own discretion&mdash;and the exercise of that discretion could have meant this bridge could have been up and on its way now&mdash;what was the government's reaction? The government's reaction was to bring in legislation which takes the power away from the minister and creates a situation where Aboriginal people around Australia&mdash;and word travels quickly through that community&mdash;are able to say in respect of one area of land which is important to them, the Boobera Lagoon, that the minister has had a report sitting on his desk since 22 April and still has not processed it. The complexity of the matter was dealt with by the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham). The minister still has not been dealt with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what is the message for Aboriginal leadership in Australia? Some of those leaders have already made some pretty heavy comments about this minister. What is the message this government delivers to Aboriginal people, whether they are in Uluru, Kakadu, Western Australia or South Australia? For a cheap, tawdry, political exercise, the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> message they are sending out is this: we want you to know we don't have any confidence in this minister. We don't believe you can really trust him to exercise his discretion. We don't think he has the capacity or necessarily the ability to say, `This bridge is going ahead. You've had your day in court, and that is finished. Any further applications will be regarded as vexatious.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aboriginal people have had many disappointments under a whole range of ministers, but they admire honesty, integrity and, above all, strength. If this minister has any principle left, he ought to walk round to the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and put his resignation on the table. This bill and the actions of this government in order to pursue a vendetta for and on behalf of the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan), and in order to get themselves in position in respect of a forthcoming state election, uses and abuses the processes of the parliament. They are using their numbers to say to this minister, `We don't trust you to exercise your discretion.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This week the Tasmanian Salmonid Growers Association has been up with another supply of salmon, and some members of this House have partaken in some of that. Members might also be aware that I have been known to cook a little salmon for members on my side of the House from time to time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Salmon is one of Tasmania's fundamental new farming products. It is a relatively new industry that is reliant on the fact that Tasmania is virtually disease free. The reason that I wish to speak tonight is that I am still very concerned about the future of this industry. We are still being held to ransom by the continued threat of imported fresh salmon from Canada.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6724">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was glad to hear the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) express his concerns on 11 September about the problems relating to cooked chicken, salmon and other such products to be imported. He understands the risks that Australia faces if such imports are permitted without very careful scrutiny. Yes, our quarantine decisions must be made on sound scientific and technical bases. Also, these decisions must flow from a proper process of risk assessment. We must have a consistent approach, as was recommended in the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I, like the member for Paterson, am concerned that AQIS's perception of risk management is sufficiently aware of the real risks of bringing in these other diseases&mdash;especially to Tasmania, where even the fruit and vegetables from the mainland are brought in through strict quarantine barriers. Senator Paul Calvert was also sufficiently concerned to speak about AQIS's findings on 31 October. He expressed the opinion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decisions will have to be very well founded before I ever have anything to do with them or even give support to any of them.</PARA>
<PARA>So I would like to remind honourable members that those members had those concerns, that any decision should be made on proper scientific grounds and that they should put the safety of Australia's industry first.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard that there is a move to trade off salmon for beef and sugar exports&mdash;therefore trading off a couple of seats in Tasmania. The honourable member for Braddon wants to be well aware of what some of his frontbench are up to.</PARA>

We have to treat all our products with the same amount of care and caution.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is in the enviable position of having a relatively disease free environment. This is more than just a selling point for our produce. It means that we can keep a clean and healthy gene pool which other nations might be requiring to replace their stocks in the future. This is no accident, though. This has been brought about through careful planning and, up to now, a thorough and careful assessment of quarantine authorities and government policy not to take any unreasonable risks. That includes any deals with one product against another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia cannot afford it. Tasmania certainly cannot afford it. Nor can the world. There should be no risk to any of our industries of diseases being introduced into Australia.

<TIME.STAMP>(7.35 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I raise the issue of the Brisbane City Council elections, which will be held in March of next year. We know for sure it is on because the assault of the letterboxes has begun by the Labor Party. They are running so short of good things to say about their time in City Hall, Brisbane, they are writing letters to constituents in my electorate and spreading untruths. They are scaremongering and frightening people about matters relating to the initiatives of the federal budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, I turn to a letter which has been sent by Councillor Bailey of the Moorooka ward to residents in and around Toohey Forest, which is at the geographic heart of the Moreton electorate. It suggests, as a result of changes to training programs and funding arrangements, Toohey Forest will be badly served. Of course, this is absolute errant nonsense. Councillor Bailey does not want to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6725"> acquaint himself with the facts&mdash;maybe he does not have them at his disposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing I will compliment him on is the suggestion residents should write to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone)&mdash;suggesting there is a job for the federal government as far as looking after the local environment is concerned. To the best of my knowledge, I do not believe any of my constituents have taken up Councillor Bailey's suggestion, proving they have seen right through his silly, scaremongering approaches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the fact is Toohey Forest is going to do far better under this government than under the previous government, when one looks at the proceeds which could come from the Natural Heritage Trust&mdash;a matter before this place&mdash;and when one considers some of the very definite improvements which have occurred, like helping unemployed people who are interested in working on projects involving the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The failed schemes like NWOs, Jobskills and the landcare environment and action program&mdash;LEAP, as it was known&mdash;may be gone, but taxpayers and the unemployed are certainly entitled to expect far better value for money, and they are going to get it under this government. Better assistance is going to come for the large amount of dollars being spent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has introduced a single brokered program to assist the most disadvantaged job seekers. The special employer support program will provide 20 weeks of training and work experience for disadvantaged job seekers who are unlikely to get a job through participation in a training program or with the assistance of a wage subsidy. The Commonwealth Employment Service's advisory committee review of labour market programs recommended the old Jobskills, LEAP and NWOs programs be amalgamated and replaced with one simpler and far more flexible program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one looks at the facts, Councillor Bailey's assertion and scaremongering to the residents in and around Toohey Forest starts to fade away. Councillor Bailey's credibility on this issue is really under a great deal of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pressure on another front. Students from Griffith University, which is located within Toohey Forest, were allocated to me earlier this year&mdash;the first ever political internship from Griffith University's public policy section. John Wanna, who is a prominent public policy academic at Griffith, worked with me and these students in making this project a great success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At my suggestion, they looked into the local impact of the previous government's employment programs in the electorate. It is interesting they managed to prove: while the application of local community groups and business organisations ensured local success of these programs on average was better than across the country, the Working Nation agenda was far too inflexible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the course of their deliberations, they spoke to many people right across the community and had absolutely no problem as far as cooperation on the issue was concerned&mdash;until they came to Councillor Bailey, who was apparently in charge of Brisbane City Council's LEAP agenda. Essentially, he was the slave master on what was essentially a slave trade of unemployed people doing work through Toohey Forest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Councillor Bailey repeatedly dismissed requests from these two students. In fact, they felt they were fobbed off on many occasions when they sought some accountability about the way the council was involved in acquitting funds from the federal government. If Councillor Bailey was so confident about the lasting success of these failed programs, why did he refuse them access to the information they were legitimately seeking?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6726"> All in all, with the Brisbane City Council elections coming up in just a few months time, I can only imagine we are going to see more propaganda and more scaremongering. It makes me almost faint when I look at the expensive, full colour, 30&hyphen; to 40&hyphen;page document the ratepayers of Brisbane have had to fund as part of the propaganda war the Labor Party is already waging in Brisbane. It is a very impressive document.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I do not know if you are like me and display great reluctance to go to your local dentist, but my local dentist, who is at Pendle Hill, is a very nice bloke and I have been going to him for some years. He is very polite, very helpful and very considerate, but I intensely dislike going to him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recently went there&mdash;and I was shocked that I had not been there for some time&mdash;and copped a terrible lecture about how to clean my teeth; and I feel very chastened. The point I want to make is that in two relatively short visits I had two fillings done and an abscess attended to and the cost came to $320. I can well afford to pay that, but I am really raising this issue because of my concern for the frail aged in my community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you know, the government is intent on abolishing&mdash;and will abolish&mdash;the dental health program as from the beginning of next year. There is no way pensioners in my electorate can afford to pay $320 to have their teeth looked at. Unfortunately, if teeth are not looked at you can contract a whole variety of diseases: halitosis, gingivitis, ulcerated mouth, abscesses, chronic infection, pain, sinus and, more particularly, the inability to chew properly, which leads to malnutrition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This program has been a very successful one. I asked a question of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) about how many clients had been able to utilise it. He told me that 140,000 utilised it in 1993-94, nearly half a million in 1994-95, and that we were expected to treat in 1996&mdash;and the minister is confident that his prediction will be met&mdash;656,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this means is that, with the abolition of this program, the frail aged in my community are often going to do without appropriate dental care. I do not believe that, as parliamentarians, we can feel comfortable about this situation. When people are old, often their gums shrink, causing problems <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with their dentures, and they may lose a tooth. Currently, under state run dental health programs, they may have to wait years to have this seen to. From 1997, as a result of this government, clearly things are going to get worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to raise the issue of podiatry&mdash;that is, the care of toenails&mdash;for the frail aged. As they become infirm, they are unable to bend to reach their toenails. Currently, podiatry is not catered for under Medicare. I wish it was. I also wish dental care was. Unfortunately, there is an unwillingness by podiatrists to take up available positions because they can earn more money in private practice. We can all say, `That is great competition policy; that is fair enough,' but unfortunately all too often the frail aged go without appropriate podiatry care. Some may feel that this is perhaps a trivial matter, but inappropriate care or a lack of care can lead to gangrene and, instead of having their nails clipped, people will have to have their toes or their feet taken off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that a caring government has a responsibility to those in our society who made such a great contribution before we came here and who have made that contribution that allows us to enjoy our success. That is the definition of what the aged in our society have contributed. As a society we certainly have a responsibility to ensure that their needs, particularly their health needs, are fully and adequately covered. Their care should not be an issue of whether they have sufficient money, but rather an issue of whether they have the need.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

I hope it is not a great breach of protocol or too great an impertinence to extend my congratulations to the President, though not as a Democrat.

I nonetheless acknowledge that as a leader of the free world, he has a critically important role to play in international affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While there has been something of a tradition amongst some members of this House, particularly on the other side, to rubbish the United States at every opportunity as an imperial power with no vestige of decency or principle, I am not one who ascribes to that view. I would certainly like to acknowledge the wonderful role that the United States played in providing a counterweight to what in my view was the true evil of Communism in the Eastern Bloc and the former Soviet Union. Had we not had the strength of a superpower committed to democratic principles such as the United States to provide that counterweight throughout the period of the Cold War, we may be living in a quite different global environment today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to acknowledge my great satisfaction at the fact that the Republican revolution will continue and that it now seems certain that the Republicans will control both the Senate and the House of Representatives. In that context, I would like to acknowledge my debt to retiring Senator Mark Hatfield, who was the first two&hyphen;term Governor of Oregon and went on to serve for over 25 years in the United States Senate, finally as Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. He was the author of a book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Between a rock and a hard place</EMPHASIS>, in which he outlined some of his anguish at attempting to retain a sense of principle amidst the challenges and the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day decisions of public life. That book was something of an inspiration to me as a young man. I was indebted to the senator when he was willing to give a young boy from Sydney a go as a member of his staff back in 1987. That was certainly a seminal experience for me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to address an issue which the United States should perhaps raise in our minds&mdash;that is, the place of patriotism in the national life. There has been a view that patriotism or nationalism is a kind of social and international evil and that it can be blamed for many of the problems of the wars and the conflicts that we see in the world today. I want to take issue with that view and say that I believe <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that there is a proper place for an informed patriotic feeling and attachment to one's nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the challenges we have to overcome as a people is that from the time of the settlement of the First Fleet there has been a tendency to denigrate, to look down upon our history and to feel some sense of inadequacy. In particular, over the past 13 years of government in this country there has been a feeling that the earliest life of this nation was something one ought to be embarrassed about. Again, it is not a view that I subscribe to. In fact, I think it is detrimental to the development of a nation, to a healthy concept of, and respect for, citizenship and for the general sense of industry, innovation and enterprise across the nation as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly want to draw the attention of the House to the lack of a systematic attempt to train and teach young people in subjects such as civics in their high school so that they have a proper feeling for their national institutions, for the place of the rule of law and for the role of a chamber such as this. In a 1993 Quadrant study of year 9 and 10 students, something like 70 per cent could not put name to the chamber in which I stand today. Concepts such as the constitutional monarchy and the relationship between the executive, the judiciary and the parliament are not well understood by Australian high school students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to conclude with some comments from the autobiography of Sir Garfield Barwick, one of my predecessors in the seat of Parramatta. In his autobiography, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A radical tory</EMPHASIS>, Sir Garfield recalls:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . at Crown Street School, I was taught a subject called "Civics" in which I learnt a great deal about the structure of government, and that the law was at its heart. I feel sure that by the time I was nine I had a fair grasp of our system of parliamentary government and could understand much of the discussions in our house. Today children grow into adulthood without any proper education in government and are left to the paucity and imbalance of newspaper information. Many become electors while still at school, still ignorant of the structure of the government they vote to elect.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Liberal Party talks a lot about small business, but when you get right down to it, when the mask comes off, it is after midnight, the defence has come down and the truth comes out, they always support big business. In this House I have spoken about the Federal Liberal Party's failure to protect small business retail tenants against shopping centre landlords and their failure to support Kim Beazley's private member's bill. I have spoken about the need to protect small business from the depravations of phoenix companies&mdash;people who run away from their creditors by deliberate bankruptcies only to start up a similar enterprise under a new name.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These failures are amongst the reasons why bankruptcies are soaring under this government. There were 4,000 or so per quarter or less until March this year and now they have really taken off. In the September quarter there were 5,421 bankruptcies&mdash;a disastrous result. The ABS chart shows a relatively steady number of bankruptcies from 1992 until 1996 and then the graph starts to take off straight up through the top of the page.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight I want to talk about the Victorian state Liberal Party's contributions to bankruptcies&mdash;in particular, poker machines and open slather shop trading hours. Figures recently released show that in the city of Moreland, which I represent, the number of poker machines has just exploded&mdash;going from 410 gaming machines at 11 venues as recently as March last year to 760 machines at 16 venues in October of this year. This is fuelling bankruptcies at an alarming rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Premier sought to defuse this issue at the end of last year by saying that he would not allow poker machines in shopping centres and shopping complexes. Yet in Glenroy the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has given a permit to the Carlton Football Club Social Club to install 85 poker machines directly opposite and in direct competition with the Glenroy RSL. Enough is enough.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to plead with the Liquor Licensing Commission, which is to hear this issue next week, not to grant a liquor licence to this club. The Liquor Licensing Commission has a legal responsibility not to grant licences to venues which are simply fronts for poker machines. It is blindingly obvious that the Carlton Football Club has simply set this venue up for the purpose of sucking money out of the Glenroy community. This is just a charade. The real Carlton social club is, of course, at Optus Oval.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to urge the state government to apply a moratorium to further poker machines in Victoria. Everywhere I talk to small businesses and retailers, the damage they are taking from poker machines is immense. It is time to put a stop to it. Finally, I want to express my grave disappointment with the state government's just passed legislation to deregulate shop trading hours. Open slather shop trading hours have simply two impacts. The first concentrates market share in the hands of big retailers who swallow up small retailers and small business. The second forces small business and shop assistants to work on Sundays and at all hours of the day or night for little or no extra reward. I would have thought that as legislators we are trying to provide social progress and trying to improve the lives of ordinary people. Surely this is just a step backwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that in the city of Moreland small businesses are afraid of losing market share if they go it alone against Sunday trading. I call on the chambers of commerce to get together with neighbouring chambers of commerce, and I call on the city of Moreland to get together with neighbouring municipalities such as Darebin, Moonee Valley and perhaps Hume council. I call on them to look at joint action or to hold a referendum which could keep Sunday trading out of our area. That could protect family life, protect the quality of our community life and protect small businesses from rising Lyons Forum bankruptcies.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr MILES</EMPHASIS> (Braddon&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6729"> (7.55 p.m.)&mdash;Tonight I rise to speak to put on the record a few things about the Lyons Forum. It seems to attract a lot of attention from the opposition over there in a range of debates.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BI4">Mr MILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, as I am reminded by my colleague here, the member for Wentworth, it attracts attention from the ABC from time to time. The Lyons Forum was established by a group of people in the coalition in 1992. It has around 50 members at the moment. It was established for one clear purpose: to support families and to provide a focus for families in the federal parliament. That was the prime focus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some members came in here today and talked about the spiritual beliefs of members of the Lyons Forum. I know that some people in this place are not very well informed. Obviously there are a lot on the opposition side who are not very well informed. Maybe they are talking about the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship. I am not sure about that. The Lyons Forum has a stated set of beliefs. I will read them out so that people are quite clear on this. Firstly, the members of the forum believe that the family is the fundamental unit of society and is the prime agency for the total development of children. You would really wonder why the Labor Party would come in here and criticise us for standing up for that belief: that we think that children ought to be nurtured and cared for in a loving relationship. But the Labor Party come in here and try to run down members of the Lyons Forum. It is just a bit strange why they want to reject the idea that the family is a fundamental unit of society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, we believe that marriage provides the environment in which nurturing of children can best be undertaken. Thirdly, we believe that the wellbeing of the family is essential to the stability, morale, security and prosperity of the Australian nation. Fourthly, we believe that the government, through its activities, should promote the family as a fundamental unit of society. They are our beliefs. I think they very clearly state the purpose of the forum. There is no doubt that we are active in regard to ideas in promoting <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those beliefs within the government. Clearly, we stand for the family as being a structure in our society; an institution which we believe is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were comments made this afternoon in regard to people within the Lyons Forum having spiritual beliefs. That may well be the case. I have no doubt about that. But the group is not based on that whatsoever. To impute that to the Lyons Forum is a total misunderstanding of what the Lyons Forum is about. The forum will continue to promote the ideas about the nurturing of children and trying to provide a very positive environment for young people to grow up in. As our motto states: `The foundation of a nation's greatness is in the homes of its people'. Another way of talking about that is to say, `I believe that the family really is the fourth tier of government.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young people need to grow up in families learning values about society, learning to respect each other, learning to care about and to nurture each other, learning to play different roles and to work in different capacities with other people as part of a team. As we move into the broader community, we encounter the rules, regulations and laws that local, state and federal governments have tried to put in place for the betterment of the order of our society. If young people, children, have not been taught to work within a team within a family, they find it much more difficult to work within the rules which govern local, state or federal government. The family is a fundamental unit for transmitting values which are very important for a progressive society: one in which young people learn to give and take in discussion, one in which they learn that they do not always get their own way&mdash;sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. They learn that there are authority figures in our society and that there are structures in which they have to operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Lyons Forum is a group of people who have a very deep concern about making sure that the family remains an important structure in our society, not just in regard to moral issues. Prior to the last election we did suggest that we have a taxation system in which there was a change in the tax&hyphen;free threshold as children become part of a family structure. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6730"> That is part of the government's position in this budget.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much. When the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) indicated publicly that he proposed to bring a bill on euthanasia to the parliament, that notion was embraced by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and, like many others, I naturally assumed that time would be allocated in the House of Representatives for that debate to occur. I think it is clearly the case that the community embraced the notion of debate as well, and embraced the notion that there can be no more important issue than life and death. I think it is also the case that the parliament&mdash;all members of it&mdash;embraced the notion that this subject matter is a matter of individual conscience which we all ought to apply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So when the notion arose of the debate being referred here I must say it struck me as being bizarre. I thought the House of Representatives had a great opportunity to lead debate on a great national issue of conscience. I also thought the House of Representatives provided the community with the opportunity of seeing the debate as openly as possible and, as I have pointed out to the parliament, it struck me that the Main Committee was not suited to controversial matters, geared as it is to the notion of one voice here being generally sufficient to refer a matter back to the House. It also struck me as being incongruous that at the time that the government was adding weeks to the parliamentary timetable it was using its numbers to consign the bill here.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6733">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On four separate occasions&mdash;once before you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and on three occasions in the House&mdash;I have endeavoured to persuade the parliament that the debate ought to be conducted in the House. On one occasion the fact that that view was supported by many members of parliament was reflected by the fact that a government member crossed the floor. It is now clear, however, that without a change of heart on the part of the government the weight of numbers will ensure the debate occurs here. There has been plenty of water under the parliamentary bridge since I moved my dissent from your ruling. Suffice to say that, in my view, the events of last week in this Committee and the House clearly showed the folly of trying to foist a controversial matter upon the Main Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a sense, my dissent from your ruling is now academic because, whatever occurs, it is clear to me that without that change of heart the debate will occur here. I have to confess to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I thought I was entirely capable of tying matters up here in the Main Committee for at least a few more hours. But what weighs on my mind is that while, as a matter of conscience and a matter of principle, it is my strongly held view that I have put firmly that debate ought to occur in the House and, as a consequence, I will not partake in the debate here, there are many colleagues whose consciences dictate that, whilst they would prefer to speak in the House, they would rather speak than not. It is out of regard for that view that I do not seek to pursue the matter that I have pursued on four previous occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a matter of principle, I have indicated to the House that I will not speak on the bill itself. When the bill comes before the House, presumably on division, I will vote in favour of it. When there is a Commonwealth head of power, the parliament should not be shy of exercising it. From an individual conscience point of view, I have grave reservations about the notion of the state sanctioning the killing of human beings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I took the opportunity of putting the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), who is the government whip in this chamber, on notice of my intention not to proceed, to enable her to prepare for her contribution rather than concentrate on procedural matters. I wish her and other colleagues well in their deliberations on this bill, and I thank you for your indulgence.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker. I acknowledge the fact that the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) did, in fact, put me on notice of his change of mind in these matters. I accept the fact that he has sincerely held views about where this matter should be debated, but I would also like to put the government view that there is a big legislative program between now and the end of the year and that the government is providing government time for what is essentially a private member's bill&mdash;and I think that is important. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has acknowledged that. There are over 60 people wishing to speak on this bill and, therefore, time has been allocated in the Main Committee&mdash;which, I believe, should be treated with a great deal of respect; and that is in fact what the standing orders dictate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will not get through everything if time is not allocated here to speak on this issue. I think that this type of debate and, in fact, this place should not be subject to stunts or any high <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6734"> jinks, and I am therefore pleased to say that we will be able to proceed. In fact, I would invite the member for Perth to reconsider the fact that he might care to take part in the debate here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In making my contribution to this debate, I would like to begin by thanking those people who have taken the trouble to contact me and let me know of their views and experiences. I appreciate that there are colleagues on both sides of this debate who hold compassionate views about the way the terminally ill should die. I respect the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and other elected representatives of the Northern Territory, but I reject the argument that the Commonwealth parliament should not debate or decide on an issue such as euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Constitutionally, it is the Commonwealth's right to do so, and there has been the relatively recent example of the Commonwealth overriding Tasmanian law. Quite frankly, while legal opinion and constitutional rights have some place in this debate, so also does the very simple proposition that a small percentage of the Australian population should not set the standard for the rest of Australia on an issue of such importance as euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To put the issue in perspective, there are 98,000 people on the territorial electoral roll, and that figure is somewhere between a good test match crowd and an Australian Rules football crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. It is 15,000 more than the number of people who make up the federal electorate of Adelaide. I am sure that my constituents would not regard it as their prerogative to make decisions for the rest of Australia. It is right and proper that this debate is taking place at a national level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has already decided that the potential of having even one innocent person being mistakenly put to death outweighs the arguments for capital punishment. As a matter of moral consistency, Australians should oppose euthanasia. `The possibility of even one patient being euthanased as a result of a wrong diagnosis or administrative mistake,' writes one doctor to me, `is too horrendous to even consider.' I agree with him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is to be expected that there will be different and strong views expressed in this debate, but little is to be gained by those who oppose the bill seeking to put those of us who support the bill into various boxes or categories. It is entirely natural and reasonable that our life experiences will shape our opinion and thus the decision we reach. Therefore, it does not surprise me that the government members and senators who in previous occupations were doctors or nurses oppose euthanasia and support this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was trained to be a healer and a carer, and I know that it is quite wrong to argue that to legalise euthanasia is the only way to ensure death with dignity. As one commentator put it, `In any other context it would be regarded as a nonsense to propose death as a proper solution for difficult human problems.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a natural instinct and desire to lead a useful and reasonably long life, close to those we love, and to have some warning of approaching death, but not too long to suffer. However, we cannot plan for everything in life. We cannot control every aspect of it, so we must have confidence that, close to death, all the necessary support will be available. The quick fix should not be seen as the solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many respects, advances in medicine have meant that many more people are living longer. Some become disabled and make demands on family and community for the care that is required, but not all people who suffer from terminal illness are old.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While nursing in a hospital I experienced my fair share of caring for the dying. Although that was now many years ago, I still vividly remember those people and those experiences <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6735"> with death. In more recent years, my experiences were closer to diagnosis of disease, some of which resulted in terminal illness. I have been there when people in the prime of their lives have been diagnosed with diseases such as breast cancer and leukemia. I have been there when their progress and treatment has been monitored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These experiences have given me a good and, I confess,  painful insight into those who suffer. It seemed that it was easier to manage the physical pain than the mental pain of depression and anguish. But I have seen people grow with acceptance and the real desire to make the most of the time available to them. I have known the dying to fight for extra time just to remember some good experiences of their life or to spend time with family and loved ones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been observed by medical practitioners in the field of pain management, calls by a patient for an end to life in times of extreme suffering have often been temporary and due to unfair pressures placed upon them, or have simply been a cry for help and attention. One doctor has written to me saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My experience is that patients will occasionally say, "I want to die, I've had enough." This is often a cry for help from a depressed person. Once good palliative care has been provided they very frequently change their mind.</PARA>
<PARA>A palliative care worker has also commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the proper palliative care, there's the capacity to transcend the most extraordinary physical suffering: and even in the terminal phase of life, there can be enormous growth and understanding.</PARA>
<PARA>Euthanasia may be an attractive option for those with proper family support who have organised their affairs and put their emotional matters in order, but it is for the disadvantaged, the disabled and the vulnerable that the provision of euthanasia introduces a dangerous uncertainty when they are least able to cope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overseas experiences have already shown that the provision of euthanasia to consenting patients has been impossible to police. There have been five extensive inquiries into the implications of legalising euthanasia: the Law Reform Commission in Canada in 1982; the Parliament of Victoria in 1987; the House of Lords in 1994; the New York State Task Force in 1994; and the Senate of Canada only last year. Those inquiries all found it impossible to make the law safe and make vulnerable people free from the risk of abuse. I do not believe the Northern Territory's euthanasia bill addresses those concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the future, with increasing health costs and an ageing population, and in the knowledge that individuals access health services the most in the first and last stages of life, we must never have in place legislation which signals that an empty bed is a better outcome than appropriate care for the terminally ill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One American commentator has said, `The patient often seems to have been most worried about the disease's impact on others. It is possible that a certain type of woman&mdash;depressive, self-effacing, near the end of a life largely spent serving others&mdash;is particularly vulnerable to the "rational-heroic" solution of euthanasia.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also have concerns for non&hyphen;English speaking patients. There is already a shortage of translators working in the health system. Also, the Northern Territory's significant Aboriginal communities have many concerns about the provision of euthanasia services in the territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The long-term implications of legalising execution through the agency of the healing profession does more than undermine the doctor-patient relationship. It fundamentally changes <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6736"> the moral underpinning of the care giving services in our society. These are fundamental and national concerns and it is only right and proper that they are decided by the national parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority of doctors do not want this type of publicly sanctioned power of executioner, as a constituent of mine, Dr Pollnitz, has written to me on this issue. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sadly, some of my colleagues cannot be trusted with the right to kill. There are doctors whose own peculiar emotional needs are met by the blend of power and intimacy in a death-dealing relationship. . . It can be argued that those doctors who are most interested in performing euthanasia are those whose own emotional needs in the matter should disqualify them.</PARA>
<PARA>I am proud to say that South Australia was the first Australian state to enact advanced directive legislation in the form of a Natural Death Act in 1983 and later the Consent to Medical Treatment and Palliative Care Act in 1995. It was the first time in the world an act of parliament gave legal protection to doctors who administer treatment to relieve pain, even if death was hastened as a result. I believe this type of legislation is a sensible approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory's act does not empower patients with real choice. It emphasises the physical act of terminal illness but ignores the emotional and mental aspects of the closing stages of life.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The idea that it is possible, in a law permitting assisted suicide, to make it safe by stipulating conditions which prevent abuses is dangerously false.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is when an issue such as euthanasia is thrust upon us that our grave responsibilities as federal members are brought home. As with most people, I have had to conduct a thorough self-examination while deliberating on how I would vote on this bill. I will be voting in support of the member for Menzies' (Mr Andrews) private member's bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Mr Andrews' bill was first introduced to the House and the issue of a conscience vote was raised, I was asked by one of my constituents whether it would receive my support. At the time I told him I disagreed totally with active euthanasia. He then pointed to the public opinion polls which have repeatedly found a very high percentage of Australians in favour of legal euthanasia, especially of the kind introduced in the Northern Territory. The answer I gave him, and which I will repeat for the benefit of this chamber, is that when it comes to popularity polls and the like, politicians, perhaps more so than anybody else, have a right to remain sceptical. On the question of those polls in particular I think the oft used line of `Lies, damned lies and statistics' has never been more appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the letters I have received in my office, from the people I talk to in the street, at local events or even in local clubs, I have found that there is a widespread misunderstanding of what is meant by the term `euthanasia.' For example, there is a failure among many people to whom I talk to appreciate the subtleties that exist between passive voluntary euthanasia and active voluntary euthanasia, a failure which I expect is shared by many people throughout the rest of this country. It is this misunderstanding which I believe is driving much of the support for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6737"> euthanasia in those polls. When this disappears I think much of that support will disappear with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Informed decision making has been made even harder thanks to the media's soft focus portrayal of suffering people pleading to be allowed to die under the Northern Territory's new laws. It is entirely understandable that Australians, confronted with images of the sick and the dying on their television sets and in their newspapers, sympathise with their plight and let their hearts and minds go out to them. As such I am surprised that the percentage of people in favour of euthanasia in the polls is not a lot higher.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, I think there has been a tendency on the media's part to portray those opposed to euthanasia as cold&hyphen;hearted and unemotional religious robots. Let me state for the record that religion has nothing to do with the reasons why I object to active voluntary euthanasia. To my mind, we are yet to see a balanced account given on the level of palliative care on offer in this country. We are yet to hear the voices of the great majority of doctors who find the notion of assisting in active euthanasia utterly repugnant and beyond the boundaries of medicine as it should be practised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have not seen are the case histories from the Netherlands and the truly frightening picture which is starting to reveal itself in that country. I have had people say, `But doctors should be able to turn off a life support system when they are not achieving anything.' I agree with them. People have also said, `If a patient's treatment is not proving beneficial, and it is just prolonging the agony before death, the patient should have the right to insist on the treatment being stopped and be allowed to die with dignity.' Again, I agree with that. These people are under the misunderstanding that to do these things is to commit euthanasia, that it is these practices which the bill of the member for Menzies hopes to put to an end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning off life support systems and withholding fruitless medical treatment is not euthanasia; it is common medical practice. This is an example of medicine as it is carried out in Australian hospitals day in and day out. Under Australian common law a competent adult patient can refuse to consent to the initiation or the continuance of medical treatment. The doctor must respect any such voluntary or sufficiently informed refusal of medical treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is when I give these people a clear and hopefully unbiased account of the active voluntary euthanasia to which I am opposed&mdash;that is, the lawful termination of one person's life by another in the case of incurable illness&mdash;that the indignation or misunderstanding written across the faces of those people I am talking to begins to disappear. The scales fall from their eyes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the polls are a problematic diversion from the main argument. There are of course the questions of human decency, of what value we wish to place on human life in our society, that lead me to oppose active voluntary euthanasia. It is my belief that to sanction the legal termination, the lawful killing, of one person by another&mdash;however sick and distressed the patient may be or however well&hyphen;meaning or medically qualified the person carrying out the termination is&mdash;is to cheapen human life beyond all acceptable levels. How can we, as a society, refuse to permit the death penalty for our most heinous criminals and yet allow death to be meted out to those whom we cherish the most?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How could we hold our heads up living in a society where we profess to consider life as the most treasured of gifts, where to intentionally take a life is the most serious crime imaginable, while at the same time cultivating a culture of easy death? I agree with the House of Lords Select Committee on Medical Ethics which found in its report published in 1993 that:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6738">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . dying is not only a personal or individual affair. The death of a person affects the lives of others, often in ways and to an extent which cannot be foreseen. We believe that the issue of euthanasia is one in which the interests of the individual cannot be separated from the society or the interest of society as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA>To allow active voluntary euthanasia into our midst is to allow a destabilisation of one of the basic tenets which underpins our society. We cannot entertain the gross hypocrisy of saying, `Life in our society is sacred, but . . . '. The minute we start qualifying our innate belief in the sanctity of life, no matter how noble or benign active voluntary euthanasia may appear, we are setting a precedent, a precedent from which we cannot comprehend the ramifications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other members may have recently received a letter from a Miss Cecily Miner, a young woman who suffers from the extremely rare and debilitating auto&hyphen;immune disorder, Behcet's disease. Miss Miner's letter is one of the most harrowing, most distressing testimonials of personal illness I have ever read. It is also the most inspiring and I suggest that all members, who have not at this time read that letter, take the opportunity and read the words of such an exceptionally brave woman. Miss Miner is a woman who has endured a lot of pain and suffering, at levels which most people would find very difficult to comprehend, and yet euthanasia, for her, remains an anathema. In part of her letter she says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe euthanasia is dangerous and fundamentally misguided as a solution to great physical suffering . . . I believe the debate over euthanasia deflects attention away from the real issues&mdash;how to manage a large proportion of the community who need ongoing medical support and how to advance the search for more effective and less harmful pain relief.</PARA>
<PARA>That is one of the main issues of this whole debate. Why are we considering taking the easy option? Why not make more of an effort into looking at better medicines and improving palliative care?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The human race, for all its faults, has always strived to improve things, to better its lot. Are we going to be the first to throw up our hands, take the easy option, and say, `Oh no, this is all too hard, it is too difficult! Give us euthanasia and let us forget all about it'? Is that what we want to say?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already mentioned the situation in the Netherlands. Let me quote from an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Scientist</EMPHASIS> magazine of 20 June 1992. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At least a third of the 5,000 or so Dutch patients who each year receive lethal doses of drugs from their doctors do not give their unequivocal consent. About 400 of these patients never even raise the issue of euthanasia with their doctors. Moreover, of those who willingly opt for euthanasia, only about 5 per cent do so solely because of unbearable pain. A much higher proportion, about a third, do so partly for fear of becoming dependent on others.</PARA>
<PARA>This shocking excerpt speaks for itself. The last sentence is especially worth noting, considering the paucity of beds for palliative care in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Netherlands and Australia are different countries, but they are not on different planets. I do not think it is too long a bow to draw to assert that what we have seen happening over there is what we will see occurring here if we allow the Northern Territory's legislation to stand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are those who point to the alarming picture in the Netherlands as a reason why we need to legislate for active voluntary euthanasia and bring it under the careful scrutiny of authorities. I cannot see legislation, however strict, stopping physicians, inured to death, bending the rules when they see fit, cutting corners when it seems to them to make sense.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6739">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Doctors, of course, are no more innately dismissive of the law than anybody else in society. But that is the point. There are individuals in all walks of life, in all professions, who step outside the law when it suits them or when, in their eyes, they perceive the law to be an ass&mdash;physicians included. I can see doctors in the Northern Territory turning a blind eye to elements of the euthanasia law as though they were no more than speed signs on a highway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to turn to the reservations expressed by those senators representing both of the major territories in this parliament that this debate should not be treated as a debate on the rights and wrongs of euthanasia but, rather, as a debate on the effect on the role and responsibilities of the legislative assemblies of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. The Australian territories are just that&mdash;territories. Until they achieve statehood, the constitutional mores that govern the relationship between the territories and the Commonwealth must remain supreme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I had more time, I would refer to the legal qualifications of Justice Lockhart in the Federal Court case, Attorney&hyphen;General (Northern Territory) v. Hand, in 1989. The Commonwealth, I believe, is not suddenly casting itself as some sort of meddlesome aunt, as the senators have suggested. It is merely performing the role set out for it which is protected by our constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are so many things I would like to have said in the main chamber with the time allocated there, rather than this 10 minutes. However, I believe that we must never have in our society in Australia a law which means that we can legally take another's life.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have requested to take part in the debate on the Euthanasia Laws Bill because I believe the matter of so&hyphen;called mercy killing or euthanasia to be one of the most significant issues of modern times. This is reflected in the large volume of mail and other contacts I have received on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This debate far surpasses in importance any of the debates which have taken place in this parliament during the time that I have been a federal member. What we are debating here today is the intentional killing of another person by act or omission and that that act should be made permissible through the enactment of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout my parliamentary career, spanning 16 years, I have been a supporter of states rights, but what the Northern Territory government proposes is a legal structure for killing. Whether the Northern Territory was a state or a territory or any other form of jurisdiction, I could not agree to a move which would detrimentally affect the people of Australia, particularly the weak and the vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) for his courage in bringing this private member's bill, known as the Northern Territory Self&hyphen;Government Amendment Bill 1996, before the federal parliament. At the outset, may I say that, from the time I can remember, I have opposed euthanasia on religious grounds. As I understand it, euthanasia is forbidden in the Jewish, Christian and Muslim faiths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I have heard the argument by some pro&hyphen;euthanasia advocates that the religious views of some should not be thrust upon others, I believe that, as an Australian, I should be permitted to take part in this debate and put another point of view that may not be in keeping with the secular humanist approach of the pro&hyphen;euthanasia lobby.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently a group of Aboriginal elders from the Yolnu people of Arnhem Land visited the parliament to protest the introduction of euthanasia into the Northern Territory parliamentary law, saying that it was totally against their law or the Madayin. The Madayin law is the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6740"> complete system of law that the Yolnu people believe provides them with the right and civilised way to live, and it encompasses the moral, social and religious laws of the Yolnu people. According to their beliefs, the Madayin comes from the beginning of time. Here is another group of Australians whom I was afforded the privilege of consulting, who are not of the `Book', but who are opposed to euthanasia because they are aware of its dangers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, however, I have known for many years that if a case was to be made against so&hyphen;called mercy killing, it had to be based on a logical and ethical argument rather than on a religious stance. This is not because there is hostility to religion in this country, but rather because there is a great apathy. I knew that eventually no member of the parliament could escape this debate, which strikes at the very heart of our civilisation, and I have made the study of euthanasia one of my priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have placed great importance on the issue because I believe that what we are debating will, in the future, have a profound influence on who is considered worthy or unworthy to live, and the attitude Western civilisation will take toward the weak and the vulnerable. If the proponents of euthanasia are allowed to have their way, we will enter an age of great social uncertainty, a time when no&hyphen;one will be certain of their future, particularly if they become ill or infirm. It will inevitably determine the future social conscience and attitude towards the unwell, the elderly and the disabled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been said many times before that the German doctors in the early 1930s who worked to have euthanasia introduced, possibly for what they perceived to be the right reasons, were the precursors of the Holocaust. Although it started with disabled children in Germany, today in Australia it has commenced with the seriously ill and tomorrow it will be the elderly and children who are perceived by some as having no future potential to contribute to society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then it would move to other groups, as it has done in other civilisations throughout history. Under the Third Reich, the euthanasia program started, as it has in the Northern Territory, with all the best intentions. It was broadened until it included the so&hyphen;called `superfluous people', the unfit, the unproductive, the useless eaters, the misfits and the undesirables. The overall picture is best understood as the identification and the elimination of the weak. Ironically, in Germany the Jews were initially excluded from the program because they were considered unworthy of its so&hyphen;called benefits. Eventually, however, they were rounded up and treated as members of a diseased race that acted as a parasite on the German people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concepts of a `life not worth living' and `death with dignity' propelled the genocide program to the national socialists in Germany. Euthanasia proponents decried parallels between the euthanasia movement and what the Nazis did. In no way would I suggest that the proponents of euthanasia in Australia are inclined that way. Nevertheless, humanity's interest in aborting a recurrence of anything resembling the national socialist genocide program decrees that we should compare the thought and practices taking place in our country with those that took place in Germany in the first half of this century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure when the movement towards euthanasia was first taken in Germany, before it was hijacked by the national socialists, it would have been with the best of intentions. However, as in Germany, here in Australia the movement toward active, involuntary euthanasia is being precipitated by the rejection of natural law, jurisprudence and the acceptance of positivistic utilitarianism and secularism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to Anne Potter in her article, `Will the "right to die" become a "licence to kill"?' the euthanasia push under the Third Reich germinated from a short but influential book <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6741"> published in 1920. The book, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Release of the destruction of life devoid of value</EMPHASIS>, was written by the jurist Karl Binding and the psychiatrist Alfred Hoche. In their publication, Hoche and Binding's reasoning resembles that of euthanasia proponents today. The book starts with a focus on voluntary euthanasia for suffering, terminally ill patients, but this discussion becomes a springboard proposal that euthanasia be extended to a larger circle of people. The greatest fear to me today is that throughout their book, written 76 years ago, Hoche and Binding trumpet the economic argument of euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been discussed in the Australian parliament recently, the pressure on funding for Medicare, which is now blowing out and compounding, will put extraordinary pressure on the budget, as will Australia's rapidly aging population. The same thing is occurring in the United States where the euthanasia debate is raging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hoche and Binding point out how much manpower, patience and capital investment is invested to keep life, which they term as not worth living, alive until finally, often awfully late, nature triumphs in death. They denounce the treatment of the mentally sick, whom they term `creatures of no value at all', and call upon legislation to abandon this commitment to the sacredness of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hoche and Binding were not Hitler's advisers. Nevertheless, they significantly influenced the current thought of their time. Under the Third Reich, the concept of life not worthy of life slowly became popularised. Cost containment concerns like those presently being raised in Australia fed the euthanasia frenzy in Germany.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1941 the film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">I accuse</EMPHASIS>, based on the novel <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mission and Conscience</EMPHASIS>, depicted a physician giving a lethal injection to his incurably ill wife in response to her desperate plea to be relieved of her suffering. In polls conducted to ascertain the impact of the film, many Germans accepted the film's argument of voluntary euthanasia in principle. There is a chilling similarity between that poll and the poll recently taken in Australia which claimed that 70 to 80 per cent of the population was in favour of voluntary euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As with Australia's first death from euthanasia, in Germany the first death came by request. A father asked that his child who was retarded, blind, and missing a leg and part of one arm, should be euthanased. Hitler's physician Dr Brandt, after inquiry at Hitler's direction, informed the child's physician that the child could be euthanased. Subsequently, a program was prepared for killing children deemed to have no prospect of a meaningful life. The rest is now history. And the sad fact is that the doctors involved were not trained as medical monsters, but they perceived that what they were doing was furthering the good of society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Early this week I got a letter from an Australian of Dutch heritage. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Noel</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a young boy in Holland during the war I recall the story where my father told me that one night a German soldier&mdash;we were occupied&mdash;came crying into our market garden with a letter from a senior officer in which he was advised that his mother was put to sleep because she was mentally unstable. The soldier told my father that his mother was old but not mentally ill, but very concerned about him, her only son, in another country in the army.</PARA>
<PARA>Need I say more. Following the Nuremberg trials the proponents of euthanasia were reasonably quiet until, in 1981, a court in Rotterdam laid down the basic criteria for the practice of euthanasia. It explicitly decreed that the patient must be in extreme pain, must have considered the alternatives, and must freely consent to be killed; further decision cannot be taken by one doctor alone, must be carefully reasoned through and carried out by a licensed physician. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6742"> Numerous alleged safeguards were built into the Dutch practice&mdash;as the proponents of the Northern Territory euthanasia laws tell us are in the Northern Territory legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has been the result in the Netherlands? According to the Dutch government's own figures, in 1990 nearly one&hyphen;third of the 3,300 official cases of euthanasia were carried out without the patient's consent. On top of that, there were 8,100 cases in which doctors gave patients drugs with the express intention of hastening their demise, but which were not officially recorded as euthanasia because the doctors also intended to relieve pain. Of those 8,100 cases, 27 per cent were capable of giving their consent, but 60 per cent of that number were never asked. And so the numbers go on. All of this in a country with judge&hyphen;made laws, tacitly approved by parliament and the executive, which on paper are every bit as strict as the Northern Territory legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what becomes of criticism of the slippery slope argument? Why should we believe the Northern Territory experience will be any different? I know this matter is one of great complexity, and I must acknowledge I am speaking as a reasonably healthy individual. But who knows what will happen tomorrow? One thing I am certain of is that one day, like everyone, I must face death. But I am unsure what pain I must suffer before that occurs. My wish for that time is that I am in the company of loved ones, that I have access to palliative care, and that those who tend me have a compassion for their fellow human.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I would like to identify with the woman whom the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) previously mentioned who wrote to me detailing the terrible suffering she has experienced over the years and the fact that when she developed her illness she prayed to die. At the end of her letter she says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't want to live in a society where the weakest, most cowardly and most lazy option is enshrined in legislation. I want to live in an enlightened society where the sick are valued and where the prevention and relief of pain are highly prized and addressed as highest priorities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not believe that parliament should be debating the Euthanasia Laws Bill, regardless of what chamber it might be in. Questions such as euthanasia and other moral issues are the responsibility of the individual. It is arrogant in the extreme that we, as members of parliament, should put our morality on others. Because we have a particular religious belief or feel strongly on a moral issue, what right have we to insist that others concur with our view? Perhaps, as some have suggested, a referendum on the issue should be conducted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that is not reason enough to oppose this legislation, I have always fundamentally believed in the rights of the states and I thought that was the philosophy of the Liberal Party. I have heard debate after debate on states rights, yet here we are overriding legislation properly enacted by the Northern Territory parliament. This states rights argument is not, as one colleague claimed, the weakest argument against the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although some argue that this legislation would only apply to the territories, such as the ACT and the NT, make no mistake&mdash;if this parliament uses its power to override Northern Territory legislation we are opening a Pandora's box: every time a federal MP objects to some state law, we will be here debating the issue. If we override this legislation, within six months we will be having a divisive debate about abortion. This will be followed up by a debate on capital punishment, a debate on homosexuality or a debate on the environment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6743">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many laws passed by individual states that I strongly object to, but I have never objected to any state or territory's right to pass laws that they see as affecting their own citizens, regardless of how strongly I may personally feel about the issue. I strongly respect the views of those who, on religious, moral or social grounds, object to euthanasia. It is my hope that they would respect my view, as I support voluntary euthanasia. This is a point that is so often overlooked in this debate: we are talking about voluntary euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like all members, I have received a lot of well&hyphen;argued documentation for both sides of this debate, but I do feel it unfortunate that many of those arguing to outlaw euthanasia have used cheap and emotive arguments about murder. What we are talking about here is voluntary euthanasia. The arguments have been canvassed about palliative care or the right to die with dignity, and I will not repeat them here. Suffice it to say that I once watched a friend of mine die a slow and agonising death. He knew he had a terminal illness and approached several of his friends on many occasions, asking them to assist him to die.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, we discussed this. What we all did, instead of assisting him, was to make sure that any methods enabling him to take his life were kept locked away, and we watched him closely. In the end this friend, when close to death, could stand it no longer and threw himself off a cliff. I suggest that we were wrong in not assisting him in ending his life. If there had been legislation, such as that in the Northern Territory today, he would have been able to die with dignity. Not only could he have died with dignity but his friends would have been relieved of the guilt feeling they now have of not having been able to assist him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing beautiful in watching a person dying in agony, screaming in pain and delirious with the impact of medication&mdash;as happened with my own sister. It is not as if, in society, a form of euthanasia is not conducted, with doctors now making that decision. The decision should be taken from the doctors and from others, and placed where it really belongs: with the individual. There are, of course, a number of scare campaigns running. We have all had the emotive letters accusing those of us who support euthanasia of legalising murder. The case must be very weak if those supporting the Andrews bill have to rely on such emotive arguments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot understand how anyone who believes in the basic freedom of the individual could deny an individual the right to voluntary euthanasia if they so choose. It is not as if a person could suddenly have a bad day and decide to end their life. They have to be suffering a terminal illness, and there has to be a second opinion: there are very many safeguards. I have heard the argument saying that this is the start of the slippery slide. But the safeguards are in place, and all the nonsense that people talk&mdash;about family pressure and the elderly being made to feel a burden&mdash;is exactly that: nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those who do not support voluntary euthanasia, that is their right; and no&hyphen;one would force voluntary or involuntary euthanasia on them. But why should people who do not agree with euthanasia force their views on people who do agree with it? It is a fundamental human right for people to die with dignity, and I cannot understand why people can oppose it. If I had a life&hyphen;threatening illness, I would choose voluntary euthanasia. That is my right, and I do not see why that right should be denied me. For those who oppose voluntary euthanasia, that is also their right. It is a right I respect, but I cannot accept that that right enables them to put their own views, morality, and beliefs concerning life and death onto others. They should not deny anyone this basic human choice.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6744">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard members say that they could not support the state taking of life. Like the honourable member for Watson (Mr McLeay), I oppose capital punishment. I have always opposed capital punishment. I am a pacifist, but this is not about the state taking a life. It is about an individual choice. It is not state sanctioned killing, but an individual choice. At the conclusion of his speech, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) said, `I hope that we have the courage to deal with such an issue of profound importance to this nation and to the people of Australia.' As I said before, I believe sincerely that this parliament has no right to be debating this issue of personal morality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most speakers in this debate have quoted from letters to support their case, and there is nothing wrong with that. Since everyone has been quoting from letters, let me quote from a letter. It is from Bob Dent, the first person to have voluntary euthanasia in Australia. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I read with increasing horror newspapers stories of Kevin Andrews' attempt to overturn the most compassionate piece of legislation in the world. The Church and State must remain separate. What right has anyone because of their religious faith to demand that I behave according to their rules until some omniscient doctor decides that I must have had enough and goes ahead and increases my morphine until I die?</PARA>
<PARA>As I have tried to explain, I have no argument with people who oppose euthanasia. I respect their point of view. But why, because of their opposition, should they put their view on me or on anyone else? As the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) so rightly says, it is an issue that we all have to face. When my time comes I will take the decision and, regardless of what legislation might be in place, I will exercise my right to exit this life with as much dignity as I can. I hope that, if I have a terminal illness, I have the option of euthanasia. I totally support the view of Bob Dent. What he said I passionately believe, and I will quote him:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been in the parliament for 16 years, and there has never before been an occasion when I have had the opportunity to participate in a debate on a question which is as intensely moral and personal as this question is. Let me at this stage indicate my objection to the fact that the debate is being conducted in the Main Committee. This is not because I have any disrespect for this chamber&mdash;I was chairman of the Standing Committee on Procedure when we reported on it, and it had been operating very effectively&mdash;but the Main Committee was not established for this purpose. Debate on questions as intensely moral and personal as this question should be conducted in the main chamber, and members should have the opportunity to speak about the question more fully.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to emphasise, as well, that I am not very concerned about the possibility that the federal government might overrule territory or state legislation. If it is considered to be appropriate within the constitutional rights of the federal government, then I am quite comfortable about that, particularly if it involves extending the rights of individuals or if it involves protecting the Australian community in any number of ways. This question is one that I have to resolve on the basis, essentially, of how I relate to it personally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context, let me make this point: I have already completed, in a legal form, a power of attorney with the appointment of a patient advocate with an advance directive to ensure that, in the event of my suffering a number of seriously debilitating and irreversible circumstances, people that I love will have the opportunity to make decisions which I may not be able to make for myself. I am indebted to the Voluntary Euthanasia Society for the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6745"> basic draft of that document. In connection with that, in the event of certain identified debilitating circumstances afflicting me, I have directed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) that I am not to be subjected to any medical intervention or treatment aimed at prolonging or sustaining my life;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) that any distressing symptoms (including any caused by lack of food or fluid) are to be fully controlled by appropriate analgesic or other treatment, even though that treatment may shorten my life.</PARA>
<PARA>I have modified the statement&mdash;the draft of which, as I say, I am indebted to the Voluntary Euthanasia Society for providing&mdash;in the following way, because it was not, for my purposes, strong enough. I have added this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">IN THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) I am afflicted by one or more of the conditions mentioned in the schedule&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and they are identified&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) despite not being subjected to any intervention or treatment aimed at prolonging my life my life is being unreasonably prolonged by natural causes to the point where I lose the physical and/or mental capacity to act rationally, independently and with an acceptable level of human dignity, then, I direct and authorise that positive intervention be provided to either assist me to terminate my life or to terminate it for me if I am unable to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>I have three beautiful grandchildren. I have attempted to live and to lead a moral and dignified life. Everyone has to die. But in the period immediately before my death I do not want to suffer, consciously or unconsciously, my three beautiful grandchildren seeing their grandfather lose his personal dignity by growing senility, degeneration, physical and mental decay. I find that prospect absolutely horrifying. So to those people who would seek to restrict my right to determine the timing and nature of my leaving this life I simply say, `Do not do so.' I ask them not to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This question is about voluntary euthanasia. It was referred to this Main Committee and at this time we have here eight members, in addition to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, of a 148&hyphen;member House of Representatives. We have 10 minutes each to consider the most moral and personal question that I have ever been involved in considering in this parliament in 16 years. I supported the proposition that it should have been referred in the first place to a special committee, which was the motion moved by the member for Longman (Mr Brough). It should have been. It would have given an opportunity for our peers, by way of a select committee, to consider some of the doubts that are involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would challenge some of my colleagues to identify clearly the difference between voluntary, involuntary and non-voluntary euthanasia, between active and passive euthanasia, and to distinguish them, in turn, from assisted suicide. They need to be able to do that in order to cast a sensible vote in connection with this question. I would challenge all my colleagues on both sides of the chamber who decided that that special select committee would not be established to resolve the very compelling legal question where competent legal opinion says this legislation will not impact adversely on other elements of Northern Territory legislation and equally competent legal opinion says it will. Until we resolve questions of that kind I have very great doubt about whether any of us can cast a sensible and a rational vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also make this point, which is a matter of enormous moral concern to me: if euthanasia remains a criminal act, there must be criminal sanctions. We cannot allow good, compassionate, moral people who assist others to die&mdash;including an estimated 7,000 doctors practising <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6746"> in Australia at the present time&mdash;to take the risk of being criminals and incarcerated. Early last year, seven doctors in Victoria went on the public record to say they had assisted their patients to die. That is a criminal act. They could have been incarcerated for 14 years. But in their courage and their morality they made that public statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As legislators, we depend on the compassion of the law enforcement authorities and on the compassion and morality of the courts not to convict those people. That is an act of personal and political cowardice. We wash our hands. We say, `The courts are compassionate. They will not convict moral, honest, courageous people.' And we leave the criminal law in place. Let me repeat: that is an act of personal and political cowardice. As legislators, we have a responsibility to give the lead to the courts and the law enforcement authorities, and we choose not to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any number of examples have been given in connection with these particular questions. There have been letters quoted from; there have been particular cases referred to. In the unfortunately limited time available, let me refer to some of them. I refer to Esme Rushton from the Dandenongs. Early last year she said that she hoped that at the end of the line for her, when the pain gets too much, she can die in her leafy mountain home, not in a geriatric ward. She said, `I will take a pill or a few pills and just go to bed and not wake up.' She said, `Why should you suffer to die when you are going to die anyway? I mean the thought of becoming a vegetable and have people having to look after me is terrifying.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I share Esme Rushton's concern. I have seen the most debilitated, senile people in the worst wards of the nursing homes and they do not deserve that. I do not deserve that. My children and my grandchildren and those people I love do not deserve that. So I say to people, `If you do not want to have available to you voluntary euthanasia, please don't deny that right to me!'</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Eight years ago, the Greer family moved in next door. Roger had been a successful director of a large advertising agency until a brain tumour struck. The tumour was treated and he was on the road to recovery, until further brain tumours were discovered. The reason I tell this story is because it changed the way that I look at the whole dying process. I saw the wonderful palliative care provided to Roger. His family and friends would visit and sit with him; his wife, Barbara, cared for and loved him in the most exquisite way. Life was precious and every moment of it was to be savoured.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I met some wonderful people who cared for Roger. One was a palliative care sister named Margaret Gully. Margaret was the closest that one could come to a living angel. Roger joked about his brain tumour early in the piece and said that he needed it like a hole in the head. His sense of humour stayed with him until the very end. The process of dying was an intimate and caring experience that family and friends participated in and shared. This brilliant man passed away and I was deeply touched by his family and the great care and love that was provided to him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The word `euthanasia' comes from the Greek `eu' and `thanatos', which means an easy death. The greatest fear that we mortals have is the fear of dying. Many of us, God bless, will die peacefully and tranquilly in our sleep. For others this will not be the case. As far back as ancient times, man has been terrified of his own mortality. We are the only creatures who bury our dead; the rest of the animal kingdom does not. The sight of a dead human body in the decaying process in ancient times was a reminder of our fragility and the darkness of death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Kevin Andrews' Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996 seeks to overturn the Northern Territory euthanasia bill passed by the Legislative Assembly in May 1996. The Northern Territory bill <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6747"> is based on the simple principle: if there are terminally ill patients who wish to end their suffering by accelerating inevitable death, and there are sympathetic doctors who are willing to help them to die with dignity, the law should not forbid it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory bill proposes and states that a person asking for assistance must be an adult; be terminally ill and diagnosed to die within 12 months; be mentally competent; make the request in writing; be advised about the nature of the illness and the palliative care and medical treatment available; be experiencing severe pain or suffering distress with no medical treatment reasonably available to offer relief; and be examined by a second medical practitioner to confirm the circumstances and fulfil all the statutory requirements set down by the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only after all the above have been fulfilled will a doctor be able to prescribe a lethal substance to be self-administered. The bill prohibits anyone appointing a relative or an agent to make a life&hyphen;shortening decision on their behalf. The letter of the law will continue to apply to anyone who takes the life of another or who attempts to take life in all other circumstances. The laws in relation to homicide apply now and continue to apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many arguments that have been put forward in support of euthanasia and against the Andrews bill, such as those advocated by Dr Roger Hunt, Dr Robert Marr and Professor Peter Baume. They say that the Northern Territory bill is a long overdue reform and that eight out of 10 Australians want voluntary euthanasia decriminalised. They believe that the Andrews bill will keep the practice of euthanasia unregulated, without safeguards and surveillance; it will undermine the patient's autonomy and leave end of life decisions in the hands of the doctors; it will invalidate the Northern Territory's Natural Death Act of 1988, which allows dying patients to refuse life&hyphen;sustaining treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They say that it will impact upon and render ineffective crucial elements of the criminal code in the Northern Territory; it casts doubts on the legality of life&hyphen;shortening palliative care; it will increase fear of prosecutions and uncertainty in the medical profession in the care of dying patients; and it will deny dying patients the right to choose how much suffering they have to endure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first point I wish to make is that, although research states that 80 per cent of people are supportive of euthanasia and it is popular, it does not necessarily make it right. Death is inevitable, and it is the process of death and dying that frightens us the most. The May 1996 position statement of the Australian Medical Association's federal council included some of the following points: The AMA believes that doctors should not be involved in interventions that have, as the primary goal, the ending of a person's life; the AMA endorses the right of patients to refuse treatment and the right of severely and terminally ill patients to have relief of pain and suffering, even when such therapy may shorten a patient's life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For society to invest in any group the power to administer death is to make life negotiable&mdash;and it is not. To believe that doctors acting individually or in concert would act honestly is idealistic in the extreme. It defies history. To believe that they will never make a mistake is to indulge in fantasy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Governor&hyphen;General of Australia, Mr Bill Hayden, referred to the frail and elderly as `unproductive burdens' and said that succeeding generations deserve to be disencumbered of some of these burdens. What does that mean to a lonely old person already suffering low self&hyphen;esteem and a sense of being a burden? These elderly people will feel that euthanasia is not a choice but an expectation of them to do the right thing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6748">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Canadian Supreme Court judgment in 1993 said that the responsibility of government to protect the vulnerable people from abuse outweighs any individual right to assisted suicide. The conclusion of the House of Lords in 1994 was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be impossible to ensure that every act of euthanasia was truly voluntary. We are concerned that vulnerable people, the elderly, lonely, sick or distressed would feel pressure, whether real or imagined, to request early death.</PARA>
<PARA>Palliative care in the United Kingdom has been developed to a very high standard. With appropriate management, pain, distress and suffering in all terminal illness can be totally relieved in all but a minority of cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people also stress the importance of dealing with the psychological, social and spiritual distress suffered by many dying individuals. The improvement of palliative care in Australia is really what is needed&mdash;not euthanasia. According to Dr Colleen McCullough in a recent report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Putting People Down</EMPHASIS>, which she presented to the New South Wales parliament in March 1996:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The right to life, whatever its quality, is universal and sacred among humankind. Those who genuinely want to die will find a way to suicide without assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>She believes that those who ask others to kill them do not genuinely want to die. Throughout the ages, to summon a physician indicated a will to live. To ask a physician to administer death is anathema.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The euthanasia issue is one that is close to the moral and social conscience of many. I have had many letters, phone calls and personal representations from constituents. Although my personal beliefs are important, I have to weigh up the conscience and feeling of those in the Petrie electorate to ensure that I vote, not just for myself but for the majority of the people I represent. The majority of those who have contacted my office are in favour of the Andrews bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to express some of the comments of people from my electorate. Their comments both for and against euthanasia are moving and each one has a story behind it. Those advocates for the Andrews bill say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not through lack of compassion that the rest of the world has rejected euthanasia. Rather it is because of the realistic knowledge that a law permitting the use of lethal injections in hospitals could never be safe.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is true that palliative care is a much better option for those desperately ill patients. Encouraging them to take their own lives is a failure of the love and care we should have for each other.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To hope that all doctors will exercise so&hyphen;called euthanasia rights with total compassion is being idealistic in the extreme. Herein lies the danger to the weak&mdash;the aged&mdash;the mentally ill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe strongly in the value and dignity of human life and feel that allowing euthanasia is not recognising that value.</PARA>
<PARA>Other comments presented include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Northern Territory's laws on euthanasia. . . well thought out and should never be tampered with by our federal government.</PARA>
<PARA>Another person wrote to me:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6749">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . every individual should have free choice to have their life terminated in the appropriate circumstances and under the umbrella of a well&hyphen;defined law.</PARA>
<PARA>Another constituent writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I support the Northern Territory in the acceptance of people deciding for themselves on how they wish to die.</PARA>
<PARA>And, finally, a nurse who wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am a nurse who is dealing with the terminally ill. . . I would like to have that choice.</PARA>
<PARA>However, my feelings on this are that life is precious and that no act of parliament should decide who lives and who dies. We as a society need to take greater responsibility and control of our sick and our elderly. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make it clear at the outset that I oppose the Andrews bill. Even if I did not believe in euthanasia I would still be opposing it because it is clearly an affront to the rights of the people of the Northern Territory. I would not like it to be thought that I condone statehood for the Northern Territory. At the first opportunity I will vote for its abolition. But while the situation is as it is, it is clearly a decision for the people of the Northern Territory to make and through their elected representatives they have made it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the measure of any civilisation is how it treats its young and its old and on that score I think our civilisation has many things to answer for. The process of dying can be, as some members have said, a lovely experience, for others it is not so. I have watched my brother die over the last few years. He was buried a few weeks ago; a man who was a superb athlete stricken with a disease which gradually crippled him. He died a quadriplegic with his brain entirely intact. I know there were many times he wanted to die. In fact, he had asked me to assist him which unfortunately I was not able to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I called in to see him on my way to Canberra and he was obviously in pain. He could only nod his head in one direction. When the doctor was called the doctor ascertained he was in pain. He was fitted with a morphine pump to ease the pain. I know that the doctor knew that that pump was going to end his life and I know that the doctor knew I knew. Nothing was said, but it was clearly an understanding. The morphine suppressed the capacity to breath and he passed away peacefully and hopefully in less pain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are dealing with here is not some revolutionary concept. It is quite clear that many people make this determination that it is best for them. If we are going to talk about dignity, the dignity of the individual must be paramount. I think the safeguards in this bill are perfectly adequate. It may be that there are some abuses of it. Why there should be is beyond me, because there are abuses of the present system now. There are some people whose death is hastened I am sure, for whatever reason. But in most cases I think the doctors and nurses who do this do it with the utmost compassion. We are not giving any more chances for this to occur, in fact we are probably reducing the probability of that happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know why this has to be an argument between palliative care and the right to die. It seems to me that both are important. I believe very strongly that government should be massively increasing support for palliative care. One of the things I find amusing is that many of the people who have taken part in this debate, and have taken a very strong view in opposing euthanasia, would be the very same people who would oppose the legalisation of the use of heroin in palliative care treatment. There is absolutely no doubt, as experience in the United Kingdom shows, that heroin is a far better substance for relieving pain and keeping <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6750"> people cognisant at the same time than other drugs, particularly morphine. So diamorphine is certainly more effective in this regard, yet many of the people who talk about their opposition to euthanasia, for whatever reasons, are the same people who would actually inhibit the use of the drugs that do make palliative care an alternative option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that, if people are happy with palliative care, every facility should be put in there for palliative care. We should increase the funding. It is not well funded now. The facilities for it are not widespread and are not well enough available. Certainly, with medical science now, there is probably no need for people to live in pain if they do have access to that palliative care, but it is not widely enough available and that has to be faced. I suggest that people who oppose this bill should go out on a campaign to increase funding for palliative care. They would have my entire support were they to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are circumstances where people feel that the best way out for their loved ones is to end that suffering. I know this was a consideration of my brother's. He knew the burden he was putting on his wife and, to a lesser extent, the rest of his family&mdash;but certainly his wife. The courage and the cheerfulness with which she accepted that task was tremendous. But he knew the burden he had become and he saw no point in prolonging it. He simply wanted out, and I believe he should have had the opportunity. He may not have taken it. In the end he worked out some reconciliation between himself and his God, I guess, and he passed away in relative comfort with the aid of the doctor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is absolutely no doubt&mdash;and I have spoken to many nurses who worked in this field who say it is very common&mdash;that there are situations where patients have begged them, and they have not been able to oblige, but eventually the doctor has acquiesced, for sufficient morphine to be given to make sure that death occurred. This is, in my view, a compassionate situation. Can anyone tell me: what is there to gain, for people in a terminally ill condition, in surviving a little longer?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been noted that euthanasia is not accepted generally in the world. We are told it is not a lack of compassion. I do not think it is. It is simply a lack of courage. What the bill simply does is to return some very small power to people. It gives people the option of making a decision for themselves. It does not give power to other people to make options for them as occurs at the moment and, in that sense, it is much more likely to circumvent the convenient death than by simply not having it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I resent this bill very strongly. We have a very heavy schedule in this parliament. We do not need this legislation. It clearly circumvents the will of the people of the Northern Territory and the people of the Northern Territory have the absolute power to change this at their next election if they feel strongly about it. I doubt whether they will because I, like every member of this parliament, have had mail from people on this issue. My office has been flooded with mail from the people with vested interests, religious concerns and people who write to you with their own personal convictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been rather interested at the very large proportion of older women that have written to me. It seems to me that in society there may be more toughness or more intellectual rigour in women than occurs in men. Because overwhelmingly the letters I have had are from older women saying, `I want this right. I want this ability to make this decision for myself.' I do not believe the legislation will be overwhelmingly used. I think you will find there will be a few cases a year, because most will leave it too late and many will be accommodated by obliging and compassionate doctors or nurses.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like many members in this House, I have been lobbied from all sides on this matter. Many people have offered well&hyphen;considered arguments both for and against the bill and good reasons why I should support their own view. I have of course listened to all of them, but in the end the decision we all have to make is for one side or the other in this argument.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this case, Mr Deputy Speaker, I surely do not want to sit on the fence. So let me say at the outset that I support the Andrews bill. Many will no doubt be surprised that as a Liberal my views will not support the freedom&mdash;as they would put it&mdash;to die with dignity. Others will dismiss my arguments as they will believe my support for this bill is because I am a Catholic. Actually, my religion explains little about my feelings on this issue. Anybody who knows Catholics will know that, while united somewhat by religious faith, we are otherwise a diverse group who because of our creed, not despite it, hold many disparate beliefs on matters less spiritual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the Andrews bill because I believe that active voluntary euthanasia is wrong. Active voluntary euthanasia is not providing relief for pain that hastens death or withholding or withdrawing treatment that is futile or unwanted. Active voluntary euthanasia is where medical intervention is sought by a patient in order to end their own life. I support the Andrews bill because the Northern Territory legislation is poor legislation and could lead to passive involuntary euthanasia where a third party requests the withholding of treatment or, worse still, active voluntary euthanasia where, at the request of a third person, medical intervention takes place to end a life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Netherlands, active euthanasia without the consent of patients and its legislature is being practised now. The Remmelink Committee reported that in 1990 nearly 15,000 had, without their consent, had treatment withdrawn or applied with the intent to terminate their lives. Initially, when the Netherlands law was first enacted, it was felt the controls were sufficient. Now, nearly 20 per cent of all the deaths that occur in the Netherlands are by euthanasia. Over half of those, therefore, are without their consent. Experience in the Netherlands shows that where you have voluntary assisted suicide or euthanasia, involuntary euthanasia will occur&mdash;not may, but will, occur. Inevitably, one will follow the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many legislatures around the globe that have debated voluntary death as a solution for suffering. Every one of those, other than the Northern Territory, has rejected that solution. That does not imply that to be the first is necessarily to be wrong, but to be the first means that you have a greater responsibility to be right, especially in this case where it is a matter of life and death. In courts of law, juries convict in criminal cases only if there is a unanimous feeling that the state has proven its case beyond reasonable doubt. This rush to judgment by the Northern Territory legislature achieved no such unanimity. Now it seems that some who opposed the legislation are willing to support it because it achieved a mere majority, like a juror who holds the accused to be innocent but is nonetheless willing to convict him anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory legislation is not right. It is totally flawed. Its intent is the relief of pain and suffering; but palliative care can relieve much of this. In the Northern Territory, however, where they have passed this legislation, there is no medical oncologist, no palliative care specialist, a barely resourced domiciliary palliative care program, virtually no radiotherapy services and not a single hospice. To many in the Northern Territory it is not surprising that death seems to be the only form of relief.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6752">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some have suggested that this lack of services is justification for euthanasia. To quote some other people, Bill Hayden, our former Governor&hyphen;General, told the Royal Australasian College of Physicians that `there is a point when the succeeding generations deserve to be disencumbered of some unproductive burdens.' As another academic and political candidate put it a few years ago, `When you're ripe, it's time to go!' I cannot believe that we are ready to treat human life as we would rotten fruit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a respect for life in our society that is fundamental to all. Respect for the aged, for our parents, for our grandparents, for the mentally ill and for the disabled is common in all societies. We do not grade human beings by their worth, because we believe that we are all equal. We do not place use&hyphen;by date stickers on human beings, because we all do contribute to our society, in whatever form. By allowing euthanasia, you necessarily diminish the rights of others by indicating to those that remain that they are a burden; that they are costing too much; that life is not so important after all; and that it can be given away by society because other people have done so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To take away a life, Mr Deputy Speaker, is the most heinous and serious act punishable by law, not only in our society but in every society throughout the world. We revile those who murder and reserve our most serious sentences for them, not only in our Western civilisation, but in every civilisation throughout the world. We also pour massive resources into saving lives. To accept euthanasia compromises those attitudes and actions. In a society that values life above all other things, it is an incomprehensible about&hyphen;face. The New South Wales Voluntary Euthanasia Society long ago made that about&hyphen;face, and continued further down the track. Recent attempts to bring euthanasia legislation into effect in New South Wales saw the society urging the inclusion of disability as well as illness in the guidelines to the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you believe that euthanasia, if allowed to remain legal, is totally voluntary then consider the thoughts of Peter Singer, the Melbourne euthanasia advocate, who suggests that babies may be killed up to the age of one month. The Remmelink study shows that there are numbers of handicapped newborns, sick children and psychiatric and AIDS patients whose lives were terminated by doctors. Euthanasia proponents say that this is about the right to die. I believe it is more about the right to be killed by someone else. It is less about easing the pain of dying than it is about making death more palatable for surviving relatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Euthanasia proponents believe that doctors should become killers. The Hippocratic oath states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If any shall ask of me a drug to produce death, I will not give it, nor will I suggest such counsel.</PARA>
<PARA>Euthanasia proponents expect doctors to abandon the centuries-old ethics of that profession. The Australian Medical Association's code of ethics, recently updated, says of dying patients:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Always bear in mind the obligation of preserving life, but allow death to occur with dignity and comfort, where death is deemed to be inevitable and where curative treatment appears to be futile.</PARA>
<PARA>Euthanasia proponents expect doctors to ignore that too. As the son of an eye surgeon, Mr Deputy Speaker, I was brought up in the belief that doctors are trained to heal, not to kill. Relieving pain that hastens death or withdrawing unwanted treatment is not intentional killing. Administering a lethal injection is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has also been an attempt in this debate by proponents of euthanasia to turn this into an issue of state rights. To acquiesce to bad law and wrong principles by hiding behind a facile argument that is patently flawed, which even a cursory glance at the Australian constitution will prove, would be extremely cowardly. The Commonwealth clearly has the power to act <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6753"> in this case. Some have dismissed the attempt to do so as blatant paternalism. I suppose those voices would also be raised when a parent confiscated dangerous drugs from their 18&hyphen;year&hyphen;old son or daughter, calling that blatant paternalism, too. In closing, I should state that I cannot in all good conscience oppose a bill that I know, if passed, will save the lives of Australian people. I urge the House to support the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am speaking in support of the bill proposed by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews). In doing so, I am sure that members on both sides of the debate are motivated by the desire to ease the pain and discomfort of dying people. Provided that sufficient government finance is available, we should expect continued advancement in this field of medical science. However, people who are promoting euthanasia would not be as strong in their conviction for improved palliative care as would those who see this form of care as the best means of assisting terminally ill people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are all upset about the suffering that individual people like Mr Dent have experienced, we should consider what harmful effects euthanasia could have on society and, in fact, question if there would be an increase in involuntary euthanasia. There is some evidence to suggest that this would be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Listening to ABC Radio on the evening of 26 September, I heard two supporters of euthanasia make statements that concerned me. I believe they give some insight into post-voluntary euthanasia Australia. Mr Jeff Kennett said, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Northern Territory have taken a very courageous leadership role, and I think most of us, probably if faced with a year, two years, three years, 20 years of incredible pain and we made that decision to exit with grace, we should be allowed to do so.</PARA>
<PARA>Would Mr Kennett be suggesting with this time frame that people would be encouraged to exit with grace at an early stage of their illness? This would deny the opportunity of the medical profession to develop a cure or develop treatment that would make that person's life comfortable. Michael Baume said, on the same program:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are over 7000 doctors in Australia today who admit to having practised euthanasia at least once and I believe some of these have been non&hyphen;voluntary.</PARA>
<PARA>If Michael Baume is correct and non&hyphen;voluntary euthanasia has been practised in Australia when voluntary euthanasia is illegal, it is in itself a very frightening thought. But how much more widely practised would it become if voluntary euthanasia were legal?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Labor Party allows a conscience vote on moral and ethical issues such as euthanasia. As with most moral issues, Australian people would have a wide variety of views. In this particular case, these would relate to constitutional issues as well as social and moral questions. My personal view is that it is morally wrong for the state to take a life or for the state to legislate to assist in taking a human life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I believe is at stake here is the value of human life. If we cheapen the value of life in any way, but particularly by legislation, we would open the door for other forms of termination of life in circumstances other than what is proposed on this occasion. In Australia we have seen criminal elements show scant regard for life. In many overseas countries we have seen the same disregard for life for political and territorial reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While some have raised the state rights question, there seems to be a serious flaw in this argument when the first publicised person who was to enact the legislation resided in another state. As the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act is available to all Australians, it is therefore appropriate for the federal parliament to debate this issue.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6754">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have received considerable correspondence on this issue, as I know all members have, from within my own electorate and from throughout Australia. I certainly thank those within my electorate who have taken the time to let me know their views. But this national interest justifies the federal parliament expressing a national opinion. In my view, the issue of appropriate palliative care and the continued need for medical research to find cures for major illnesses goes hand in hand with my opposition to euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this modern economic world, there is a continual battle to obtain sufficient funds to finance health and care facilities for those most in need, whether they be in need of child care, medical services for families, care for people with disabilities or elderly people. It should be remembered that a long and relatively comfortable life is available for many people with major medical problems, thanks to progress in medical science and services. With improved medical research we could save the lives of patients where they were thought to be terminally ill at one point. If the argument were accepted that euthanasia was valid in terminating the life of one person, it would clearly place under threat the lives of many other people who society considers, for medical reasons, may just as well be dead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My view on this point is supported by Dr Carlos Gomez from the University of Virginia Hospital in Charlottesville, Virginia, who carried out the research for his doctoral thesis on 26 cases of euthanasia in the Netherlands. While the majority of the patients appeared to meet the criteria for euthanasia, in at least four cases they did not, according to Dr Gomez's research. In one case, a doctor injected a lethal dose of potassium chloride into someone who had been severely injured in a car accident and looked unlikely to recover. The doctor wanted to spare the family the emotional suffering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another case quoted by Dr Gomez was the killing of a two&hyphen;year&hyphen;old child with Down syndrome. The child would probably have lived for 40 or 50 years. Dr Gomez has said that, in Holland, you feel that something is going on behind the argument for patients' autonomy. He said that some physicians think that certain patients are better off dead than alive and they are willing to make that decision.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely we, as a society, do not want to close the door on continual research into what are now seen as incurable diseases. Do we want to close the door on continuing to care for ourselves and our family members as we grow older? I believe euthanasia would place these obligations on our society under threat. All major political parties have agreed that society has an obligation to provide medical care for all sections of our community, particularly those unable to help themselves: the young and the elderly. Governments have an obligation to ensure that modern medicine is available to relieve the pain of dying people; that good palliative care is available to ensure the control of pain and provide around&hyphen;the&hyphen;clock support to relieve the emotional distress of dying patients and their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is clearly a political and economic side being argued by some in this debate. If we find finance is not sufficient to supply adequate medical services to the general public, then quick&hyphen;fix solutions are going to be seen as possible options. I believe it is necessary in opposing euthanasia to also ensure that the medical profession and care service providers have the necessary funds to provide palliative care for the terminally ill and aged members of our society. Therefore, I would urge the coalition government and Labor opposition to support additional funding for the care of aged and ill members of our society.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have sat down on many occasions to think and to write a few lines about my decision to oppose euthanasia. I have read many letters that I have received from constituents and beyond. I have read letters from famous people, professionals in the field of medicine and ordinary people in the street. Having considered the views put to me, both in correspondence and by personal representations, my conscience tells me that euthanasia is morally wrong. My main concern is that we are trying to interfere with our culture. Some other societies may practise a form of euthanasia but this has never been the path of Australian society. Our culture has been to preserve life; to look after the elderly, people with disabilities, people who are mentally ill and the young.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> If euthanasia were accepted into the law of this country at any level, we would be placing terrible pressure on many of these people, and on the medical profession to terminate human life ahead of its time, as well as removing our clear responsibility to provide public funding to continue to improve our health services. There would be less need to provide finance to encourage medical research into finding cures for major illnesses such as cancer, AIDS and Alzheimer's disease. There would be less need to provide finance for nursing homes to provide comfort, care and pain relief for dying people. But, worst of all, we would be opening the door to a callous, less caring society. We would be opening the door to the unknown if we accept any form of euthanasia. It is extremely likely that at the healthy community's convenience other forms of mercy killing or genocide would follow, as it has in other countries, from pre&hyphen;war Germany to post&hyphen;war Holland.</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(12.10 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I state my position at the outset. I am opposed to voluntary euthanasia on two major and specific grounds: that is, on religious, moral grounds and because of the unsolvable legal intricacies. I oppose euthanasia because of my deeply held religious and moral conviction as one who adheres to Christian beliefs and places absolute value on the sanctity of life. In fact, not only the Christian faith but also all the other major world religions have at least one tenet in common, and that is respect for the absolute sanctity of life. Voluntary euthanasia contravenes that sanctity. The second major and specific ground for my opposition to euthanasia relates to the impossibility of putting to paper the legal requirements that will not be open to widespread abuse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am acutely aware of my responsibilities as a legislator, having served 12 years in the New South Wales parliament and about eight months in the federal parliament, in ensuring that laws are not enacted that are open to abuse, either deliberately or in all innocence, whether it be perceived or otherwise. The Northern Territory legislation on voluntary euthanasia is abhorrent to me because of at least two reasons, as I mentioned earlier, the former relating to moral grounds and the latter because it is unworkable legislation. I will expand on that later in my speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Three arguments have been promoted by the supporters of euthanasia in support of their case against the deliberations of this parliament. It is their assertion that states rights are being violated, that the issue is not one for the federal parliament, and that rather it should be determined by referendum and we should mirror the views of the alleged majority as reflected <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6756"> in opinion polls that show overwhelming support for euthanasia. My response to that assertion is that I am a federalist and a member of the federal parliament which represents all Australians. We, as federal members of parliament, simply cannot avoid this debate which has Australia&hyphen;wide implications. We are not a regional or narrow parliament, and it is certainly not a states rights issue as it is the indisputable right of the Commonwealth parliament to make laws for any state or territory under section 122 of the Commonwealth constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second argument by the supporters of euthanasia refers to the matter of a referendum to decide the issue. The electorate expects us, as its elected representatives, to show leadership and shoulder our responsibilities. It certainly does not want us to shirk our obligations every time an issue arises, no matter how contentious and/or potentially divisive it may prove to be, by dispatching it to referendum. A people's referendum must only be used to determine changes to the Australian constitution. It must never be used by parliaments to avoid taking responsibility for matters other than for constitutional changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third argument refers to the matter of the alleged majority view as determined by opinion polls. I strongly reject the view that parliaments should be poll driven. Our future as parliamentarians is determined by the people every three or so years based on our performance, our accessibility to our constituents and the views we expound&mdash;and that is the way it should be. I will nonetheless make passing reference to the issue of opinion polling, especially and in particular to this most complex and contentious of issues, that of euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can such a complex issue, with moral conscience overtones, with legalistic difficulties and with potentially unforeseen legislative ramifications, be responded to by a simplistic yes or no response? The fact is that it can not. Additionally, the wording of the question put to those who are polled can lead to differing interpretations unless time is spent explaining the background and the detailed arguments for and against so that a proper judgmental opinion can be given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having now spoken to many people and having received a very large number of letters on this subject over many years, I am convinced that the average person thinks of the issue of euthanasia as simply a matter of turning off the machine. It is little wonder then that an overwhelming number of people are supportive of euthanasia as they would define it. The fact is that that definition could not be further from the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Euthanasia is not turning off a machine that results in someone's death. Euthanasia is not about giving a person a pain killer which might lower that person's resistance levels which may result in an accelerated death. Euthanasia is the administering of a lethal injection, an injection administered by a fellow human being, that results in an instantaneous, premeditated killing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Spokespeople for all the major religions have spoken out against voluntary euthanasia and have spoken out not only with the authority of the scriptures and holy teachings that are unchanged through the ages. The position taken by the religious&mdash;that is, the Christians and those who follow the holy Torah, the holy Mosaic law, those who follow the teaching of the Koran, the Buddhists, the Hindus and all the other major religions&mdash;places the utmost emphasis on the sanctity of life. God gives and God takes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second major reason for the authority by which the religious speak on this issue is the fact that the religious have spent, and continue to spend, a huge amount of their resources in the form of not only personnel but also substantial sums of money in providing support for the dying and the families of the dying. In fact, a cursory glance at a comparison of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6757"> resources provided by the religious and the state towards the terminally ill shows a very heavy bias towards the religious. Therefore, if for no other reason, we have to listen to what the religious are warning against in regard to voluntary euthanasia, as they probably know, more than anyone else, that these unacceptable moral and legal obstacles exist that are insurmountable and therefore must be strenuously opposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Additionally, the non&hyphen;religious based support groups and associations, including the RSL, that minister to those who are terminally ill are all&mdash;with the exception of only one association&mdash;opposed to voluntary euthanasia. The association that stands alone is called the Coalition of Organisations for Voluntary Euthanasia. It is interesting to note that one of their policy objectives is that voluntary euthanasia be available to people with disabilities, whether they are terminally ill or not. That policy is strenuously opposed by all the disability groups throughout Australia. In fact, some of the most powerful opponents of voluntary euthanasia are the disability organisations that have played a major role throughout the world when legislators have considered the issue of voluntary euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the question of the codification, in statute form, of the circumstances under which a human life can be terminated legally and without the possibility of challenges to the law in the courts by relatives of the deceased or by community groups opposed to euthanasia. An undeniable fact has now emerged that no form of words can ever be put into legislation to legalise the circumstances and the safeguards to allow human beings to snuff out the life of another human being. The Northern Territory parliament has attempted to do that. However, their legislation is not only deficient at law but also lacks proper safeguards. For instance, the Northern Territory legislation allows for a two&hyphen;day cooling&hyphen;off period before life is extinguished. Yet we allow a five&hyphen;day cooling&hyphen;off period when someone buys a used car. How does the Northern Territory parliament justify that not unreasonable comparison between a human being and a used car?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been estimated that some 25,000 Australians could be yearly candidates for voluntary euthanasia. Can anyone seriously claim that each and every one of these cases will be subjected to the same scrutiny and the same safeguards? Will the individual applicants for euthanasia have these safeguards equally applied in each and every case? Or will we as a society become so desensitised to voluntary euthanasia that it will become an everyday occurrence, with a`ho&hyphen;hum' attitude becoming the norm?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to ensure that all who face a terminal illness will be confident in the fact that their final days will be without the added pressures of a final solution being theirs alone, and that&mdash;despite the fact that they feel desperately that they do not want to be a burden on their families&mdash;they will not have the option of leaving this world as soon as the law allows so as to not be a burden. If voluntary euthanasia is condoned, how many terminally ill patients will push the button because they may feel that one or more of their relatives want them to do so?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hear of the unbearable pain and suffering experienced by many terminally ill people being put forward as the main reason for euthanasia. Whilst no&hyphen;one can deny that people who are sick all feel varying degrees of pain, the fact is that our focus should always be on reducing the pain threshold and not on extinguishing the life. The overwhelming evidence produced by those who specialise in palliative care demonstrates beyond doubt that, even in the most severe cases, patients&mdash;in consultation with their doctors and families&mdash;can receive injections of chemical cocktails of various levels of potency to enable them to remain awake <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6758"> or at various levels of consciousness and, if the pain becomes unbearable, to keep them asleep until they die naturally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There seems little doubt that palliative care is becoming a major issue in our society, with an ageing population. No doubt all governments will have to spend increasing resources on palliative care, especially in ministering to the terminally ill. That is one issue that has to be resolutely addressed, and sooner rather than later. The inescapable fact is that euthanasia involves the taking of human life by another human being. That concept runs counter to all that a civilised society can or should allow, if we are not to gradually descend to the depths of barbarity by reaching for the ultimate in our throw&hyphen;away society, throw&hyphen;away humans. Voluntary euthanasia is the antithesis of a humane and compassionate society, and must be opposed at every stage.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This whole debate on the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996 is put in the context of territory rights versus moral rights of the federal parliament to make decisions in these matters. At a point members of the federal parliament have to make a decision on whether the moral rights that are implicit in this decision&mdash;so many of our decisions do have a moral aspect to them, whether we like it or not&mdash;override the proposals put forward by the Northern Territory. I believe they do. I believe that, apart from the whole states rights issue, there is another dimension, and that is the dimension that is pivotal in the whole process that the parliament is dealing with today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian parliament has dealt with similar issues of this type. The Tasmanian legislation on the rights of the homosexual community was one of those issues. This is a life and death issue and nothing could be more significant and more pivotal to the existence to our fellow Australians than the matter that we are dealing with today. It goes to the very basis of the delivery of health and the role of doctors and health professionals in our system. It is asking of them to think of themselves in a new dimension. Just to illustrate the process, I want to refer to a useful article provided to members by Karin Clark from Melbourne. Karin Clark goes to the processes of a doctor actually making a decision on what techniques should be best applied if a person wishes to participate in euthanasia. These are the comments by Karin Clark on the Northern Territory legislation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 7(2) provides that a medical practitioner must be guided by `appropriate medical standards' and any prescribed guidelines and must `consider the appropriate pharmaceutical information about any substance reasonably available for use in the circumstances'.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the circumstances of euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Difficult questions about the liability of the doctor may arise if the chosen combination of drugs is not effective to kill the patient in a `humane' or `dignified' or quick way.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have health professionals whose whole career, whose whole training, is focused on providing and sustaining life, and they are suddenly asked to change their thinking to what is the most appropriate, humane and dignified way that they can deliver death for a person. That switch required in the thinking of our medical professionals will then carry through, if the House supports euthanasia in the Northern Territory, to the whole attitude of our doctors and the medical profession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will reach a point ultimately where they are thinking in part, `What is the process I must use in order to bring about a dignified death of this person? What cocktail of drugs must I deliver to bring about a humane and dignified death?' Then patients themselves will start to consider, `Am I at a point yet in my life where the doctor is considering whether they will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6759"> bring about a dignified and human death, or what drugs could be used to bring those circumstances about?' The whole relationship between doctor and patient changes in a most dreadful way. When you have got a very sick person&mdash;they may be terminally ill or they may not be terminally ill&mdash;lying there wondering, `How is this doctor going to continue to treat me? Can I continue to trust this person or am I going to get that dreadful question, "Have things gone too far for you?"' To me, that is a whole basic and terrible change in a relationship which must be founded on trust and absolute and complete confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The medical practitioner is granted immunity, under the civil code and under the criminal code, if the medical practitioner acts in good faith and without negligence in compliance with the territory act. So, if they fail in the process of delivering the fatal dose, are they in some way absolved from making that mistake? Are they absolved from making a mistake about killing somebody? What is society playing with here? We expect in the one individual an absolute commitment to the maintenance of life and then absolve them if they fail to deliver a death. To me, that is a terrible conflict that cannot be resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is about a personal thing, it gets to the very essence of an individual, and in the processes of making this decision it no longer becomes a personal matter. It is not a matter of suicide or a person making a decision to take their own life; immediately other members of that person's family are involved. A whole medical team is also involved by participating to assist them to take a decision about whether they continue to live or not. So it moves far beyond just the personal matter. A person, an individual, has the right to make decisions, a terrible decision though it would be to me if they decided to commit suicide. But we cannot take away that free will from an individual in any way. In fact, many insist on pursuing to the ultimate the decision to take their own lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But then, if we can say that this is really only assisted suicide then we try to absolve those people who are asked to participate in the process from any ramifications. We rationalise that they are simply asked to participate in a suicide. There is no judgment for them to make at all, really, because the person suiciding is making an individual decision and that right still rests with them. They are asked to participate in the act whether they want to or not. But I do not believe any individual should ever be confronted to make a decision of that sort about the life of another person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is simply not a voluntary process at all that we are looking at. There is no such thing as voluntary euthanasia because as soon as we start to consider the voluntary nature of the thing you start to think about disabled people and infants. Where does the voluntary decision come for disabled people and infants? It becomes an involuntary process. They are no longer asked. You have only to refer to people like Mark Oliphant, who is the patron of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society in South Australia, and who said, in reference to someone he knows, `he should have been dead years ago and he is not; he just loves to be a damn nuisance to his friends and relatives.' Ellen Fanning, who was conducting the interview said, `And that's his right too, isn't it?' Mark responded, `No, I don't think it is. I think he is cluttering up the whole world at a time when he should not'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can you have one of Australia's greatest scientists proposing that? He is patron of the South Australian Society for Voluntary Euthanasia. He is not talking about voluntary euthanasia. He is talking about the prospect of getting rid of somebody who is just a damn nuisance cluttering up the place. We cannot have anybody given that power as Sir Mark has expressed it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6760">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to conclude by speaking about a very interesting seminar we had last weekend in my district of Castle Hill, where over 200 people attended. We had the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) there and the honourable former Senator Peter Baume. They discussed this issue in a very quiet and civilised way and the audience were very pleased to be able to hear these two men with differing views discuss these important matters. But there is no doubt in my mind of the views of the majority of those people, the great majority. They just thought that this whole process is too risky and too dangerous and they do not want us to pursue it as an Australian nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One only has to look at the prospects of determining the definitions. What is a terminal illness? What conditions must be met before euthanasia takes place? You are thinking of codifying this process in law and having it laid down so that it can be tested in the court. What must the patient be suffering to qualify? Who is excluded because of clinical depression? What about mental illnesses other than clinical depression? Who is of sound mind? What other conditions must be met for euthanasia to take place? When is palliative care available? All of these things are factors that are taken into account. I think that to codify those by the process of law is impossible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I think of one man I know, John Temple. When John was five, his parents were advised to let him die. Just five years ago, John won the Order of Australia for his contribution to disabled people. Bob Hawke was delighted to honour this man for his contribution and so were the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal Party. Yet here was a man, who has lived a most substantial life, whose parents were told, `Let him die.'</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was considering how to vote in relation to this matter, however, a number of arguments were put to me which made me reflect upon that starting position. The most telling of those arguments was advanced to me not by one of the more public of lobbyists but by Senator Harradine, who I think in the public forums has been relatively quiet, although his views are well known.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine spoke to me on a plane, travelling back to Hobart. He said that his principal concern was that some amongst the elderly who find themselves in situations where they feel somewhat of a burden to their families&mdash;they may find themselves in nursing homes or in some circumstance where they identify themselves as no longer being necessary to the wellbeing of their families but, perhaps, causing them some burden, some additional <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6761"> responsibilities&mdash;will be forced to think about a question which ought not be put to them. Indeed, they may be placed in a position where a matter that ought not have to come before them inevitably is drawn to their attention and, therefore, what for some of us in the community will be an act of willed choice will be asked of them in circumstances where that act of willed choice has not been sought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a powerful argument to reflect on. Nonetheless it struck me, on thinking further on it, that such elderly persons and others in such circumstances already reflect upon that choice as the law presently stands. They reflect upon it and, should they decide to request assistance for their death, they do so notwithstanding that that choice currently is not available under the law. And they already find within medical practitioners a substantial group of doctors who are willing to facilitate the execution of that choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that surveys within the Australian Medical Association show a very substantial minority of doctors are prepared currently to accede to requests under limited circumstances where they accept that the patient is suffering terminal pain and has rationally thought out their decision to bring their life to an end and do make available that assistance. We do not treat such doctors as murderers; our society does not do that. If we did then doctors who self-admittedly have carried out such procedures would be investigated by police, but they are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, within our own ranks, Dr Brendan Nelson, surprisingly a proponent of the Andrews bill, says that he himself has twice carried out active voluntary euthanasia. How can it be that somebody who asserts their right as a doctor, contrary to the law as it currently stands, can come before this parliament and say that that choice should not be available legally to patients who seek it under very restricted circumstances?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most eloquent contributions to this debate I have found came from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> editorial, my own home newspaper. I rarely refer to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> editorials, they are rarely so eloquent. They comment usually on local political events. However, the editorialist of 30 October found voice for sentiments that put this situation as well as I have ever read. The editorialist referred to the different arguments and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The points made for and against are salient. They are made by people with strong convictions. They are points which are deserving of respect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet the most relevant point, the one which many of the politicians involved in the debate in Federal Parliament acknowledge, and the one which the moralists and ethicists who decry euthanasia cannot ignore, is the one involving personal freedom.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People choose how they will live. They cannot be denied the right, once life becomes so unpleasant, so full of pain and misery that it is devoid of any semblance of what it had been, to choose how and when to die.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are counter-arguments that adequate safeguards cannot be devised to prevent a system which allows euthanasia from being abused.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is probably correct. Loopholes will be found.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But will they be any greater than the `loophole' which now sees blind eyes being turned to the fact that euthanasia, by any other name, is now being committed, without any legal safeguards and on a regular basis?</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very compelling case. We, as a society, currently turn a blind eye to euthanasia being committed regularly but without the safeguards that the Northern Territory legislation provides. I cannot see how it can be said to be moral to turn that blind eye and then to deny to the parliament of the Northern Territory a process that provides extremely restrictive guidelines for the exercise of that moral choice.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6762">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does seem to me that there is a greater likelihood of abuse not occurring, of people's will not being overborne, if euthanasia has to be carried out within a legal framework. It strikes me that it is more probable than not that those doctors who currently carry out euthanasia in a circumstance where society is turning a blind eye are not referring to all the safeguards that are required in the Northern Territory legislation and they are not required to seek the independent testimony of psychiatrists and other specialists. They take it upon themselves, as part of their responsibility to the care of that patient, to exercise an individual judgment which they know will not be second&hyphen;guessed by anyone. It is more likely than not that euthanasia would be less common were states and territories to apply strict guidelines so that anything that takes itself outside of those guidelines is genuinely treated as murder, is genuinely treated as a crime against society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that we are in a false and hypocritical environment if we acknowledge as a society that these things occur but apply to those people no moral opprobrium for breaking those laws or for transgressing the moral framework which we assert. The most obvious example of that is Dr Nelson, a member of this parliament, who supports the Andrews bill yet has himself admitted to two instances of active euthanasia, and perhaps more passive instances, in the conduct of his own medical practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After anxious thought and with respect to people like Margaret Tighe, who is present and who has spoken to me, and to Senator Harradine and many others who I believe have come into this debate with passionately held views, my conclusion is that this measure should be opposed. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are participating today in the national parliament&mdash;albeit in this chamber, we are still in the national parliament&mdash;in a debate about the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996. This is a very important debate. It is a debate about `death'. It is a debate about whether we, as Australians, accept the practice of one human actively&mdash;I underline `actively'&mdash;and intentionally killing another human being who decides they no longer wish to live.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While public debate about this topic has raged over recent months, one thing is clear&mdash;that is, within our community there are very widely held and often very strong views about `death'. This diversity of opinion has been reflected in the many letters and faxes on this issue that I have received. Our views about `death' are most often shaped by personal experience, and it is easy to get caught up amongst the emotive arguments for and against euthanasia. But our responsibility as national law makers, as elected politicians, is to try to examine this issue as clinically and factually as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the Commonwealth parliament is the appropriate forum for such a debate. Whether intentionally or not, the Northern Territory's Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 does affect all Australians. Attempts by Chief Minister Stone to limit the effect of the Northern Territory bill to Territorians are only farcical. Since this debate came on in this House, we have seen moves in the media by the particular doctor that has already undertaken to euthanase one person in the Northern Territory, encouraging more people to come to the Northern Territory and get the relevant certificates if they want to be euthanased as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, this is not an issue about states rights. The Andrews bill seeks to use the Commonwealth's legitimate constitutional powers to override a territory law. This bill is not revolutionary but follows the proper conventions of our constitution, under section 122. It is a pity that the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) has just left, because I heard one of the Labor <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6763"> Party members comment this morning that he thought that the coalition was all about support for states rights. They have short memories, Mr Deputy Speaker. When we voted on a bill that had an effect on individuals' rights in Tasmania, as you would recall, almost the majority of coalition members&mdash;in opposition as we were then&mdash;voted in support of individuals' rights over and above the rights of the state. That is what this debate is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians already have the right to die. Many states, and the Northern Territory, have legislation that gives people the right to refuse medical treatment even if the treatment would prolong or save their life. However, the Northern Territory's Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 goes one step further by allowing a doctor to prescribe, prepare or administer a substance to a patient with the intention of bringing about death. In this context the right to die really means the right to be killed on request.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Experience in the Netherlands has demonstrated all too clearly that the practice of euthanasia is profoundly corrupting and ultimately uncontrollable. Euthanasia remains a criminal offence in the Netherlands, but it has been openly practised for some years on the premise that doctors act in accordance with a number of formal criteria which have been enshrined in legislation. I disagree with the previous speaker that it should be codified so that there are controls on the doctors. We have seen in so many law making practices in this nation that codifying something&mdash;codifying a moral issue, codifying moral guidelines&mdash;provides, in reverse, the parameters for people to argue legally in a court to do something rather than not to do it. I do not believe that in this instance codification is what is required morally in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The guidelines for euthanasia are supposed to be limited to those who have a serious physical illness and who make a voluntary request for euthanasia. However, there is ample evidence that these guidelines have been flouted. Dr John Keown, lecturer in medical ethics at Cambridge University, recently stated in a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Dutch experience provides weighty evidence of the `slippery slope' from killing on request to killing without request.</PARA>
<PARA>And that is my argument about codifying the moral ethics of this issue. Further, Dr Keown said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The (Dutch) guidelines require a free well&hyphen;considered request for euthanasia by the patient, but it is disputed that thousands of Dutch patients have been killed without request, and courts recently upheld the killing of disabled babies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The guidelines limit euthanasia to cases of `unbearable suffering', but this has been held to include depression.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The guidelines require euthanasia to be a `last resort', but good palliative care is widely unavailable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The guidelines require doctors to report all cases of euthanasia to the authorities but one survey revealed that over 70% were not and were instead illegally certified by doctors as death by `natural causes'.</PARA>
<PARA>Even more alarming was the Chabot decision of the Dutch courts in which a woman with no physical illness, but a history of psychiatric illness, requested a lethal dose from her doctor after her husband walked out and her two sons had died. The courts held that she was an appropriate person for euthanasia, even though her mental `suffering' was derived from non&hyphen;physical causes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite assurances of appropriate guidelines and safeguards within the Northern Territory bill, how can we guarantee that non&hyphen;voluntary euthanasia will not occur? As the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) has suggested:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6764">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How can you police a system of safeguards when every time the safeguards are breached, the only witness is dead?</PARA>
<PARA>As a world first, the Northern Territory bill raises a number of perplexing issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can we improve standards of palliative care if the solution is euthanasia? Critics of palliative care say it is degrading and does not provide pain relief in certain circumstances. But how can we improve current practice if we kill the patient? What about the pressures on health care providers, such as nurses? While the Northern Territory act states that no health care provider is under any duty to participate in euthanasia, what is to say they will not feel pressured to assist or face from within the medical hierarchy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How do we safeguard against an act of non&hyphen;voluntary euthanasia? The Dutch experience shows guidelines do not work. A doctor's diagnosis or prognosis about a person's terminal illness can be wrong. There are many examples where patients with terminal illnesses have defied their prognosis and gone on to live fulfilling lives. Does legalising euthanasia pressure other people to end their lives? Making death an acceptable and legal solution to problems could pressure people, young or old, into taking this action&mdash;for example, increasing youth suicide or turning nursing homes into `death camps'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can the Northern Territory legislation be contained? There are genuine fears from disabled groups and others within the community that this legislation signals a devaluing of the lives of people who may be intellectually or physically disabled. As members of the human race, we must have an intrinsic belief in the special worth of human life&mdash;individually and personally I do. I have been present at the birth of all three of my children and I have a very deep belief in the worth of human life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that any human being has the right to take life away from another. It is the fundamental value on which all others are based and is the foundation of both law and medical practice. I refer to the words of the previous speaker, the member for Denison, with regard to medical practice. When doctors take the Hippocratic oath they are committed for their professional lives to saving lives and prolonging life, not snuffing it out, not euthanasing people. Legalising euthanasia attacks the very basis of our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no hesitation in supporting this bill. In closing, I will refer to a few comments from my constituents in the electorate of Lyne. Overwhelmingly, the correspondence that has come into my office from my constituents has been against the Northern Territory legislation and in favour of the legislation that we are debating here today. They say that it is a national issue and that, as the elected representatives of the federal parliament, we have a responsibility to make a decision about it and to let our community know where we stand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overwhelming majority of correspondence I have received from my electorate has been in favour of the so&hyphen;called `Andrews bill' to strike down the Northern Territory bill. This is not about states rights. It is about individual rights. We voted on an issue like this once before and the coalition also voted with the Labor Party then. This is a conscience vote, and I support the bill being proposed by the member for Menzies. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>
