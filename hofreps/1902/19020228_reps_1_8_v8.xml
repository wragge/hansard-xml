                            <para>- Last night the committee imposed a duty of 59 per cent, upon doors, under cover of a specific duty of 7s. 6d. each; but here it is proposed to impose a duty of only 20 per cent, on sashes and frames, which are substantially the same kind of articles. This Tariff will be so full of such absurd anomalies and inconsistencies that it will be the laughingstock of any one who has the moral courage to go through it. I have been informed that a duty is charged upon hickory and ash oars. It seems to me absurd to try to discourage the use of the most suitable material for the manufacture of articles such as oars. </para>

For instance, leather, iron, and wood are used in making a pair of bellows, and to prevent any doubts being entertained as to the duty chargeable upon such articles, we made them specifically dutiable.

If doors are imported ready made they will be subject to a duty of 58 per cent., and if made locally a duty of 20 per cent, will be levied upon the stock used by the manufacturer. </para>

                    <para>Mr.F. E. McLEAN (Lang).- American sugar-pine is perhaps the lightest and best wood in the world for making doors, and even when a duty was imposed upon doors in New South Wales, what is called door stock was admitted free of duty from America. I understand that there is a great difficulty in obtaining timber suitable for the manufacture of doors from America unless it is cut into shape, and that door stock can be imported at lower prices than the rough timber. We found in New South Wales that it was impracticable to manufacture doors without importing door stock, unless doors were made of local timbers which are not very well adapted for the purpose. The representations made by the honorable member for South Australia are well worthy of consideration. </para>

                        <para>- I think that axe and other unattached tool-handles might be placed upon the free list. The committee have recognised the justice of exempting tools of trade of city industries, such as bootmaking,&amp;c., and there seems no reason why axe and other tool-handles, which are practically tools of trade, should not also be admitted free. The revenue derived from the duty upon them cannot be very large. </para>

                        <para>- Among other things which are taxed under this item are casks, and as they are largely used by winegrowers the duty of 20 per cent, will impose a heavy burden upon a great natural industry which we all hope to see largely developed. Wine-growers cannot procure within the Commonwealth timber of a character suitable for making the best quality casks, and in view of this fact, a 20 per cent, duty is extremely high. It has also been pointed out that axe-handles are subject to a duty which will fall directly upon a very large number of hard-working people in the country. Umbrella sticks are on the free list, because their' exemption from duty will benefit the manufacturers of Melbourne. No consideration is shown by the Government for the working men in the country districts, but wherever a manufacturer's interests are concerned, a duty is imposed or remitted just as may be required to further his interests. Thousands of pioneers and settlers may appeal in vain for any consideration if one manufacturer desires a duty upon axe-handles because he imports the partly prepared material and simply dresses it here. Are not the men who are employed in cutting timber manufacturers in a sense1! Who is going to determine at what stage manufacturing begins and ends ? The proposed duty upon casks will seriously affect the whole of the wine-growers of Australia. </para>

The proposed duty, therefore, must fall upon the people who are engaged in this great industry. The Treasurer estimates that a revenue of £23,000 will be derived from this item. He has clearly shown that he expects the importations under this head to be reduced by one-half, and it is therefore abundantly clear that a 20 per cent, rate is far too high for revenue purposes.

                            <para>- We are consistent, for the simple reason that the local manufacturers are practically supplying the market. The raw material is brought in free, and handles are dressed here by the hundreds of gross every year, providing a great amount of employment. I am informed by a man of great experience that if the consumer had to pay the whole of the duty it would be a matter of only 6d. a year, and I question whether it would even amount to that small sum. We contend, however, that the duty has not to be paid by the consumer because the article is manufactured here. The firm of which the acting leader of the Opposition is the head have just issued a circular, stating that since the introduction of the Tariff they have started making shirts, and that the duty of 27½ per cent, will be escaped by the consumer in consequence of the local manufacture. In connexion with axe handles the consumer escapes the duty in the same way. </para>

It is with great reluctance that I drag the affairs of my firm into these discussions ; and all I can say is that there has been no development of our business which was not started years ago. Anything done during the past twelve months has been simply owing to the large development and increase of business, and would have been done, I give my word of honour, whether or not a duty had been imposed. </para><para>

                            <para>- That depends on the nature of the work and the competency of the man. It is unreasonable to say that umbrella sticks should be free, because if the arguments of the protectionists are sound we ought to impose a duty in order to make them cheaper. Is it said that in Australia we cannot make umbrella sticks, or that there is anything more difficult in their manufacture than in the manufacture of axe handles'! The whole proposal is invidious, and I shall support the placing of axe handles on the free list. </para>

                        <para>- I can understand the Treasurer moving that umbrella sticks be put on the free list. It is admitted by those in the business that this would be a purely revenue duty, and it is not congenial to the Treasurer to have a duty which will make for revenue, and will not serve the purpose of protection in the slightest degree. Honorable members have received a circular from somebody in the trade, who tells a pitiful tale of how he has employed more than the average three men and a boy - how he has employed a great number of men - in the manufacture of umbrella and walking sticks, and has lost an enormous sum of money, principally owing to the fact that the sticks have to be imported. The wail of this manufacturer is that a duty would be only a revenue tax ; and, if that be so, we ought to adhere to it. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members on this side of the Chamber do not intend to offer any opposition to this division. I could not at first understand why a duty of 15 per cent, has been applied to the articles mentioned in item 106 and a duty of 25 per cent, to the articles mentioned in the item 107 ; but I have since been informed that the first set of articles are the raw materials of the second set. As the articles dealt with in this division are luxuries, not necessaries, while I look upon the proposed duties as high, they are not higher than the duties imposed upon similar articles in other parts of the Tariff. </para>

I ask the Treasurer if an importer can fairly estimate the cost of the clamps attached to penholders, apart from the value of the penholders themselves ? </para>

                        <para>- I also wish to point out that the Customs authorities, while exempting from duty lead pencils which are imported loose, charge 20 per cent, upon those which are imported in little cases suitable for the use of school children. As the value of these cases is very small, and the pencils are used almost wholly by school children, I think the exemption should be altered to cover the cases as well as the pencils. </para>

                            <para>- (Melbourne). - I desire to move an amendment to the effect that imitation jewellery shall be subject to a duty of 25 per cent., and jewellery of gold and silver shall be admitted at 20 per cent. It is represented to me that the cost of bringing gold and silver jewellery here is much greater than in the case of imitations, and that the high-class jewellery imported here really constitutes the raw material of the trade. Most articles of gold and silver jewellery imported are introduced as patterns, and it will assist the trade if these are admitted at the lower rate. </para>

                        <para>- The amendment suggested by the honorable member for Melbourne is the most extraordinary I have heard of. The idea of reducing the duty on high-class luxuries and imposing the full rate on articles which the poorer classes use for their adornment is certainly a very singular one. The only limit I should place on the duty on jewellery is that beyond which we cannot collect it, and to my mind there is no reason why cameos and precious stones unset should be exempted. </para>

                            <para>- Still, there is no reason why the}' should be admitted free, and certainly facilities should not be afforded for evading duty, to the extent of, perhaps, hundreds of pounds on one consignment, by simply lifting stones out of their settings and importing them separately. There is no reason for differentiating in favour of the luxurious jewels of the rich against the poor little trinkets used by the working classes. I do not know whether it is safe to fix the duty upon jewellery at 25 per cent. I am afraid it will encourage attempts at evasion ; but if the duty can be collected at that rate, it should be imposed. I understand that certain classes of metal buttons have been declared by the Customs authorities to come within the category of jewellery, on the ground that they are used for personal adornment. No doubt most buttons are used for the purposes of adornment, but there are many, such as the small brass buttons bearing the figure of an anchor, which are used largely for buttoning children's clothes. These should not be subject to a duty whilst bone or horn buttons, which may be much more valuable, are allowed to come in free of duty as necessaries. It is very difficult to draw a distinction, but I should like to see the brass buttons, such as those used for children's clothing, either exempted or admitted at a lower rate of duty. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir WILLIAM</inline>MCMILLAN (Wentworth). - There is really very little difference between buckles used for adorning hats' and other similar purposes, and ribbon, which is subject to a duty of only 15 per cent. No one could say that these buckles are pieces of jewellery, any more than is the band on a man's hat. It is purely a question whether the duty on such articles as buckles should be 15 or 25 per cent. Certainly they are unnecessary in one sense ; they are manufactured articles, and I see great difficulty from the collector's point of view in making any distinction in their favour. I should prefer to see the duty fixed on jewellery all round at 20 per cent., although I admit that with a duty of 25 per cent, on clothing and a duty of 59 per cent, on doors it may seem inconsistent to place a lower impost upon jewellery. </para>

                        <para>- Clearly upon this item the committee should endeavour to collect as much revenue as possible. The question which we have to consider is what rate will yield the largest amount and lead to the least possible fraud. Honorable members should recollect that we are now dealing with articles, the more valuable kinds of which can be packed into a very small compass. A man might very easily bring in £5,000 worth of jewellery in a carpet bag, and I fear that the imposition of an excessively high duty will conduce to fraud and evasion. In that case the tax would fall almost entirely upon the poorer classes of the community who buy the cheaper kinds of jewellery. I am glad to know that there is no question of either free-trade or protection involved in the discussion of this item. It is altogether outside the realm of one's fiscal belief. The Treasurer has already declared that he abstained from proposing the imposition of a high duty upon cameos and diamonds on account of their great value, and because the adoption of such a course would minimize the revenue receipts and encourage dishonest trading. I therefore appeal to the Government whether it is not advisable in the interests of the revenue itself to reduce the proposed rate to 15 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the honorable and learned member for Werriwa has pointed out the weak spot in connexion with the proposed duty. Every one must admit that the higher the impost the greater is the encouragement offered for fraudulent practices. On this question I take a view rather opposite to that favoured by most of the committee. Honorable members' seem to run away with the idea that because jewellery is an ornament it is necessarily a luxury ; but I am of opinion that the daughters of the people have as much right to be adorned as their luckier sisters who can afford to buy high-class jewellery. It has been pointed out that hat-pins may be tipped with precious stones, and it is contended that, because of that fact, the daughters of the people should be called upon to pay a duty of 25 per cent, on the humbler classes of pins which they use. Is it feared that, great as this Commonwealth may be, the habits of the period of Louis XV. are going to be adopted, and that our eyes may be dazzled with jewellery worn by the wives and daughters of Australians on the fashionable promenades in Melbourne, Sydney, and other capitals? I see no necessity for a duty of the kind proposed, and for the protection of the revenue as well as for other reasons, I ask the Treasurer to reconsider the position. In a short time we hope that the women of Australia will have the franchise, and if this duty be imposed, how will the Government fare when they have to meet thousands of indignant females at the ballot-box ? Ordinary hat -pins should not be regarded as luxuries. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that the amendment of the honorable member for North Sydney would allow to escape free of duty imitation jewellery, made up of other than gold, silver, and precious stones. A great deal of shoddy imitation jewellery is imported, the use of which we do not desire to encourage, but which is just as showy, whilst new, as genuine jewellery. As to the item generally, I hope the Government will adhere to a duty of 25 per cent. Let us have here and there in the Tariff some evidence of the fact that we are imposing reasonably heavy duties on the luxuries of the rich as well as extravagantly heavy duties on the necessaries of the poor. We, on this side of the chamber, have involuntarily passed duties of 40 per cent, and 50 per cent, on absolute necessaries, and I do not see why we should baulk at 25 per cent, on articles which are clearly of the character of luxuries. I cannot see that we should get less revenue from the higher duties. If dishonest dealers will smuggle when the duties are 25 per cent., they will do so when the duties are 20 or 15 per cent.; and we most look to the Customs authorities to prevent that sort of tiling. I shall not be disposed to vote for a reduction of this duty, but when we come to cameos and uncut gems it might be considered whether the former should not be made dutiable. Thousands of pounds' worth of uncut gems can be carried in one's waistcoat pocket, but cameos and works of art of a fragile character have to be packed with great care, and are by no means easily smuggled. </para>

                        <para>- In support of the amendment proposed by the honorable member for North Sydney, I would point out that in the next division, dealing with leather and rubber goods, there is a similar qualification in the special exemptions, namely " buckles, not for adornment." It has been pointed out by harness-makers that the retention of those words will mean that buckles which are plated with tin, brass, or nickel, will be charged a duty of 25 per cent., just as if they were articles of jewellery. Such a duty is, of course, absurd, and shows the danger of the retention of these words. At the same time, harness-makers point out that some such amendment as that now before the committee will meet the case. As to the general item, I should like to point out to the right honorable member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Braddon, that the real question is what ought to be the rate for the purposes of revenue. It is somewhat significant that in Victoria, where the duty was 20 per cent., the value of the jewellery imported in 1900 was only £47,000, whereas in New South Wales, where there was no duty, the importations were valued at £195,000. </para>

                            <para>- Jewellery is also manufactured in New South Wales, and the difference I have shown in the importations is enormous. The principal purchasers of jewellery are the poorer, not the richer classes, but it is not for us to penalize people because of their folly. If a lower rate would bring a larger- return, why should we not reduce the duty ? ' </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HENRY</inline>WILLIS (Robertson).This must be looked upon as a revenue producing duty. The New South Wales duty upon jewellery while it lasted was 15 per cent., and I understand that in Victoria there was a strong agitation to reduce the duty from 25 to 20 per cent., in order to obtain more revenue. I am satisfied, from conversations which I have had with jewellers, that the better class of jewellery will come in even if we make the duty as, high as 30 per cent., but the poorer classes of jewellery, and imitations of jewellery, will be kept out, and the persons who buy it will make what they have last longer, so that the revenue will suffer. If any amendment is made, it should be to reduce the rate of duty upon the poorer classes of jewellery. I do not think that the better class of jewellery should be charged less than 25 per cent. The amendment of the honorable member for Melbourne will, if it is pressed, lead to a long debate. </para>

I am informed, however, that very little made-up jewellery is imported, because it does not pay to import it since, when it is imported in a finished state, duty is charged upon the precious stones it contains, whereas unset stones are admitted free. I am advised, however, by those in the trade that a duty of 25 per cent, is too high. </para>

                            <para>- Those in the trade appear to be anxious to obtain an advantage. We may be perfectly certain that they do not want the duty reduced so that the importations may. increase, but they would naturally be glad to be able to bring in samples and other small articles at a lower rate. I went thoroughly into the whole question with the Minister for Trade and Customs, and while we came to the decision that it was hardly worth while to place a duty upon unset precious stones, we thought that a duty of 25 per cent, upon jewellery would be a reasonable rate, seeing that the rate upon the requirements of the jewellery trade is only 15 per cent. </para>

Photographs are admitted free, but dry plates, films, sensitized paper, and cameras, which are required to make photographs, are all taxed. I received this morning a letter from the South Australian Photographic Society, which contains 112 active members, and by there I am informed that the better class of cameras, which must be used to obtain the best results, are exceedingly expensive, and that a duty of 20 per cent, will restrict, if it will not prevent, their importation. Photography is used to a very large extent for illustrative work in connexion with weekly and monthly journals, and, therefore, from the artistic point of view, it would be wrong to impose a tax upon the cameras used by those who are in the trade. Cameras are used also in connexion with the telescope and microscope for scientific purposes, and with the spectrum by which we measure the distances of the stars. </para>

                            <para>- I know that a great deal of smuggling of precious stones goes on in America, and besides that we do not wish to adopt here the enormously expensive system of Custom-house supervision, adopted there. If we imposed a 5 per cent, duty the Custom-house officers would have to make the closest search for articles which it is very difficult to discover, and. the revenue derived would scarcely recompense us for the trouble and expense. I quite agree that it is desirable to impose a. duty if it can be collected, but I am satisfied that we should only encourage dishonesty. </para>

                        <para>- If we imposed a duty upon precious stones we should have to largely increase our customs staff. The total importations of precious stones into the Commonwealth would not be valued at more than £100,000 per annum, and a duty of 5 per cent, would realize only £5,000. The search for these articles would prove most irritating to travellers, and the duty derived would not repay us for our trouble. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. THOMSON</inline>(North Sydney.)- I must really ask the committee to vote against the amendment. Whilst I am thoroughly in sympathy with the intention of the honorable member for Wide Bay, I claim that it is impossible to ascertain the purposes for which lantern slides are to be used at the time they are imported. Moreover, ambulance classes do not import these slides direct. They purchase them locally. I further hold that it is a false principle to make the amount of duty chargeable upon any article dependent upon the use to which that article is to be put. </para>

                    <para>Attach a copy of the letter already written upon this subject. The amount involved is not large, and it is desired the present system may continue until the Estimates are passed. Of course if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Philp</inline> persists in his demand the money must be paid. </para>

                <para class="block">It is my intention to write to Mr. Philp in the sense of the letter forwarded to me from the department of Home Affairs, and to represent the inconvenience that will result if the system suggested by him be adopted. At the same time honorable members will be with me when I say that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Philp</inline> persists in his demand, which I consider an extraordinary one, cash will, of course, be paid, however much such a course may upset the arrangement in progress at the time the demand was mode, I can only add that I am very sorry to have to say that the treatment we have received in this matter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Philp</inline> is neither surprising nor unusual. </para>
