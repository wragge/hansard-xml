There is no doubt that the suspension of the consideration of private members&#39; business became an inevitable necessity, owing to the amount of public business to be considered. At the same time the Government would impress upon honorable members that if their desire is to conclude the session, some selection should be attempted of the more important matters to be discussed. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to disabuse the mind of the honorable member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Braddon, that I have any personal motive in taking this course. I do not intend to say anything regarding the petition against the return of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hartnoll.</inline> I expressed my opinion privately to the honorable member as well as others as to what ought to have been done in that matter. We have constituted an Elections and Qualifications Committee, and we should have that body respected as far as it is possible to have it respected. While it is quite possible that the honorable member may deal with the petition in a fair way from his own standpoint, and probably his decision would be just as fair as that of any other person, there is another aspect to be considered. The general public throughout the Commonwealth do not know the honorable member as we do, and they will recall his statement concerning one of the parties to the dispute, and will wish to know, why after that extraordinary statement, he was allowed to sit on the committee. I thought that he would take the first opportunity of resigning his seat on the committee. I clearly recognise that so long as we have party Government, and an Elections and Qualifications Committee for the trial of disputed&#39; returns, we must have, to a certain extent, all parties represented thereon . But it would be just as well that the members of the committee should not be Strong partisans. I am credibly informed that the statement of the honorable member concerning <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitelaw</inline> was one of the principal reasons why that gentleman lost the election. Of course the honorable member denies having made the statement in the form in which it was generally published, but even the qualification that he made I certainly think was not a good one, and it will not relieve him of that imputation of partisanship which in my opinion disqualifies him to sit on the committee. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member denies that he put it in that way. Originally <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitelaw</inline> was accused of being a pro-Boer by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hartnoll,</inline> who used the statement for all it was worth. The honorable member goes on the same platform with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hartnoll,</inline> and states that he would sooner see a pro-Boer hanged than returned to Parliament. What did it mean? If he had not the same meaning as had <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hartnoll</inline> in using the phrase, then why did he use it at all? It was certainly used, according to his own showing - I admit that he put it in this way : If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitelaw</inline> was a pro-Boer,&#38;c. But it had been already established, or was supposed to have been established by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hartnoll</inline> thathe was a pro-Boer. Under such circumstances I think when the question was put to him a few days ago, the honorable member should have retired from the committee out of respect to his fellow members. I had hoped that after the statement he had made - in fact, I was led to believe so - the right honorable gentleman would resign from the committee, and I was utterly astounded to find that he had taken his seat - not merely as an ordinary member, but as chairman. I do not wish the honorable member to understand that I have taken this course out of any ill-feeling towards himself. I am merely acting in the interests of the Elections and Qualifications Committee, which I think should be held above any suspicion. I do not approve of a committee as a tribunal for settling these disputes. I think that they should be  Court,  we have not the necessary legal machinery to deal with election petitions in that way, we are obliged to have recourse to a committee of the House, and under such circumstances it should be kept as far above suspicion as it is possible for us to keep it. </para>

                    <para>- I am greatly obliged to the honorable member for Kennedy for his kindly expression of confidence in, and good feeling towards, me. At the same time, gratifying as that may be, it is not quite sufficient to make me abandon the position I have taken up, merely because he thinks it is the course I should adopt. As to the matters concerning the petitioning candidate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitelaw,</inline> there has been a very . considerable amount of misrepresentation, not on the part of the honorable member, but certainly on the part of the press - at airy rate the press as represented by one journal here, which is agreeably characterized by occasional lapses into veracity. It is not in any of those occasional lapses that the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> has dealt with this matter. </para>

That is a beautiful figment - there is not a particle of truth in it. At our first meeting, months ago, I was appointed chairman on the nomination of the honorable and learned member for Bendigo, and therefore when the committee sat, there was only one place for me, and that was the chairmanship, which I took. </para>

                    <para>- It is really a coincidence that on that occasion a majority were free-traders. But it is not true that because_there was a majority of free-traders present, I was elected chairman of the committee. There was no question of the election of the chairman on that day. Then I find this recorder of public events saying that I, during the election campaign, interested myself in the contest, and made speeches against the petitioning candidate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitelaw.</inline> I made two speeches during the contest. In one of them I did not mention <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitelaw,</inline> and in the other I spoke of him in regard to the one question of free-trade - and spoke of him more favorably than of any other candidate, except <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hartnoll,</inline> inasmuch as I was able to say that not very long ago, while he was a supporter of mine in my candidature for a seat in the House, he was a free-trader, and, therefore, if he were elected on this occasion, I might hope to see him, with a swing of the pendulum, come &#34;back to free-trade again. </para>

                        <para>- That was not greatly against the candidate. Speaking to a free-trade audience I practically recommended him as the candidate who should be second in their choice, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hartnoll</inline> as a straight out free-trader being the first. As to this matter of the pro-Boer business, I have never charged <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitelaw</inline> with being a pro-Boer. There was some talk of it at the meeting in Hobart I attended, and there was a little disturbance in the hall as a consequence of it, and when I followed I said distinctly I had nothing to say about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitelaw</inline> being a pro-Boer. I could not speak as to that, and I was justified in that attitude, inasmuch as I had heard him deny an accusation brought against him at Waratah that he was a pro-Boer who had expressed the hope that our British troops would be defeated in South Africa. </para>

The Elections and Qualifications Committee has not to consider the opinions held by the sitting member, but to consider, for subsequent report to the House, the rights in regard to the petition which has been lodged against his return. I am so perfectly satisfied in my own mind that I shall enter into this inquiry with the full intention to see justice done, whatever result may follow, that I shall not dream of practically confessing weakness of judgment or dishonesty of purpose by offering to resign from the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- That does not matter. The candidate whom the right honorable gentleman was supporting had devoted a portion of his address to inflaming the audience, or to trying to persuade them by statements of pro-Boerism on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitelaw,</inline> and the right honorable gentleman immediately proceeded to apply the inference put forward by the candidate, namely, that pro-Boers ought to be hanged rather than to be returned to Parliament. When the right honorable gentleman disclaims any intention to refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitelaw,</inline> he reminds me of a statement made in, I think, one of Lever&#39;s books, that a certain priest told the electors at election time to be sure not to put a certain man&#39;s head under the pump. The right honorable gentleman disclaims any idea of referring to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitelaw,</inline> and yet he was the only person spoken of, and was the only candidate who was thought to have a chance against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hartnoll.</inline> The application of the remark was made plain to every one in the hall, and in consequence of it a certain amount of disturbance took place. </para>

                        <para>- I agree that we should adopt the earliest opportunity of  the adjudication of these matters to an independent tribunal altogether apart from politics. I have advocated that course in the State Parliament of New South Wales, and I think it should be adopted here at the earliest possible opportunity. In the meantime we have justification in what has occurred in the State Parliament of New South Wales for the attitude we are now assuming. I remember a case in which <inline font-style="italic">n</inline> candidate, whose case was to come before the Elections and Qualifications Committee, had been defended in the police court by a partner of an honorable member who was on the Elections and Qualifications Committee; and that honorable member retired in consequence. In this instance the right honorable member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Braddon, took an active part in the campaign. He was there personally urging the people - and I do not object to his taking part in the campaign - to do their best for one particular candidate, and to my mind the persistence of the right honorable gentleman in sitting in judgment in this case is one of the most indecent incidents that has occurred in politics for some time past. Of course, we are all affected to some extent by party bias, but where an honorable member has taken an active part in a campaign he must be more susceptible to party prejudices than are those who have looked upon the contest from afar, and who can   without any personal knowledge of one or other of the candidates. That is the closest approach we can make to a satisfactory tribunal in Parliament, and I trust that even at this late stage the right honorable gentleman will see the wisdom and the decency of retiring from the committee. I have nothing to say about the position taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitelaw.</inline> I express no opinion upon that. I have no doubt that the members of the committee can be trusted to -judge that from the evidence - before them and upon the equities of the case. But, apart from what the decision is likely to be, it appears to me that the committee can never have the respect from the outside public that it should command and receive while it is tainted to a certain extent by the presence upon it of an active partisan such as the right honorable gentleman proved himself to be when . the election took place in Tasmania. </para>

                    <para>- I should not have spoken on this matter, which I look upon as a storm in a tea-cup, but for the fact that the honorable, member for Bland has referred to the action of the right honorable member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Braddon, as indecent, and as causing the Elections and Qualifications Committee to lie looked upon as tainted. I think that the honorable member for Bland, who is generally very sober and logical, in his remarks, has allowed his feelings in this matter to carry him too far. I have not heard anything advanced to justify the position he has taken up.

We have decided that all petitions against the return of honorable members shall be referred to a committee composed of honorable members of this House, and we cannot divest these honorable members of their political convictions. Nothing has occurred to justify the attack made upon the right honorable gentleman, who may very well be regarded as the Nestor of this House, and whose life-long story has been one of honour and integrity, and I think that the taint and the disgrace, if any, rests upon those who have brought this matter forward rather than upon the object of their attack. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitelaw</inline> was not the person referred to, it is due to that gentleman and his supporters that the right honorable member should state who was referred to. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitelaw</inline> has petitioned against the return of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hartnoll</inline> - as he has a right to do under our law - and we do not expect the members of the Elections and Qualifications Committee to exhibit bias before the case is heard, any more than we expect a Supreme Court Judge to express an adverse opinion from the bench in regard to any accused person before he is tried. I do not know what would be said of our Supreme Court Judges if they practically hanged accused persons before trying them. For the sake of placing the committee above suspicion it would be wise on the part of the right honorable member to withdraw from that body during the hearing of the petition. Without ever doubting that justice would be meted out by him, we want the outside public to believe that justice is being done, and, above all, we wish the partisans in this dispute to be satisfied with the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the committee. </para>

                <para class="block">It occupies the same position in regard to this House that the Supreme Court occupies in regard to other Assemblies in the case of a disputed election. That being so, it is almost imperative, not merely that the chairman of the committee, but also that every member of it, should be above suspicion. What would we think of a Judge of the Supreme Court who had acted as counsel for one of the parties to a suit prior to his appointment, and who, upon his elevation to the Bench, undertook to try another development of that particular issue ? I ask the legal members of the House what would be their opinion of such conduct 7 </para>

                <para>Mir. MAHON. - I believe that a Judge in any British community would refuse to sit. I think that the right honorable member - for&#39; whom I am sure we all have the deepest respect, and for whom personally I have the greatest esteem - would be consulting his own dignity if he reconsidered his position in regard to this matter. The fact remains that the right honorable member went to Tasmania and took part in the recent election. Of course, some men may be able to divest themselves of all human  in matters of this kind, but certainly the ordinary man could not for a moment be said to be above feeling in such circumstances. However, the point which I wish to urge is that, as this committee performs practically judicial functions, judicial methods should, as far as possible, be followed. The right honorable member having taken part in this election - as many a Judge in his practice at the Bar has taken part in cases which subsequently come before him on the bench - would be consulting, not only the welfare of parliamentary institutions and the high character of this Parliament, but his own dignity, if he at once reconsidered the position which he has taken up. </para>

The right honorable member admits having said that he would rather see a pro-Boer hanged than elected to this Parliament. But he might hold that opinion and yet be perfectly fair to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitelaw,</inline> for the reason that the latter, according to the honorable member for Bland and the honorable member for Maranoa, is not a pro-Boer. Further, the right honorable member for Tasmania, when speaking, declared that he did not know. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitelaw</inline> was a pro-Boer. Consequently he never stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitelaw</inline> should be hanged as a pro-Boer. </para>

                        <para>- It is of no use the Minister for Trade and Customs trying to misconstrue matters. No doubt, in his&#39; profession he has acquired the capacity for twisting words, but it is useless for him to attempt to exercise that capacity upon this occasion. It is abundantly clear that the right honorable member for Tasmania never accused <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitelaw</inline> of being a pro-Boer, and therefore never said that he should be excluded from Parliament because he was one. But, altogether apart from this aspect of the question, I wish to point out that the Elections and Qualifications Committee, as long as it is a committee of this House, will always have members upon it to whom objection might be taken. I remember that in the New South Wales Parliament, to which allusion has been&#39; made, members of the fighting committee of different parties, who had eagerly used every piece of machinery they could in order to win success, were invariably upon the Elections and Qualifications Committee. From my experience I can say tha.t these men have almost universally - at any rate so universally that we need not allude to any exceptions - risen above party bias, and given fair decisions &#39;in the cases which have come before them. Of course, very proper objection may be taken to a committee of this description, but so long as we have such a committee so long will there exist a danger of party bias creeping in. Certainly we can alter the system, though I doubt very much whether honorable members would be satisfied if we adopted the Supreme Court system, because the expense which they might then have to face in case of a disputed election would confer an advantage upon those who have the longest purses. In Great Britain it very frequently costs &#163;5,000 to dispute an election. I am quite certain that the right honorable member for Tasmania - so far as his own feelings are concerned - would prefer not to act upon this committee. But if he resigns his seat when challenged and when attacked - and he was attacked when this question was first raised- </para>

                        <para>- It was the honorable member for Bland who did so. If the right honorable member were to resign his seat after having been challenged and attacked, he would be admitting that he alone upon that committee could not be trusted to give a fair and honest opinion. For these reasons I think that he is justified in adhering to the position in which Parliament has placed him. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HIGGINS</inline>(Northern Melbourne).I congratulate the honorable member for Kennedy upon the moderate and courteous manner in which he brought forward this motion. I understand that the right  for Tasmania has intimated his intention to continue to act as a member of the committee, and in view of that fact I do not think that this House can go any further. I understand that he says he did not refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. &#34;Whitelaw</inline> when he made the remark that he &#34; would just as soon see pro-Boers hanged as elected to the Federal Parliament.&#34; His disclaimer reminds me very much of a passage in one of Captain Marryat&#39;s novels - I think it was <inline font-style="italic">Percival Keene</inline> - where a child who is reproved by his grandmother and put into a corner with the cat, is heard to say - &#34; There is one of us three, pussy, whom I should like to see hanged. It isn&#39;t you, pussy, and it isn&#39;t me &#34; - but he made no reference whatever to the grandmother. I understand that the expression complained of was used as the Scotch say &#34; in the abstract &#34; - that it contained no particular reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. &#34;Whitelaw,</inline> and that there was no intention whatever to injure him in the minds of the electors. However, I understand that the position taken up by the honorable member for Kennedy is not in any way intended as an attack on the right honorable member. The honorable member for Kennedy spoke most kindly and courteously of the right honorable member&#39;s fairness and capacity, but, at the same time, he lays down a principle which a number of us would like to adopt, namely, that we must not only be just, but seem to be just. There is some expression to the effect that it is more important in some aspects that justice should be deemed to be pure, than that it should actually be pure. I do not go so far as that, though I remember that when Caesar&#39;s wife was charged with participating in some orgies, and she asserted her innocence, she was nevertheless put away by her husband, who held that &#34;Caesar&#39;s wife should be above suspicion.&#34; In public matters there is nothing more important than that one who has taken an active part on the platform in favour of a particular candidate should not be called upon to decide between the right of that candidate and another to the seat. Personally, I have no doubt that the right honorable member would act with absolute fairness ; and it is left to his own good taste to say whether he will continue to occupy his seat on the committee. </para>

In the recent Tasmanian election there were four candidates ; three others besides the gentleman whom the right honorable member supported on the hustings. Two of these three candidates were not pro-Boers but acknowledged to be  loyalists ; why then does the right honorable member not admit that he meant <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitelaw?</inline> The audience to whom the remarks were addressed knew that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitelaw</inline> was meant, and cheered to the echo. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitelaw</inline> is not a pro-Boer. Unlike many others, who call themselves loyalists, he volunteered to serve the Empire ; and it was only his age which caused him to be rejected. And not only did he volunteer himself, but he was willing to sacrifice his son for the Empire. There is not much pro-Boerism about an action of that sort. How many of those who, from one end of Tasmania to the other, are crying out &#34; Save the Empire &#34; have volunteered, much less offered to let their sons go to South Africa? To clinch the argument, I have here a telegram from Captain Morsby to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitelaw</inline> as follows : - </para>

No one can say that this is a personal matter ; although, apparently, there has been some attempt to turn the drift of the debate in that direction. In laying the foundation of the methods of carrying on the affairs of the Commonwealth, we cannot be too careful in the administration of every department which has to do with meting out justice. It surprises me that the right honorable member has not before this seen that it would have been wiser in his own interests, and from the point of view of a proper sensitiveness in regard to the honour of Parliament, to avoid any suspicion by keeping clear of this particular case. The general feeling of the House is, I venture to say, in that direction - not because of feelings of a personal nature, but because we have to consider the effect outside the House. The honorable member for North Sydney attempted to draw some very fine distinctions, but I am sure he does not believe that such distinctions were drawn by the. audience of the right honorable member in Tasmania.

If the newspapers falsely reported the right honorable member, that false report, like other matter which appears in newspapers, would no doubt have its effect on the election ;. and considering the whole circumstances, it would be far better, in the interests of the purity of administration, if the right honorable gentleman retired from the Election and Qualifications Committee. The more the right honorable gentleman persists in holding his seat, the greater responsibility he is taking on himself, particularly as he occupies the position of chairman. If it came to a decision by the casting vote, the whole responsibility would rest on the right honorable gentleman, and, although his motives and his judgment may be of  - as I have no doubt they are - his decision would open him to the charge of bias. That is not a proper position for the right honorable gentleman to be placed in, and the circumstances all indicate the great necessity for a high sense of honour on the part of every honorable member who happens to be appointed to this committee. I am sorry, for the credit of Parliament, and for. the credit of the right honorable member, that he has persisted in a course which seems to be somewhat unwise, because, while I have every confidence in his personal judgment, suspicion may be aroused amongst those who know less of the right honorable member than do his colleagues in this House. This is the only method we can take of expressing our opinion ; and it would be far better for the right honorable gentleman to resign and allow some one to  who had less to do with the election in question. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDONALD</inline>(Kennedy), <inline font-style="italic">in reply. -</inline> I do not desire to delay the House longer. I regret very much that the right honorable member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Braddon, should still persist in his determination to sit on the Elections and Qualifications Committee. I had hoped that when the matter was first pointed out to the right honorable gent len ian, he would have taken that opportunity of retiring from the committee. I spoke to the right honorable member, who, however, said he would justify his position. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; I told the right honorable member what I intended doing, and I thought that would be a quiet way of providing him with an excuse for retiring ; but the right honorable member has thought fit to take another course, which, for the honour of the committee and the honour of the right honorable gentleman himself, I deeply regret. The honorable member for North Sydney says that under the circumstances, if the right honorable member resigned it would be practically admitting that he alone was unable to give an unbiassed opinion. It would be nothing of the kind. In the first place, the right honorable gentleman is under no compulsion to sit on the committee, and he need not do so ; and in the next place, even supposing it were necessary for him to resign, he would be doing himself and this House honour in following that course. It would be a sign neither of weakness nor cowardice for the right honorable gentleman, or any person, to admit that, owing to certain facts, it was not his intention to take part in the proceedings of any such committee or tribunal. We prevent even the newspapers from commenting upon a case when it goes to a jury, and in this case I think it would be only fair for the right honorable member and to the House that he should retire from this committee. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to ask the Prime Minister a question with regard to the procedure upon a message. Objection was several times taken when a message came down from His Excellency the Governor-General to going into committee at once and passing resolutions authorizing expenditure referred to in the message. Several honorable members took exception to that as being the wrong procedure, because it was really authorizing that the amount asked for should be paid before a discussion could take place as to the expediency of making the particular grant. In the procedure upon these Estimates a different course, and what appears to me to be the proper course, has been adopted. The message has come down, and we are now proceeding to open a debate to consider whether certain resolutions should be passed. I suggest to the Prime Minister that in future, when a message comes down, it will be better not to go into committee as we have hitherto done, and at once authorize a grant of the amount asked for before there has been any discussion on the question of expediency. We are following what I believe to </para>

                            <para>- Except in extraordinary cases I quite agree with my honorable and learned friend that it is not expedient to go into the matter contained in a message immediately upon the presentation of that message. It will be noticed that we have not taken that course in regard to a message presented to-day, but have ordered its consideration for to-morrow. In this case two facts have to be observed. The first is that these are substituted Estimates, merely for the purpose of combining the additional with the original Estimates, and so to make one set of Estimates for the convenience of honorable members : and the next is that the message covering that purpose, and stating that these are in lieu of the Estimates transmitted on the 8th October, came down from His Excellency the Governor-General on the 23rd April, and was ordered on the same day by the House to be printed. So that the message was presented on that day. It is therefore now six days since the presentation of the message, and I hope that that will be satisfactory to my honorable and learned friend. </para>

                        <para>- I hope the committee will not adopt the course suggested in the motion proposed by the Prime Minister. I could understand the right honorable gentleman asking us to deal first with the Department of External Affairs, as he proposes to leave the Commonwealth in a short time. But it is hardly a fair thing to expect us to go into the Estimates for the Defence department immediately. Honorable members have recently been so much engaged in connexion with the discussion on the Tariff that they have had no time to go into this matter, and the Estimates for Defence are the most important of those submitted. It would, I think, be better to take their consideration last rather than first. I understand that a number of honorable members have been looking over the first portion of the Estimates, and have been trying to prepare themselves to deal with them. Now we find that they are to be suddenly thrown aside. </para>

Not only has there been the intervening time open to honorable members for the study of those Estimates, but I may mention that there was no objection taken at the time to the course proposed.  to be a general consensus of opinion on the part of honorable members that it would be a convenient course to adopt. I think, therefore, that my honorable friend will agree that we are doing no injustice to any member of the committee in proceeding, as we now propose to do, with the Estimates for the Department for External Affairs.

It is probable that these Estimates will take longer to discuss than any Estimates likely to be put before us in the future, and I believe that the military Estimates will take far longer than the time intervening between now and the date fixed for the Minister&#39;s departure for England. In my opinion, not a line should be passed without the fullest explanation, because an attempt is being made to reorganize the military forces in a manner opposed to the wishes of the people of the Commonwealth. I think it would be better to postpone the parliamentary Estimates only until after the Estimates of the department of External Affairs. </para>

                            <para>- I should like the  to give the committee some information as to what is proposed in  the expansion of his office, and of the Commonwealth departments generally, and   them in Melbourne. If the programme, as outlined by some Ministers a little time ago in connexion with fixing the site of the capital, is carried out, then within three years from the present time we can be established in our own building. As I understand the Ministerial programme, an inspection of sites is  made by honorable members, and during the recess an inquiry is to be made by experts on behalf of the Government.. Honorable members will have an opportunity of studying the reports of the experts, and towards the end of next session the Government will be in a position to submit a definite proposal. If a decision is come to next session, then within two or three years from that time there is nothing in my opinion, to prevent the erection of temporary buildings sufficient to accommodate Parliament until the permanent structure is erected. For with two years interest on the cost of a permanent building such as this one is, though I trust that no such waste will go  Federal Government, we can erect temporary buildings which will do for 40 years. If the Federal. Parliament will be established in its own capital within a, period of five years it points to the unwisdom of expanding the permanent offices in Melbourne and making them so large as to involve a waste of money when the staffs have to be shifted to the Federal capital. I understand that not only have nineteen rooms been added to the Commonwealth offices at the corner of Spring and Collins streets, and offices secured in , near the Princess&#39;s Theatre, but that it is in contemplation to take another building in Spring-street, near Collins-street, with the view of giving more extensive accommodation. It requires a great deal of firmness on the part of the Government in the first place to see that the departments do not expand in the way in which all Government departments do if the Ministers are at all lax. There is a perpetual tendency on the part of each officer to glorify himself: 12050 <inline font-style="italic">Supply.</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Supply.</inline> by the securing of an attendant to assist him in doing perhaps very little for the time being. In the States that tendency - though, of course, at times  manifested in the direction of doing only that which is absolutely necessary - has resulted in an absolutely over-manned service. I should hope that the Ministry would take every care to see that no officers are appointed except those who are absolutely necessary, and, in any case, so far as additions to the Commonwealth buildings are concerned, it is an unwise tiling to secure, I presume permanently, considerably larger offices, and more of them as each month goes by, when the greater number of them will have to be or should be vacated within five years at the most. I dare say that the Prime Minister will be able to tell us on what terms the offices are being obtained, so that we shall be able to see whether a reasonable economy, consistent with the proper housing of. our officers, is being practised. The people of New South Wales, as being interested in the early selection of the capital, will follow his statement with some interest. </para>

                        <para>- I quite agree with the honorable member for Bland, when he urges the necessity for great care in the public service. I suppose every honorable member has been importuned lately with appeals that appointments should be made and the service extended. It will strengthen our hands if the Government insist upon keeping the public service within as reasonable bounds as possible. Every honorable member is anxious to have an efficient service, but it does not tend to efficiency to have engaged a number of men who are in one another&#39;s way, as is frequently the case in State departments. Only those who are required should be engaged ; their work should be prescribed, and the payment should be adequate to the services. In regard to the extension of the offices, I am not so sanguine as is the honorable member for Bland, regarding the selection of the federal capital. I am not going to utter any word that would look like an attempt to do anything contrary to an honorable agreement, but I think there is quite as big an opportunity for extravagance and mistakes in the suggestion of my honorable friend, as there would be in the other direction. It seems to me perfectly remarkable to talk about putting the Federal Parliament in something which is little better than a wilderness, so far as I know from descriptions. I hope that no money will be wasted on temporary buildings. </para>

                            <para>- I have no doubt that they will. Surely it will be better to have permanent buildings, properly erected and equipped, than to spend a great sum on temporary premises. In regard to the engagement of the offices, there is a great deal in the contention of the honorable member. It would be interesting to know whether the extra offices are being obtained on lease, and if so the terms, because owners have a habit of bleeding a Government if they can. I shall be grateful if the Prime Minister will tell us what is being done in that connexion. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that the Government have taken over the administration of New Guinea, and are dealing with its affairs in the same way as did the Queensland Government. Is it intended to allow recruiting to go on in New Guinea in connexion with the pearl-shelling industry? If the pearl-shellers are allowed to recruit the natives of New Guinea to work in the pearl-shelling industry, how can we reasonably object to their employment in the sugar industry ? On some of the adjacent islands where gold is being found the natives are being used to do nearly all the surface work. I refer more especially to Woodlark Island. It is only a matter of time when these men will be working underneath. If when our jurisdiction extends over the islands these mine-owners are allowed to recruit the natives and employ them in the mines, how can we object to the mine-owners on the mainland claiming that privilege <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> The natives should not be taken away from their islands. If they are allowed to work at all, it should be on the islands of which they are natives. The administration should be such as not to allow the natives to be taken and recruited for employment elsewhere. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to call the attention of the committee, in no parsimonious spirit, -to the fact that the administrative staff of the department of External Affairs comprises fifteen officers. That is a very large staff to have at the inception of a new department. The Treasury, which has to deal with the finances of the Commonwealth as well as the finances of the States, is run by a staff of thirteen officers, but the new department of External Affairs is started with an administrative staff of fifteen officers. This department appears to have expanded beyond all reason. No one ever contemplated that a staff of fifteen would be required. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports expressed the hope that Parliament would not be required to meet in temporary buildings at the federal capital site, but I hope that the site of the federal capital will be chosen within twelve months from now, _ and that Parliament will be housed in temporary buildings. If we wait until a federal city is erected we shall doubtless meet the wishes of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports and others who desire that the sittings of Parliament may be held in Melbourne for many years to come, but we should not continue any longer than is absolutely necessary to pay heavy rentals for office accommodation in Melbourne. </para>

                        <para>- I hope some explanation will be forthcoming from the Prime Minister with regard to the announcement in this morning&#39;s newspapers that the office accommodation for Common wealth purposes is to be largely increased. The federal offices are &#34; swelling visibly,&#34; a newspaper states, but I am not aware that the federal staff has been so largely increased of late as to involve the renting of additional chambers. In view of the fact that any arrangements made must be of a tentative character, and that sooner or later - the sooner the better in the opinion of some honorable members - the federal capital will have to be erected, economy should be exercised in the matter of buildings, office accommodation, and of everything else concerning the public service. </para>

                        <para>- No one will complain of the demand of the right honorable gentleman for economy, and I do not think that if matters are viewed in their proper proportions, the Government will be charged with extravagance. &#39;In the first place, we have  declined to acquire the freehold of buildings for public offices. Knowing that whatever views we may have as to the duration of our stay in Melbourne, it is, according to the Constitution, to be only temporary, we have taken no steps which do not provide for a merely temporary occupation ; and there is no case in which we have purchased the freehold of a building. We might in one case perhaps have made more economical arrangements by purchasing a freehold. We might have housed all, or nearly all, the Commonwealth officers - up to present requirements - in one building, if we had gone to the expense of purchasing the freehold, but we knew that, while some people here might approve of our doing so, the majority of honorable members would discountenance any such proceeding. Therefore, gauging the temper and tone of honorable members, as Ministers are bound to do, we thought that an arrangement of that kind ought . not to be entered into, because the mere semblance of it would look like a breach of faith, in view of the provision in the Constitution that our stay in Melbourne shall be temporary. </para>

                            <para>- I beg the honorable member&#39;s pardon ; we are talking about all the departments, because the discuss son has covered them all. More than that, I feel impelled to say something for the Minister for Home Affairs, because he cannot be here to defend himself. The staff under the Electoral and Franchise Bills will require accommodation. With regard to the Public Service Bill, that is now all but passed, accommodation must be provided for the commissioner, the inspectors, and the other officers to be appointed under that Bill, and the department cannot get on without a clerical staff. In addition to that the General Officer commanding the Defence Forces has been housed at Victoria Barracks with his staff, and the Minister for Defence is now deprived of the use of the offices he formerly occupied there; consequently he has to be provided for, and his requirements are not half met by the room he has in the existing buildings. The building at the corner of Spring and Collins streets is occupied&#39; under a three years&#39; tenure, with the option of renewal. This is an arrangement which I think will not conflict with any honorable member&#39;s ideas with regard to the federal capital. An additional building, if not leased, is to be leased, adjoining the fifteen extra rooms which are being erected by the State Government at a cost of &#163;2,500, upon which the Commonwealth Government will be charged a fair rate of interest. The office expansion has not arisen from the inflated views of the Commonwealth Ministers, but from the actual requirements of the Commonwealth staffs, and has been in fact imperative. I am not making any speculative arrangements with regard to Bills that we may not pass. We were told by the honorable member for Coolgardie that the offices at the corner of Collins and Spring streets were expensive, but when, as I have stated, the premises were acquired at a cost of &#163;1.2,500, upon which we pay the interest charge, I am sure that no honorable member will say that that is an expensive building to occupy. Arrangements are not yet completed with the State Government as to the rate of interest to be charged upon the capital, but it will not exceed 6 per cent., including repairs, and it may be less. It is upon that matter that we are now negotiating. </para>

                            <para>- No; they are asking for such a rate of interest as would include repairs, without leaving them any profit, and the question is whether the rate asked does leave a profit or not. I do not think they are making the slightest predatory attempt upon this Government ; their conduct with regard to this building shows that they are not disposed to do so. There is a building leased in Macquarie-street, Sydney, at &#163;500 per annum for seven years, with a condition under which the New South Wales Government agrees to take over the building at any time after three years, if we should require it no further. If honorable members know the building in question, they will agree that the Commonwealth have made a pretty good bargain. Provision is made there for the offices of the Minister for External Affairs, the Minister for Home Affairs, and the Vice-President of the Executive Council. The Postmaster-General occupies a building upon a lease of a very brief tenure- I forget the precise time - at a rental of &#163;110 per year. The Treasurer has not settled with the State Government what he is to pay for the quarters which he occupies in the Treasury-buildings, but I am told that he has been asked &#163;250 a year, and does not want to pay so much. The Auditor-General, I am informed, is located in a building for which the Government pay &#163;170 annually. Roughly speaking, the rental of these buildings aggregates </para>

I ask the committee whether it is quite within reason to complain of the occupancy of buildings at a capitalized value of &#163;42,000 annually, in order to meet the requirements of all the six States of the Commonwealth, when many of those who sit in this Chamber have been calm parties to the expenditure of millions sterling upon State public buildings. I think that I have answered the charge which has been made, and answered it pretty effectually. The right honorable member for Tasmania and the honorable member for Dalley have asked questions concerning the inordinate number of officers engaged in the department of External Affairs. I have compared that number with the number of officers engaged in the Treasurer&#39;s department But in connexion with the Treasury, honorable members have apparently forgotten that, in addition to the thirteen officers engaged in Melbourne, there are three officers employed in each of the other States, thus bringing the total number up to 31. The administrative portion of the staff of the department of External Affairs is put down at sixteen, including the housekeeper. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member will give me the opportunity of so doing, I shall be only too happy to show him through the department and to let him see its work. He will then understand that most of the officers are generally engaged overtime, for which they get no allowance whatever beyond tea-money. It is a most frequent thing for officers in my department to work overtime, just as it often devolves upon me to work upon Saturdays and Sundays. Honorable members who are anxious about Factories Acts might well insist that I should not employ clerks in the department of External Affairs for such long hours as I frequently do. I am obliged to do so, however, because I find that such a reign of terror is established by reason of some press criticism that even reasonable expenditure is denounced as extravagant. However, I intend to make provision for the expansion of this department, and to lay it before Parliament as occasion requires, and I shall not be deterred from so doing by any criticism whatever. I can assure the committee that the department of which I am the head is absolutely undermanned, and within the next few months perhaps it will be necessary to make provision for extra assistance. The fact seems to be overlooked that this department deals, not only with the work of the Governor-General, not only with all the communications which pass between the Commonwealth and every one of the six States, but also with such external affairs as can be conducted by the Commonwealth itself, including its relations to the Pacific Islands, which involve a daily and increasing correspondence. </para>

It must also be recollected that the department of External Affairs is the Prime Minister&#39;s department, and as such involves a voluminous correspondence with every one of the departments of the Commonwealth, including the huge transferred departments. All these things are provided for in the Estimates for this department. The whole of that work has been based upon the most reasonable calculation with regard to the remuneration of the officers concerned. It is absolutely a bitter falsehood to say that there is anything but economy practised in the administration of the department. In addition to that, its work has grown, and is growing. Within a few months, owing to the transfer of New Guinea, the volume of work will be considerably increased. Within a few months, too, we may also expect further movements in the direction of the transfer of other matters to the Commonwealth. If any matters stand outside the present limits of the Commonwealth, they are administered by the Department for External Affairs. This state of affairs cannot be altered, unless an Act is passed setting out that they shall be administered by some other department. I have rigidly examined every expenditure as far as the material allows me to do so, and I am convinced that reasonable and strong scrutiny is exercised by the permanent heads of this department with regard to all expenditure. It is not a fact that we do not obtain a proper return for the money expended. </para>

                            <para>- Although it is not called transferred expenditure, we may say roughly that the &#163;20,000 for the administration of New Guinea, and the .t&#39;6,000 for mail contracts, do not represent new expenditure. I feel that we must accept the Prime Minister&#39;s assurance with regard to the need for assistance which is experienced in his own department. I am sure that this House has no desire to see that department inefficiently administered.  expect the Prime Minister to have only such assistance as he needs, and not to sweat his officers. When the time comes I should like the right honorable gentleman to give the committee some information regarding the items included under &#34; contingencies &#34; which represent a  amount. I understand, however, that in the Estimates of the department are included not merely the work of the department itself, but that done by the head of the Government as Prime Minister. Thus we find &#163;1,500 provided for telegrams. Also, I note that the words &#34; temporary assistance &#34; occurs several times ; likewise, &#34; travelling expenses,&#34; &#34; incidental expenses,&#34; and &#34; living allowances.&#34; Honorable members will want to know more with regard to these expenses, allowances, telegrams, &#38;c. </para>

                            <para>- I am very glad to hear that since the House expressed its disapproval of the practice of granting these allowances, it has been discontinued. Then I find the very big item of &#163;2,000 in connexion with official printing, stationery, travelling, telegrams, and other incidental expenditure for the Governor-General. I think the committee will require an explanation as to what this extra amount represents. Under this same heading I also find &#34; incidental expenses,&#34; and &#34;temporary clerical assistance.&#34; Under the title of &#34; miscellaneous, &#34;&#163;500 is provided for the federal flag and seal competition. I should like to know if that matter has yet been decided. I understand that the proposed design of the flag and seal has been condemned. </para>

Poynton - and he knows there are reasons of urgency for the request - to postpone the discussion on individual items, until,  come before us in due course, when I undertake to afford the fullest information ? </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to delay the Estimates, but I should like to refer to the growth of the departments, and the necessary extension of the buildings in which to house the officers. I quite agree that the Prime Minister has made out a case showing that there have not been unnecessarily expensive arrangements in the latter connexion ; but there is need for great care, seeing that large sums have already been spent on public buildings in the different States. Were we, on the same scale of extravagance as that indulged in by the States, to recklessly add to our Commonwealth buildings for departments other than those which have been transferred, the cost, or the interest on the cost, must come out of the pockets of the same people who paid for the extensive establishments in the States. In order to emphasize what others have said, I also draw attention to the necessity of watching very carefully the growth of separate departments. The departments of Trade and Customs, Defence, and Post and Telegraphs were transferred from the States, and should in the long run cost rather less than previously. But we have new and purely federal departments, which ought to be established on the most economical scale possible. I am not saying that the efforts of Ministers have not been directed to that end, and we may assume that economy has been observed ; but there is a danger of these small departments, kept separate and distinct as they are, each growing of itself. The motto of Government departments is the motto of a well-known firm in these States - &#34;While T live I grow,&#34; and there is a danger of each department budding separately until it becomes a large tree of expenditure. I should like to know from the Prime Minister whether the officers in his department are all permanent, as I understand they are ? </para>

                            <para>- It is not necessary that all departments should grow as the Commonwealth grows, because there are cases in which the work of dealing with a large population is no heavier than that of dealing with a small population. The departments grow separately, officers never passing from one to the other. That does not matter so much in a department of some 300 or 400 employes, but it matters very greatly when the number is only fifteen or sixteen, and the staff has in proportion to be increased very heavily in the absence of assistance from the officers of other departments. </para>

                            <para>- Neither do I. I believe, from what the Prime Minister has said, that the work in this department is fully as much as the officers can do. I am only contending generally that it should not be a crime, at times of pressure, to transfer officers from one department to another, though I do not say that could be done at the present moment in connexion with this particular department. Officers are increased in number under pressure, and it has been the custom in the States to never return to the old standard. This has created enormous departments and caused the public services of the States to be much larger than is justified by the work. As an illustration of how departments grow, I may point to the department of Home Affairs, within which we have an electoral office, Public Service Commissioner&#39;s office, and a Public Works office. These are not transferred services from the States but have been added by the Commonwealth. </para>

The danger is that bit by bit this growth takes, place unless Ministers set their faces strongly against it. I hope the present Ministry intend to do that. It must be remembered that when it does take place it is an addition to the Public Works departments which still exist in the States, and exist possibly at the same rate of expenditure </para>

                            <para>- It has started, and is moving on. I am drawing special attention to the tendency to the establishment of separate departments which are new departments superadded to those existing in the States, and which, though small at present, may expand to an undue extent if not carefully watched. I do not say that I can charge Ministers with it, or bring evidence that it is so, but there have, been indications of a desire in some of these directions to  large Commonwealth departments. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir GEORGE</inline>TURNER (Balaclava)Treasurer). - I quite agree with the honorable member for North Sydney that we should carefully and cautiously watch the expenditure of the Commonwealth departments. Where we have new departments we must start them at first with as small a stuff as possible. But it may be found that the work of a department will increase for some considerable time, and it is hardly fair to keep men continuously working. In my own department I have asked for three extra clerks in connexion with the work upon these Estimates, but I have had to do that, because from my own experience in the office I have found that my men have been working fourteen days extra in each month, in the shape of overtime. It is not  ask me to continue to sanction that kind of thing. It must be remembered also that if men are working till ten and twelve o&#39;clock at night three nights in the week, it incapacitates them for their work in the day-time. </para>
                    <para class="block">While as anxious as any one to keep down Commonwealth expenditure, I have been forced to get this assistance in my own department, because it has been absolutely necessary. So far as public works are concerned, the practice has been to get the work done through the State departments, and we have provided a certain amount on the Estimates, I think &#163;5,000, to pay for it. I quite understand that with a new Public Works department of our own we should take work away from the State departments, which would probably still be maintained at the same strength as before. I believe that where officers are required for Commonwealth departments they should be taken from similar departments in the States. I have in that way been taking men for the Audit-office and the Treasury, so that the States may have a chance, if they wish to avail themselves of it, to reduce their expenditure. Something was said by the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne with regard to the large increase in new expenditure, and I think it is only fair to see exactly how this question of new expenditure stands. There is new expenditure caused by federation, expenditure which would not have been required had federation not been in operation, and that, I take it, is the true cost of federation. But there is other so-called new expenditure. We are carrying out work which formerly was carried out by the States out of loan money, and we can hardly call that expenditure a part of the cost of federation, because the work would have had to be done either out of loan or out of revenue by the States. This year the amount asked for by the different departments of Government, and which may be considered the real cost of federation, is &#163;228,374; that may be slightly increased by the amount of the Governor-General&#39;s establishment, but I believe that in that amount there will be some saving, so that I do not believe that more than &#163;220,000 or &#163;230,000 can be said to be really new expenditure. </para>

                        <para>- That is the real cost of federation, as will be seen from the figures supplied in a paper prepared for my right honorable colleague, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, in submitting the Tariff to the Senate, and which honorable members will no doubt have an opportunity of perusing. Then there are new works and buildings we are now providing out of the revenue to the extent of &#163;61,750, in addition to that there is a sum of .&#163;20,000 expenditure upon New Guinea, the greater portion of which was previously borne by the States. Then there is &#163;25,000 which we put down for the purchase of rifles out of the revenue, instead of paying for them out of loan. These three items, amounting to &#163;106,750, cannot be said to be a part of the cost of federation, because that expenditure would have had to be met under any circumstances. Then we have to consider the non-recurring expenditure in connexion with the celebrations of the Duke&#39;s visit and the Coronation celebrations, amounting to &#163;33,755. So that, while the total expenditure incurred since the establishment of the federation amounts to &#163;368,759, it is not fair to tell the people that that is the cost of federation, because really the cost of federation, as I have said, is something between &#163;220,000 and &#163;230,000, and it will be seen that we cannot be charged with any undue extravagance upon any of these items. </para>

                        <para>- I am very glad that the Treasurer has made this question of the real cost of federation pretty clear, because, so far as my observation has gone, there is great misapprehension amongst electors as to what the real cost of federation is. There are some items of expenditure which some of us condemn. Some of us, for instance, took exception to the duplication of Ministerial salaries. I regret that Ministers have thought fit to put the amount down amongst special appropriations, as it is a&#39; maximum, not a definite, sum of &#163;12^000. I had hoped that an opportunity would be afforded&#39; us of saying whether that &#163;12,000 should not be cut down proportionately to the &#163;400 to which each Minister is entitled as a member of the House of Representatives. When I took exception to this duplication before, it was said that I was seeking to deprive Ministers of what they were entitled to under the Constitution, and some honorable members said that the proper thing to do was to await the Estimates, and then to cut down the amount. It appears, however, that Ministers do not intend to give us that opportunity, although I hope we will have such an opportunity before the Estimates get through committee. I am glad that the Treasurer has made it clear that the cost of federation is about &#163;100,000 less than was estimated at the convention, because really some State politicians have been to a large extent deceiving the public upon the subject. </para>

We know that one estimate has been exceeded to a very large extent so far as New South Wales is concerned.

Because if that praise is indulged in too extensively it may encourage the right honorable gentleman to lash out into greater extravagances than those of which he has already been guilty. I hope that this general discussion upon all the items in this division will not be understood as precluding honorable members from subsequently taking exception to one or two items in connexion with which they believe there has been extravagance. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDONALD</inline>(Kennedy). - I am of opinion that a number of the salaries set down here are too high, and I  to move accordingly. First of all, there is a secretary to the department at &#163;800 a year, That appointment was thrashed out when the first Supply Bill was before us, and I am not going into it further. The salary of the secretary to the Prime Minister was also decided by the House at the same time. But now we find that there is a chief clerk at &#163;600 a year, and also that the chief clerk has a senior clerk at &#163;300 a year. The information supplied by the Prime Minister on the subject is practically <inline font-style="italic">nil.</inline> If honorable members enter a Parliament in any one of the States while the Estimates are being discussed, they will find the Minister in charge of the Estimates telling the committee that his department is overworked, but when a big agitation for economy is got up throughout the country, such as is being got up at the present time in the various States, Ministers appear to be able to see their way to cut down their expenditure to an enormous extent. It appears to me that we are entering upon this matter in a very extravagant way. We have a responsible secretary to the department at &#163;800, and I think the salary proposed to be paid to the chief clerk is too high, and should not be more than &#163;400. I understand that these officials have been taken from the public services of the States, and the idea appears to be that the Commonwealth should pay salaries similar to those paid in the States. It is well known, however, that in the past the States have been paying many of their public servants more than they could afford to pay. I know of one case in Queensland in which a public servant was being paid &#163;400 a year for indexing letters - work which a boy of twelve could have done. It seems to me that by paying the salary now proposed we are laying the foundation for an enormous expenditure, and we should endeavour to prevent that. I do not think that the work to be done by the chief clerk warrants us in paying him a salary of &#163;600 a year, and I therefore move - </para>

I have seen so much that is regrettable arise out of that practice that I hope that we shall not follow the bad example which has been set elsewhere. To my mind, the salary provided for the office of chief clerk is a reasonable one, and I know that it is amply justified by the circumstances under which the appointment of the present holder of the office was made. </para>

                            <para>- His allowances, with his salar3&#39;, brought his remuneration up to about what he is getting now. I knew what his career had been, and what his attainments are, and he came into the Commonwealth service upon my representation that he would continue to get as much as he was then receiving. I think I may say, without making an invidious statement, that living is much cheaper in his State than it is in Victoria. He abandoned the highest position in the public service of Tasmania to take a subordinate position in the Commonwealth service, and I do not think that we are justified in reducing his salary. In considering this matter, I ask honorable members not to be guided by personal considerations, but by the value of the services rendered. Although I have answered the question asked by the honorable member for Coolgardie, I do not base my defence of the salary upon the answer I have given, but upon the ground that it is only a fair remuneration for the office. </para>

As Principal Under Secretary - the blue ribbon of the Tasmanian public service - secretary to the Premier, and clerk to the Executive Council - he performed duties which, before the period of retrenchment, were remunerated by salaries amounting to over &#163;1,000 a year. </para>

                            <para>- I thank the honorable member for Barrier for the position which he takes up. I should have explained that the Public Service Commissioner, when appointed, will, with the assistance of the reports of his inspectors, regrade the public service, after considering the duties attaching to each office and the salary paid to its occupant. He will also consider the qualifications of the various officers for the positions which they hold, and state whether he considers there are officers in excess of the work to be done. Under these circumstances, and seeing that the financial year expires very shortly, I think that a matter like this might well be left to the Public Service Commissioner, whose powers the Government will not endeavour to unduly curb. </para>

I know, however, that not less than &#163;600 is paid to the other chief clerks in the service, while some of them receive more. I regard &#163;200 as, in any case, too large a reduction. If the committee agreed to &#39;the amendment it would practically be affirming its opinion that the office is an unnecessary one. I think that we might well adopt the suggestion of the honorable member for Barrier, and allow the Public Service Commissioner to deal with this salary. </para>

                            <para>- That does not touch the point at issue, It will be urged by honorable members that the House had decided that the post was required, that the man was qualified for the position, and that the salary voted was adequate for the work he was doing. The only alteration that will be made in the salaries voted will be by way of increase. No salary will be reduced. I take exception only to the increases on what was considered sufficient last year. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDONALD</inline>(Kennedy). - After the division which has just been taken, I am afraid it will be taken for granted by the commissioner that the office of senior clerk is necessary because the salary was voted in the Estimates. I am almost inclined not to move the omission of the item. The Prime Minister says that the officer is absolutely necessary. I should like to know what work he performs, seeing that the staff comprises a chief clerk, a senior clerk, another clerk at &#163;200, a record clerk, a correspondence clerk, and a despatch clerk. </para>

                        <para>- I can quite understand a proposal to abolish the department, and if there were no records, despatches, and correspondence, I should have a holiday. This clerk and another were at equal salaries, &#163;250 I think, under the old arrangement. The reason for the increase in this case is, not only to reward valuable services rendered, but to more definitely fix the clerk&#39;s position in the office. He is entitled by his attainments to seniority over the next clerk, and it did not seem to me to be inordinate to fix his salary at this rate, once I had satisfied myself that he was doing work proportionate to it. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but I do not give him the increase specifically for the purpose of making up for the allowance. I would not propose any of these increases unless I were assured that the work of the officers had so increased as to justify the additional amount which is being allowed to them. There is no use in going into these things at great length. All I can do is to assure honorable members that I have investigated the matters, and I do not think that this is in any sense an excessive amount. It does not amount, I think, to &#163;40 more than the officer was receiving in private employment a considerable time ago; and, after all, the question whether he should receive a little more than he got at first has depended with me on the question as to the extent to which he has justified his employment. I always make that a very strong consideration, and if I make a very small increase in one case, and a larger one in another, it is after  all the facts and services of the men. For the senior clerk of a department like this, a salary of half of that at which the chief clerk receives, is not excessive. </para>

                <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. WATSON</inline>(Bland).- My recollection of what has obtained in the public service of New South Wales is that after the chief clerk, the other clerks ranged merely according to the character of their work, but there was no singling out of one of them as a senior clerk. The statement of the Prime Minister reminds me irresistibly of the &#34; circumlocution department &#34; described by Mark Twain in connexion with the great beef contract. In that case the contractor was referred from the chief clerk to the senior clerk, and from the senior clerk to the deputy-senior clerk, and so on, until he had to go to about twenty different departments before he could secure any consideration of his claim in connexion with the beef alleged to have been supplied to the army. The reasons put forward by the Prime Minister are not sufficient to justify the payment of an increased salary to the officer who is rated as the senior clerk. The Prime Minister did not state that the work performed by the senior clerk was of such an intricate nature and entailed such responsibility as to call for the payment of a larger salary. He certainly said that this gentleman, because of his seniority, was entitled to be placed next to the chief clerk. </para>

                        <para>- What has that to do with the question <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The sole basis upon which we have to judge the worth of these officials is the class of work they have to do and the possibility of obtaining men to perform it at the salary prescribed. We need not consider the position they occupy with regard to other members of the staff. I admit that we can have only a very vague idea as to the manner in which these officers perform their work, and that it is difficult to arrive at a proper estimate of their services. Therefore, I am inclined to allow the proposals of the Government to pass until we can see how the Public Service Commissioner deals with the officers. If a proposal for the reduction of the salary were defeated the commissioner might think that the committee approved of the salary at present fixed. On the whole, therefore, it would be much better to leave a free hand to the commissioner. At the same time it does not seem to be necessary to differentiate between the position held by the&#39; senior clerk and the other clerks. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir EDWARD</inline>BRADDON (Tasmania). - The honorable member for Bland has anticipated what I intended to say. We are thoroughly incapable of judging the work of these officials and estimating the salaries which should attach to their positions. If we attempt to deal with them, we shall be tilting in the dark, and probably bring upon ourselves ulterior consequences such as have been described by the honorable member for Bland. I think, therefore, that we should accept the Government proposals, leaving upon the Ministry the responsibility of satisfying the Public Service Commissioner. </para>

It seems rather&#39; singular that &#39;in every instance where officers had living allowances, which were stopped owing to the objections raised by honorable members, an increase of salary should have been provided for. </para>

Therefore, if the honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton,</inline> thinks that the amount provided for carrying on the administrative work of the department is excessive, he should propose a reduction in the total vote. When the Public Service Commissioner has gone through the whole of the officers we shall be in a better position to know what to do, but I do not feel disposed to reduce the salary of any officer unless it is clearly shown that he is unfit for his position or that his salary is excessive. At the same time I am willing to assist other honorable members in cutting down expenditure. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. MAUGER</inline>(Melbourne Ports).When the question of allowances was discussed it was not contended that the salaries, together with the allowances paid, were excessive, but objection was taken to the principle of paying allowances. It was urged that if the salary attached to an office were not sufficient it should be increased, but that  should be done away with. We do not know that this officer is overpaid, and I am not prepared to cut down individual salaries without a full knowledge of the circumstances. If an officer is not fit for his work he should be dispensed with. We should employ only such officers as  required, and should pay them well in accordance with their value. If we proceed on the lines proposed by the honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton,</inline> we may deal very unfairly with the officer whose salary is in question. </para>
                <para>Mr.FULLER (Illawarra).- Whilst I do not desire to reduce the salaries proposed by the Government, I do not agree with the observation of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports.

                        <para>- The House expressed a very strong opinion against the practice of granting allowances to certain officers, whilst withholding them from others. Since that practice was discontinued, the salaries 12064 <inline font-style="italic">Supply.</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Supply.</inline> of all the officers who formerly received &#34;living allowances&#34; have been increased. I do nob wish to do an injury to the gentleman who discharges the duties of senior clerk in the department for External Affairs, but I protest against the course of procedure which has been adopted by the Government. I submit that after the House had declared that the practice of granting living allowances should cease, the Government had no right to increase the salaries of officers in such a way as to practically restore them to the position which they occupied when they were in receipt of the allowances. I can see no way of emphasizing my protest other than by moving to reduce this salary. </para>

On this occasion we are discussing an increased salary which has been given to an officer since the first Estimates were submitted, and it is said that that increase places the officer in question upon exactly the same footing that he occupied when he was in receipt of a living allowance. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton,</inline> can show that the officer in question is receiving a salary equal to his original remuneration, plus the allowances which he enjoyed, I am prepared to support him. At the same time I would point out that it is unfair to attack the salary of any particular officer under cover of a protest against a practice which the committee have unanimously condemned. The principal objections which honorable members had to the allowance system was that it &#34; covered up &#34; amounts which, therefore, could not be traced. If the honorable member for South Australia can show that there has been any further attempt to &#34; cover up &#34; expenditure, that is a different matter. </para>

A salary of &#163;300 annually represents only &#163;5 15s.6d. per week, and I do not understand how the officer in question can live upon less and retain his position. Where honorable members can make a determined fight is in connexion with the Estimates for the Defence department. Let us reduce some of the amounts payable to the gilded-spurred roosters. To my mind anything below the amount which is here set down would mean starvation. </para>

                            <para>- I have had some nine years&#39; experience of parliamentary life, and this is the first time 1 have known a Minister, when an honorable member has asked for particulars in regard to a department under review, say - &#34;You shall have no more information,&#34; and walk out of the Chamber. If the Prime Minister think she will get his Estimates passed by treating honorable members in that manner, he is very much mistaken. I have contended that these increases of salary have been granted in lieu of allowances, and I can show, from the previous debate on this question, that that was the Prime Minister&#39;s expressed intention. The Prime Minister on that occasion said - </para>

These sixteen members get at the rate of &#163;25 per week divided amongst them.

Glancing at the salaries which they receive, I find that five of them receive over &#163;400 and up to &#163;1,000 per  ; four receive &#163;250 and over, but less than&#163;400 ; five receive from &#163;150 up to &#163;250 ; and two only receive under &#163;100. </para>

                        <para>Now, I maintain that there is no justification for the payment of these allowances in the way they have been paid. Further than that, there is no justification for the payment of such allowances at all. I allude to this because the Prime Minister last night indicated that he would probably propose increases of salary in place of these allowances. Why should we give a larger salary in place of these allowances. Why should we give a larger salary for the work which we require to be done to certain individuals, because of their special circumstances, than we give to other individuals whose circumstances are different ? The persons accepting these situations ought to recognise that they do so in view of the opportunity to obtain permanent positions in the public service of the Commonwealth, and that during its initial stages they - as well as the  this Parliament - will have to submit to personal inconvenience, and, it may be, to certain personal expenditure. </para>

                    <para class="block">Certain men who came into the service from New South Wales were, through the generosity of the Prime Minister, given allowances, but in the same department officers from other parts of Australia received no such consideration. It is distinctly unfair that individuals should, in the first instance, be selected for allowances, and when these are stopped by the House, should be given increases of salary, while other officers are denied either allowances or increases, although these were asked for. The Prime Minister admits that officers from Tasmania and Western Australia asked for allowances, which were held over because of the discussion in the House on the question. However, the committee seem to be against me, and, in this, honorable members are assuming a peculiar position. Only a short time ago strong opposition was manifested to the course taken by the Prime Minister in this connexion, and yet now it appears I have to content myself with a protest. </para>

                        <para>- There is an item of &#163;200 for interpreters&#39; fees and other expenses under the Immigration Restriction Act, and while a certain expenditure is no doubt necessary, I desire some further information. From a return which was laid on the table a little while ago, I find that the total number of coloured aliens admitted into the Commonwealth in the first two months of this year was 442. The number who passed the education test was seven, and 379 were admitted without passing the test, while 32 were refused admission. When the Bill was before Parliament we were assured that the education test would be sufficient to practically keep aliens out of Australia, the Prime Minister assuring us that the Act would be administered as strictly as it was possible for the department to administer it. We find now, however, that the education test has evidently not been administered in the manner promised. If only seven aliens passed the education examination, all the others must have been admitted without any test, and on this point the committee are entitled to some information. Had honorable members known, when the Bill was before the House, that the result would have been as disclosed by these figures, the measure would not have passed in the form desired by the Prime Minister. It&#34; was only on the strongest assurance by the Prime Minister that the education test would be enforced to the fullest extent that the House agreed to the Bill in the form in which it was presented by the Government. I  no hesitation in saying that the House would have preferred the amendment of the honorable member for Bland - which had for its object the exclusion of all coloured Asiatics, irrespective of any education test - had there been the slightest idea that the Act would not be administered strictly. There seems to be no alternative but at some future time to amend the Act. </para>

                            <para>- There is a little information in the returns, but not sufficient to justify the admission of so large a number of aliens. Had the Act been administered in the way promised by the Prime Minister, these people could not have entered Australia. I admit that in connexion with the Japanese there was a certain amount of difficulty, owing to the position taken up by Queensland prior to entering federation. The difficulty does not, however, account for the admission of aliens on the tonnage basis. There were twelve Chinese admitted on tonnage, and 115 others, of whom 90 held permits. These aliens need not have been allowed to enter, and it is well known that some 80 or 90 permits were proved in Queensland to be forgeries which had been traded. We want an exhaustive explanation why this large number of aliens have been allowed to enter Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps it may shorten discussion if I now say a few words. The honorable member for Kennedy is under a misapprehension if he thinks that any undertaking given by this Government has been in the slightest degree broken. I provided the House with a return of aliens admitted during the first two months of this year under the Immigration Restriction Act, as compared with those admitted during the first two months of last year under the heterogeneous Acts which prevailed in the States. I do not wish to criticise the State Acts, , which were heterogeneous simply because the States were divided. The returns show that while the Government were fulfilling every honorable engagement entered into by every State before aliens came under the control of the Commonwealth, there was, nevertheless, a diminution of alien immigration by 50 per cent. The same policy has been followed, and will be followed, by the Government. Where there is a distinct indication that a State has committed itself through its Government to the return or the admission of any person who might otherwise come within the Act, I shall maintain the obligation. I did that, as honorable members know, in the case of the Japanese immigrants. </para>

I have kept all those obligations, as I think any self-respecting nation must keep them, and I would rather go out of office than not keep them. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member uses his recollection, he will remember that there were certain indications in the despatches - I do not desire to rake up the whole discussion - which showed that we were on the safe side if we did not take certain steps which we were invited to take. I said I thought that when we got the Act into working order we -should get as good results from, it without disturbing certain conditions within the Empire as we should get if we took a stand which might, and which in my opinion I thought would, delay the passage of the Bill. I may have been wrong in my opinion, but I do not think I was. Now the result has been this - that for the first two months, as compared with the first two months of the previous year, we have had a diminution of 50 per cent. I have not the returns for the last month in such a state as to be able to lay them upon the table, but they show a progressive diminution. As regards the admission of aliens, the only direction in which there seems to be any perceptible admissions of any consequence - that is as regards coloured aliens - is with respect to the Japanese. Bug there is no reason to anticipate that there is any breach on the part of the Japanese Government ici respect to the arrangements made between them and the consul for Japan which have been intimated to us. And therefore I think that within a very short time indeed the influx of alien immigration of the kind that is chiefly objected to will have practically ceased. I should have said this a little while ago, if there had not been, perhaps, a little justifiable heat on the part of my honorable friend, the member for Kennedy. I do not desire to take any account of that. I think that, after all, the honorable member has been fair to me, and I wish t&#60;&#62; be fair to him. </para>

                            <para>- Although the amount may appear rather large, I can see the desirability of passing an .amount for the Ministers to draw upon. They will, of course, be responsible if the amount voted is exceeded, and they will also be responsible for not spending the whole amount unless its expenditure is justified. We should have some explanation upon the next item of &#163;250, for temporary assistance, and also upon the item of &#163;300 for travelling expenses. Whose travelling expenses does the amount cover ? The item of &#163;200 for incidental expenses will probably not require very much explanation. The item of &#163;1,350 for printing the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth</inline><inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> seems a very large amount, considering what the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> is at the present time. </para>

There is very little in it, and its cost should be insignificant. Upon the items to which I have referred, the committee are entitled to some satisfactory explanation, and to some information which will lead not only the committee, but the Treasurer, who has not, I hope, lost all his economical tendencies, to see the necessity of reducing some of them. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Kennedy very fairly seeks for information regarding the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act, and I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether it is not possible to be a little more stringent in admitting the Austrians and Italians who are now overrunning the goldfields of West Australia. My information at present from Kalgoorlie and from nearly every other centre - of the West Australian gold-fields is that these men are gradually supplanting the Australians in the mines. None of us would be so inhumane as to object to a few foreign aliens landing and procuring employment in Australia, but when it comes to vast hordes of aliens ignorant of our language and our laws, &#34;entering into a competition with the workers on bur gold-fields, the result must eventually </para>

The situation therefore demands from the Government  which a great national danger undoubtedly calls for. If we are to vote &#163;200 for. interpreters and Customs officers at the different ports, we should see that those officers do their duty. I believe that if they had done their duty a great many of these foreigners would have been sent back to their own country. Possibly, in passing through Fremantle on his way to London, the Prime Minister will hear a little more upon this subject from numerous deputations of working men from the gold-fields, who may interview him upon the matter. In regard to the item of &#163;1,350 for printing the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette,</inline> I should like to know if that amount covers the cost up to the 30th  next. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that in laying down the lines upon which the expenditure of the Commonwealth service is to proceed we should be guided by the principle of rigid economy. There is no doubt that the people will force careful and economical administration upon both the States and the Commonwealth Legislatures, and, although I have had nothing to say in regard to the salaries which have been dealt with, knowing that they are to be reviewed by the Public Service Commissioner, it seems to me that, as the expenditure for contingencies will not be reviewed by him, we should have full and precise information before agreeing to what appears to be in several respects an unduly large expenditure. I suggest that Ministers in charge of the various departments should give full information in regard to matters like this before we are called upon to discuss them. At the present time, member after member asks for information on this point and the other, and the result is that we learn what we want to know in a piece-meal fashion. If, however, the Minister in charge of the department would run through the various items, picking out those upon which he thought the committee would require information, it would probably be found that in nine cases out of ten his explanation would be quite satisfactory, and thus a considerable amount of discussion would be saved. To my &#39; mind the amount set down for incidental expenses and temporary assistance is too large, as the department is fairly well manned. </para>

                            <para>- I shall be glad to put the committee into possession of all proper information. The sum set down to cover the expense of telegrams may appear to be a large one, but it includes the cost of all cable messages to England, Tasmania, and New Zealand Honorable members will understand that in connexion with the administration of a department like that of External Affairs, questions are constantly arising in this House and in the other requiring instant action. Sometimes if we did not communicate by cable on affairs relating to the interests of the Commonwealth, and confined ourselves to despatches, we should be forestalled by other people, and in most cases we should find that before our despatches reached home, the occasion for our  had gone by. The amount also includes any possible contributions to Reuter, on the lines which have been followed by the States, though in the&#34; case of the Commonwealth they have been cut down to a minimum. I believe that in regard to some of these items there is an anticipated saving, but I do not think it wise, in view of possible contingencies, to reduce the items. Any savings which occur can be carried to the savings account. There has not been any substantial over-estimating in connexion with any of the items ; but the exact cost of the various services cannot be foreseen, and a margin must, therefore, be allowed for contingencies. In regard to the amount set down for travelling expenses, I should explain that whenever I go to Sydney I must be accompanied by an officer of my department, to assist me in conducting the business of the department during my absence. On such occasions I am constantly at work in -Sydney with the officer who accompanies me,&#39; and his travelling expenses, including his railway fare, must be paid. The item also includes the cost of the very necessary visit of the chief clerk to Brisbane, in connexion with the Immigration Restriction Act. The incidental expenses include all subscriptions to newspapers, the preparation of a map of the South Sea islands - which has been found to be a most necessary thing - and all petty cash expenses, such as the purchase of books of reference, of which a department like that of External Affairs must have&#39;a large stock. The item for general printing I need not discuss, but the item providing for the printing of the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette</inline> includes small expenses for circulation. It is expected that there will be a saying on that item, but it can never be  foretold  to a certainty to what extent the circulation of the publication must be sometimes extended for purposes which are of importance to the Commonwealth. The living allowances which have been referred to were definitely discontinued on 1st August last. As to the removal of furniture, to which one or two honorable members have called attention, I laid down the rule very early in regard to the appointment of officers, that the cost of conveying to Melbourne furniture to the value of &#163;300 - and this applied generally to the members of the Parliamentary reporting staff, who came from all parts of the Commonwealth - would be borne by the Government, together with the cost of their passages. That rule has been acted upon, and I do not think any honorable member will consider the expenditure incurred excessive. With regard to the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act, there may be a small saving, but I am taking steps to make certain inquiries in regard to the matter, and I do not think any one considers the proposed expenditure excessive. With regard to the proposed vote for temporary assistance, one must occasionally, in a department like this, employ an extra hand or two for a few weeks. If the employment of temporary assistance is forbidden, more permanent appointments will have to be made, and that will increase expense. I have on all occasions warned temporary hands that their appointments do not entitle them to future permanent employment, because the appointment of permanent employes does not depend wholly upon merit, but must be in accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Act, and <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> pursuance of the principle that, so far as possible, new &#39;officers shall be taken from the services of the States, a principle to which I have adhered from the beginning. I do not think that there are any temporary employes in my department at the present moment, with the exception of two officers holding very minor positions. Neither of them is likely to remain in the department for more than three months longer, and the work done by them will speedily be inquired into by the Public Service Commissioner, who is to determine&#39; whether additional assistance is necessary. </para>

                            <para>- Another matter to which I wish to refer is this : We find in the return prepared by the department of External Affairs that a very large number of coloured immigrants have passed the education test and been admitted to the Commonwealth. So far as my recollection serves me, it was understood, when the Government proposal now embodied, in the Immigration Restriction Act was before us, that, if the application of the English language test was not sufficient to keep out undesirable immigrants, a knowledge of Greek or some other European language would be- insisted upon to that end, and that that would be absolutely effective in keeping out those we desire to exclude. </para>

The number is not very largie, but if a knowledge of the English language is the only thing required, some of the worst of these undesirable immigrants will be allowed to come in. I quite understand that the officials who administer the Act may not at first have fully appreciated the position which has been taken up by the Government. I draw attention to the matter to ascertain if the Government have issued instructions which will prevent the admission of people of this kind in the future. Four Chinese, two Indian women, and a Japanese were admitted into New South Wales during the two months to which the return applies, without passing any test at all. It is not stated that they were allowed in under permits issued by the State Government. </para>

                            <para>- In these cases there is no such explanation given in the return. To the two Indian women the explanation might apply, but I do not know that it in any way affects the four Chinese and Japanese, presumably males. Then we find that in the case of Victoria, of 70 Chinese 44 were exempted under the Chinese Restriction Act. I presume that they got permits which allowed their return to the State. We cannot quarrel with the action of the Government in recognising permits issued by the States. It would be interesting to know, so far as the Department for External Affairs has been able to ascertain, how many of these permits are outstanding. That useful information, if it has not been gathered, should be obtained from the State Governments. </para>

                            <para>- Forty-four Chinese who were exempted in the manner I have stated came into Victoria, but some 26 were admitted because their passages were booked prior to the 7th August, 1901. The statement that these individuals who arrived here during January and February had booked their passages prior to that date is, I think, the most palpable lie on the face of it which was ever put before a Government official. We know that the journey from any port in China to Australia, allowing for all stoppages, takes at the outside about a month. The procedure, so far as I have been able to gather from the Prime Minister&#39;s explanation, was that 26 men were brought down to Victoria, twelve to Queensland, eleven to Western Australia, and so on, by the steam-ship companies, and refused admission tentatively, and that then the steam-ship companies asked that the men be admitted on the ground that they had booked their passages before the Immigration Restriction Bill was introduced in this Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know, but the Prime Minister this evening might tell the committee how long he intends to accept this excuse. It is a palpable lie. The word of the steam-ship companies was accepted. There was no possibility - at any rate, no likelihood - of sending officers to China to investigate the truthfulness or otherwise of their statements, and as it meant to the companies, not only the saving of any penalty, but the saving of the expense of taking the men back to China, naturally they were willing to make any sort of statement with regard to the time at which passengers were booked. The idea that a Chinaman books his passage about six or seven months ahead is preposterous, and should not hold water with any reasonable man. We have a right to know how long the Government intend to continue the recognition of that sort of excuse by the steam-ship companies, because with them it is purely a matter of pounds, shillings, and pence. If they think that that excuse will be accepted they will continue to bring in people, and swear beyond the possibility of contradiction, so far as mere asseveration is concerned, that the passage was booked many months ago. In Queensland, too, a number of Chinese were admitted on the tonnage rate. I do not know whether the tonnage rate is to be another reason for admission. Apart from the question of exempt permits which have been given by State Governments, and apart from the time at which the men were supposed to have booked their passages, here is another loop-hole that the Government seem to be allowing. The State Acts were abrogated by the passage of federal legislation on the subject. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish to be misunderstood. I do not say that where the Federal Act was less effective, or less restrictive, they would not operate, but the tonnage provision in Queensland was purely a local one, and was abolished by our legislation. We made no exemption in favour of that provision, but we added the education test and the other restrictive provisions to it. If the Act is to be administered in the direction of keeping out these people there is no excuse for allowing them to come in solely on the. ground that they are admissible under the tonnage provision, and I take it that the reason why the twelve were admitted into Queensland was because the tonnage provision was availed of. With regard to those twelve, and the seven who passed the education test which was submitted to them, I do not for a moment contend that as to the number it is anything important, but I submit that if it is known that these are to be the methods by which the entrance of these people is to be judged, it will be found that the number under these headings will increase largely, because the wily Asiatic will take the earliest opportunity of qualifying himself for the education test in English, and on the other hand, the steam-ship companies will see that the tonnage provision is made the most of on every trip. I make all due allowance for the difficulty&#34; of having a uniform policy brought into existence straight away, where we have a large number of officers throughout the Commonwealth each perhaps with a different interpretation of the provisions of the Act. </para>

                    <para class="block">But we ought to know what the policy of the Government is, and how far they are attempting to carry out the understanding made with the House that the admission of all these people would be barred excepting where permits had been granted. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BARTON&#34;.-</inline> Nothing has been or is being done which in the slightest way, or to a tittle, conflicts with what the Government has stated to the House or has promised. As regards the Chinamen, some &#34; tonnage &#34; men came into Queensland before I issued my instructions, which I did at the earliest possible moment after the passing of the Act. None are coming in now. With reference to the Chinese who took their passages or otherwise changed their position before the 7th August, 1901, there are less than twenty for the whole Commonwealth who can now claim the advantage of any such arrangement. It must be remembered that many Chinese had booked their passages a long time before the Immigration Restriction Bill was introduced, and it is not necessarily to be inferred from the lateness of their coming out afterwards that there was any fraud on that account. The State Chinese Restriction Acts, however they manipulated the tonnage limit, only enabled the companies to get a certain number on board, and there was always a surplus. But the honorable member for Bland must recollect that I told him and the rest of the House that in certain identifiable cases they must have left before the 23rd December, unless they came in under a permit previously issued by the State. We have rigorously interpreted the law in that way, except that where, as I have said before, there had been permits previously issued by the States, and there was the necessary evidence of identification of returning Chinamen, we kept the promise of  State. After the exhaustion of the twenty who have been spoken of, these immigrants will have to run the test of the Immigration Restriction Act as well as the Chinese Restriction Act. </para>

                            <para>- I do not promise very much ease to the immigrants in passing either of these tests. I always said that, if one form of test were not sufficient, another would have to be resorted to. I am properly reminded of that by the honorable member for Bland. But the entire effect of imposing the tests, which have been changeable at short periods, and have amounted to seven or eight different passages in English administered from time to time at the various ports, is that, when the tests have been applied, only seven persons have got in, and I do not think that, in these circumstances, I should revert to the Polyglot Bible for the purpose of finding more tests. </para>

I find from inquiries already made about the permits issued by the States under the Chinese Restriction Acts that there are a few cases outstanding, and the same thing may be said about permits under any State Immigration Restriction Acts. The fact is that the whole thing is dwindling away to nothing. </para>

                            <para>- That may be; it is a matter of opinion. I wish to point out that these interpreters are mostly of the same nationality as the immigrants and make their paths easy for them. Four hundred and twenty Italians and 27 Austrians have been admitted into Western Australia since the Immigration Restriction Act became law, and all this labour is being poured into a comparatively small community of 200,000, people. </para>

                            <para>- That is difficult to prove, but it is an extraordinary thing that these men, although they do not know a word of our language, can go to Cue, Coolgardie, or Kalgoorlie and obtain work at once. I think that the Prime Minister will be forced to modify his view of the manner in which the law should be administered. If in any country it were found that vast bodies of strangers were flocking in and threatening the predominance of the people who had done the pioneering work, steps would soon be taken to stop them ; and if the people of Australia think that certain immigrants coming in large numbers are undesirable, the power of exclusion under the present Act should be exercised. </para>

                        <para>- I quite sympathize with the position taken up by the honorable member for Coolgardie. The question of alien immigration presents a problem which will soon have to be faced. President Roose veldt pointed out to Congress recently, that 90,000 Russian peasants of the poorest class were poured into the United States in the year 1900, and in view of the danger of a similar influx here we shall have to very seriously consider the necessity of passing more restrictive legislation. I am sure that my honorable friend was wrong in supposing that the present Act was intended to apply to immigrants such as he has referred to. </para>

I rose for the purpose of directing the attention of the Treasurer to the fact that on the8th October last his estimate for salaries and contingencies for the Department of External Affairs was &#163;9,321, and that the amount now asked for, after omitting &#163;200 for expenses in connexion with the Immigration Restriction Act, &#163;20,000 for the administration of New Guinea, and &#163;4,534 for the South Sea Islands mail services, is &#163;12,312, or about &#163;3,000 more than the estimate. If the whole of the miscellaneous division, representing &#163;895, is also omitted, there is still an amount of &#163;2,000 in excess of the estimate. </para>

                        <para>- I hardly think that the present is an occasion on which the question of Italian immigration into Western Australia can be fully discussed ; but, as it has been referred to, I should like to say that it is developing very serious proportions in. Western Australia. The newspapers contain numerous complaints on the subject, public meetings are frequently held to protest against the arrival of these immigrants, and several petitions have been presented to the local authorities. So far. as I am aware, the protests made by the labour organizations are not based upon any objection to these immigrants because they are foreigners, but upon the belief that they are introduced into the State under labour contracts contrary to the provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act. Whilst there is every evidence of this fact, and the men readily find employment, it is very difficult to obtain legal proof that the Act is being evaded. The immigrants are prompted by their countrymen, who meet them on arrival, as to the answers which they shall give to the questions asked by the Government interpreters or other officers, and they deny that they are under contract. If, however, there is sufficient circumstantial evidence to lead to the belief that men are being brought in under contract contrary to the law, even although that fact cannot be legally proved, the Government would be justified in applying the educational test, and excluding such persons as could not pass it. Italian and Austrian immigrants are arriving in Western Australia in such large numbers that serious trouble is anticipated. The men who have already arrived will write home to their friends, and their numbers are likely to increase rather than diminish. I am sure that if the same proportion of foreigners were arriving in Great Britain, or in any other country in the world, something would be done to check their influx. There are less than 200,000 people in Western Australia, and it seems to me that if this immigration continues unchecked it might be well for the Ministry to communicate with the Imperial authorities with&#39; a view to representing to the Italian Government that whilst we do not object to the admission of Italians to the Commonwealth, we strongly protest against such large numbers of them entering one particular portion of Australia. If these immigrants were distributed over the whole of the Commonwealth their numbers would not appear formidable, but when they are practically confined to one State their presence threatens to become a very serious matter indeed. Already the Prime Minister has been good enough to promise a deputation that he will inquire into the whole matter, and I trust that the result of his investigations will be to check the evil of which we complain. </para>

                        <para>- The Joint Printing Committee have recently investigated the matter of printing, and have it under consideration at the present time. They suggested that I should move for a return, which has already been agreed to by this House. I would ask the Prime </para>

                    <para class="block">Minister to expedite the preparation of that document, as probably it may throw some light upon the cost of printing. I should certainly like it to be presented to the House as promptly as possible, because I believe that its presentation may result in some very valuable information being embodied in the report of the Joint Printing Committee - information which may remove a considerable amount of misapprehension. We have seen sensational statements in the press regarding the enormous amount of printing undertaken on behalf of the Commonwealth, but probably when the matter is investigated, it will be found that the printing bill, consequent upon federation, is not nearly so gigantic as has been represented. By the way, it came out in evidence before the committee, that the printing for the Department for External Affairs was not done by the Victorian Government Printer, but was done in Sydney. </para>

                            <para>- I presume we may accept the assurance of the Prime Minister that in these matters the Government are making the best arrangements possible. I join with others in advising the Ministry to. be very careful that the expenses, not only in connexion with printing, but other matters are kept down as much as possible, because there are enemies abroad who are only too glad to lay hold of any particular expenditure, and to exaggerate it to the prejudice of the Government, and of our federal institutions. I am very glad indeed that we have received so much valuable information from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer concerning this branch of our expenditure. It will remove a considerable amount of misapprehension, and honorable members may rest assured that there has been no extravagance in this department. </para>

                        <para>- I think that we owe a debt of gratitude to the right honorable member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Braddon, for suggesting some method whereby theCommonwealth <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> may be developed into an Australian organ for disseminating information, because the time is fast approaching when in  the Commonwealth will have to start its own newspaper. We have too many journalistic dictators in Australia at present. As soon as we reach the new federal capital the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> ought to be changed to a general Commonwealth journal, because the time is coming in Australia when we must have a newspaper on which we can rely. I agree that we ought to make the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> pay, and it would pay if it were turned into a real journal with short spicy editorials. . The editorials in the present newspapers are so long that when a man has finished reading them in the morning he is nearly dead. No doubt the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> conducted on the lines I have indicated would be successful. It ought to give the news and allow the people to judge for themselves. The Commonwealth could have its own telegraph system, and the best reporters in the world, because they would have a life job with an old-age pension attached. </para>

                        <para>- The fact of the matter is that Captain Wallington, who is private secretary to the Governor-General, is allowed &#163;150 a year by the Commonwealth for duties which are performed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Budge</inline> in Sydney for &#163;500 a year, and are performed in the other States for larger salaries than &#163;150. So far as I can gather, &#163;150 a year is a lower salary than is paid for similar work in any State. In regard to .the clerk at &#163;325 a year, the reason he receives a larger salary than the Clerk to the Executive Council is that Captain Wallington receives a salary out of the Governor-General&#39;s, purse, and this made it possible to enter into an economical arrangement with him to perform the duties for &#163;150. The work done by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lewis,</inline> who is the clerk at &#163;325 a year, is similar to that which he did in New South Wales, except that he has more to do now. That is the reason he is paid the amount mentioned, instead of &#163;290 a year, as previously. He does more work here simply .because there is considerably more to do, he having to help in the Governor-General&#39;s office apart from the Executive Council office. He does a certain amount of double duty, and it is considered only fair that an additional &#163;35 per annum should be allotted to him, especially as he had to leave his home at the express request of the Governor-General, who sets great value on his services. </para>

                            <para>- Captain Wallington. We have instituted rather a close system in regard to the Executive minutes. Every minute is signed by the Minister in duplicate, one copy being retained in the Executive Council office as a permanent record, and another going to the department as ah equally permanent record, so that there may be no mistake. That, perhaps, involves a little more labour than has previously been undertaken, except in one or two States ; but, at the same time, it is an immense advantage to have a record in the department corresponding with the record in the Executive Council office. If we did not pay &#163;150 a year to Captain Wallington we should have to pay &#163;350 a year more to somebody else for the performance of the duties. </para>

What I called attention to was the payment of &#163;150 a year to an alleged clerk to the Federal Executive Council. The Prime Minister mentioned the name of that gentleman, and I ask the committee to remember that it was not mentioned by me. Now that the name has been mentioned it can scarcely be denied that Captain Wallington is merely a figure - head in society here, which no doubt to some extent accounts for the appearance of this item on the Estimates. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish to speak with any disrespect of Captain Wallington, whom I knew when he was private secretary to Lord Carrington. If the Attorney-General means that Captain Wallington is a leader in thought - that he has ever contributed to science or education, or to the elevation of his fellow-man - he should tell us when and where that service has been rendered. When I say that Captain Wallington is a figure-head in society, I mean that he is a nice, genial gentleman of irreproachable manners, but that so far as the public life of Australia is concerned he is a nonentity. </para>

Nobody except an absolutely confidential person can be admitted to the Executive Council&#39;s meetings, which are entirely secret under the Constitution.   by the clerk involve the inspection and revision of all minutes, so that if anything appears to be out of order they may be again referred to the department from which they came. As a matter of fact, in the very very best regulated Ministries cases frequently occur in which slips in the minutes require to be rectified. All these matters have to be attended to by the Clerk of the Executive Council, besides which he has to keep an accurate minute-book with a file of the minutes. I tried to make that clear before, but I am afraid I was rather too abrupt or short in what I said. Honorable members will understand, however, that the services rendered by the Clerk to the Executive Council are very cheaply paid for. </para>

The Prime Minister is bound, of course, to defend this item, and make out as good a case as he can, but I think the committee will find that the gentleman who is the real clerk to the Executive Council, and who does the whole of the work, is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lewis,</inline> whose salary is &#163;325 a year. I move - </para>

                            <para>- His ease is singled out for special treatment. The honorable member has been told that &#163;150 is a small amount to pay for these services as compared with the amount paid in the various States to officers holding similar appointments. In Victoria the work is performed by one of the most trusted officers of the State. This officer must be a trusted officer, because every official document that goes before the Executive Council has to be perused by this gentleman before it &#39; is placed before the Governor-General or the assembled Council. There is no doubt that this officer has to advise to a very large extent the representative of the Crown of the contents of many documents which go before the Executive Council for its consideration. </para>

The honorable member must know that every Minister is advised by his officers, and the Governor-General must be in the same position. The King himself is advised, I presume, by his Prime Minister and Cabinet, and does not consider it derogatory to his dignity to be so advised. I do not believe the Governor-General will think it derogatory to accept information from the Clerk to the Executive Council. </para>

It does not matter to me who occupies the position, and I desire my remarks to be taken as applying only to the office. I say that &#163;150 a year is very little for the work that has to be done, and for the responsibility which the officer occupying this position has to undertake. If he is able to carry out the work, it does not matter whether he is a member of the military forces or the humblest man in the community, he is entitled to a commensurate recompense for the work he does. Unless the honorable member has something to urge against the character of the individual who occupies the position, he should not mention his name. Any one who has been brought into contact with the Clerk to the Executive Council must admit that at no time has he behaved himself in other than a perfectly courteous and gentlemanly fashion. </para>

                        <para>- I think I can satisfy the honorable member for Coolgardie on this point in a very few words. I have no concern whatever as to who is holding the position, or what he may be in any capacity outside his official capacity as Clerk to the Executive Council. The person holding that position - a peculiarly confidential position, upon which I do not think the Prime Minister laid sufficient stress - is under a pledge of secrecy as well as the members of the Executive Council. He must not be confused with the clerk who does not and cannot do the work of the Clerk to the Executive Council. </para>

                        <para>- In my opinion the honorable member for Coolgardie has attacked the one item which we can all defend. I only wish I could defend every item of expenditure by the Government as I can defend this. I think that in this case the Government have made an excellent bargain. There is no doubt that the Clerk to the Executive Council has very important duties to perform. He has to be in the confidence of the various Ministers, and also of the Governor-General, and he has to make all sorts of arrangements between them. The other clerk, who merely does the clerical work, I believe, renders very good service, but in this particular case I think the remuneration of &#163;150 is extremely moderate. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to ask the honorable member for Coolgardie if he has ever been a member of any Government in Western Australia ? I do not think he has, because he has displayed a want of high solemn appreciation of the great responsibilities attaching to the confidential position of the Clerk to the Executive Council. The clerks to the various State Executive Councils are paid a very much higher salary than this officer. 1 wish the members of the committee to understand, that if the gentleman who occupies this position received no other emolument he would probably be paid from &#163;600 to &#163;800 a year for the duties of this office. The clerk referred to, who has to do the detail work, is never present at the conferences and discussions which take place in the Council. I do not desire to discuss the merits of the gentleman who at present occupies the position, but to cavil at the proposed remuneration for the highly responsible, delicate, and confidential duties of this office shows an absolute non appreciation of the position. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the Government should pay a reasonable salary to whoever performs the work of this office. The present occupant, I understand, fills two positions, and the &#163;150 is paid to him for purely nominal services. In the States they have officers to perform this work, who are paid decent salaries. It is evident that the man who is doing the work in this case is the clerk at &#163;325 a year.. I think it would be better to add to his salary the &#163;150 attaching to the office we are now discussing, and another &#163;100, and let him do the whole of the work. </para>

                            <para>- In Queensland the whole of the work is done by an officer receiving &#163;600 a year, who is termed Clerk of the Executive Council, and a messenger. It is not dignified for the Government to give this position to the private secretary to the Governor-General merely because his time is not fully occupied. The chances are that had any one but the present occupant held the position of private secretary to the Governor-General he would not be getting the &#163;150 a year. If the office is necessary, some one should be appointed to fill it at a decent salary. </para>

Among the arguments which influence me are those of the honorable members for Maranoa and Kennedy. As usual, I have not been able to agree with the honorable member for Gippsland, whose logic to my thinking is somewhat eccentric. I still regard the office as unnecessary. In my opinion it would be better to increase the salary of the next clerk by the amount at issue, and allow him to do the work, the bulk of which he does now. </para>

It seems to me that, as the honorary Ministers were appointed, not  were required to conduct the business of Parliament, but to get the Cabinet out of a difficulty, and to provide for the representation of Tasmania, the country should be put to no expense in regard to them. If an additional Minister was required, the Government should have brought in a Bill creating a portfolio for him, and providing a salary. </para>

                        <para>- There are in existence, and until there is an Act passed for the administration of New Guinea, there will continue to be in existence certain ordinances of the Executive and Legislative Councils of New Guinea. They provide, I understand, for  of New Guinea labour for certain purposes in the pearling industry under regulations which are very strict, and which insure the return of the natives after specified terms of service. These, among other things, are matters which are now being inquired into. The arrangement at present on foot does not entitle us to interfere with existing conditions, except so far as the Legislative Council of the Possession may pass an ordinance requiring the assent of the Governor-General. We are waiting, as I explained the other day, for the opportunity to pass an Act in completion of the documents that arrived only a day or two ago, which will give us complete control over New Guinea. In the meantime the ordinances I have spoken of will have effect. The honorable member said something this afternoon about natives being recruited for the pearling industry. They receive no employment, I understand, as pearl-divers. If I correctly recall a conversation I had with the Administrator, they do not take employment as pearl-divers generally, but they take employment on the crews of pearling vessels. If they take employment in New Guinea as members of a crew <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> engaged in the navigation of the ship, I have given a decision that under the Immigration Restriction Act they are entitled to land as members of the crew during its stay. I am informed by the Administrator that there are either none of them or very few engaged in  That is as much as I can tell the honorable member just now, unless he will put any question to me arising out of what I have said. </para>

Natives are taken over from New Guinea to Woodlark Island to work in connexion with the gold mines. If they are allowed to be taken over to that island, and perhaps to others, to work in connexion with the gold-mining industry, it is likely that they will creep into other industries. I should like to see the natives confined to their own island. We cannot reasonably object to the natives working for any one who happened to be on their island, but we ought to try and use our influence to prevent them from going outside the confines of New Guinea. </para>

                            <para>- In the main I am in accord with what the honorable member has expressed ; but I would rather take a little more extensive view. I think every section in the House has assented to the proposal that a man is entitled to earn his living in the country to which he belongs, whether he be a black man or a white man. That would be true as regards New Guinea ; but if we find that there are any groups of islands the people of which are practically one in race, and one so far as their possible local connexion may prevail, it would be very hard to treat each of them as a separate principality, especially in the case of savage tribes, in whom the idea of anything like a settled principality is totally inconceivable. Therefore, when we get a group of islands, such as the New Hebrides or New Guinea, or a few of the islands adjacent, it is far better, it strikes me, to treat them as one entirety, instead of trying to set up among them all sorts of independent arrangements of an opposite character which really are not justified either by sentiment or by race. It may be so in regard to Woodlark Island. There has been an immemorial intercourse between the natives of New Guinea and those of some of the adjacent islands, and I have gone so far as to give this direction - and I shall stand by it - that that immemorial intercourse shall not be disturbed to such an extent as to prevent those who are purely people of the same coloured races having the same interchange and intercourse between them that have prevailed amongst them for ages. I would not think of disturbing that, or of so pressing the optional sections of any Act as to make that disturbance, because I do not think that was ever in the contemplation of Parliament. I shall look into what the honorable member has said, but with regard to Wood lark Island it is very probable that it will come within the principle I have laid down. This vote has to be administered, as the time has now nearly expired, on the same lines as the vote which was previously taken from the several States for the Government of New Guinea. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to have some information concerning the old subsidy towards the mail service to New Hebrides, Banks, Santa Cruz, and Solomon Groups, and the two additional subsidies, amounting to &#163;2,400 a year. I understand that there is very little trade in connexion with a number of these islands. The annual subsidy of &#163;3,600 has been considerably increased, and we ought to have some explanation as to what the Government expect to derive from the increase in the vote. </para>

                        <para>- Not very much in the way of revenue is likely to be derived from the mere postal contract, and&#39; it is not in the postal sense that the contract is an advantageous one. Although the subsidy of &#163;3,600 a year, which was paid by the New South Wales Government as a postal subsidy, became a transferred service, I have taken the whole matter into the hands of the Department of External Affairs. I could have very well said to the Postmaster-General, &#34; This comes over as a postal contract,&#34; and insisted upon it remaining in the Postal department, and therefore kept my own Estimates down. But I felt that in fairness I was bound to take this matter into my own department, notwithstanding that it is by law a postal contract. The object of the vote is not to make money. It has two sides to it. One is to keep up the trade relations which we have always had with the islands, and the other is to see that that part of our constitution which specifies the relations of the Commonwealth with the islands of the Pacific is not lost sight of, and that we keep up with the islands a reasonable relation, which may at any rate have this effect: that we shall not let them drift so far apart from us as to prevent their hope or our hope of their at some time becoming attached to the Commonwealth. I do not mean to say that I am pursuing a policy towards the annexation of the New Hebrides, but I shall resolutely pursue a policy against their annexation by any power other than Great Britain. Therefore I am entirely in favour of a small expenditure like this - it is only &#163;2,400 a year beyond that to which we were previously bound - which will keep up our connexion with the islands, help to conserve their trade to us, and also secure an extension with the Gilbert and Ellice group, the trade of which, nearly equal to that of the New Hebrides, is now being exploited by Germans from the Marshall group. </para>

                            <para>- Other powers may acquire the same trade relations, and oust us from ours, and if that were not so, the political aspect of the matter - the relation of Australia to the islands of the Pacific - justifies this small increase of annual expenditure, which, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned  only &#163;200 a month, for the sake of keeping up a regular communication enabling us to have, not only mails, but information from these quarters, and enabling us, therefore, to keep in touch with them politically, and know the movements of other powers, besides those of that to which we are attached. Considering the prospective advantages of the expenditure, it is, on the whole, a moderate one. </para>

In any case, I do not think that a couple of ship captains are the best persons to pick out a flag for Australia. If there is any necessity for a flag the Executive ought to take the responsibility of the selection. There is no need for undue haste in the selection of a flag to embody our sentiments. The Prime Minister in the first flush of his enthusiasm  that he must have a flag, and hastily brought together a number of retired merchant sea captains and others to adjudicate on a number of designs, some of which were fearful and wonderful productions. </para>

                            <para>- This expense was not incurred owing to any new-found enthusiasm on my part about the Australian flag. There was in existence a flag called &#34; The old Australian flag,&#34; which was used in the twenties with permission, and which has been used ever since without permission. But we received a despatch from the Colonial-office on the subject. Of course, it is well known to honorable members that the selection of designs for military and naval flags does not rest with the Commonwealth or with the States, but is an Imperial matter. In order that there may be some attempt at conformity, the selection rests with the military and naval authorities of the Empire. A despatch came from the Colonial-office asking us if we would submit designs for a flag and seal. We consented to do so, but I admit that we spent what might almost be regarded as an unreasonable time in considering how we should act. We came to the decision that we were not very good hands at choosing flags and seals, and we thought it best to invite competitive designs, and to appoint certain persons who might reasonably be regarded as judges in these matters to decide on the merits of the designs submitted. We did that in regard to both the seal and the flag. The designs for the seal were submitted to a committee, of whom I think <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bernard</inline> Hall, president of the Melbourne Art Gallery, was the chairman, and one or two other gentlemen were drawn from the other colonies including the deputy masters of the Mint in New South Wales and Victoria. As regards the flags, we appointed several gentlemen in marine authority at various ports of the Commonwealth - Captain Clare, of Adelaide, Captain Evans, Captain Edie, and Captain Mitchell - and we added to these, with the consent of the Admiral - in order that what is called naval heraldry might be considered in the selection of the flag - Lieutenant Thompson, R.N., who is to some extent, I believe, an authority in these matters. </para>

                    <para class="block">As has been well known for eighteen months, we offered prizes for the best designs amounting to &#163;150 - &#163;75 for the seal and &#163;75 for the flag. The expenses of the judges amounted to, I think, &#163;120. The flag-judges we paid two guineas per day and actual fares. The judges of the seals received no payment, but small presents were made in acknowledgment of their services at a cost of &#163;20 ; &#163;45 was paid for rent at the , and the wages paid to servants, and the honorarium given to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackham,</inline> who so admirably arranged the designs and looked after them generally, amounted to &#163;117. We paid for stores - including, I am shocked to say, strawboards - &#177;&#39;20. That is the whole history of this extravagance. In accordance with the despatch sent to us, we have now forwarded to England the design which received the first premium in each case. I have also taken the liberty of sending home a copy of that old flag which was well known as the Australian flag in the early part of the century, and which seems to me to be a very beautiful and bonnie flag. The rest remains with the Imperial authorities. </para>

                        <para>- I am one of those who think that the design selected for the Australian flag is decidedly unsuitable. Looking at the flag in the distance, as it was exhibited for some time on the Exhibition-building, the large star on the dark ground looks like a hole, and certainly a much better selection might have been made. What I particularly object to, however, is that we seem to be committed to this flag, <inline font-style="italic">nolens</inline><inline font-style="italic">volens.</inline> The choice of a flag for a people for all time is an important matter, and yet the Parliament of the Commonwealth have not had a voice in the selection, or in the approval of the selection made by the committee. We have decided many less important matters. </para>

                            <para>- I have no strange misconception. Other flags have been approved by the representatives of the people. If the Ministry had retained the selection in their own hands they would have represented the Parliament, which in turn represents the people ; but they have delegated their powers to four or five persons, to whose selection we are to be committed for all time. We have been committed behind our backs in a way that we never anticipated. This is not a question qf money, but of national sentiment, and a national decision has been given without any reference whatever to the national sentiment. If the Prime Minister, on his visit to Great Britain, can do anything to secure a better selection than that already made he will be acting in the best interests of Australia. </para>

The Prime Minister cannot on his visit exercise his mind and his activities over any matters that will be of more importance in the future, although I admit that there are many matters of more importance for the present. </para>

                            <para>- I read several opinions that were published in the <inline font-style="italic">Times.</inline> The criticisms were condemnatory, and a suggestion was made similar to that which has fallen from the honorable member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Braddon, namely, that the designs should have been submitted to the College of Heralds to insure their conformity with the requirements of that institution. There is a considerable amount of expert pedantry displayed even in regard to flags, and it is said by the critics of the designs sent home that they do not conform to requirements, and that it was a pity that they were not&#39; first submitted to some expert. If the Prime Minister will look into the matter when he visits England, and ascertain what reasonable objections have been urged against the designs, perhaps its remission to an expert may be advisable. It has been pointed out that, perhaps, the Union Jack with some modifications might be adopted in preference to the flamboyant designs which were sent home. I believe it was said that a flag actually contained one or two special pointers which do not exist in the heavens. At any rate a great deal of pleasantry has been indulged in at the expense of those who emblazoned the flag with additional stars to represent the southern firmament. </para>

But inasmuch as this honorarium was held over for so long, it might easily have been withheld till Parliament had been consulted. </para>

                        <para>- The sum paid to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jenkins</inline> was no larger than that paid to other State officials. It has been said that there were more State than Commonwealth functions in connexion with the celebrations. That is so, but there was not more work. The work of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jenkins</inline> began at the same period as that of the State officers, and was just as continuous and arduous. Perhaps the remarks of the honorable member for Bland would have been more to the point if he had censured the Ministry for choosing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jenkins</inline> instead of attacking that gentleman himself. At any rate it is only fair to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J</inline> enkins to say - and I was in the way of observing what he did - that he spared neither pains nor trouble to do what was right. It is true that there were hitches, but such celebrations were never carried out without myriads of hitches occurring. To ascribe to the man who had to direct and control the whole of the arrangements, every hitch that might possibly have arisen from an inaccuracy on the part of any subordinate officer is not too kind. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jenkins</inline> did his work as well as did any other man. </para>

                            <para>- I am not speaking of any member of this Parliament, but I happen to know of cases in which considerable heartburning and jealousy were engendered generally because of the position in which somebody else&#39;s wife was placed. It is impossible to arrange these matters so as to avoid .all unpleasantness, and when one is trying to classify 10,000 or 12,000 persons with their wives and perhaps members of of their families, one may be excused if a mistake occurs. That is what has happened. But the solid fact remains that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jenkins</inline> did the same class of work and was engaged outside his own official duties ns long and as arduously as was any other man. Waa I to be guilty, then, of the meanness of engaging his services for the purpose of making all the arrangements connected with the celebrations, and of afterwards leaving him without an honorarium <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If he merited any honorarium it was that which he received ; if he did not deserve that he should have received nothing. </para>

I was not even allowed admission to the State concert in the Exhibition-building, so my wife and 1 contented ourselves with going to the theatre. I &#39;was looking for the only Jenkins again. After the celebrations were concluded I was given a badge, and told that if I had worn that I should have been able to get through the lines. I saw none of the show. A policeman stopped me at every turn. Yet now I find that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jenkins</inline> has been paid &#163;250 for looking after strangers like myself. </para>
