If heavy duties are imposed upon everything, small and great, that is used in the processes of manufacture, the protection' given by the duties on the finished articles will evaporate. </para>

                            <para>- So far as I have been able to learn the larger portion of the imported anti-friction grease is in tins. It is the more valuable portion, and the rate of duty we propose comes to about 20 per cent. I can understand that certain quantities may be imported in bulk, but probably they would be of an inferior description, and the rate of duty would be higher. </para>

                            <para>- No. That which is imported in tins is very valuable; running from £24 to £28 per ton. Honorable members will see that we can fairly impose a reasonable duty upon that article. I admit that so far as the bulk article is concerned the proposed rate may be too heavy. I advise the committee to agree to a duty of 2s. per cwt. in bulk, and 4s. per cwt. in tins. </para>

                        <para>- On referring to the <inline font-style="italic">Statistical Register</inline> of South Australia I cannot find that the South Australians import any of this article, so that it is impossible to estimate the price at which it is imported, but according to the New South Wales returns ordinary grease averages about 16s. per cwt. Anti-friction grease would average a great deal more than that here. On anti-friction grease the duty should be 4s. per cwt. whether it is imported in tins or in bulk. It is complained that we do not give an opportunity for the working up of our products in this State. I cannot see the force of sending away to other countries the grease and other byproducts of our primary industries and allowing them to come back in a manufactured state. Although the duty on anti-friction grease has been 4s. per cwt. when imported in tins, the price has been less here, according to travellers' returns, than in other States. In New South Wales, they imported most of their supply duty free from America. </para>

                        (East Sydney). - The honorable and learned member for South Australia, I think, is nearly accurate in what he stated with reference to the difference between the value of the article and the duty of4s. per cwt. It is of no use the honorable member for Yarra taking our bulk statistics, dividing them up and finding a price, because all sorts of qualities of material are included in the general bulk. I believe that this stuff is shipped free on board in New York at 7s. per cwt.

                            <para>- I am confining myself entirely to the definition in the Tariff - axle grease. A duty of £4 per ton on an article worth, on board ship in New York, £7, is a pretty stiff one ; it is a long way over 50 per cent. As the freight and shipping charges amount to £3 per ton, there is practically a natural artificial protection amounting to 100 per cent. Are we going up to 100 per cent. in the case of grease when we will not go beyond15 or 20 per cent. in the case of our great manufacturing industries ? This stuff is used in the manufacturing and producing industries. We ought to try to observe some consistency in our rates. Two shillings per cwt. would amount to over 27½ per cent. </para>

                            <para>- If the value ranges to these extreme points, then a specific duty is a most inconvenient and unfair one. Four shillings per cwt. would be a very small percentage, perhaps, on an article valued at £30 per ton, but when it is compared with an article valued at £7 per ton, it becomes an enormous duty. I suppose the Government wish to have some sort of relationship between their duties. The Treasurer has been extremely liberal in coming down 50 per cent, in one shot. </para>

                        <para>- I did not quite follow the figures of the honorable and learned member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn,</inline> but I think that he must be labouring under some mistake. If I heard him correctly, he stated that the price of grease landed in South Australia was £32 per ton, and he made out that a duty of 4s. per cwt. came to 80 per cent. Of course the figures do not work out in that way. The prices which have been furnished to me show that the average cost is about £14 per ton, so that the article quoted at £32 per ton must have been a very superior one. The prices which have been given to me are for articles of similar quality, and used in similar work, namely, £11 in Victoria, £12 in New South Wales, £14 in Queensland, and £16 in Western Australia. I suppose that the differences in the price are partly the result of freight charges, and partly the result of distances to be covered, but I believe the average is about £14 per ton. I do not know a very great deal about this matter, except that some four companies are engaged in manufacturing the article here. I believe it is manufactured in every State in Australia, and to that extent it must be locally consumed. The Victorian product has given every possible satisfaction to the users, more particularly to mine managers. I have some letters from the Bendigo, Ballarat, and Maryborough districts. It is used there in large quantities by mining managers and others, who all state that it has given every possible satisfaction; that they have used it for a number of years, varying from twelve to sixteen ; and that it has served all their purposes, and, above all, that it is quite cheap. Perhaps the best testimony is that sent by the manager for James McEwan and Co., the hardware importers, to the manager of the Standard Grease and Oil Company in Richmond -  </para>

                            <para>- The other letters I have are from mine managers and others, who say the local article is good in quality and is supplied at a fair price. The manufacturers say that they started the industry as the result of a duty of 4s. per cwt. being imposed in this State ; that if it be removed probably they will come into very severe competition with the American Standard Oil Company, who, in part, manufacture this article from the refuse of the oil wells ; and that if they are subject to that severe competition they will have either to reduce wages or to take other steps. It does seem to me, on the evidence I have before me, only a fair thing to main tain the duty as it is, and to allow local persons to supply the market. </para>

                        <para>- I followed the arguments of the last speaker, and he has confirmed, to my satisfaction, the statement made by the leader of the Opposition that this grease is bought in America at £7 per ton, and landed here at £14 per ton. He showed very clearly that this duty is quite equal to 40 or 50 per cent, on the cost of the material in America. If the Government desire to put a duty of 50 or 60 per cent on grease, then their action is quite consistent. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">But if it is desired to impose a duty of 25 per cent, the amount should be reduced from 4s. to 2s. per cwt. There is no possibility of Australia competing with America in the manufacture of axle grease. The best Australian grease is made from tallow and oil - chiefly cod oil which comes from Newfoundland. The cod oil would cost here between £30 and £40 per ton, and the cheapest tallow cannot be obtained for less than £18 per ton. We can make axle-grease of better quality than that which is imported, but it will not do better work, and when we have to pay £18 per ton for tallow, it would be impossible for us to compete with the imported article at £14 per ton. That is one of the reasons why the consumers of axle-grease in Victoria had to pay more than was realized for the article in New South Wales before the Federal Tariff came into operation. </para>

                        (East Sydney).- If the honorable member for Melbourne Ports desires the business to be expedited, he will not make wildly inaccurate statements such as that which has just fallen from him. I have some figures taken from Messrs. Lewis and Whitty's price-list before the Federal Tariff came into operation. Axle-grease was then admitted free in New South Wales, but was subject to a duty of 4s. per cwt. in Victoria. According to this price - list Messrs. Lewis and Whitty sold their axle grease called " lubricator," in one and a-half pound tins, six dozen in a case, at 4s. 9d. per dozen tins in Sydney, whilst the Melbourne price was 5s. -3d. per dozen. This made a difference of 6s. 2d. per cwt. in favour of Sydney consumers. As the Treasurer has agreed to reduce the duty by 2s. per cwt., I suggest that the honorable and learned member for South Australia should accept the compromise, so that we may save discussion and get on with the business.

I have offered to meet the committee by consenting to a duty of 2s. per ton upon grease imported in bulk, retaining the 4s. duty upon grease imported in tins. Now the honorable and learned member for South Australia wishes me to apply the 2s. rate all round, and I do not think that it is fair to press me to that extent.

                        (South Australia).I would ask the Treasurer whether it is worth while to make a distinction between the axle-grease imported in tins, and that brought in in bulk. The grease is sure to be brought in here in large quantities, and tinned within the Commonwealth, but we shall scarcely be justified in imposing a high duty upon axle grease in tins, in order to encourage its importation in bulk, so that it may be put in tins here.

                        (Yarra).- The proposal of the Government is a very fair one. It is perfectly legitimate to impose a higher rate of duty on grease imported in tins, with a view to encourage its importation in bulk. Honorable members opposite declare that axle grease will continue to be imported in bulk, and that the tinning will be done locally. In my judgment, the men employed by the local manufacturer should be given a preference. Despite the repeated declarations of members of the Opposition that they are in favour of extending consideration to the primary producer, they want to send away tallow from Australia in order that it may be worked up into axle grease in another country, and then imported into the Commonwealth.

According to the figures which I have obtained, the latest quotation for anti-friction grease in New York is £12 10s. per ton. That is greater by nearly 50 per cent, than is the price quoted by the honorable member for Robertson. I trust that the compromise suggested by the Treasurer will be accepted. </para>

                        <para>- I would point out to the committee that the total revenue which the Treasurer expects to derive from this particular item is £830 per annum. After declaring that the Government would consent to the imposition of a duty of 2s. per cwt. upon axle grease, we find Ministers affirming that there must be a difference made between the tax levied upon grease imported in bulk and that collected upon grease which is imported in tins. In other words, because Messrs. Lewis and Whitty put this grease up in tins, we are to impose a differential duty for their benefit. </para>

I am addressing those honorable members who have some regard to the welfare of the people of the Commonwealth. The proposed duty will fall upon the bulk of the producers, because they are the persons who use this axle grease. But simply because a particular Melbourne firm says - " We should like an extra duty of 25 or 30 per cent, imposed upon this particular article," their wishes are cheerfully acceded to. The Commonwealth is composed of the people of Australia, and not of the half-dozen manufacturers who make representations to the Ministry. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable and learned member for Werriwa is always haunted by the suspicion that any honorable member who speaks from the Government side of the Chamber, must be speaking on behalf of a particular firm. The industry under discussion has been established in Victoria for eighteen years. When a protective duty was first imposed upon axle grease in this State the price of the article was 22s. per cwt. ; but at the present time I am informed that a more suitable grease for mining purposes can be purchased for lis. per cwt. This commodity is being made by the firms which have sprung into existence under the operation of a protective duty ; and the reduction in price which has taken place has been brought about solely by internal competition. During the tenure of office of the Patterson Government the duty upon axle grease in tins was fixed at 4s. per cwt., whilst that levied upon grease not otherwise enumerated was 3s. per cwt. ; so that the present proposal of the Treasurer really constitutes a reduction of the Victorian rate of duty. The compromise suggested by the Government is a reasonable one. and should be accepted. </para>

                        (Werriwa).- According to the argument of the honorable and learned member for Bendigo, the committee ought to abolish the duty upon axle grease. He says that in Victoria, as the result of the operation of a tax upon this article, its price has fallen from 22s. per cwt. to lis. per cwt. Last week he declared that it was necessary to impose protective duties to enable our manufacturers to pay higher wages to their workmen than those which are paid in other countries. Therefore, if the operation of this particular duty in Victoria has lowered i the price of axle grease, it necessarily follows that the wages paid in connexion with the industry have also been lowered.

                        <para>- It is quite natural that every honorable member who speaks from the Opposition side of the Chamber should be regarded as a theorist by the honorable and learned member for Bendigo. But I would point out that the only theoretical proposal which has been advanced to-day has been put forward by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports and himself. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports tells the committee that axle grease is 20s. per ton cheaper in Victoria than it is in Sydney. Has the honorable member ever heard of any petitions coming from Sydney praying for the maintenance of the duty which formerly operated in Victoria in order to enable the people of New South Wales to get a cheaper article? Are all the residents of Sydney simpletons <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If they have to pay 20s. per ton more for axle grease than do the people in Victoria, does he not suppose that they would be clamouring for the imposition of this duty in order that the price of the article might be reduced ? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member has me at a disadvantage, because I do not know. But does he subscribe to the theory that if we impose a duty upon any particular article we reduce its price ? The amazing feature with regard to the honorable member for Melbourne Ports is that he knows everybody's business, can tell the committee precisely how it stands financially, and whether any individual firm is making profits or going to the wall. To-day he has made the astonishing statement that axle grease can be purchased in Victoria for 20s. per ton less than it can be bought for in Sydney. Upon that line of reasoning the honorable member ought to be a most violent opponent of the Treasurer's proposal, because, if the duty is lowered, the probability is that the price of the article in Sydney will be reduced, whilst it will be raised in Victoria. Really the statements which are made by the honorable member are too ridiculous. If he would only take the trouble to consult the people who have to pay these duties, he would not submit the absurd proposition i that if we increase the rate of duty upon any article we decrease its price. The contrary is the case, and as grease is used so largely in every kind of manufacturing industry, it appears to me that the Government might well waive this proposal, or at an}' rate reduce the duty to the extent proposed by the honorable and learned member for South Australia. </para>

                        PATERSON (Capricornia).This is an item about which I certainly ought to know something. I have been rather amused b)' some of the speeches delivered on this question. There seems to be an impression that axle-grease is made from tallow, but from the facts stated during the course of the debate I conclude that very little tallow is used in it at the present day. Tallow is not obtainable here under £1S per ton, and in New York, where axle grease comes from, tallow is from £20 to £23 per ton at the present time. Therefore the quantity of tallow used in the manufacture of the axle-grease must be verv immaterial. No doubt some adulterant is employed which can be obtained for next to nothing. Part of this item relates to "tallow unrefined." I would suggest to the Minister for Trade and Customs that it seems to be absurd to impose a duty on tallow, because under the former State Tariffs of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, it was admitted free, while no duty is imposed even by protectionist New Zealand. It is ridiculous to impose a duty on this article, because for the last ten years the surplus which must be exported has ranged in value from £1,000,000 to £1,500,000 per annum. Tallow ought to be placed on the free list. I wonder whether the Government, having placed a varying duty on axle-grease in tins and casks, propose to treat tallow in the same way. That would make the position even more ludicrous. I suggest that the duty so far as it relates to tallow, be omitted.

                        <para>- I suppose it is useless to think of opposing the amendment, but it seems to me that the Government gain very little by these compromises. Their only effect is to give away the Government policy. The Government offered the Opposition this compromise, but a division was insisted upon, with the result that the item was agreed to. We might as well have an all round duty of 4s. as give away a duty of 2s. per cwt. </para>

                        <para>- There is an item in this list which, I think, should receive attention from honorable members. I refer to cotton seed oil, and the duty proposed to be imposed upon its introduction. I presume that so high a duty has been imposed upon this article because it is used considerably as an adulterant for olive oil. So far as regards the encouragement of purity in that direction, I have no objection whatever to the extent of the duty here proposed. I do think, however, that there is an incongruity when the adulterated olive oil can come in at1s. 4d. per gallon, while the cotton seed oil would have to pay 2s. There is another aspect of the question to which I desire to direct the Minister's particular attention. After some years of experimenting, and the expenditure of a considerable sum, a process has been devised in New South Wales - I do not know whether it has been used in any of the other States - by which tallow is sufficiently refined to produce what is called "edible fat." This edible fat is a marketable article, and in its manufacture a considerable quantity of cotton seed oil is used. It is quite true that we have expressed our opposition to " edible fat " going into competition with our butter in these markets, but there is a large demand for it in England, and on the continent, as a marketable article. The difference to Australia is that, whereas the finest refined tallow may bring £29 per ton, this " edible fat " sells at £40 per ton. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know for what it is used. Do we know for what our tallow is used? American lard is said to contain the same admixture of this cottonseed oil as does this refined tallow which is described as "edible fat,"andwepropose to let American lard in at1d. per lb., while we charge nearly 3d. per lb. on cotton-seed oil. How can we say what our products are used for? I have myself observed that in London the finest quality of our tallow is refined there and used as the basis of a substitute for butter. Are we to cease exporting tallow or to place difficulties in the way of its exportation because it is so used ? We know that the poorer populations of Europe cannot afford to pay the prices charged for butter. They are perfectly willing to accept these edible fats, knowing them to be edible fats, and why should they not get the benefit of using them? This being so, there is an opportunity of increasing our export trade, of improving certain products of Australia, and of obtaining a much higher price for them than can be obtained for them as tallow. Why should we allow difficulties to be placed in the way of this industry? By placing a duty of 3d. per lb, or £28 per ton, on cottonseed oil, unless some arrangements are made for giving a drawback upon the quantity of oil used in the manufacture of the fat exported, we raise the price of the finished article <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> some £14 per ton, and immediately destroy the business. Thousands of pounds have been spent in perfecting the processes and providing the machinery necessary to produce this article, and such an expenditure has in other instances been urged by honorable members opposite as a good reason for protecting industries. But protection is not demanded here, and the request is simply that we should not destroy this industry by our Tariff proposals. This article is never offered upon the local markets ; but while an industry of this sort has been established in New South Wales at an expenditure of thousands of pounds in machinery, and while there is a demand in Europe for the article, not as a substitute for butter, but simply as " edible fat," for whatever purpose it may be used, it is ridiculous for us to interfere with that industry, and destroy it. I recognise that no reduction which Ministers would be disposed to consider would be sufficient to meet this case, but if the duty is not to be reduced, or sufficiently reduced, could not the Minister, under his regulations, grant a drawback, as he proposes to do in the case of other articles, on the amount of cotton seed oil that may be used in the product <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> By doing anything else Ministers would not interfere with the consumption of edible fat, which is supplied by America and other countries, and they would only say, in effect, that Australia should not take part in this trade because some of the product is used as a substitute for butter. On the same principle they should put difficulties in the way of the exportation of tallow, because, as I have witnessed in London, a considerable amount of that article is refined, and then used as a substitute for butter. So far as that kind of thing is honestly and openly done, it is perfectly legitimate and proper, and we cannot stop it. We can only prevent the Australian producers from getting the benefit of that outlet for their products, and the present prices for their articles in the markets of the world are such that every possible assistance should be given them to raise the prices of those articles. There is no question of protection in this ; it is only a question of removing by drawback the disability which this duty will impose upon the industry, and of allowing Australia to supply what is in demand in other portions of the world, and which will be supplied, and will be used practically to the same extent if Australia cannot supply it. If the duty is to remain at the figure here proposed, or even at a much lower figure, the proper way will be for the Minister to arrange that on the exportation of this "edible fat," there shall be a drawback given upon the quantity of cotton-seed oil it contains. </para>

                        <para>- This duty upon cotton-seed oil is undoubtedly high, and it has been purposely made so because the article is not only used fraudulently, but, so far as we know, it is injurious to health. Olive oil is produced within the Commonwealth and this cotton-seed oil is absolutely put into bottles in which olive oil has been imported, and then sold as olive oil. That is undoubtedly a fraud, the oil being a less valuable article than pure olive oil, and we are informed upon expert advice that it is injurious. The honorable member for North Sydney admits that there ought to be a very high duty imposed upon it. Cottonseed oil is made very largely in America, and goes through several processes before it is exported. In these processes various chemicals are used, and amongst them caustic soda, potash, and milk of lime. These ingredients are used in refining the oil. The committee will, I hope, pause before they do what the honorable member for North Sydney asks us to do. If there is anything which more than another we have attempted to do in all our State Parliaments it is to be perfectly certain that everything exported from our States as butter, or as a substitute for butter, shall be as pure as we can possibly make it. If this is an article which, for the reasons I have mentioned, ought to be heavily taxed, surely the honorable member will see that he is asking us to do something which would not be wise in the interests of Australia. It may be that this particular industry has been established, but we all know that it is not absolutely necessary to use all these ingredients. This cotton-seed oil is used for some purpose, but I doubt whether my honorable friend will tell us that no other ingredient could be used which would answer the purpose as well. If we admit, as I think we do, that this is an article which is fraudulently used, it is one upon which we should not only put a heavy duty, but one which might very well be considered when we come to discuss later on a list of articles which ought to be prohibited. </para>

                            <para>- If this were a non-injurious article there would be no reason for putting a heavy duty on it. All the evidence we can get, and all the information supplied to us, shows that this is an article the use of which we ought not to encourage. We have, therefore, proposed a heavy duty upon it, and I regret that I cannot accede to the request of the honorable member for North Sydney to facilitate the use of this article in the manufacture of "edible fat," which will be sold by some people as butter. I think the duty ought to be carried as proposed. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member will find, if he reads up the American statistics, that there are thousands of gallons of it made, and that shows the extensive use to which it is put. The committee are asked at the present time to impose a duty upon it, which, with the import charges, amounts to possibly 100 per cent. The original price of cotton-seed oil is from 2s. 3d. to 2s. 6d. per gallon. We are asked to impose a duty of 2s. per gallon upon it, and I suppose the import charges would amount to not less than fid. per gallon. The argument used is that cotton-seed oil is used in place of olive oil. Is that not rather an absurd reason to bring before this committee1! We must deal with this article on its own basis, and look at it from that point of view entirely. It seems to me that it would not be a bad thing for members of this committee to get one or two elementary lessons in chemistry, that they might learn that scientists are endeavouring to - day to make foods cheap. In spite of what has been said, I would defy honorable members to tell good cotton oil from good olive oil if both were placed before them. Fraud occurs only when an attempt is made to sell common oil for some other oil, and we cannot prevent that. If the protectionists were to have their way in regard to matters like this, they would prevent any new discoveries in chemistry. </para>

                    <para>The assertions of the Minister for Trade and Customs would convince a schoolboy that he does not understand the subject. I think Mark Twain, in his <inline font-style="italic">Life on the Mississippi,</inline> devotes a couple of pages to a discussion as to the use of cotton oil in America, where there was a great deal of prejudice against it 20 or 30 years ago, and the right honorable member seems to have obtained his information from that book, when he would have been much better occupied in making himself acquainted with some author on the subject of political economy. The committee are not now considering the provisions of an Adulteration Bill. We are engaged upon a Tariff, and why cannot we keep to what is before us ? No wonder that the number of lawyers is increased. The Postal Act contains a number of provisions which rightly belong to other measures, and now it is proposed to insert in the Tariff provisions which should belong to an Adulteration Act. </para>

                        (North Sydney).- I do not know of my own knowledge whether cottonseed oil or even olive oil is injurious ; but I know that edible fat mixed with cottonseed oil has been sold in England for years, and the British Adulteration Acts are the strictest in the world. If the British Government allow this article to be imported, we may be pretty sure that it is perfectly wholesome. The best refined tallow brings £29 a ton, and is largely used as a substitute for butter, but if edible fat mixed with cotton-seed oil is sent home it brings £11 per ton more.

                            <para>- Because tallow during a three months' voyage acquires a peculiar rancid flavour, which should be absent from an edible fat. This article is exported to Great Britain from the United States and from South America, so that, even if we prevent its exportation from Australia, we cannot prevent its importation into Great Britain. My complaint is this : If cotton-seed oil is imported and then exported, a drawback is allowed, but no drawback is allowed when the cotton-seed oil is exported mixed with some other substance. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister has hitherto refused to grant drawbacks. We do not want competition between butter and edible fat in our own market, but if we do not allow this edible fat to be exported, it will be forced upon our market. The same drawback should be given when cotton-seed oil is exported mixed with some other substance as when it is exported by itself. A duty of 2s. a gallon is imposed upon cottonseed oil, but adulterated olive oil is allowed to come in on payment of a duty of ls. 4d. a gallon. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the case made out by the honorable member for North Sydney has not been answered. I could understand the position of the Treasurer if it were a practice to export edible fats as Australian butter but that is not done, and if Ministers wish to make quite sure on the point they can require all casks containing edible fats to be branded with the name of their contents. But to undertake to supplement the Adulteration and Health Acts of Great Britain and other European countries is to take too much upon ourselves, and to inflict a severe blow upon one of our industries. Even if Australia ceases to export edible fats, they will continue to be exported from America, so that our efforts on behalf of the people of England and Europe will be abortive. We have a good export trade in edible fats, and it is quite opposed to the underlying principle of both free-trade and protection that obstacles should be placed in its way. The honorable member for North Sydney does not ask for an alteration in the proposed duty. He admits that it is necessary to do something to prevent the use of cotton-seed oil in Australia in place of the ordinary culinary and table oils. But he wishes to secure from Ministers the promise that a drawback will be granted when cotton-seed oil upon which duty has been paid is exported, whether mixed with edible fat or not. We have given protection and assistance to other industries, and why should we hinder this industry, which is likely to become more and more important as the years go by ? It is not for us to say that the use of these edible fats by the people of other countries is injurious. We can very well leave them to take care of themselves. It is no part of our duty to refuse to enter into a trade in which America and the Argentine are already very largely engaged simply because of some Quixotic notion about protecting the health of the people of European countries. </para>

                        <para>- The request made by the honorable member for North Sydney, so far as the export of this article in combination with tallow is concerned, is a reasonable one, and the Government have perfect power under the Customs Act to allow a drawback. Of course, the manufacture would have to be carried out in such a way that the Government could be satisfied as to the quantity of oil which was used. As regards the oil itself, a great mistake seems to prevail. No doubt it is used as a substitute for olive oil, but it is a perfectly sweet and wholesome product, and there can be no objection to it if it is sold for what iv. is. If it is sold and used as olive oil it is a fraud, and would come under the provisions of the Adulteration of Foods Act. I fail to see how the Government are likely to quite attain their object by imposing a duty of1s. 4d. per gallon on olive oil which they intend to prevent cotton-seed oil being substituted for. If the article is imported in bottles, unless every parcel is examined by an analytical chemist, it is impossible to tell what it is. </para>

                            <para>- I am not aware if they can. It will lead to great practical inconvenience if every parcel is examined. If it is not examined, the substituted article will come in at ls. 4d. per gallon in bottles and at 2s. per gallon in bulk. That will lead to difficulties. If the duty on the two articles is assimilated there will not be an inducement to people to substitute one for the other. I suppose the duty is proposed in view of the fact that olive oil is being largely made in Australia. If it is brought in in bottles at ls. 4d. per gallon, the protection which the Ministry intend to give the article, will not be attained. There is another difficulty which has to be pointed out. According to the next paragraph, bottles are subjected to a duty of 20 per cent. If bottled oil comes in no duty is paid on the bottles, cases, and labels, whereas any one using the olive oil of South Australia or Victoria will have to pay a duty if he uses foreign bottles. There are a great variety of bottles involved. I am not prepared at the moment to say what is the best way for getting out of the difficulty; but I think that one method will be to assimilate the duties on the two articles. There is no question that one is substituted for the other in Europe, America, and Australia ; but I believe it is generally sold as salad oil, which is not necessarily olive oil, because many other oils are used for salad purposes. It may be that large quantities are sold as olive oil. "We wish, as far as possible, to remove the inducement to people to perpetrate a fraud which cam be punished under the Adulteration of Foods Act at any moment. </para>

                        <para>- The only justification which has been put forward by the Government for imposing this very high duty on cotton-seed oil is that which has been put forward by the Treasurer - that it is used fraudulently, and that it is injurious. If, as he says, it is sometimes sold for olive oil, I do not see why we ought to take that matter into consideration in connexion with the Tariff, because those who sell cottonseed oil as olive oil ought to be prosecuted in the ordinary way. And if it is injurious to the extent which the Treasurer implies that it is, then it is a matter which ought to be dealt with in the regulations under the Customs Act. Its importation ought to be prohibited. This duty will not prohibit its importation. On the contrary, the quantity that will be imported, even under this very high duty, must be very considerable. According to the estimate prepared by the officers of the Government, the proposed duty is expected to yield £6,875. Therefore the federal authorities must believe that the importation of the article must go on to a considerable extent. The Government have placed themselves in the position of getting that very large amount of revenue out of the importation of an article which the Treasurer declares to be injurious. </para>

                            <para>- It is a very singular thing that, if cotton-seed oil be as injurious as it is represented to be, none of the other States seem to have quite discovered the fact. Not one of them has had a duty nearly so high as 2s. per gallon. In New South Wales and Queensland it was admitted duty free. In South Australia - the State which is principally interested in the production of olive oil - the duty was only 6d. per gallon ; while in Tasmania it was ls. 3d. per gallon. I am told that the cost of cottonseed oil in America is from 2s. 3d. to 2s. 6d. per gallon, and the cost of carriage to Australia 6d. per gallon, so that a duty of 2s. per gallon will come to about S5 per cent. If we are going to admit this oil at all, a duty of 85 per cent, is far too high, no matter whether it is regarded from the revenue or the protectionist point of view. </para>

                        <para>- I trust that Ministers will see the wisdom of agreeing to allow a drawback, as the honorable member for North Sydney suggests, in respect of the duty paid on cotton-seed oil used in the composition of an article of export. There is a great deal of force in the point put forward by him that it lies with the consignees at the other end of the world to see that they get what they are asking for. I trust that the committee will not see fit to assimilate the duties on olive oil and cotton-seed oil, because that would be practically giving a bonus to the employment of the cheaper and nastier oil. If we subject cotton-seed oil to the same duty as olive oil, it stands to reason that the inducement to people is to use the cheaper article, and the effect will not be at all in the direction of discouraging the use of an article which, so far as I know, is very seldom sold on its own -basis commercially. Our small farmers are beginning to understand that a plantation of olives can be made of value to them for the production of oil, and we shall not for very long have to depend on outside sources for our supply. Nearly all the salad oils on the market- of course I exclude the well known brands - are made of cotton-seed oil, and by salad oil the general public understand olive oil. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so. It would be a good thing to put an even higher duty upon cotton-seed oil other than that used for soap-making. I trust the Government will at least insist upon the distinction they have made in favour of olive oil. I should prefer to see a difference made to the extent of reducing the duty on olive oil to ls. per gallon, while leaving the duty on cotton-seed oil at 2s. per gallon. </para>

                            <para>- I should impose a duty of 185 per cent, if I could prevent it from entering into human consumption. If oil is methylated so that it cannot enter into human consumption it is admitted at a very low rate of duty, namely, 6d. per gallon, and that should meet all the requirements of those who use oil for ordinary trade purposes. The point raised by the honorable member for Mernda is well worthy of consideration. The foreign exporter is at an advantage as. compared with the local manufacturer so far as bottle supplies are concerned. Certain kinds of bottles have not been, and are not likely to be, manufactured within the Commonwealth, and upon these the local consumer has to pay a high duty, but the exporter from abroad can send in perfumery, essences, tinctures, or even oils, and pay no duty upon the bottles in which the liquids are contained. This was an old-established grievance amongst a certain class of manufacturers under all the State Tariffs. In the free-trade port of Sydney we were able to manufacture certain goods, put them up in bottles, and send them into Queensland and Western Australia at a distinct advantage, because our bottles were free of duty, whilst the local manufacturers of the same commodities had to pay duty upon every bottle they used. That is a left-handed way of encouraging native industries. </para>

                            <para>- I was not aware of that; but I am sure that there was no such duty imposed in Western Australia or Queensland, because I was a member of a firm which sent frequent consignments into those States. We were not able to compete in the Victorian market, because the spirit duties were too much in favour of the local manufacturer. If there is to be a duty on bottles, every bottle, whether it contains a liquid or not, should be subject to duty. I hope the Government will consider this matter, because otherwise they will find that they are placing a large proportion of our manufacturers at a disadvantage as compared with their competitors abroad. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot agree with the honorable member for Bland that a duty should be imposed upon all bottles, irrespective of whether they are empty or used as packages for imported goods. If we did as the honorable member suggests I do not know where we should stop. If we impose a duty upon the packages in which imported goods are contained as well as upon the goods themselves, we shall inflict great injury upon the revenue. We have already had communications from all parts of the Commonwealth protesting against the imposition of a duty upon packages, and I hope the Government will take these into consideration. I do not see that there can be any objection to the proposed duty on cotton-seed oil. I trust the Government will take into consideration the point raised by the honorable member for North Sydney, because we should encourage exports in every possible way. </para>

The manufacture of edible fat is in itself perfectly harmless. Some millions of people in European and other countries are too poor to buy butter, and they knowingly buy edible fat as a cheap substitute. </para>

                            <para>- But if poor people cannot afford to buy butter, we surely do not want to prevent them from procuring edible fat as a cheap substitute. I remember when I was a youngster - and doubtless other honorable members have a similar recollection - that we ate a fair amount of bread and dripping, and it did not do us much harm. That was edible fat, and surely we should not discourage the export of fat in a refined state. If there is any fraud committed in connexion with the sale of the article in some foreign country, surely that country may be left to look after its internal government. The ambitious spirit of the Minister for Trade and Customs will find sufficient occupation in squaring the financial returns with the Treasury, without bothering himself about what they do in countries 12,000 miles away. It would be absurd to interfere with the operations of Australian industry here on the basis of some anxiety for people somewhere else, who can very well look after themselves. I have no doubt, therefore, that that matter will be put right. I understand that cotton-seed oil is an article which can be used honestly for a number of purposes, although I believe that frauds are practised in connexion with its use. There again, is a subject that has a great deal more to do with some other Act than with the Tariff Act. I do not desire to attack those honorable members who wish incidentally so to shape the Tariff as to "prevent fraud. I do not see anything to object to in that. From all I can hear, large quantities of cotton-seed oil are used for a purpose which has not yet been mentioned, namely, in the operations of those who sell fried fish. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; but I understand that two-thirds of the oil used for frying fish is cotton-seed oil. I am afraid that in Our endeavour to follow the manipulation of imported articles we shall only land the unfortunate public in a greater difficulty by causing those who now use cotton-seed oil to substitute a still more objectionable article. China nut oil, which is subject to only a low rate of duty, could be used for some of the purposes to which cotton-seed oil is now applied, but it would not be anything like so good. We shall have to undertake a very big contract if in passing the Tariff we try to deal with this trouble. As long as the point mentioned by the honorable member for North Sydney, with reference to drawbacks, is attended to, the main object of this debate will have been served. </para>

                        <para>- I think we shall do well to be very careful in dealing with butter substitutes, or with substitutes for any of our staple products. It will be admitted that some parts of Australia may be described as a second Palestine - a land of corn, wine, and oil. It is difficult for me to omit recollecting at this moment that I have the honour to represent a State which has acquired a very considerable reputation in connexion with the production of olive oil. I believe there are other parts of Australia equally well adapted for the production of this excellent article, and I look forward to our being able at an early date to meet all local requirements in the way of edible oils. Cotton-seed oil has been attacked in a variety of ways, and I confess that I have been taught to think that in many respects it lends itself to fraud, and that we often get it when we do not expect it. I believe that there are good reasons for believing that under certain circumstances its use is deleterious. I wish to especially address myself to the whole question from an agricultural point of view - from the point of view of dairy farmers and others. Of course our agricultural resources are of the greatest importance, and what I am afraid of is that in endeavouring to get a small market for butter substitutes we may incur a huge loss as regards butter itself. At the present moment Australia enjoys a verv fair reputation foi- butter, and I believe that, as time goes on, we are likely - by the adoption of more careful methods than those which have hitherto been adopted - to improve that reputation. The higher our reputation in connexion with the manufacture of an article for the production of which Australia is so eminently suited, the greater will be the financial reward of those who engage in an industry of the character to which I have referred. It is of the utmost importance that we should strive, in every conceivable way, to increase our reputation as a butter-producing country. We know that the production of butter has been a great stand-by and a magnificent source of assistance to our farmers at various periods when they were urgently in need of it. Why is it that Australian wines enjoy such a high reputation ? It is because we do all that we can for the purpose of preventing their adulteration. They are said to be pure, and I believe they are. Hitherto Australia has never had its name associated with oleomargarine-- </para>

                            <para>- It is something very like it. When people in the old country buy Australian butter they know that they are getting butter. Would one of us willingly purchase a substitute? Would we, instead of getting a smaller quantity of real butter, purchase a larger quantity of fat and cotton-seed oil? The very idea of the thing is repulsive. These butter substitutes can be palmed off upon the people as butter. I have a letter in my hand bearing upon this very question. The matter is put as follows : - </para>

                            <para>- The writer points out how it is possible for Australia to participate in this trade. What would be the result of our doing so ? Either we should engage in it secretly, or we should do so openly, and thus have our reputation for the production of excellent butter mixed up with the rather discomforting reflection and criticism that we were indulging considerably in the manufacture of butter substitutes, and were supplying those who think that they are getting butter with cottonseed oil and tallow. I trust that our name will never be associated with anything of the sort. It would work great injury to our reputation as exporters of pure butter, and any amount of revenue which might be derived from such a source would be as nothing compared with the loss that would be sustained by those engaged in the production of the genuine article. We have already dealt with a somewhat similar matter in the Customs Act. In that measure the importation of oleomargarine, butterine, &amp;c., is prohibited. We practically say that we will protect Australian stomachs and constitutions against the baneful results caused by the consumption of these deleterious articles. We declare that we will prevent our people from being imposed upon, and that our farmers shall not be brought into competition with artificial articles of this sort. </para>

He states that we have prevented Australian citizens from using oleomargarine. We have done nothing of the sort. There is nothing in the Customs Act to prevent all our citizens from being supplied with oleomargarine. All we have done is to declare that oleomargarine shall not be imported into the Commonwealth except under certain conditions. But it can be made in every State of the Union. It is being made to' some extent at the present time.

                            <para>- It is being made, I understand, to a small extent in New South Wales. This fact evidences the inaccuracy of the statement made by the Minister. Nothing has been done to prevent the local production of oleomargarine or to interfere with its exportation. It can be manufactured and it can be used by Australians in spite of anything that the Minister may do. Edible fat has been produced to supply the demand which exists in Great Britain and on the continent of Europe. The Minister for Trade and Customs is altogether wrong in declaring that edible fat as such is sold as a substitute for butter. It is simply the base of that substitute, and if the edible fat is not used as a base what is? The best refined tallow, which is another of our exports. Are we going to say - " "We shall not refine tallow to the highest degree of perfection and export it, lest we should damage the reputation enjoyed by Australian butter?" Yet that is what the Minister coolly puts before the committee as a reason why we should not export edible fat. By adopting the course suggested by him we shall not reduce its consumption one iota. Even if we do not supply it, it will still be supplied by the United States and the Argentine Republic. I am told that there is a very large outlet for this article in India. Even if refined tallow were not used there, butter would not be used. The consumers there know its constituents, as they have to consider the ingredients of which certain articles are made, on account of their religion and caste. Its use is preferred in many cases because it stands the climate better. Whilst we allow a drawback upon other articles, and will permit oleomargarine - which is a complete butter substitute - to be exported, are we going to say " We will not allow any drawback upon cotton seed oil which is portion of this edible fat " ? If this article supplies a, good and wholesome purpose, and if it is in demand by people in different parts of the world who know what it is, why not permit our folk to supply ? The Minister has shown no good reason for refusing to grant a drawback upon this article, and I hope that he will reconsider the matter. From my business knowledge, I assert that he is acting upon a wrong principle. </para>

                        COOK (Parramatta).- In dealing with the duty on olive oil, I am going to take the Minister for Trade and Customs at his word. He has argued that we ought to impose a heavy duty on cottonseed oil for the reason that it is used in the manufacture of adulterated substances which are very injurious to our trade when used as substitutes for Australian butter. Another reason urged by him for the imposition of the duty was that cotton-seed oil came in here as a substitute for olive oil, and was used by people under the impression that they were using olive oil. It has been put to the committee that that is a very wrong practice. I believe that olive oil is much superior to cotton-seed oil, and it is with a view to foster the use of the former, and to supply a motive for the use of olive oil, that I propose to strike out the duty upon it. That will lead to a strict examination on the part of the Customs department, and to the " policeing  " of these oils, with the result that the people will obtain the pure article. On the very grounds upon which the Minister urged the imposition of a heavy duty on cotton-seed oil, I move -

                        <para>- The Government know, as every one knows, that they are proposing a duty on olive oil at a higher rate than that which has existed in any of the States save South Australia. Under the old State Tariffs, the duty on olive oil was 6d. per gallon in Victoria, and ls. per gallon in Queensland, ls. 3d. per gallon - a very high duty imposed for revenue purposes upon this and all other oils - in Tasmania.' In Western Australia and New South Wales no duty was imposed. We understand that the increased duty is proposed for protective purposes : but there is no reason for protecting that which is protected already by nature. Just as it is impossible for India to import from Europe any oil which can be compared for one moment with that which is manufactured locally, so is it impossible for the Commonwealth to import oil equal to the local product. The oil imported by these States is not able to stand the long sea voyage from Europe, and is more or less rancid when it arrives here. Olive oil is manufactured in the Commonwealth, and if it cannot compete with that imported from Italy, Spain, or elsewhere, which suffers the natural disadvantages to which I have referred, the industry ought not to be assisted. If a duty of 6d., or even 9d., per gallon were imposed for revenue purposes, it would be all sufficient : and the amendment of the Tariff in that way would remove an additional blot from it. </para>

It is justifiable not only on the ground that it will raise revenue : but also because it will tend to encourage and promote the production of native olive oil. For many years past scientists and others have been advocating the cultivation of the olive in Australia. They have advised orchardists and cultivators generally that the olive should grow in certain parts of Australia just as well as it does in certain parts of Europe. The result has been that the olive has been and is being cultivated successfully in South Australia as well as in various parts of Victoria.

As the result of its cultivation vast quantities of oil have been produced in Australia, under local conditions and subject to local rates of wages, but it has had to compete with rancid oils from foreign countries, imported in large quantities, and sold at very low rates. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member ought to be particularly interested in justifying this duty, because no State will benefit by it to such an extent as will South Australia. I believe that the duty is justified on the ground of the protection which it will afford Australian cultivators of the olive. In time, perhaps, they will be able, to compete with the imported article ; meanwhile this duty will steady the market, and keep out inferior olive oil imported from the old world, which does not tend to popularize the consumption of that article but rather to disgust the public taste. If the attention of the public is directed to the pure olive oil of Australia, and that article has a fair field, unembarrassed  by cheap products from the old world, the industry may become thoroughly established here, with the result that millions of money will be placed in the pockets of Australian cultivators. </para>

I consider that the duty on olive oil relates to an industry for which we ought to show some consideration, and, as it is also a revenue-producing duty, I think there is very little in it to which objection can be taken. </para>

                        (Kalgoorlie).- I shall support the amendment. I believe in consistently following out any policy that one adopts, and in adhering to that policy, irrespective of how it may affect the interests of any individuals whom an honorable member may represent. I am in favour of olive oil being placed upon the free list, or, at any rate, of the proposed duty being reduced very much. I would draw the attention of the committee to the fact that, with one exception, the duty is higher than that which existed under any of the State TarifFs. No duty has been imposed upon olive oil either in New South Wales or in Western Australia. In Victoria the duty was only 6d. per gallon, while in Queensland it was ls. per gallon. In South Australia there was a duty of 2s. per gallon. South Australia is the chief producer of olive oil, and as it supplies most of the oil required by the other States, I fail to see that there is any necessity for this duty. Therefore I shall vote in favour of the amendment.

                        <para>- I desire to draw the attention of the committee to the duty proposed upon castor oil, which, in its unrefined state, is largely used as a lubricant. I am satisfied that the Minister for Trade and Customs, in his love for everything pertaining to protection, and particularly as applied to the machinery industries, will not be prepared to place those industries at a disadvantage. Castor oil is not made in Australia, so that there is no local industry to be encouraged by the duty proposed, or to be destroyed by its reduction. The value of castor oil at the port of shipment, India, is 2s. 3d. per gallon. The import expenses amount to ls. per gallon, and Ministers propose a duty of 6d. per gallon. The <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty here proposed is equivalent to 22^ per cent., and the import expenses are equivalent to 45 per cent. The <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty proposed and the import expenses amount together to something like 68 per cent, upon the value of the article. </para>

                    <para class="block">In its unrefined state castor oil competes with mineral oils. It is well known that vegetable oils are a better lubricant for machinery than are mineral oils. But if honorable members will look at the list they will find that the duty placed on mineral oils for lubricating purposes is only 3d. per gallon. </para>

                            <para>- I do not suppose it was the intention of the Ministry, but as it stands the Tariff simply offers a premium to the Standard Oil Trust. They sell mineral oils in Australia for lubricating purposes, and under this Tariff they are given an advantage of 3d. per gallon in competition with this vegetable oil in its unrefined state. I mention this matter in the interests of a large section of the people whom I represent, who have to use lubricating oils very largely, and who prefer to use castor oil if they can get it. I will allow other members of the committee, better able to speak upon sentimental lines, to show that castor oil is really the medicine of the poor. Surely under these circumstances Ministers will not be prepared to insist upon such a high duty upon this article, seeing that it is not made in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- AVith the exception of the duty upon linseed oil these are practically revenue duties. Linseed can be grown here and linseed oil can be made here, although up to the present it has not been made to any very great extent. We have allowed lubricating mineral oils to be introduced at a lower rate because they are very largely used in connexion with all classes of machinery. The value of those oils is, of course, less than the value of the oils referred to here. These are items out of which we may expect a very reasonable amount of revenue. The honorable member for Dalley estimates the duty at 22 per cent. The rate, as given to us by experts, is about 20 per cent, on both classes of oils, and I think it can hardly be said that that is a very high rate of duty. Kerosene we propose to deal with separately, but honorable members will see from the figures supplied that under this item we expect to receive in revenue from £70,000 to £SO,000. I fail to see that any argument has been brought forward to justify a reduction of the dutv here proposed. </para>

                        (South Australia).I was going to put it to the right honorable Treasurer whether 20 per cent, is not a pretty stiff revenue duty. Castor oil is an exceedingly good lubricant. Colza oil is an illuminant ; linseed oil is another lubricating oil, and raw and boiled it is really the raw material for most mixed paints. I therefore put it to the Treasurer whether he is not asking rather too much in the duty he proposes on linseed oil. In looking at the Tariff lists of the States, I see that in nearly all of them the duty was 6d. per gallon.

This is a very expensive item indeed to the miner, and he resorts to some strange shifts at times to avoid the expense of purchasing China oil. He sometimes makes up a compound of fat for himself, which is a very poor substitute for China oil. This oil is not made here but is imported, as its name indicates, from China. </para>

                        (Dalley).- The Treasurer practically admits the correctness of my figures as regards the percentage of the duty upon castor oil, since he puts it at 20 per cent., whereas I put it at 22 per cent. The expense of importation, however, is 45 per cent. Castor oil is the most useful and effective lubricant that we have, but since the duty upon mineral oil is only 3d., that oil will compete with it unfairly.

I believe that the honorable member for Gippsland and the honorable member for Mernda have both attempted to manufacture linseed oil in Victoria under a bonus, but without success, and that at the present time neither linseed oil nor castor oil is manufactured in the Commonwealth. Therefore, it is not necessary to impose a. protective duty for the assistance or protection of a local industry. </para>

                            <para>- Personally I do not favour purely revenue duties, and although I know that the proposed duty of 6d. per gallon upon linseed affects the varnishing and painting industries, I feel that the Government must obtain money from some source. Honorable members, when they come to look into some figures which I hope to supply to them in the course of a few days, will find that both Queensland and Tasmania' require as much assistance as we can give them. Formerly, the duty upon these oils was1s. in Queensland,1s. 3d. in Tasmania, and 6d. in the other States, with the exception of New South Wales. That fact has actuated us in fixing the duties at 6d., and 3d. upon mineral oils, which are more largely used in our industries. The proposed rate is not unreasonable, and, even if it is agreed to, both Queensland and Tasmania will be affected to some extent, so that I trust that the committee will reject the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- It is all very well to talk about the revenue, but this duty has a protective incidence, and as the proposed duty upon mixed paints is 15 per cent, and1s. per cwt., the oil used in those paints will come in nearly as cheaply as pure oil. The best protection that we can give to an industry is to allow those engaged in it to obtain the materials they require as cheaply as possible. </para>

                            <para>- Colza oil is, but China oil is used almost wholly by coal miners. If it is admitted duty free, it will not make any difference to any State except New South Wales, and perhaps Victoria. The revenue could not suffer to any material extent. Although the tax is insignificant from the stand-point of the continent as a whole, still it is very severe on the miners. </para>

The information has been given by the officer on the spur of the moment. While he has a good general knowledge, he may make a mistake in regard to its use in States with which he is not so familiar as he is with Victoria. I shall ascertain the whole quantity that is imported, and see what other purposes, if any, it is used for. If I find that a very large quantity is used for the purpose the honorable member mentions, I think we might assist the coal-miners to that extent by omitting the item later on. </para>

With regard to kerosene and one or two of the items here, I am obtaining, the fullest and most reliable information I can as to the actual receipts on each line of the Tariff in each State. I have had considerable difficulty in getting information from Western Australia, the officers there being so far away, and misunderstanding what was required. I shall not have the information for perhaps a week or ten days. As soon as it is received it will be circulated, so that honorable members may be in a position to see how the revenue from each item is coming in, and we shall then deal as quickly as possible with two or three items which are postponed, such as kerosene. In the meantime, I ask the committee to deal with only " lubricating (mineral) " and " mineral n.e.i." </para>

                        <para>- I was going to make use of the very" remarks which the leader of the Opposition has addressed to the committee. I would advocate either that the article should be admitted free, or that the duty should be reduced. In Victoria the article was duty free before the Federal Tariff was introduced. The duty was taken off, I understand, in the interests of protection. The imported lubricating oil was compounded with Victorian animal oils, and I am informed that the effect of the imposition of this duty has been to take away from Victoria the trade we had in Tasmania. The railways in Tasmania always took this oil from us in the past, but will not take it now in consequence of this duty. It is a matter which might well be inquired into. I feel sure that there is information that the Treasurer has not got which might be useful to him. </para>

                        <para>- After the announcement made by the Treasurer that it is intended to put on the free list crude mineral oil, such as is used for fuel, some statement ought to be made regarding the intentions of the Government in respect to kerosene. I see no reason why mineral oil used for illuminating purposes should not be treated upon the same footing as is mineral oil intended to be used as fuel. I hope the Ministry will put kerosene on the free list and thus make a valuable concession to the people throughout the country, and particularly the farmers and miners, who have to use it as an illuminant. </para>

                        McEACHARN (Melbourne). - I would urge the Government to reduce the duty to 2d. Lubricating oils go entirely to waste, and as they are used very largely in mining and other operations, the duty should be reduced to as low a figure as possible. If the duty of 3d. per gallon is retained, it will do great injury to the industries in which it is largely used.

                        <para>- I would direct the attention of the committee to the fact that palm oil and cocoanut oil, both of which are largely used in the manufacture of soap, will, under the proposal of the Government, be taxed to the extent of 6d. per gallon, whilst other oils, n.e.i., will be required to pay only 3d. per gallon. As the Sunlight Soap Company, in Sydney, is the only company which manufactures palm and cocoanut oils, the adoption of the Government proposal will practically compel all competitors to purchase from that firm. Therefore the duty should be reduced to 3d. per gallon. </para>

                    <para class="block">My object in submitting this amendment is to destroy the composite character of the proposed duty. I would point out to the committee that under the Tariff which formerly operated in New South Wales, paints and colours were admitted free. In Victoria, where a duty was applicable to everything from white lead to paints in tins for household purposes, the system has been anything but a success. Indeed, it has been an abject failure. That the effort to encourage the manufacture of white lead has been a failure in this State, is proved by the fact that to-day it is being made only in small quantities by Messrs. Lewis and Whitty. Honorable members are also aware that the Messrs. Patterson, who claim to have discovered material upon their property suitable for the making of paints and colours, received a subsidy from the Victorian Government. Despite this encouragement, however, the industry has collapsed, and the Government has seized the machinery. The imposition of the proposed duty upon anti-fouling and anti-corrosive paints, which are used for painting the bottoms of ships, will directly affect the employment of several thousand men. </para>

                            <para>- No, the paints are found for them. But the point is that in Eastern ports, where labour is cheap, these paints are admitted free. The result of the imposition of the proposed duty will be that ships will not undergo repairs within the Commonwealth, but will proceed to Eastern countries and be docked there. If the Minister for Trade and Customs is not prepared to concede all that I ask, I hope that he will consent to the payment of a drawback upon anti-fouling and anti-corrosive paints when they are used in connexion with shipping. Australia does not produce either white lead or colours, and I would point out that upon the poorer classes of paints, which cost 10s. per cwt., the proposed composite duty would work out at about 38s. 6d. </para>

                        <para>- I would strongly urge the Government to discard the composite duty, although I cannot go the length proposed by the honorable member for Dalley, because I know that those who are chiefly interested in this matter would be satisfied with the Victorian duty of 2s. and 4s. per cwt. I would point out to the Minister that steamers like the <inline font-style="italic">Kalgoorlie</inline> have to be docked every six months. To paint the vessel I have mentioned absorbs 14½ cwt. of material, which costs £78 18s. 7d. Under the Tariff which formerly operated in Victoria the duty upon that material was £2 18s.; but under the present Tariff it represents no less a sum than £1211s. 3d. </para>

                            <para>- The composition to which I refer is used very considerably in painting all ships that are docked here. In the case of anti-corrosive composition - I am referring entirely to paints that are not manufactured here - the old Victorian duty was 4s. per cwt. The present duty is 14s. 6d. per cwt., an increase of 10s. 6d. per cwt. On anti-fouling composition there is an increase of18s. 6d. per cwt., the proposed duty being £1 2s. 6d. per cwt., as against the former duty of 4s. per cwt. On water-line composition the duty is £111s., as against 4s. under the old Tariff, an increase of £1 7s. per cwt. Let me say in dealing with these particular items that, if these enormous increases of duty are imposed, steamers will not be docked and painted here. Therefore, while the States themselves are spending money in providing largely increased docking accommodation, the Federal Government will be doing what they can to drive away from our ports ships requiring to be painted and repaired. I think therefore that I have made out a very good case. </para>

                            <para>- I ann not advocating the reduction of. the duty to ls. per cwt. If I have anything to bring forward I endeavour always to put it before the committee fairly. I do not advocate a reduction to ls. per cwt., because those interested would he perfectly satisfied if a duty were imposed similar to that which prevailed under the Victorian Tariff. The majority of the articles on which this heavy duty is to be collected are used in the manufacture of paints. Take white lead, for example, which is not made here. </para>

So far its manufacture is not on the market, and past experience of white lead manufacture in the various colonies does not induce any hope of its success. </para>

Quite apart from the fact that a composite duty is objectionable - and I said at the outset that I should vote against composite duties - I would urge the Government to do away with it, and fix a duty that will be acceptable to all parties concerned. The Government have before them the example of the rate under the old Victorian Tariff, which was 2s. and 4s. per cwt. </para>

                        <para>- The proposal as I understand it is simply to have a fixed duty of ls. per cwt. on these articles. It has been pointed out that some of the paints embraced by this item are of very great value, but the Government worked on an average of about 30s. per cwt. A fixed duty of ls. per cwt. upon that value would be about 3 per cent., and the addition of 15 per cent. <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> makes an average duty of IS per cent. We certainly think that an average duty of 18 per cent, is not unreasonable on articles such as these. If we were to take off the fixed duty of ls. per cwt, and leave the impost at 15 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad</inline><inline font-style="italic">valorem,</inline> the duty would still be very heavy on the class of paints to which the honorable member for Melbourne refers. The fixed duty of ls. therefore makes practically no difference. The proposal to have only a dutv of ls. per cwt. is something to which we cannot agree. If we fixed only an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of 15 or 20 per cent, the impost would still be high on the class of paints referred to by the honorable member for Melbourne. Such a course would not get over the difficulty suggested by him. Seeing the way in which the prices of these goods vary, it. seems to me that this is one of the class of articles to which we may very fairly apply a composite duty. At the same time I do not want to do anything that would drive work away from any of the States. We must oppose the amendment, but any other reasonable suggestion might be considered by us. </para>

                        duty. Reasons had been given by various speakers why this should be done, and I suggested that the Government should be satisfied with a specific duty. Under the old Victorian Tariff, the duty was 2s. per cwt.

                            <para>- So far as New South Wales is concerned, I would point out that the paints referred to by the honorable member for Melbourne, are used only for j the painting of ships. They are patent I preparations, and are very expensive. The ; composite duty proposed by the Govern ment would make their use prohibitive, and j the result would be that ships that are now I docked in Sydney for the purpose of being repaired, would have their work done in other ports. These patent compositions are not made in the Commonwealth ; they are admitted free into eastern ports, and vessels trading between Australia and the East would have their painting work done in those ports. The result would be that so far as my electorate is concerned, from 500 to 600 men would be thrown out of employment. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The cost of the paint would be increased by this duty to such an extent as to become almost prohibitive. It has to be remembered that paints of all descriptions have hitherto been admitted free into New South Wales. I ask the committee not to impose the duty proposed by the Government. There is no established paint-making industry in Victoria. Messrs. Patterson Bros., who were subsidized by the Victorian Government, failed in their efforts, and the Government had to take over the machinery on which they had a mortgage. </para>

                            <para>- The only local manufacturers of white lead in any quantity are Lewis and Whitty. The difficulty in regard to this composite duty is that many firms import paints which, although of exactly the same name, have different values, and the authorities will not be able to gauge accurately the values of the various paints presented to them. On behalf not only of the industry to which I have referred, but of the building trade, which uses paints and colours very largely, I urge the Treasurer to consider the desirability of agreeing to a reduction of this heavy duty. Apparently he is willing to meet the proposal made by the honorable member for Melbourne, and the object which that honorable member wishes to attain can only be secured by the imposition of a fixed duty. Whether that duty shall be ls., 2s., or even 2s. 6d. per cwt. is a matter for the committee to determine. I would sooner see a fixed duty of even 2s. per cwt. than a composite - a fixed and an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> - duty. </para>

                            <para>- Under the old Victorian Tariff there was a duty of 40s. per ton on paint ground in oil, and 80s. per ton on paint ready for use, or 2s. and 4s. per cwt. respectively. In Queensland they do not appear to have differentiated between the two, but they imposed an all-round duty of 3s. per cwt. In South Australia there were duties of 3s. and 4s. per cwt. collected probably on the same lines as were the duties under the old Victorian Tariff. In Tasmania there was a duty of ½d. per lb. which would be equal to 4s. 8d. per cwt., while New South Wales admitted these paints free. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; but does my honorable friend mean to tell the committee that the effect of this duty of 8 per cent, on the average will be to throw some 600 men out of work ? I am afraid that he must be drawing on his imagination to some small extent when he makes that statement. I do not think that the rate of duty proposed here, or any alteration of it which may be made, would have the effect of sending out of the States the work to which reference has been made. I admit that there is some force in the arguments which have been used, and I shall be glad if possible to meet the wishes of the committee in the matter. If we are to make any alteration at all it should be on the lines of a fixed duty. I think, perhaps, there may be a good deal of difficulty in arriving at the value of some of these articles, but we should differentiate between partly prepared and wholly prepared paints. We might fairly meet the difficulty by having a fixed duty, as there appears to be a feeling in the committee that importers and manufacturers would prefer that to an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty. We might, under these circumstances, accept the basis adopted in Victoria and South Australia, and agree to a duty of 2s. per cwt. on paints ground, in liquid, and 4s. per cwt. on paints ready for use. I think that might be considered a fair compromise. </para>

The mistake was that the Victorian Government did not satisfy themselves that the necessary pigments were there before they gave a subsidy for the manufacture of the paint.

                        <para>- They have the machinery because they put their money on the wrong horse to begin with. I am sure they will not repeat such an experiment. That is the explanation of Patterson Brothers' failure, but there are others in the State who have produced these paints, and they are being produced here at the present time in large quantities. I wish to direct special attention to the serious way in which we have handicapped paint manufacturers already, by the revenue duties we have imposed upon linseed oil and methylated spirits, which are very largely used as raw materials in the manufacture of paint. The duties we have imposed upon the raw material in the case of this industry reduce, almost to vanishing point* the protection afforded by a duty of even 4s. per cwt. If we are going to raise revenue upon the raw materials of this industry, surely it is only fair to give its production some substantial protection. I appeal to honorable members not to ruthlessly destroy this industry, which is finding employment for a large number of men at excellent wages. The work is scientific and skilled work, and the wages paid in the industry range from £6 to <inline font-style="italic">£3</inline> 3s. per week, while boys are paid from 30s. to <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> per week. The industry employs a large number of men, and those engaged in it have entered into large monetary obligations in the establishment of the necessary plant. </para>

                            <para>- I can give the honorable member the exact figures for one firm, which will prove that it is not an insignificant industry. I do not hold with the theory that if an industry employs only two men and a boy it is not worthy of consideration. If it employs only half a man, and he has an interest in it, we have no right to destroy his interest. The honorable member for Dalley has been lamenting that this proposal may lead to some 600 men being thrown out of work. That is all a myth. There is no likelihood of any such thing taking place. A duty of ls. per cwt. upon paints that cost from 12s. to 29 a </para>

                    <para class="block">SOs. per cwt. is not going to make the slightest difference in contracts for the painting of ships. Such a duty is trifling and insignificant when estimated upon the price of the paint. It must be remembered that we are able to produce all the paint required, and can enlarge the output to meet all demands made. I therefore ask the committee not to be influenced by any suggestion that the imposition of such a duty is likely to throw men out of employment. The only likelihood of men being thrown out of employment in this connexion would arise from the injury which might be done by refusing the very moderate protection asked to enable those who have invested largely in this industry, and who turn out an article which gives the utmost satisfaction to all who use it, to continue the production of that article. I hope that the Government proposal will be "maintained, and failing that, that there will be an emphatically protectionist duty imposed. Revenue without destruction should be our motto again in this case, and- we may do serious injury to a large and promising industry unless we can give liberal terras under this head, seeing that we have already taxed those engaged in it to the utmost limit upon the raw materials which they use. If we are going to do justice we must compensate those engaged in this industry for that heavy taxation. </para>

                            <para>- For the reason that we have to protect other industries as well, and the whole thing hangs together. If we are going to have a patchwork in the Tariff, with a free-trade page here, and a protectionist page there, it will be very mixed up by the time we have done with it. We have imposed duties upon raw materials of this industry for the purpose of protecting the local industries established for the production of those raw materials, and to be consistent we should now insist as far as we can upon a reasonable protection for this industry. The Government proposals in their original form are no more than adequate to meet the case. We may have to accept a proposal, making a differentiating duty of 2s. and 4s. per cwt., but I would prefer the original proposal. </para>

                        <para>- I congratulate the honorable member for Southern Melbourne upon his speech to-night. I am afraid that he knows no more about this subject than other honorable gentlemen do. At any rate, his speech was not very enlightening. He got np to demolish the arguments of the honorable member for Dalley, but what he said confirmed the honorable member's statements in regard to the efforts of the Victorian Government to galvanize into activity the business of Messrs. Patterson Bios. Some time ago we heard that the Victorian Government has a beet sugar plant on their hands, and now we find that they possess paint-making machinery as well. I wonder that they do not hold an auction, and get rid of some of their machinery. The honorable member for Southern Melbourne told us that the paint-making industry could not be established here because the necessary ingredients for making the paint are not to be obtained in the State. If that be so, what an idiotic thing it was for the Victorian Government to pour out its money in the attempt to establish the industry here ! It shows the length to which the protectionist policy and the hungering, unintelligent desire to establish impossible industries will drive people. The honorable member asks for a high duty upon paint, because we have put high duties, which he voted for, upon the raw materials, and he says that unless these high duties are imposed scores of men and boys will be thrown out of employment. How many men and boys are employed in the industry he does not tell us. The Government estimate to obtain about £27,000 a year from the duties upon paint, and I believe that if that money, which we are taking out of the pockets of those who use paint, was distributed amongst those who are employed in the paint-making: industry, it would give them all very handsome pensions. As against the few persons, who are employed in the manufacture of paints, there are thousands of persons in the great industrial centres of New South Wales who use paint. From the revenue point of view New South Wales will have to stand the brunt of any reduction of these duties. </para>

We have reached a period when the boys and girls must have work provided for them. At one time the only employment for women was to find some one to marry them, but now they are becoming self-reliant, and competing with the men, and they are entitled to the same protection, and to the protection of the men as well. The leader of the Opposition must have worked and struggled as a boy in order to get where he is. I hope that the committee will accept the proposal of the Treasurer, and save further debate. </para>

Why should the thousands of boys who are painters have to carry an iniquitous load of taxation because two or three misguided parents have put a few unhappy boys into some unhealthy shanty in some crowded slum near Melbourne?

                        <para>- I hope that the honorable member for Dalley will withdraw his amendment. We have agreed- - I was opposed to it - to put a tax on the raw material used in making paint. If we are going to pursue any policy at all we must pursue a policy of justice. Here is an industry employing a number of hands, and if we tax the material those engaged in it use, it seems to me that as a matter of justice, we should tax the goods coming in to compete with their manufactures. For that reason I hope that the honorable member for Dalley will withdraw his amendment, and let us accept the Government's new proposal. That is not so good as it ought to be, but it seems to be a fair compromise. </para>

                        (Werriwa).- The honorable member for Tasmania made an appeal on behalf of certain boys, who, he said, are employed in this industry. During the last fifteen years, the number employed in all the factories in Victoria has increased to the extent of 2,500, so that out of every 8,000 boys coming to the age of, say 21 years, only from 160 to 170 a year have been able to find employment in factories. For the sake of that number, we are asked to impose taxes, diverting many thousands of pounds per annum from the pockets of the people. The country could afford to give every one of these new hands a couple of thousand a year each. Surely in the face of the figures I have quoted, honorable members will not argue that large industries are springing up every week, and giving employment to a large number of persons. The first thing that the committee has to do is to strike out the composite duty. We have not the responsibility of framing the Tariff, and we only accept a duty of this kind when it is forced upon us.

                        (Dalley).- Out of deference to the general wish of the committee, it is my intention directly to ask leave to withdraw my amendment, but I wish to place on record the fact that this duty will materially affect about 600 men in my electorate. It has been the custom, when an amendment has been moved affecting so many men, whether there was a possibility of winning or not, to go to a vote. I do not intend to press for a vote. I see that the Government are prepared to abolish the 15 per cent,
                        <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline>
                        duty, and, in its place, to propose a duty which is not so bad as their original proposal, though not quite so good as I should like to see. As this side cannot take any responsibility for the Tariff, and as it has always been my endeavour to assist the Government in the interests of the general welfare of the Commonwealth, I ask leave, with great regret, to withdraw my amendment.

                        <para>- I do not rise to oppose the amendment, but to express gratification that the Government have decided to amend their original proposal in such a form that it will be much improved. I wish to draw the attention of the committee to the singular fact that this amendment is exactly identical with the suggestion that has been made by those engaged in the hardware trade. Whilst it is very gratifying that the item should be improved in this way, it shows how much the Government are controlled by the manufacturers. It would not have mattered how much the committee had discussed the question, but, merely because a suggestion is sent along - at any rate, it is very singular that it comes in this way - it is immediately adopted by the Government. </para>

                            <para>- I thought there was a general consensus of opinion after the Opposition and the Government had. given way upon their respective proposals, that my suggestion should be accepted without a division. It is hardly treating us fairly to now move a further amendment. This has occurred on several occasions when I have endeavoured to meet what appeared to be the wish of the committee with regard to the rates of duty to be imposed. </para>

I do not wish honorable members opposite to think that they are receiving any favours from us. When I find that any of our proposals is likely to inflict injustice, I am only too anxious to make any reasonable amendments. I care not whether my honorable friends look upon that as a gift or as something to which they are entitled. We have discussed this item for a considerable time ; and as the consensus of opinion was that the offer I made should be accepted, I do not think that we are being treated fairly. </para>

We have been discussing oils of various descriptions all the evening, and the right honorable gentleman has never suggested a compromise, except at the instance of some honorable member on the Government side of the chamber. If the Government would meet us half way in regard to all these matters we should be delighted, and I do not know that we should fight the Tariff any further. Tonight we have been endeavouring to effect a compromise with reference to the duties proposed upon oils, but we have not been able to obtain any concession from the Government. It is only because the compromises that have been suggested have been so one-sided that we feel constrained to press our point whenever we have an opportunity.

                            <para>- Upon the value of the article I admit that the proposed dutv is somewhat high. In view of the fact that we are imposing a tax of only ls. per cwt. upon putty which includes a certain quantity of oil, it might be wise perhaps not to go to the extent proposed by the honorable member for Cowper. I would suggest to him that he should be content to accept a duty of 6d. per cwt. upon whiting, which would probably be a fair amount, considering its value. </para>

                        <para>- I would point out that <inline font-style="italic">£'i</inline> 2s. 6d. per ton is the value of whiting within the Commonwealth. That is the price quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">journal qf Commerce.</inline> But that amount does not represent the value upon which we : calculate the rate of duty. The rate of duty is calculated upon the value at the port of shipment. In this connexion honorable member's must recognise that it costs at least <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> per- ton to bring whiting to our market. That charge, in itself, represents a natural protection of 50 per cent. I do not doubt the accuracy of what has been stated in regard to its manufacture in New South Wales, but I would ask if the industry did not arise under free-trade conditions ? </para>

                            <para>- It is not " sufficiently established," as the Minister for Trade and Customs would say. We know that the right honorable gentleman recently advanced the doctrine that an industry ought to be " sufficiently established " before it was entitled to the benefit of a protective duty. Honorable members should recollect that whiting is used within the Commonwealth for a great many manufacturing purposes, such as the production of carbonic acid gas, &amp;c. Therefore, we ought to consider whether it is wise to levy a tax upon it, seeing that it already enjoys a natural protection of 50 per cent. </para>

                        (Werriwa). - I ask the honorable member for Cowper to withdraw the amendment. The course which he has taken is a departure from the rule which has hitherto been followed that private members must not introduce increases in the Tariff save through the medium of Ministers. Even from a constitutional stand-point it is not a good thing that they should be allowed to do so. If any proposal of this kind is to be submitted it should be submitted through the Ministry. That is the only way in which the committee should be called upon to consider any increased duty. The arguments advanced by the honorable member for North Sydney are sufficiently strong in themselves to warrant the committee in opposing the imposition of this duty. It is clear that the industry has been carried on in New South Wales without the artificial aid of a duty, and if we are going to increase the price of whiting may we not be imposing still further disabilities upon those who manufacture paints, seeing that whiting constitutes one of their raw materials.

I can only regret that the Ministry have not shown sufficient care to discover it for themselves. It is a novel situation that representatives from New South Wales have to supply information relating to important industries in that State, which employ hundreds of hands, whilst every small concern within a radius of five miles of Melbourne has several honorable members keen to proclaim its great importance and the pressing necessity which exists for giving it the advantage of a protective duty. This is the one conspicuous matter which the honorable member for Cowper has brought before the House during the present prolonged session, and I congratulate him upon it.

                        (North Sydney).- This proposal has been put forward again as a compromise, and the Treasurer took a great, deal of credit for offering the Opposition a compromise on the last item. That compromise was, however, the rate of duty fixed under the old Victorian Tariff.

                            <para>- Yes ; but the right honorable gentleman was quite indignant that we did not jump at it as a very reasonable thing. What is the compromise offered on this occasion ? It is proposed to impose a duty of 2s. a gallon on varnishes. That was the duty under the old Victorian Tariff. In the other States where there were fixed duties, there were imposts of 6d. and1s. 6d. a gallon ; yet we are asked to accept the offer of the Government as a compromise. If we are going to accept the high level of protection represented by the old Victorian Tariff, we on this side of the committee might just as well give away the whole free-trade side of the question. Another point is that the manufacturers themselves are willing to accept a duty of 1s. 6d. per gallon. </para>

                        <para>Numerous objections were made to the duty of 2s. per gallon on varnish by witnesses in various trades. Painters and decorators wished for a reduction on the ground that it was a hindrance to their business. They use, they say, Victorian made varnish for some purposes, but not for the best descriptions of work. Requests for a reduction or abolition of the duty were also made <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> agricultural implement and carriage-makers, and a cartridge manufacturer. The carriage-builders and cartridge-makers do not use Victorian varnish, which they state is not suitable for their purposes, and they consider that the duty is detrimental to their industries. The quality of Victorian varnish was said by most of the witnesses to be inferior to that of imported and unsuitable for many kinds of work, bub this was denied by the principal manufacturer, who affirmed that the adverse opinions expressed were due to prejudice, and that he manufactures various qualities of varnish ranging in price from 4s. 3d. to 21s. per gallon. He ascribed some inferiority in his varnish to his inability to obtain sufficiently good imported linseed oil, and hoped that a superior oil would soon be manufactured in the colony. He would not at present ask for a higher duty on varnish, bub said he would be pleased if the rate were increased from 2s. to 2s. 6d. per gallon. The industry is not extensive : the largest factory employed but eight hands in this work, and we could only hear of two makers. We were told that the manufacture is very simple, employing little labour, and this appears to be borne out by the figures before us. In one factory eight hands made nearly 12,000 gallons in a year, and, as the annual consumption of the colony is about 40,000 gallons, aboub 27 bands could at the same rate make sufficient for our internal trade. It is not probable that the trade could spread beyond the limits of Victoria, as long as a heavy duty remains on linseed oil, which is one of the principal ingredients used in the manufacture. The price of varnish ranges from 5s. per gallon to 28s. per gallon ; a duty of 2s. per gallon, therefore, equals 40 per cent, on the lowest class, and 7 per cent, on. the best descriptions. The average rate, according to the Customs returns, is approximately 22½ per cent. </para>

                        <para class="block">The honorable member for Melbourne Ports is seeking to impose upon the .Commonwealth a duty on varnish very much higher than that borne under several of the old Tariffs. In New South Wales this article was admitted free. In Queensland there was a duty of 25 per cent. ; in South Australia 6d. pei gallon ; and in Tasmania ls. 6d. per gallon. It will thus be seen that the Government proposal is no compromise. It is seeking to enforce upon us the high duty which prevailed in Victoria, where an inferior article which is not suitable for the requirements of the trade is produced. Even if the duty be imposed it will not be the means of producing a better class of varnish, because it appears that the manufacturer is not able to make it. We shall find that an import duty of 2s. per gallon will amount to something like £3,000 a year, while the wages of the men employed in the local industry, assuming that they receive £100 a year each, would not exceed £2,700 per annum. Therefore, the people will actually be required to pay a duty in excess of the full amount of wages earned in the manufacture of this article. I shall support the amendment. </para>

Surely there is some truth in that statement, and it is not made merely with a view to cheat members of the committee into agreeing to a lower rate of duty than would otherwise be imposed upon this article. The proposal of the honorable member for North Sydney is that there should be a duty of ls. 6d. per gallon, and that would be equal to 17 J per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline> So that the Trades Hall representatives seem to suggest an absolutely lower duty than that suggested by the honorable member.

                            <para>- Perhaps this is one of the deputations the Minister would not receive. However, the point is that they were willing to make a communication of this sort, and it shows that they are willing to have a lower rate of duty than the honorable member for North Sydney has proposed. The circular states that the coachbuilders represented to the Commissioner of Customs that there should be a duty of 10 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> or as an alternative, ls. per gallon. The honorable member for North Sydney is asking for a duty of ls. 6d. per gallon. It is also pointed out that the composite Tariff rate now abandoned by Ministers was equal to 28 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> while the old Victorian Tariff rate was equal to 22J per cent, <inline font-style="italic">vd valorem,</inline> so that there was not very much difference between the 2s. rate and the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> incidence of the composite rate. I think the honorable member for North Sydney ought to be supported in the amendment he proposes, which is equivalent to a duty of 17-J per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad</inline><inline font-style="italic">valorem.</inline></para>

                        (Melbourne Ports). - I wish to correct the statement that the Trades Hall asked for a duty lower than the Government proposed. The Trades Hall deputation who waited upon an officer of customs, asked for nothing of the kind. The Trades Hall would support the proposal of the Government, because they recognise that varnish of the very best quality can be, and is being, 'produced here, and is being used by some of the leading coach builders. The honorable member for Robertson has quoted from a report which be has been told several times is se\ en years old. The Legislative Assembly of Victoria placed their Tariff on the statute-book after that report had been presented. That has also been stated times out of number, and yet the report is continually being read as though it were something new, and as though it were a discovery to which honorable members should attach great weight.

                            <para>- We have listened to it repeatedly, and the Victorian Assembly deliberated for five months upon the Tariff proposals in connexion with which that report was presented. Seeing that the Victorian Tariff was framed after the presentation of that report, it is plain that the people of Victoria, through their representatives, did not place the slightest reliance I upon it. It was recognised as a free-trader's I report. My honorable friends opposite may j laugh, but the protectionists on the com- J mission presented a minority report, which the honorable member for Robertson has not referred to, because it did not suit him. </para>

The composite duties have been abandoned, and we ask the committee to accept a duty of 2s. per gallon, the rate fixed in connexion with other similar items of manufacture. We have agreed to a duty of 4s. in some cases and 2s. in others, and we propose the lower duty in connexion with these varnishes. I hope the committee will not yield to the solicitations of honorable members opposite. </para>

                        (South Australia).Seeing that this article is the raw material of a number of tradesmen, the honorable member for Melbourne Ports ought to be satisfied with a duty of less than 20 per cent, upon it. I presume that the coach builders are as good an authority on this subject as the honorable member, and they say that while a large quantity of varnish is made in Victoria, the high class and more expensive varnishes are not made here, and this duty is high upon the low-class varnishes produced. There is a very large body of men interested in getting varnishes at a reasonably cheap rate. I remind honorable members that we have agreed to a duty of 15 per cent, upon a great deal of agricultural machinery, and to a similar duty upon woollens, and yet we are here being asked to put a duty of 20 per cent, upon a raw material, which is used by thousands of men all over the Commonwealth who are outside the coachbuilding trade altogether. Men who make a living by painting and decorating houses, and who purchase their own materials, will, if this duty is carried, have to pay the extra amount upon varnishes they purchase. Although I appreciate the reduction which the Treasurer has suggested, the duty is still beyond the average duty imposed before the Commonwealth duty was in existence. We are being asked to adopt the Victorian duty, equivalent to 20 per cent., which was the highest duty imposed in the States. If we had a duty of ls. 6d. imposed it would be equivalent to an

                        of 17 J per cent., and that should give a fair amount of protection in this instance. Coachbuilders are asking for a duty of ls. per gallon, and I think that would be a very fair duty.

                        (East Sydney).- The honorable member for Melbourne Ports seems to be taking charge of the Ministerial business, and he has now got to the length of speaking about what " we propose " and " we submit." It gives some support to a rumour that the honorable member is acting as the dry nurse of the Government in dealing with this Tariff. Might I suggest to the honorable member when he is so impatient about the reading of a document some years old, that a. much more recent document issued by the Government throws a very strong light upon the item before the committee. The Government are proposing for us the highest duty in connexion with this article which existed before federation, and that is the Victorian duty. The people of Australia were told by the Prime Minister, speaking for the whole of the Government, at Maitland, that the Victorian Tariff would not be the model taken by the Government for their Tariff, and was in fact the very last one that would be taken, because the right honorable gentleman regarded it as an extreme protectionist Tariff. He said that the aim of the Government would be to frame a Tariff which would be a happy medium between the two extremes of free-trade in New South Wales and the high Tariff in Victoria. Yet here we find the Treasurer and his colleague bringing this maximum Australian duty forward as if they were making a very graceful surrender of their position. It seems to me that the proposal made by the honorable member for North Sydney is a perfectly reasonable one, and might very well have been accepted. I admit that the Government have now made a much better proposal than the one which was the result of a great deal of deliberation. Are we now to 'suppose that as the Government have steadily given up these composite duties one after another, they have determined not to force that principle upon the committee in connexion with the Tariff?

                            <para>- Then I congratulate the cigar people upon their success, but it only strengthens the force of my observation. The Government have adhered to the composite duty in one case, and have given it up in other cases, and I wish to know if there is to be any consistency. Surely the principle is a good one or a bad one ? If it is a good one why not adopt it right through, or, at any rate, to the extent which the Government originally proposed ? However, as there is still a doubt, we are not yet in a position to assure the people of Australia that the Government have given up these composite duties. When the rabid Minister for Trade arid Customs was in a position in the most misgoverned  State in Australia - South Australia - which he has desperately, but unsuccessfully, attempted to occupy here, the duty on varnishes, varnish stains, and enamels was only 6d. per gallon, and the duty on things like petrifying  liquids and dampwall compositions, 10 per cent. Yet we are told that a duty of 2s. per gallon is a triumph of moderation. The varnish industry in Victoria began in 1854.-, so that it has been in existence for 48 years, and it now employs two men, three boys, one traveller and clerk, and a carter and handy man - in all seven persons. £10 a week are divided between those seven persons in wages, and while the proprietor of the factory was well off when he started, he has lost everything in the enterprise, which now practically belongs to a wholesale grocer. In addition to the factory he manages an adjoining hotel. The factory is a dilapidated shanty, but the hotel is going strong. He sells his varnishes considerably below the prices charged by other people, because of their poor quality. Is the Treasurer proud of a composite undertaking of that sort ? I submit that the proposal of the honorable member for North Sydney is thoroughly reasonable, and while I do not wish to see unnecessary divisions, I think that, by way of protest, we should place upon record our desire to carry out the Maitland programme in this matter. It was only because of that programme that the life of the Ministry was possible. It was there promised that there would be a fair compromise between the exorbitant Victorian Tariff, which produced the monstrosity to which I have just referred, and the free-trade policy of New South Wales, and I ask Victorians, who are enjoying the advantages of federal union, to help us in securing the performance of the promise made at Maitland. We are fighting the battle of the manufacturers now - the battle of the thousands who use paints and varnishes, against this one man who runs a hotel and grocery store in conjunction with a varnish factory. Surely a duty of 17^ per cent, ought to be sufficient protection when added to the expenses of importation. </para>

                        <para>- A statement has been made from time to time about what the Trades Hall representatives on a deputation recommended, and it appears to find favour only on this occasion. As to this item, two members of that deputation, members of the Trades Hall Council, and representing a union, did recommend a duty lower than that which the Government proposed, but in every other case they recommended a duty either as high as that which the Government proposed, or higher. Of course, in the latter instances, our honorable friends on the other side ignore any proposal which was made by any such deputation for any increase, and assume that they were nobodies. I was surprised when I heard that any member of the deputation referred to had recommended a decrease, and the gentleman to whom I wrote for information told me that it had been introduced by myself and another member of the House, and that I would find a report of the proceedings in a certain newspaper, which I did. My impression was that they did not object to the Victorian duty being imposed on this particular line. Honorable members on the other side unwittingly, I believe, assume that this is the Victorian duty. Under the Victorian Tariff the duty on methylated spirits was only ls. per gallon. The honorable and learned member for Werriwa, who professes to have a great knowledge of chemistry, will know that methylated spirits, as well as linseed oil, enter largely into the composition of varnish. </para>

                        <para>- In Victoria the duty was less than it is now. I believe we have carried a duty of 3s. per gallon on methylated spirits, and the excise duty is 6d. per gallon. I trust that the committee will reject the amendment of the honorable member for North Sydney. I am prepared to vote for a duty of 2s. per gallon all round, but if we do not get that, I intend to ask the committee to make a separate line of "lithographic varnish." In the manufacture of this varnish, the linseed oil has to be burnt, and as it takes nine gallons of oil to make eight gallons of varnish, honorable members will see that it will make the manufacturer's position considerably worse. J have here a price-list from a reputable English firm, showing that the price of lithographic varnish varies from 6s. 9d. to 10s. 6d. per gallon. </para>

I have read the evidence, as possibly the Treasurer has done. The manufacturer, whose name I cannot call to memory, gave evidence, also many consumers, whose names are there given. When I sent to the library for the report, I was told that the only two copies they had are in the Chamber. They are not on this side, and as the Treasurer and the Minister for Trade and Customs have repeatedly quoted from the report, which they will not allow me to do- </para>

                            <para>- I was under the impression that it had been quoted, but I must accept the Minister's disclaimer. My copy is in the hands of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, otherwise I should be able to read the minority report which does not affect the varnish trade whatever. The Treasurer was in a state of great indignation just now, because we would not . mention names. I never mention names if I can help doing so. In most cases I can help myself, and I do not give the names. But as he wishes to know what the names are, I would refer him to that report, which is voluminous. A great number of manufacturers in all trades gave evidence, to the effect that the varnish was not suitable to their manufactures, and without exception it was admitted, even by the manufacturer himself, that he could not produce a varnish suitable to their requirements. So that all that has been brought out by the leader of the Opposition, and supported by his followers, is borne out by the evidence given before the Tariff Commission. The Government should propose a reasonable compromise between the Victorian duty and the low duty in South Australia or Tasmania, and should not force on the Commonwealth once again the high Victorian tariff that has been, I suppose, an absolute failure. The leader of the Opposition stated that there were seven men and one or two boys employed in the industry. The commission stated that there were but eight hands employed, and that they could hear of only two men being engaged in the industry. All that has been contended has been proved, and I hope that Ministers will show some consideration for the people of Australia, and fix a duty that will be acceptable to the Opposition. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the strictures passed by the Treasurer upon me and other members of the Opposition were entirely undeserved. If there is any personal character given to our consideration of these items it arises from what I have always considered a most regrettable fact - that when there is an attempt to fasten burdens on the people, the names of certain manufacturers in Melbourne are quoted on the other side of the Chamber. Their names are brought in here not for the purpose of relieving the people from burdens, but for the purpose of taking money out of . their pockets. If any personal tone has been introduced, or if references have been made to manufacturers, it has arisen mainly from the fact that a large number of objectionable propositions have been passed through the committee, by the use of the names of individuals as being embarked in a certain industry. It is our duty on this side, as against this onslaught on the public on behalf of individuals, to endeavour as far as we can, to protect the great mass of the people from these burdens. The great mass of the men who use this varnish, and upon whom this proposal comes as a tax, have no medals to show, but they are men who pay their way, carry on a lawful calling, and vastly outnumber the men for whom the Government are standing up. We have not had handed to us a list of medals gained by. individual manufacturers. The Government are in that position. They are in close communication with the manufacturer, and the moment some reference is made to his industry, and the fortunes of his enterprise, as bearing on this item, they have such admirable information about all these items that a Minister of the Crown is able to jump up at once to tell the committee where he won his medals, and what he won them for. The men who make varnish have opportunities of communication with the Cabinet, which the great mass of the men who have to pay this duty have not. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that it is not fair. I was not aware that the officer was accessible to honorable members. But still I would point out to Ministers that even then we have no time to inquire into the accuracy of the information we get suddenly, while an item is before the committee. If Ministers would lay upon the table the papers containing the information which they have - not confidential information, but that which can be made public - it would help us very much. Not having the facilities which the Government possess we have to take all the information we can get, so long as we satisfy ourselves that the source from which it comes is a reliable one, and I generally take care to do that. The Treasurer makes a very sad mistake when he suggests that it is a proper thing for us, even when we illustrate our argument by reference to particular industries, to drag the names of individuals before the committee. I think it is an improper thing to do. I might be tempted to do it if my statements would help the man, but I would not drag in his name if I were saying something calculated to injure him. As I was saying what might have that tendency, I was doubly careful not to give a clue to the name of the individual concerned. Someone must be here to look after the interests of the nameless thousands who use this article. It is perfectly evident that whenever any individual Victorian manufacturer is concerned, he can make sure of a protective duty, but any appeals made on behalf of the thousands of people in other States who have had the advantage of freedom from taxation, are disregarded. Surely this proposal is moderate and reasonable enough, even from the protectionists' point of view. The Victorian manufacturer, now that he has the whole of the Australian markets open to him, should be content with less protection than he has hitherto enjoyed. A duty of ls. 6d. per gallon should afford to the Victorian manufacturer of varnish more real protection than did a 2s. duty under the Victorian Tariff with the markets of the other States locked against him. I am disappointed that the Government have not given up these composite duties altogether, because they will only serve to keep up a bitter conflict to the end of the Tariff. I am glad that the Government have abandoned the composite duty in this case, but I could not sit and. listen to the attack made upon the honorable member for North Sydney, as if he were proposing something of a revolutionary character. South Australia has hitherto imposed only a moderate duty upon varnishes, and Tasmania has levied duties ranging from only 10 to 15 per cent. - chiefly 10 per cent. I wish to discourage useless divisions as far as possible, but this is a matter of sufficient importance to justify us in taking a vote upon it. </para>

                        <para>- One article included in this item is lithographic varnish, which is really a reducing fluid used by lithographers. We have already placed upon the free list the tools of trade used by printers, and I notice that artists' colours and ultramarine blue are among the special exemptions. It seems to me that there is no real consistency in placing one article in the dutiable list, and others in the free list. </para>

I think that before we impose a duty upon an article which enters into consumption to such a small extent, the committee should be informed as to the number of people engaged in making it. </para>

                            <para>- Surely the Treasurer would not ask us to impose a special duty upon lithographic varnish, because those engaged in making it are employed in its production for about one week in the year. A number of the articles used by printers, which have already been placed on the free list, would be made here if sufficient encouragement were offered. I could name a great number of articles used by printers that could be made here much more readily than could lithographic varnish. As the honorable member for Yarra has made a special point of protecting the varnish making industry, I do not propose that lithographers' varnish should be placed among the special exemptions, but the committee should be supplied with some information as to the number of persons engaged in making it before being asked to agree to the duty. </para>

                        (East Sydney). - I omitted to make one statement which I think it is only fair to place before the committee. I referred to a manufacturer in Melbourne, and the very adverse conditions under which he laboured. I now have great pleasure in stating that the son of this manufacturer started a varnish factory in Sydney some few years ago, and that he employs two or three times the number of hands that are employed by his father, and pays away twice the amount of wages per week. I believe in encouraging enterprises of this sort as much as I can, and when I was at the head of the New South Wales Government I gave directions that when an article was made within the State, the manufacturer should have an opportunity of tendering for that one article apart from any others that might be required at the same time. I hope the Commonwealth Government will adopt a similar practice. In this particular case I made it possible for the manufacturer to obtain Government contracts by tendering for the supply of the one commodity produced by him. I also omitted to mention another large varnish factory in one of the suburbs of Melbourne, in which the proprietor of the establishment and two boys are employed in making varnishes for bedsteads. In order to show that I was not indulging in any exaggeration when I was speaking of the large number of people who use varnish, I desire to mention some of the industries in which it forms one of the articles of consumption. They include coach-building, house-painting, furniture-making, Japanning  works, bedstead works, shipping and boat building, agricultural implement works, and many others. In addition to this, the Treasurer when he speaks of the assistance given to these industries must remember that the protection now afforded is much less than was formerly extended under the Victorian Tariff.

We were told, however, that he pays only twice the amount of wages. It would appear that the men employed in New South Wales are receiving in proportion 33 per cent, less wages than are those similarly engaged in Victoria.

                        <para>- Before we consider the list of exemptions I should like to remind the Minister for Trade and Customs that a few weeks ago I submitted to him a communication from the leading Sydney merchants who are interested in importations of paints and varnishes, complaining of the duties which are charged upon outside cases. According to the regulations the duties are chargeable where the goods are not free or are subject to a fixed duty. Of course these goods were not subject to fixed, but to composite. Now that the composite duties have been discarded in favour of fixed duties, I wish to know whether these outside packages will be admitted free ? </para>

                        <para>- I wish to point out some of the anomalies which exist in connexion with this matter. In many cases the packages cost more than the goods, as they cannot possibly be manufactured within the Commonwealth, as no manufacturer in England will send his goods out in bulk to be repacked and relabelled at the discretion of the Australian importer. Also the duty on packages is, in some respects, anomalous. For instance, if paint is imported in 14-lb. iron kegs shipped loose, these packages are "outside" packages, and, by a recent decision of the department, are exempt from duty. If, however, the same kegs are packed in casks to. insure delivery in better condition they become " inside " packages and are consequently dutiable. The duty on packages also seriously affects the smaller buyer, as it increases as the size of the package is reduced, Should paint be imported in 28- lb. kegs there is no duty on the packages. If, however, the same paint is imported in 7-lb. tins, such as are required by the ordinary painter, duty is payable on about 5s. per cwt., if in 1-lb. tins on 13s. per cwt., and if in½-lb. tins on 22s. per cwt. for the packages alone. This is an important matter to consider, especially as it applies to the smaller man. </para>

                        (East Sydney). - I was going to mention the point which has been raised, by the honorable member for Melbourne. As stated by him under a recent decision of the Customs department, iron kegs containing white lead, varnishes, &amp;c., are exempt from duty. But the practice exists of sending out kegs of this material packed in casks to insure their landing in better condition. Under the decision to -which I have referred the outside casks would probably be admitted free, but the inside kegs, which are practically outside packages, would be dutiable. Then, as the. honorable member for Melbourne has said, there would be a duty of about 5s. per cwt. upon the packages containing paint if it is imported in 7-lb. tins, of 13s. per cwt. if it is imported in 1-lb. tins, and of 22s. per cwt. if it is imported in½-lb. tins.

They would thus be placed at a distinct disadvantage as compared with those who obtained their paint in bulk. However, I think the miscellaneous section is the best place at which to deal with matters of this sort. </para>

The particular matter which has been referred to by the leader of the Opposition and the honorable member for Melbourne has not yet come before me. But I will look into it. It is a matter upon which I would not like to commit myself offhand. I would further remind honorable members that the whole question of packages is a very interesting one, and we have provided for its discussion in the latter part of the Tariff. I do not intend, therefore, to anticipate its discussion at this stage. </para>

This exemption reminds me very much of the cartoon in <inline font-style="italic">Punch</inline> depicting two country people looking at a picture, and one of them remarking to the other that the paint used upon it must have cost £5, let alone the labour of the man in laying it on. This exemption seems to be conceived in very much the same spirit. I do not think that a duty on artists' colours would save any of the States from insolvency, should they be threatened with such a disaster : but it does look like the refinement of ingenuity to allow artists' colours to come in free. </para>

Tins proposal shows that Ministers must be votaries of the fine arts. I would remind them that when I pleaded the cause of other artists - men who paint ships, men who labour long and do not give their wares to the wealthy alone - the Government could not see their way clear to place the particular preservatives used by them upon the free list. As a free-trader, the only point I can see in the Government proposal is that the amount of duty on artists' colours would be so small that it would not pay to collect it. </para>

                        <para>- I hope the Government will retain this exemption. We all admit that this is not a country of art. Whoever buys a picture worth anything in this country ? Last year Pierpont  Morgan paid more for one picture than the whole of Australia spent on works of art. Although this item may seem to be small, the children of the poor who go to the public schools, and from whom the artists come, would have to pay the duty. Artists' colours are not manufactured in the country, and consequently the strugglers, the masses, from whom all the genius of' the world comes, would have to suffer if a duty were imposed. </para>

                            <para>- The right honorable member is a little mixed in regard to this matter. Although it is not worth while grumbling about this proposal, the trouble of collecting the duty on artists' colours at the rate of 4s. per cwt. seems likely to be of such an extent that it is difficult to decide what is the right policy to adopt in the circumstances. Had. the larger duty prevailed, it might have been worth while to collect it on artists' colours, but as that has been struck off I am inclined to think that the exemption should stand as it is. </para>

                        BRADDON (Tasmania). - Will the two right honorable Ministers in charge of the Tariff come to some agreement on this subject. One of them tells us that it is utterly useless to attempt to charge a duty on artists' colours, while the other says that it is not advisable to collect it, because it is so small. The argument that the collection of the duty would involve a certain amount of trouble is absolutely absurd, and if it were applied all through the Tariff we should have nearly everything on the free list.

                        (East Sydney). - I cannot allow this proposed exemption to go without protesting against the invidious class distinction sought to be made. Ordinary painters who have to paint in the broiling sun from day to day have to pay 4s. per cwt. for the paint they use, but the average artist who sits in a luxurious studio, puts on an . ounce of paint a month, and then scrapes it off, and perhaps uses the same paint a dozen times over, is to have his colours placed on the aristocratic free list of this conservative Administration. The Government proposal is utterly absurd. It will cost twice as much for the Customs to prove that colours are exempt as it would cost to collect the duty.
