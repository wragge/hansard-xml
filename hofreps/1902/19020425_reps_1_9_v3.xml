                    <para>Last night when the Minister for Home Affairs was discussing the proposed tour of inspection of the federal capital sites, I asked him by way of interjection if he considered it necessary that the press should be represented on the occasion in question, seeing that newspaper representatives had visited the various sites with the senatorial party. In my innocence I thought that having once inspected the sites, if they wished to repeat the trip, they might be patriotic enough to do so at their own expense. As a result I notice that the Age report of yesterday's proceedings states -</para>

                    <para>Mr. Poynton, notwithstanding an expressed desire for economy, appeared to be so keen upon having an enjoyable time that he suggested to the Minister the advisability of debarring the attendance of all representatives of the Press, in order presumably that the public might be kept in darkness regarding the proceedings.</para>

                <para>I have no hesitation in characterizing that statement as a deliberate and diabolical misrepresentation of facts, and one which is only worthy of an Ananias. I may add that it is on a par with the conduct of the press upon a previous occasion, when its representatives participated in what they alleged to be a " guzzle," and afterwards made capital out of it.</para>

                        <para>I wish to ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether, in view of the great difficulties imposed by the Tariff, some better mode cannot be devised of dealing with cases of probably pure' error than that of police court prosecutions ? Of course, a new system of taxation is bound to result in error at its initiation, and I ask, whether in view of the character of the traders, which, in most cases, has been fairly maintained through many years, the system of regarding possible errors as absolute crimes cannot be discontinued till the whole system has got into working order. We have been altering the Tariff from day to day, so that it is impossible for others to appreciate its full bearing. I may inform the Minister that there are a large number of small importers in Australia who have no machinery of their own on the other side of the world, and who depend for their invoices entirely upon indent agents and other representatives of manufacturers. I understand that errors have occurred in many cases in which the individuals concerned are willing to make statutory declarations that such errors have resulted from no fault of their own. Seeing that an error in an invoice cannot be discovered until the goods have been opened, it seems to me that more lenient treatment than that at present in vogue might be meted out to those who have committed a technical breach. I am as anxious as is the Minister for Trade and Customs that the honest trader shall be protected</para>

                        <para>There is not the slightest desire on the part of the Government to be unnecessarily severe, but we have a great desire that the Customs revenue shall not be unfairly evaded, and that dishonest, or even careless, people shall not secure an advantage over honest or more careful traders. I am inclined to think that a very lax system has grown up in this connexion, that some people do not recognise their duty in regard to the making of entries. They' risk it. They' prac-ticallj'pledge their oaths to the truth of statements which are not correct, and which they would not dare to declare correct had they' looked into them more closely. It is also noteworthy that the great majority of these cases are mistakes—or "errors," if the honorable member chooses to call them such— against the Government, and in favour of those who make them. By the exercise of reasonable vigilance, not only will the honest and careful trader be protected, but I believe that the revenue will be considerably augmented, by compelling people to pay what they ought to pay, thus avoiding the necessity for the further taxation of those who more fully recognise their liabilities. There has been, and will be, no unnecessary severity. We shall simply endeavour to do what we can for the?purpose of securing a true statement of the facts for the guidance of the Government, and of preventing the evasion of customs duties to the advantage of those who make the errors, and to the disadvantage of their competitors in business.</para>

                        <para>his is the first intimation I have had that there was any scarcity of copies of the Tariff in Western Australia. Of course it is difficult to insure a full supply of copies of the amended Tariff to date. However, I will look into the matter and see what can be done. I hope that very soon we shall be able to supply copies of the Tariff complete with the Governor-General's signature attached to them.</para>
