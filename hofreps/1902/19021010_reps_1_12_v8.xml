                        <para>- There has been a series of most untoward accidents in this telephone extension. After the tenders were called, two contractors, each of whom had his tender accepted in turn, failed to carry out the work. The vote expired on the 30th June last, and it was necessary to wait until the. sum appropriated was revoted in the Bill, which is to receive the assent of the Acting Governor-General to-day. I assure the honorable member that there will be no further delay. </para>

                        <para>- Arrangements are now being completed. I hope that in a day or two we shall be in a position to take such measures as will allow the owners of the pearl-shelling fleets to replace the men who are returning to their homes. We shall require a satisfactory guarantee that these men will not enter the Commonwealth except for the purpose of being signed on, or under short exemptions, and that they shall be expatriated at the termination of their engagement. In addition, a movement is taking place, which we shall be able to assist by other means, for reducing the number of aliens who were in the Commonwealth prior to the operation of the present Act. Careful returns are being prepared showing the names of all aliens who enter the Commonwealth in connexion with the pearl-shelling industry or otherwise, and each person will be carefully marked off only when he. leaves the Commonwealth at the expiration of his term of engagement. By an alteration of the administrative methods hitherto pursued we hope to obtain at. Thursday Island what has not been secured up to the present - a complete record of those coloured aliens who are in, enter, or leave the Commonwealth. </para>

It is represented that the honorable member for Melbourne Ports asked, by way of interjection, whether cigars and whisky were to be provided, and that the Minister replied - " If the Government will not pay for them I will do it myself."

                        <para>- I mentioned that there were seven or eight honorable members who could not go when the previous trips were organized, and that amongst them was the honorable member for Gippsland, who could not very well travel in the same way as others. I had previously spoken to the honorable member on the subject, and there were six or seven others, who I, understood, were prepared to make the trip through Gippsland to Bombala. I thought it was only right to offer to these honorable members the same facilities as were afforded to others. </para>

                        <para>I undertake to reduce the expenditure for the present year as stated, and to reduce the Estimates for next year by £62,000...... I give my word, which I hope the committee will accept . . . that the reductions will be made, not in the direction which some honorable members seem to fear, but mainly in the expenses of the administration staff. I cannot give particulars now, but I shall take care that the spirit of the debate to-night is reflected in the reductions, and that honorable members shall not be in any way hoodwinked or misled. </para>

                        <para>The Estimates include rifles and warlike stores, but do not embrace the construction and maintenance of works. The leader of the Opposition says that it is desired that the reduction which is to be effected this year shall not apply to the provision which is mode for warlike stores. That is not intended, and will not be done. Next year a little more or a little less money may be appropriated for warlike stores, according to the requirements of the year. I reduced the amounts provided on the Estimates for the purchase of warlike stores quite as low as I felt justified in doing, and the reductions to be made in accordance 'with the wish of the House will be effected in connexion with the administration, from the Head-quarters Staff downwards. </para>
                        <para class="block">That is the gist of what I said. I do not want honorable members to think that the whole reduction can be made in the cost of the administrative staff. In order to show that this i3 so, I have had prepared a' return showing the cost of the administrative staff, including all" permanently employed officers and non-commissioned officers, other than permanent artillery and permanent engineers. The total is £72,148, including State staffs; and it is manifest that, on such a sum, it would be quite impossible to make a reduction of £62,000. I have received from the General Officer Commanding, a report suggesting reductions in order to effect a saving of £62,000. A summary of that report shows that it is proposed to reduce the Head-quarters Staff by two officers and one clerk. In each of two of the States, a commanding officer has been retired under the provision as to age limit, but I do not think I ought to mention names. In the administrative and instructional staff it is proposed to do away with ten positions for commissioned officers, made up of four in New South Wales, two in Victoria, and one each in Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. Of these ten positions, four are already vacant, so that only six officers would retire. It is proposed to dispense with the. services of fourteen warrant and non-commissioned officers, made up of nine <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> New South Wales, two in Queensland, one in South Australia, and two in Tasmania ; and to reduce the establishment of the permanent artillery by ten officers and 363 non-commissioned officers and men. The establishment of the artillery is now short by seven officer's, and about 100 men, and these vacancies, which would not be refilled, are included in the proposed reductions. The establishment of the permanent artillery would then remain at 33 officers, and 660 non-commissioned officers and men. It is proposed to reduce the permanent engineers by three officers - two of these positions are at present vacant - and by four noncommissioned officers and men. A reduction in contingencies is expected by £6,436 ; in the cost of camps of instruction, £6,025 ; and in expenditure on uniforms for reservists, New South Wales, £800. </para>

                            <para>- -I believe it is proposed to dispense with one or two clerks in the civil branch. I have told the General Officer Commanding that the Headquarters Staff, and also the Head-quarters Staffs in the States must "be still further reduced to a considerable extent. I have suggested that a conference should be held, or that the General Officer Commanding should devise some more simple method of dealing with the business, especially in the States, so as not to necessitate the passing of so many papers, which compels the employment of numerous clerks. I give the House this information in order to protect myself, and to show what steps have been taken in regard to the recommendations already made. </para>

                        <para>- I think the proposal is to reduce the staff by one. I may tell the honorable member, for his own satisfaction and that of other representatives of South Australia, that I have told the General Officer Commanding that, in my opinion, the instructors generally will have to be reduced by one-half. That, of course, will mean the reduction of the number of instructors in South Australia by one-half. </para>

                        <para>- Can the Acting Prime Minister tell us whether it is proposed, during the recess, to "convert the present select committee on the Bonuses for Manufactures Bill into a Royal commission ? If that be the intention, I would remind the honorable gentleman that the session has lasted a long time, and that a Royal commission will mean a considerable strain on the <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard</inline> staff, who, I understand, will be called upon to report the evidence. Does the Acting Prime Minister consider that that is quite fair to the reporters?

Any demand which may require to be made thereafter depends upon the arrangement which was made with the members of the staff at the time of their engagement by the Prime Minister, who, by that time, will be here, and able to deal with the question.

                        <para>- The question demands an amount of foresight of which I am quite incapable. Our meeting next session will depend very largely, first on circumstances that may intervene after the rising of the House, and, in the next place, on the business which it may be possible to introduce in consequence of the recent visit of the Prime Minister to the mother country. That visit had reference not only to the questions of defence which were considered at the Imperial Conference, but also to inquiries directed to a number of other matters of practical importance, such as the appointment of a Commonwealth High Commissioner, and the conversion of the debts. If the inquiries of the Prime Minister on these points enable the Government to mature the measures dealing with them sufficiently early, it may then be necessary to provide for a session of some duration before this Parliament closes. </para>

I have already explained the matter by showing that last year's expenditure was not as great as it would ordinarily have been, owing to the fact that a number of men in the forces went to South Africa, and that while they were on service there pay was not debited to South Australia but was met by the Imperial Government. </para>

                        <para>- I see no prospect of any such remission. The fact that Victoria is now suffering as the States of New South Wales and Queensland have most unhappily suffered cannot alter our attitude, which must be in accordance with the needs and wishes of the whole of the people of Australia. Their deepest sympathy goes out to the afflicted districts, but the permanent policy of the whole cannot be dictated even by their temporarily sad condition. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member asked me a question in regard to this matter some time ago. I mentioned then that I had applied on two occasions to the Treasurer of South Australia for certain information, but that it had not been furnished. Immediately afterwards I made a third application for the information, but up to the present time I have not even had an acknowledgment of my request. We have the information so far as the two years which have elapsed since the inauguration of the Commonwealth are concerned, but in regard to the previous year we have to pick out the details from various documents. That has been done to some extent by my accountant, who is a very careful officer; but I do not desire to make any official statement with regard to the expenditure in any State until I have satisfied myself as well as I can that it is correct. I shall then be able to give the Treasurer of the State in question an opportunity to point out any inaccuracy if a mistake has been made. I have not had an opportunity to examine the information which has been obtained, but propose to do so as early as possible. I shall endeavour to obtain the official information from South Australia, as I have obtained it from the other States. As soon as I have completed the statement, I shall take care that it is circulated amongst honorable members, and made public. Taking into consideration the fact that we are now constructing new works and buildings out of revenue instead of out of loan moneys, and that in some years we have had to pay off heavy arrears belonging to an earlier period, we shall be able to show that there has been no extravagant increase. The increase will be small indeed, and will have been occasioned by the growing necessities of the Postal department, and similar demands in other directions. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> - It now becomes my very pleasant duty, on behalf of the members of this House, to tender to you in very brief and simple fashion an expression of our appreciation of the manner in which you have discharged the duties of your exalted position. The dignity, the equity, the complete mastery of your functions which you have displayed during the current session, have, I am sure, satisfied the whole Parliament that among all the experienced politicians of the States assembled in this House no one could have been selected who was able to fulfil more adequately the very important duties of your distinguished office. In wishing you the enjoyment of the recess which you need, as much as any other honorable member, you will, I hope, accept our assurance that we recognise how well and thoroughly it has been earned by your devotion to duty. We also appreciate the work of the Chairman of Committees, who, during this session, has probably occupied the chair for a longer period than any Chairman of Committees in any Parliament of Australia, and who, in the difficult position which he occupies has, by his devotion to duty and his determination ' to maintain the best traditions of his office, given universal satisfaction. In regard to those officers who are not elected, but by whose aid the business of this House is transacted, we admit with frankness and obligation the great assistance which they have rendered at all times to honorable members. The capable recorders of our proceedings - as, indeed, all the other officers of the House, and even its messengers - have passed through a session which has made an unparalleled demand upon their strength and ability. The first Parliament of Australia may well congratulate itself upon the fact that it has been able to gather about it so efficient and so generous a a staff. Before I resume my seat, may I express to my friends upon the opposition benches, and also to those who have done us the honour of sitting upon this side of the Chamber, the acknowledgments of the Government for the courteous treatment which we have at all times received at their hands. No one will pretend that we have not been confronted with many serious and many new difficulties. But we have managed to surmount them, and to transact business of a character never before attempted in this part of the world with an absence of those personal altercations, which sometimes cause our critics to censure the working of representative government. Taking into consideration the enormous strain to which we have been subjected by the duration of our proceedings, and the immense fruitfulness of our labours, I can sincerely congratulate the House upon having risen to the great demands made upon it, and upon having discharged its duties in a manner that will reflect lasting credit upon its members. </para>

                        would not be right if the Opposition did not join in the well-deserved appreciation of yourself and .the officers of the House, to whom allusion has been made by the Acting Prime Minister. I feel that I am expressing the views of honorable members upon this side of the Chamber, when I say that we felt from the beginning - and experience has confirmed our original impression - that in your hands, not only the interests of the Opposition, but those of all members, and the honor of the House itself, were safe. I heartily join in the encomiums which have been passed upon all the other officers of Parliament. With the Government and their supporters, we have, of course, had many disputations and some battles. We do not regret them, but we are pleased that they were conducted in a good humour and an honorable manner upon both sides. On behalf of the Opposition, I thank honorable members opposite for many courtesies, and I would especially thank those who were good enough to occasionally cross to this side of the Chamber, and thus assist us to achieve some of what I regard as very well deserved victories. I shall content myself with adding that though we have had our differences, on the other hand we have had much pleasant intercourse, and have learned to appreciate some, who, at the beginning of the session, were strangers to us. I sympathize with those representatives of the different States who have been so long absent from their homes, and I hope that they may now enjoy a lengthy sojourn there - if they are able to find them after this long interval. I trust that the good spirit which has distinguished the first session of the first Parliament of the Commonwealth will be present to a still larger degree in its future sessions.

                    <para>- Speaking on behalf of those honorable members who belong neither to the Government nor the Opposition, I join in the, expressions of high appreciation of the admirable manner in which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> have discharged the duties entrusted to you during the session which is now closing. In some Parliaments members of the labour party' are credited with a disregard of the methods of parliamentary procedure, but after the experience of the present long session, which has covered proceedings which were likely to engender the greatest amount of heat, the members of that party in this House have the fullest possible confidence in you, and appreciate the fair and exemplary manner in which. you have adjudicated between conflicting interests and parties. We are all under a debt of gratitude to the other officers of Parliament for the work which they have performed, and the obliging way in which they have assisted us upon every possible occasion. </para>

Any success which I have achieved in my present office has been due to the generous assistance and support that has been extended to me by all sections of the House. On behalf of its officers, I thank honorable members for the encomiums which have been passed upon their services. May I also wish honorable members a very pleasant recess and a happy re-union a few months hence. </para>
