            <para>- The information which I have received shows that the resolution arrived at was general in its purport. It left to each Government the task of considering in what way, and to what extent, it could make a reduction in the postage upon newspapers. . It will be for the. PostmasterGeneral to consider the matter, and to present proposals to the. Cabinet,the members of which are, I am sure, prepared to give them the most favorable considera tion. </para>

For halfacentury I have been in the habit of witnessing reviews in this and other parts of the world, and if this review had been on the other side of the world, at Aldershot, you,  Colonel Stuart,  and the officers under you, need not have been ashamed of your men. I congratulate you,  Colonel Stuart,  on the admirable training of the forces you will hand over to your successor,  Colonel Lyster,  and I congratulate you, Captain Clare, upon the men of your Naval Brigade, who are quite worthy to march with the Military Forces. </para>

            <para>- The expressions of opinion in South Australia, which have been published in the press, have been read by me. The Government of that State have communicated with this Government on the subject by a telegram, the general purport of which was that, so for as they can judge, their troops compare favorably in point of drill and discipline with those of the other States, and they are, therefore, at a loss to understand why the extra cost which they consider will be involved by the appointment of the drill instructors has been incurred. </para>

          <para>- Although this is not one of the most important items in the Tariff, there was a considerable discussion upon it when it was last before the committee, the general feeling of honorable members on this side of the Chamber being that the duty proposed was far in excess of the rate necessary to protect the manufacturers of these articles. I do not suppose that mangles are very difficult or costly to manufacture, but they are bulky and heavy, so that the cost of importing them must be large. That being so, I think that a duty of 10 per cent. would afford quite sufficient protection to the manufacturers, and I therefore move - </para>

Many honorable members hold strong views with regard to the reduction of the duty upon agricultural machinery, but would be prepared to support the imposition of a higher duty upon engines. </para>

        <para class="block">After very long debates, the committee decided that a 15 per cent. duty should be imposed upon agricultural, horticultural, and viticultural machinery, and it is of the highest importance that we should encourage the manufacture of these goods in our midst. We must not forget that whilst it is highly desirable in the interests of the agricultural community that their implements should be manufactured here, the industry is deserving of special encouragement, because it affords employment to a large number of skilled labourers. Moreover, the facilities afforded to our agriculturists in the shapeof cheap machinery largely assist in the development of that industry which is the backbone of all our resources.From all I can hear, hardly any request of the Senate has caused more alarm than the proposal to cut down the protection afforded to the manufacturers of agricultural machinery. </para>

            <para>- It is not a question of a third House, but is simply one of skilled officers speaking freely upon this matter. If, however, honorable members prefer not to have their information on the subject, I shall not offer it. But in this connexion I should like to quote from the report of a deputation which waited at my office, and which was received by my officers. The report reads - </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <quote>
          <para>On the 31st July, a deputation consisting of Messrs. Forwood,Reid, and Evans, representing the South Australian Chamber of Manufactures, waited on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smart,</inline> to lay before him the views of their Chamber relative to the suggested amendments by the Senate on the duties passed by the House of Representatives. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Forward</inline> said, with reference to the above, that the trade in South Australia are practically convinced that if the duty is reduced to 10 per cent., as proposed by theSenate, a large number of them will have to give up manufacturing altogether. They will hardly be able to get along with the15 per cent., but the 10 per cent. would be fatal, and the consequence will be that a number of things that are manufactured now will be imported instead. In South Australia, it was only after the imposition of the 1885 Tariff, which imposed a duty of from 20 to 25 per cent. , that we were able to get a start in the manufacture of these goods. Before the 1885 Tariff the duty imposed on mining and agricultural machinery was 5 per cent. Since the imposition of the higher duty, factories have grown up largely in South Australia, the men have been well trained, and to-day we can turn out work very much cheaper than we could before. Most of the manufacturers are determined that they will not lose their trade simply because they are manufacturers only - they will become importers as well. Several of the Victorian manufacturers have informed me that it will be impossible for them to manufacture under the proposed duty. </para>

        <para class="block">Another gentleman represented - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>One of the strongest points in asking for a higher duty is that a duty of 10 per cent. will simply be playing into the hands of the American and German manufacturers. In America, machinery for export is sold at specially reduced prices, and with the cheap labour prevailing in other countries, it is impossible for our manufacturers to compete against it. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">In connexion with this matter we have received all sorts of letters, and there is no doubt whatever that the position is - as has been put repeatedly, and with considerable strength - that this House did all that it could reasonably be asked to do when it reduced the rate upon this machinery to 15 per cent. If a further reduction be made it will be to the danger, if not the extinction, of many manufactures, and must result in increased importation from abroad to the loss of Australia. I ask honorable members to consider whether the industry is not worth preserving, and also to declare that 15 per cent. is a fair duty to impose. In this connexion I know - as was pointed out by the honorable member for Grampians - the cruel competition to which Australian manufacturers are exposed. Their ideas, which conform to local requirements and which are properly the subject of their personal ownership, are copied, the designs are taken elsewhere, and some trifling alteration is made in them so that the inventor, instead of having the full benefit arising from his invention, not only loses it, but is subjected to competition from which he ought to be free. I have no desire to invite a lengthy debate upon this subject. We are all familiar with the arguments upon both sides. What is a 15 per cent. rate? It is practically what the acting leader of the Opposition suggested as a fair all-round drag-net rate after levying special duties upon stimulants and narcotics, and with a special fixed list upon various articles. It seems to me that we cannot reduce the protection afforded without withdrawing all pretension to give encouragement to an industry which is well worthy of it, which is already fairly established in our midst, but which has been exposed to cruel risks from which it ought tobefree. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir WILLIAM</inline>McMILLAN (Wentworth). - I thought that during the last fifteen months I had been able to form a tolerable idea of my right honorable friend&#39;s character, and I did believe, notwithstanding his well-known obstinacy, that he at least possessed some sense of humour. That he should quote the opinion of the manufacturers of any State as proof that we should retain a 15 per cent. duty upon machinery is ludicrous in the extreme. Does he think that any manufacturer in the world who has a regard for his own interests would refuse to accept even a prohibitive duty if we offered it to him? The thing is ridiculous. But the right honorable gentleman has made a still greater mistake. He has actually intruded into this debate the opinion of one of his officers - the New South Wales Collector of Customs - who has nothing whatever to do with the policy of this country. If the Minister had said that that officer had reported upon the revenue aspect of this question, his opinion might have been given without dragging in his name. </para>

            <para>- At this time of day I am not going to instruct the Minister, and I am sure that my right honorable friend would not take my instruction, even if I proffered it. We are now approaching the end of this long struggle upon the Tariff. Honorable members have differed very materially during the course of the debates which have extended over the past nine months. The enormous divergence of opinion was well illustrated by the interjections of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports. We also know that instead of the compact which was entered into being honorably carried out, many honorable members who believe in extreme protection have declared that they would vote for every duty that would prohibit importation. But upon several occasions we were, I might almost say upon neutral ground, because even if the war did not cease there was more or less a temporary truce. As far as my recollection of the debates goes, when the committee came to discuss the question of the duties to be levied upon machinery, honorable members from both sides of the Chamber got very closely together. Now, putting aside the large distributing forces which must form a part of every State, and which, to my mind, are just as necessary as is any other part of our industrial life, we have the great primary producers of Australia upon the one hand and the great manufacturing industries upon the other. Now, what was the feeling of the committee when &#39;they came to deal with the question of the duties to be imposed upon machinery ? We felt that we were not dealing with an ordinary item under a protective Tariff, but with the actual tools of trade of various industries. As honorable members know, we have not merely to deal with the tool of trade which is necessary in the simplest arts of agriculture, but with the most complicated scientific machinery used in all the industries connected with manufacture. In this connexion, the first thought which strikes one is - &#34; Are we, as a manufacturing and producing country, to face the competition of the world.&#34; Honorable members must recollect the peculiar character of the Australian continent. Although by communication we are now in closer touch with the outside world than we were formerly, we are still more or less an isolated community. Even with this large continent we are a mere handful of people, and we must face the fact that we over-produce, and that under a protectionist system we must over-manufacture. Consequently, under the very system which we have been creating in this Parliament, we must face the question of the disposal of not only our surplus products, but also our surplus manufactures. There is one thing which protection cannot do, and that is to give efficiency in the skill of the workman, and to give nice, complicated, scientific adjustments to the most modern machinery. What is the good of protection if in this industrial life we have not the most modern inventions in machinery ? It is all very well to impose a duty on say locomotives to such a point of &#39; prohibition that we import none; but while we are using a locomotive which perhaps would take only twenty cars in a train, there might be invented and patented in another part of the world a locomotive which would enable a train, at the same expenditure, to draw 40 cars. That is what protection cannot do, and fortunately for the interests of the inventor patents have been granted all over the British Empire to protect the man of genius against every person who desires to pirate the fruit of his brains. Are we going at the very outset of the Commonwealth to strike a blow at the very machinery which is so necessary to give us that superiority in manufacture and in production which is required once we begin to export our produce <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The use of machinery lies at the very bottom of our industrial life, and in a young nation like this, which must rely more or less on the inventive genius of the larger populations of the world, it ought to be free. I should like to give an instance of the wisdom of this policy. </para>

        <para class="block">Fifteen years ago I had the good, or bad, fortune to offer a coal mine in London - I suppose at the time the largest coal mine in Australia. We required to sink to a depth of 1,100 feet, a thing which had never been done before in a coal mine. The colliery had to be opened out and the industry carried on under conditions which had never prevailed before in that business. It was absolutely necessary, for the maintenance of the industry and the preservation of the lives of the people, that we should have- the best mechanical appliances which the world could produce. England and Scotland were ransacked by the directors of the company, and the machinery which at the time, if not now, was equal to any machinery in the world, came from 50 or 100 firms, and of course it was supplemented by some of local manufacture. We laid tribute on the world ; we sank our shaft 1,100 feet; we created a business which, since that day, has been&#39; keeping 2,000 men, women, and children in comfort, and everything which human wit could do in order to make that property productive, and protect human life was done. Are we, a handful of people isolated from the centres of the world, to put an embargo on the very privilege which we ought to enjoy <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Such a policy is unstatesmanlike. In support of a z-eduction of duty we claim not merely the voices of the primary producers, who get precious little out of the Tariff, but also the voices of the industrial manufacturers, who, to the disgrace of Australia be it said, in the future, if these embargoes are imposed, will be behind the rest of the world as regards the use of  scientific appliances. We have no right to impose an embargo on science and skill, or to do anything which would prevent the industrial life of Australia from competing with the rest of the world. We must recollect that whenever a man of genius invents a new mechanical appliance, it becomes available to nearly the whole world. Are we going to put an embargo on the use of that appliance <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Again, when we wish to engage a professor of chemistry or a great railway expert, do we depend on our colonial stock?. Do we not go to America, England, or elsewhere in order to secure the talent of the world? Are not the mechanical appliances which we are importing and on which there should be no embargo the most effective capital which could be introduced <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> My honorable friends on the other side have to deal with this question from the stand-point of the industrial life of the future. We are now forcing manufactures not merely in Victoria, but in all the other States. Within ten years, I venture to say, &#39; under this Tariff, if it is not amended, either we shall have a large surplus stock of manufactures or we shall have men unemployed. What are we going to do then <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Are we going to make our industries simply commensurate with the area and the wants of Australia <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> Are we never going to aim at the destiny of Australia in the eastern part of this world? Do we not expect, as time goes on, if we have the industrial brain and the intelligence of our forefathers who made the English nation the greatest manufacturing power under the sun, to export to every part of the  eastern world <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Certainly we do. Once a mau of genius invents any mechanical appliance, it becomes by right of purchase at a certain price the property of the Japanese, the Chinese, or the Indian, just as much as it becomes ours. There is no fear of those people shutting out the mechanical appliances of the world, putting an embargo on genius, or hesitating to &#39;get a professor or an engineer from any part of the world. I am not opposed in any sense to the rise of the manufacturing industries of Australia. I believe that within 20 or 30 years, without one jot of duty, we should have had manufacturing industries which would not merely have provided for the wants of Australia, but would have made us the emporium of the eastern world. But, taking it for granted that this position is forced, I wish to see the industries of Australia placed on the same basis as the best industries in all parts of the world. Will the honorable member for Melbourne Ports deny that to-day, largely by reason of these duties, and largely from the want of an active and healthy competition, there is employed in Victorian manufactures machinery which is far behind the times <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> That is one of the great dangers of this protectionist system, especially if it is carried to a point which almost prohibits importation. We lose the strengthening element of a healthful competition. Do honorable members wish to -bolster up industries when they are behind the rest of the world ? If so, the system must break down. We should not have any duty affecting an industry unless that it is of such a moderate character that, if the industry does not keep in touch with the march of civilization and the march of science, it will inevitably go down. I feel that the Government might give way on this item. I would point out to Ministers and their supporters that here we have an opportunity to pursue a broad line of public policy, by agreeing to the sensible proposal of the Senate. I think if that course be taken it will go a long way to smooth the differences between the House&#39;s. I feel strongly on this matter. I make no distinction between the machinery of the agriculturist and that of the miner. I submit that all machinery - everything which is necessary to a man for carrying on his industry and which can come under the general title of tools of trade - ought to be  absolutely  free, or, if not free, subjected to the least possible duty.

            <para>- That rate is not prohibitive. Imports have continued to come into Victoria under duties ranging as high as 35 and 40 per cent. We have never had anything approaching a prohibitive Tariff in this State, and no one knows it better than does the honorable member for Wentworth. It has been recognised by leading protectionists on the public platform in Victoria, and in the course of parliamentary debates, that owing to financial requirements this Tariff must be a compromise, and for any one to contend that it contains a prohibitive item, or that -a prohibitive duty has been proposed in connexion with it, is simply to ring the changes on words.

            <para>- I hope that my honorable friend is right, and that at an early date we shall be able to overtake our home market. But there is no indication of it, and I am afraid there is no possibility of it under this Tariff. The honorable member for Wentworth has asserted that we have obsolete machinery in Victoria. Where is that machinery? The honorable member must be acquainted with our various manufactories, and surely he will admit that in our boot, hat, and other leading industries we have the very best machinery, and employ the most skilled workmen? </para>

            <para>- That is not the question. The honorable member for Wentworth has urged that we ought to obtain the latest patented machinery from all parts of the world, and the honorable member for Barrier now says that the up-to-date machinery used in Victorian factories is imported, thus proving that our duties have not prevented its importation. The honorable member knows that in all the better classes of manufacture, . Victoria is doing better than is the State he represents. Highclass hats, boots, and clothing have been, and are being,made in Victoria to an extent not equalled in any other part of the Commonwealth, yet the honorable member for Wentworth talks about obsolete machinery. </para>

            <para>- My honorable friend is edging away from the question. I am not discussing high or low duties. What I contend is that, in the leading lines of manufacture in Victoria, the very best machinery that can be secured in any part of the world is employed, and that the duty upon machinery has not shut it out. The honorable member for Wentworth has also referred to the genius of invention. I have the fortune or misfortune to be an Australian native, and I claim that Australiayoung and unimportant and insignificant as it is in the eyes of some honorable members opposite- has given to the world some of the best inventions known. What about the torpedo? </para>

            <para>- I have done my best to bring about the opposite result ; and in advocating the policy of protection I am anxious that we should follow the example of the nations that are leading the world. It is a notorious fact - and the honorable member for Grampians knows it - that the combined harvester, an agricultural implement invented and manufactured in Australia by an Australian firm, is being copied at the present time by a Canadian firm which has branches here, and can tranship and transfer without the slightest trouble. To that firm the duty will be no bar. Foreign manufacturers are sucking the brains and the inventive genius of Australian people, and yet we ate asked by some friends of the Commonwealth to give them an open market without any restriction. The manufacturers have not appealed for free machinery ; and the workmen are petitioning us to impose the reasonable duty of 15 per cent. proposed by the Government. </para>

            <para>- I can assure my honorable friend - and the honorable and learned member for Darling Downs will verify the statement - that users of machinery are urging that, in their own interests, as well as in those of the Commonwealth generally, Australian manufacturers should be supported. At a conference of farmers, held recently in the electorate of Darling Downs, one of the leading farmers of the district said that he had used Australian machinery, and could commend it. He appealed to his fellow farmers to do their best to support it. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member for Moira does not support black labour, and he will tell the committee that farmers in Victoria, where we have machinery manufactories, have been better served than have those of New South Wales. Even the producer is not urging that these duties should be imposed. Notwithstanding the insinuations that have been made, I have no monetary interest, either direct or indirect, in any manufacture. I am here to advocate the interests of our workmen and those of our own people generally, and I trust that the duty proposed by the Government will be agreed to. </para>

          <para>- I think that the committee will acquit the honorable member for Melbourne Ports of having any personal interest in any duty which may come before us. . No one has made any such suggestion, and I am sure that so far as this side is concerned he stands acquitted of any interest of the kind. The honorable member as well as the Minister for Trade and Customs spoke very strongly about foreign manufacturers who had stolen the patterns of Australian machinery makers. When the Tariff was before us on a former occasion, I cited a case showing that the ideas of a foreign manufacturer had been stolen and utilized by a local maker of engines. So that all these sins - if they be sins - are not confined to one side. Probably there are just as many offenders on one side as there are on the other. </para>

            <para>- To the case in which a man utilized the design of the Crossley oil engine, and constructed a kind of compromise engine. In these circumstances I do not think the Minister has a right to advance that argument as a reason for maintaining this duty. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports said that there was no possibility of the local market being overtaken for 50 years. If that be so, we cannot have a stronger argument in favour of reducing the duty or making all machinery free, because the more machinery we have in the country, andapplied to our natural resources, the greater our production will be. I cannot understand why the honorable member for Melbourne Ports shouldbe so anxious about the home market, seeing that it is already largely secured to Australia. I should like him to explain why he urges, as an argument in favour of protection, that local production cannot overtake the home demand for 50 years to come. If the statement be true, it is an argument in favour of allowing machinery either to come in free, orat as low a duty as possible, in order that production may be stimulated, and that we may be able to overtake the home demand. The Minister for Trade and Customs mentioned that there had been an enormous increase in the output of factories in South Australia after 1885, when the duty was increased from 5 per cent. to some higher figure, but the right honorable gentleman omitted to state, and it was a most important omission, that Broken Hill broke out just about that time, and created a demand for machinery such as had never existed in South Australia before. He also omitted to mention that Kalgoorlie and other Western Australian gold-fields have since been discovered. I do not think the right honorable gentleman was as candidas he might have been. He is sometimes very outspoken, but I do not think that in this instance he has placed before us all the facts which should have been within the knowledge of his collectors of customs. If he is getting the collectors of customs to formulate his policy for him, it ought at least to be formulated upon a knowledge of the whole of the facts, and not upon the knowledge of only a portion of the facts. The whole of the facts should be submitted, and fairly considered. We ought to lower this duty in justice to the great agricultural and mining industries of Australia. If we cannot agree to the free admission of these implements and machines, we should at least make the duty imposed upon them as low as possible. There is no likelihood of the Senate going back upon its decision in this matter. I draw the Minister&#39;s attention to the fact that the motion requesting the reduction of the duty upon this item from 15 to 10 per cent. was carried in the Senate by a majority of four in a House of twenty. Twelve voted for the suggested reduction of the duty, and eight against it. It is significant to note that of the minority of eight, three were Victorians. </para>

            <para>- It has been said by different members of the committee. We have been told that the opinion of the primary producer, the user of these machines, is alone entitled to consideration. Let us for a moment view the . situation from his stand-point, more particularly as it applies to agricultural implements and machinery. What is the position? I venture to say that it cannot be refuted that since we have had the agricultural machinery industry firmly established in Victoria, under a duty similar to that now proposed by the Government, the Victorian agriculturists have been much better served than they were when they had to depend upon imports. As to the inventive genius and mechanical skill of our people, it is only since the establishment of the manufacture of these implements in Australia that we have been able to meet the requirements of the people. The double-furrow and multi-furrow- ploughs as they exist to-day are purely .Victorian inventions and manufactures. The stumpjump plough, the stripper, the winnower, as we know it to-day, and the travelling  chaffcutter  and automatic bagger are also Australian inventions. This shows that we can make machinery and implements in. Australia to meet our requirements, and an immense proportion of these implements in use are made within the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- The free-trader says that the agriculturist can get these implements cheaper under his revenue duties. The representative&#39;s of free-trade in this instance propose a duty of 10 per cent., and the protectionists say that that is not sufficient to insure the manufacture of these implements and machines within the Commonwealth, but that a duty of 15 per cent, is sufficient for the purpose. There is only a difference of ls. in the &#163;1, but it involves a considerable difference in the cost of the implement. For this reason : With the duty at 10 per cent., very little, if any, of this machinery will  be manufactured  within the Commonwealth, while with the advantage of a 15 per cent, duty, a considerable proportion, if not the whole of it, will be made here. As a proof of that statement I may say that the duty under the Victorian Tariff upon implements and machinery was 15 per cent., and all the implements subject to that duty were manufactured locally and used by the Victorian agriculturists. Strange to say, in the neighbouring State of New South Wales, where attention was given to the same lines of agriculture, but where they had no duty upon agricultural implements, little, if any, of the agricultural machinery employed was manufactured in that State. The agriculturists of New South Wales were buying their implements from the Victorian and South Australian manufacturers, and were paying the same price for them as were the Victorian agriculturists. The honorable member for Canobolas will not deny that the farmers in his district using strippers and harvesting machines manufactured in Victoria paid exactly the same price for them as did Victorian agriculturists. They did not get any rebate because they bought the implements from Victoria. Consequently, it will be seen&#39; that there was no impost and no tax whatever upon the Victorian agriculturist because there happened to be a duty in Victoria upon agricultural implements and machinery. The same result will follow the proposal made by the Federal Government. I share the opinion that the revenue duty of 10 per cent, which is requested will crush the Australian manufacturer out, and that the extra 5 per cent, proposed &#34;by the Government gives him a bare margin upon which to continue his industry. The competition between manufacturers, and their known ability to adapt agricultural implements and machinery to the requirements of the Australian farmer, will enable the industry to -be successfully carried on without any increased cost whatever to the man using the machinery. As one who has been and is to~day using these implements, and as one who is every year purchasing these machines as they are invented and developed, I can say on behalf of the Victorian farmer - and I think I can say the same on behalf of the agriculturists of New South Wales and Queensland, because the conditions of agriculture are almost identical - that the development of this industry within the Commonwealth under a 15 per cent, duty will impose no tax whatever upon the  argriculturists  of the Commonwealth. &#187; </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. KIRWAN</inline>(Kalgoorlie). - The honorable members for Moira and Melbourne Ports have been very strong in what they have said as to the wonders that have been accomplished under the high Tariff imposed upon machinery in Victoria, and they are very keen in their opposition to any reduction in the duty imposed upon agricultural and mining machinery. But it will be remembered that some time ago, when the question of the duty that should be imposed upon machine tools used in connexion with city manufactures existing in Melbourne was before this committee, those honorable members developed very strong free-trade tendencies. </para>

            <para>- I speak generally of Victorian members, and I know that the honorable member for Melbourne Ports particularly exhibited very strong free-trade tendencies where a number of individuals engaged in city trades were concerned. A comparison has been made between New South Wales, where free-trade has obtained, and Victoria, where there have been high duties imposed on machinery; but from the latest issue of <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan</inline> I find that the number of hands engaged in manufactures of metals and machinery in New South Wales under free-trade conditions is considerably greater than the number employed in Victoria under high customs duties. </para>

            <para>- Those figures are in reply to honorable members on the other side, who seem to think that we on this side are not the friends of Australian industries, and that we have not faith in the inventive powers of Australians. I claim that it is honorable members opposite who exhibit a want of faith in the Australian people. We on this side do not fear but that the Australian people will be able to hold their own if we have free ports. We have greater confidence in the Australian people, and it is honorable members on the other side who are the &#34; little Australians &#34; who seem to lack faith in themselves, and who think that without support the Australians will not be able to hold their own. After all that has been said upon the subject, both here and in the Senate, I do not think it calls for lengthy discussion now ; but, as the members of the Senate request the reduction of the duty to 10 per cent., while a majority of the members of this committee favour a duty of 15 per cent., I think that the Government might well consent, as a compromise, to an all-round duty of 12i per cent. While there are strong reasons for very much reducing the duty upon agricultural machinery, there are still stronger reasons for reducing, and even for removing, the duty upon mining machinery, and in New Zealand mining machinery has been placed upon the free list. Furthermore, while an. attempt has been made to impose duties to assist the agricultural community,  thare  are no duties which can be regarded as in any way benefiting the mining industry, because the mineral output of the country cannot beincreased in price by the imposition of import duties. It is hardly necessary to impress upon the committee the great importance of both mining and agriculture to the country. The total annual production of those two industries is worth about &#163;40,000,000, whereas the total annual production of the manufacturing industries of which we hear so much is only about &#163;28,000,000, while many of the industries included in that term cannot benefit by protection. It seems to me, therefore, that we are sacrificing the larger interests of the Commonwealth to its smaller interests. I hope that an till-round <inline font-style="italic">duty</inline> of 12-J- per cent, will be agreed to. </para>

          <para>- If I understand the honorable member for Moira aright, he. argued that the manufacture of machinery has been developed more largely in Victoria than in New South Wales, because of the protective policy of the former State. I would therefore like to point out to him that the development of that industry cannot depend solely upon the existence or non-existence of a protective duty,, but is largely governed by the law of supply and demand. To my mind, the chief reason why the manufacture of machinery is an industry which has been developed tq a greater extent in Victoria and in South Australia than in New South Wales is that the agricultural development of those States has been spread over a longer time than that of New South Wales. On page 504 of Coghlan&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Seven Colonies,</inline> a table will be found giving the acreage under agriculture in each of the several States for a series of years. By referring to that table it will be seen that in 1861, while New South Wales had only 265,000 acres under crop, Victoria had 410,000 acres, and South Australia 400,000. In 1881 the New South Wales acreage had increased to- 578,000 acres, the Victorian acreage to 1,435,000 acres, and the South Australian acreage to 2,156,000 acres. In 1891 New South Wales had 846,000 acres under crop, but in 1S99 the State made a great advance  to 2,440,000 acres, while in that year the acreage under crop in Victoria was 3,155,000 acres, and in South Australia 2,238,000 acres. New South Walesmade her big increase inagricultural development between the years 1895 and 1899, and then commenced an immense demand for machinery in that State. The increase in cultivation was due to the opening to selection of large areas of land which were formerly not available. Those who secured that land speedily put it under crop, and then an immense demand was created for agricultural machinery to reap the crop. The creation of a demand for agricultural machinery resulted in the establishment of works for the manufacture of agricultural implements, which would otherwise have not been brought into existence, and the original inventors of the stripper - the Meadow Bank Company - shifted their works from South Australia to New South Wales. With regard to the contention of the honorable member for Moira, that the farmers of Victoria were better off so far as agricultural machinery is con- cerned than the farmers of New South Wales, I would remind him that about three years ago Victorian manufacturers were supplying agricultural machinery more cheaply to New South Wales farmers than to the farmers of their own State, who paid for the protection afforded to them. This fact caused such a feeling of dissatisfaction among the Victorian farmers, however, that the practice had to be discontinued, and a bond was entered into among the Victorian manufacturers not to supply machinery more cheaply in New South Wales than in Victoria, though, I know that despite that bond, New South Wales fanners were still able to secure Victorian machinery more cheaply than it could be bought in Victoria. </para>

            <para>- I can give the honorable member instances, and the names of those who bought the machinery. Owing to the great demand for agricultural machinery in New South Wales, the Clyde Engineering Company, which is a firm not usually classed among the makers of agricultural implements, Messrs. Ritchie Brothers, and other firms entered largely into the business , of making farming machinery. But these firms found that they  Were  unable to keep pace with the demand which was so suddenly sprung upon them, and many farmers had, therefore, to look elsewhere for their implements. So, too, in Victoria and New South Wales it is not protection that has been responsible for the establishment of agricultural implement manufactories so much as the demand for agricultural implements. With a sufficient demand, industries will arise, whether protected or not, but if there is no demand they cannot be created by the highest duties in the world. The Minister for Trade and Customs spoke of the encouragement given to inventive genius by the imposition of protective duties, and instanced the great improvements made in farming implements in Victoria and South Australia. No doubt such improvements have been made, and will continue to be made, because I think the inventive genius of Australia, when given a fair opportunity, and not restricted by unenlightened patent laws, is second to none in the world ; but I do not think that any more complicated or ingenious invention has been made in Australia than the sheep-shearing machine, which is a New South Wales invention. The pastoral industry has never been protected, yet an invention has been produced which can accomplish what was formerly held by experts to be an impossibility. Similarly new inventions and improvement in farming machinery will con tin ue to be made, whether we have protective duties or not. If, as some of the protectionists claim, the farmers will not have to pay increased prices for their implements, what benefit do the manufacturers expect to derive from the duty? It is certain that the duty cannot fall upon the foreign manufacturer. The farmers will not be able to secure better prices for their produce, because they have to compete in the open markets of the world. The Minister for Trade and Customs has admitted that the grain duties can operate only in times of drought and distress, and that if the farmers wish to derive any benefit from the Tariff, they should pray for a continuance of drought conditions. It is unfair that the agriculturists, who derive no benefit from the Tariff, should be asked to bolster up manufacturing industries by paying heavy duties upon their machinery. I should prefer to see agricultural machinery admitted free of duty. </para>

Some honorable members appear to think that good machinery cannot be made in Australia ; butI would point out that the Melbourne Tramway Company, after having had a most unsatisfactory experience with imported machinery, have for some years given their contracts to local manufacturers. I shall support the retention of duty at 15 per cent., and I hope that we shall at once proceed to a vote. </para>

          <para>- I shall not detain the committee at any length, because I am afraid that further discussion would be useless. When the honorable member for Melbourne Ports spoke in very optimistic terms of the position of the manufacturing industries of Victoria, he reminded me of an article which I read some little time ago. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> H. Curle, a gentleman who represents the <inline font-style="italic">Economist,</inline> one of the best financial magazines in the world,recently paid a visit to Victoria, and expressed the opinion that the equipment of the mines in that State was in some cases 30 years behind the times. Some honorablemembers may he inclined to sneer at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curle,</inline> but he is a man of world-wide experience in mining matters, and in view of the unsatisfactory position now occupied by the mining industry in Victoria, the probability is that there is something radically wrong in the methods at present adopted. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curle</inline> speaks not with a view to injure mining interests in Victoria, but simply with a desire to see a promising field for investment worked to the fullest advantage. He recognises that there are large and valuable deposits of gold in Victoria, and he urges that the best and most up-to-date machinery should be employed in their development. </para>

            <para>- Perhaps that is because the honorable and learned member does not pay much attention to the course of events beyond his own State. It is remarkable that Victorians discover that they are behind the times only after they leave their own State. Many of them havemade this discovery on visiting the mining fields of Western Australia, and I should be sorry indeed to see the policy which has proved so injurious to. Victoria extended to Australia in general, and my own State in particular. </para>

          <para>- The suggestion made by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie that the duty should be fixed at 12&#189; per cent. is a very fair one. The retention of a high rate of duty will have a most injurious effect upon the mining industry, which is taxed very heavily under the Tariff. Those who are engaged in mining do not derive any benefit from protection, and it is only fair that they should be supplied with the machinery they require at the lowest possible rates. In my electorate one mining shaft is being sunk through granite country to a depth of 3,000 feet. This work will involve an expenditure of from &#163;60,000 to &#163;80,000. Another shaft will be sunk to a depth of 2,500 feet, and a third to a depth of 1,800 feet. When these shafts are completed, the companies interested will have to obtain very powerful and expensive machinery. Much of this will have to be imported, and if we impose a heavy duty upon mining machinery we shall largely hamper the operations of those who are engaged in these important enterprises. I should like to see mining machinery admitted free of duty, but, under the circumstances, I shall support the request of the Senate. </para>

          <para>- The honorable member for Perth has stated that the mining machinery employed in Victoria is of the poorest quality, and is far behind the times. Some eighteen or nineteen years ago, I had considerable experience in connexion with mining enterprise in Western Australia, and as a member of the board of directors of one company, and as a shareholder in other companies, I found the directors in every case determined to obtain machinery from England. The result was failure, and ultimately they had to send to Bendigo for their mining equipment. The authority mentioned by the honorable member apparently does not know that different kinds of stone call for the employment of special classes of machinery. I undertake to say that at Bendigo they crush their stone and obtain the gold at less cost than in any other part of Australia. Not only is that so, but they recover all the gold. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curie</inline> has probably been accustomed to deal with ore containing refractory elements, and requiring the use of the cyanide and other processes. Even in this respect, however, Victoria and the other States are quite abreast of the times, and the locallymanufactured machinery is fully as good as, if not better, than the imported article. I can quote one instance to show that the imposition of a duty upon machinery will confer considerable advantage. In connexion with certain works we were large importers of cars, and the various parts thereof. The result of the operation of a duty which was imposed upon these was to call attention to the desirableness of manufacturing them locally, and consequently we find to-day that we can manufacture them at very much less than the price of the imported article, plus the duty. Formerly they cost more than &#163;800, but they can now be manufactured for less than that sum. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CONROY</inline>(Werriwa).- Only yesterday the Minister for Trade and Customs declared that the imposition of a duty upon any article increased its price if there was any importation. He also admits that in regard to agricultural and mining machinery there is importation, so that by levying the proposed duty we shall be taxing the farmers and miners to the extent of 15 per -cent. Letters were quoted by the right honorable gentleman to show that the manufacturers of these machines must be -allowed to charge the agriculturists and miners at least an additional 3s. in the &#163;1 for their purchases. Of course, their request is a most natural one. If I were a manufacturer enjoying the benefit of a high protective duty, I could even go to the extent of doubling the wages of my workmen without personal loss. The honorable member for Melbourne has referred to the Bendigo mines. ButI should like to point out to him that the quartz there is a very free-milling one. That is the reason why mining operations there can be carried on cheaper than they can be anywhere else in Australia. A yield of about 4 dwts. to the ton has been found sufficient to pay working expenses. I know of no other place in the Commonwealth where such a free-milling quartz can be obtained in sufficient quantities. Usually the quartz is mixed with pyrites, and consequently the extraction of the gold is more expensive than it otherwise would be. But the question with which we have to deal is whether the present duty increases the price of mining and agricultural machinery, and in this connexion we have the admission of the Minister for Trade and Customs that it does. Surely a duty of 10 per cent., or 2s. in the &#163;1, should be ample for any manufacturer ! To my mind 15 per cent. is far too high a rate to impose. It must also be remembered that every time we increase the cost of mining machinery, we diminish the productivity. The Sydney Colliery Company spent &#163;30, 000 in machinery alone, but it is questionable whether the work would have been proceeded with had there been a duty upon it. </para>

            <para>- Despite what the honorable member asserts, I happen to know that the funds of the company were practically exhausted before they reached the seam of coal. That is an instance in which the operation of a duty would have absolutely prevented production. How will any farmer benefit by the imposition of the proposed duty ? Will he obtain a larger crop because he is compelled to pay &#163;8 or &#163;9 more for each machine that he uses? Yet the Minister for Trade and Customs admits that if the manufacturers cannot raise their prices to that extent they will be unable to continue operations. He is the author of a new doctrine, and one which cannot possibly be expected to mislead the great bulk of the electors. I shall content myself with recording my vote upon this item, and will not trespass upon the time of the committee by discussing the succeeding items. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. SYDNEY</inline>SMITH (Macquarie).The district which I have the honour to represent is keenly interested in the matter under consideration, because it uses machinery to a very large extent. In the case of one large industry established there, I am told that, under the original proposal of the Government, it would have had to pay in duty upon machinery imported just prior to the introduction of the Tariff no less a sum than &#163;15,000 or &#163;20,000. I am glad to say that that industry was started under freetrade conditions, although the Minister for Trade and Customs wished to claim that it commenced its operations as the result of the protection afforded by this Tariff. One consignment of that machinery was in Sydney Harbor three days before the Tariff was submitted, but because an entry was not passed in the interim  duty was charged upon it. The unfair feature in connexion with this part of the schedule is that machinery for. scouring,  carding,  washing, spinning, and finishing the manufacture of fibrous material is exempt from duty. Thus all the appliances required by the woollen manufacturers of Victoria, notwithstanding that they have enjoyed the benefit of a 30 per cent, duty during the last twenty years, in addition to the natural protection afforded them by reason of over-sea freights, have been placed upon the free list, whereas the miners and agriculturists who have to depend largely upon the export of their produce to the markets of the world are to be severely taxed. The natural protection afforded to the woollen manufacturer constitutes the natural drawback to the miner and agriculturist. The latter have to send their surplus products to England and other outside markets and compete with the imports from Prance, Belgium, and Germany, where, according to the Minister for Trade and Customs, low wages and protection reign supreme. I do not ask for any favour, but simply urge that, as regards machinery, the primary producer should be placed upon the same footing as the manufacturers of woollen material in Victoria. Tools of trade of nearly every Victorian industry, which are largely protected in other ways, have been placed on the free list. I have been astonished that the primary producers have received so little consideration at the hands of honorable members. I thought that the representatives of mining and agricultural constituencies would have been sufficiently numerous to succeed in placing mining and agricultural machinery on the free list.  It is impossible for the manufacturers of Victoria, even if they had the greatest skill available, to manufacture patented machinery without the consent of the patentees. Being compelled to import the latest improved machinery, primary producers are charged a duty of 15 per cent., and, therefore, .are seriously handicapped in their efforts to compete in the great markets of the world. A most unjust </para>
        <para class="block">Tariff has been framed. The- miner and the agriculturist are taxed not only on the clothing, boots and shoes,&#39; and everything they require, but also on their machinery. I cannot understand the action of the Government in not agreeing to a reduction &#34; of this duty. In New Zealand, a strong protectionist country, all agricultural and mining machinery is admitted free, because it was found advantageous to encourage the primary producers. But in Australia the primary producers, who are trying to get a footing in the markets ,of the world, are handicapped with a duty on their machinery. I shall vote in favour of the request of the Senate, and if we are defeated in the division, I shall then vote in favour of a reduction in the duty to 12^ per cent. </para>

          <para>- I think it is to the interests of the primary producers to have their machinery manufactured on the spot, and that they should not be dependent on importations from foreign countries. I may tell the honorable member far Macquarie that the primary producers of Victoria have long been under that impression. The primary producers know that the circumstances and conditions of Australia may be altogether different from those of distant countries, and they think it is desirable that we should have a number of artizans and manufacturers here who can not only manufacture but repair machinery required by Australian conditions. What would be the use of primary producers importing machinery, which, if it got out of order, could not be repaired ? Naturally, the process of repair is associated with the process of primary manufacture. It has been found by the primary producers in Victoria that it is to their interests, both in the first instance and afterwards, to use locally made machinery. In Victoria, the local manufacturers are able to produce all the up-to-date agricultural and mining machinery which is required. I do not say that they have yet been called upon to produce all classes of machinery which may be required in all parts of Australia, but they will be able to do so before long, and if they do not, new manufactures will grow up in the States where there are peculiar conditions requiring a special class of machinery. As illustrating the capacity of Victorian manufacturers of mining machinery, I may tell the honorable member for Barrier that recently the directors of a large mine at Charters Towers called for tenders all over Australia for the manufacture and erection of a very large battery and plant. They requested a Bendigo firm to send in a tender, and it was in a position within 48 hours to tender for the required plant, showing that in Victoria there have grown up a number of manufacturers who are not only capable of supplying the needs of Victoria, but who are able to a very large extent to supply the needs of various parts of Australia. </para>

            <para>- They do, because there may be directors of some companies who are interested in the importation of machinery from outside countries. It is highly desirable that an inducement should be offered to these companies to use Australian productions, and a 15 per cent. duty is only a light impediment in the way of importing machinery and other requirements. To give another illustration of the capacity of the Victorian manufacturers of mining machinery, I may mention that quite recently I was informed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry</inline> Gore, a director of the Victorian Estates Company, who have a number of mines at Moolort, that originally they imported their machinery from England, at an enormous cost, but that after it had been erected and thousands of pounds paid in duty, it was found that it could have been made here at less cost. He told me that the next order for machinery was given to the Phoenix Foundry at Ballarat, and that it cost less than did the imported machinery. </para>

            <para>- In the first in stance, the London directors refused to give an order to the local manufacturers, and went to the expense of paying the duty. The existence of a duty helps to draw the attention of directors and others who are interested in the erection of machinery to the fact that it can be made locally. I submit that the duties on this line have been reduced so very largely from the original Victorian standard, that the time has now come when we ought to say that we have arrived at the irreducible minimum. </para>

On one occasion he asked that a machine to cut soap should be admitted free. Does not the same principle apply in one case as in the other? On another occasion the honorable member for Melbourne Ports asked that a machine to make glass bottles should be put on the free list. The miner or the agriculturist is just as important as the man who makes soap or the man who makes glass bottles, and if, by the logic of those honorable members, it is necessary in the interest of these manufacturers that their machinery should come in free, why not allow the miner to have his machinery free ? The honorable and learned member for Bendigo used the argument that it did not pay the manufacturers to make the machinery for these two industries. </para>

Soon after the House first met we were all invited by the Melbourne manufacturers to visit their establishments. I accepted the invitation, and I assert that a man cannot visit a manufactory of any size in this city without finding that the indispensable machinery has been imported. Even rice cannot be cleaned here without using imported machinery. The head of the firm of Robert Harper and Co. is, I suppose, a good business man. In his manufactory we saw an abandoned Melbourne boiler, side by side with Huddersfield boilers. I asked him why he used foreign articles, subject to duty. </para>

            <para>- Why was it not replaced with a locally-made boiler ? Thinking that the information might be of some advantageto <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harper,</inline> I mentioned that the honorable members for Bendigo and Melbourne Ports would tell him that he could get boilers made here, and that it was onlyprejudice which made him use an imported boiler. I said to him - &#34; Those two honorable members assert that you can obtain cheaper and better boilers from local manufacturers, and that it is only prejudice that causes people to go elsewhere for such goods.&#34; He did not take my advice. As a business man, it paid him to import his machinery, notwithstanding that he had to pay &#163;1,500 duty upon it. He told me that he paid the duty and did not grumble. I replied - &#34;But you want a duty on rice to make up for it.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harper</inline> informed me that he paid &#163;1,500 duty on two boilers and some other machinery which I saw, and that statement was made in the presence of the honorable member for Darling and several others. In the same establishment we saw machinery which had been imported from Hungary being used to separate rice. It is true that, in some parts of the Commonwealth, excellent machinery is manufactured. Our mining companies use locallymade machinery whenever they can do so, and there is an advantage in doing so. If I were a director or a manager of a company I should obtain locally-made machinery - even if I had to pay a slightly increased price for it in the absence of any duty - provided that it was as good as any I could import, for the reason that there is an advantage in being able to supervise its manufacture, and to see that everything is correct. </para>

            <para>- No, I object to any such compulsory increase in price. Those who use machinery should be given an absolutely free hand. The honorable member for Moira said that a duty of 15 per cent. on agricultural machinery had a protective incidence, whilst a duty of 10 per cent. would be only a revenue-producing one. My opinion is that a duty of 15 per cent. on mining machinery is not of a protective character. Its imposition will not cause all machinery required in Australia to be obtained from local manufacturers. The mere existence of such a duty would not cause some men to have their orders carried out here. The engineers are asking for duties ranging from 30 to 35 per cent. </para>

            <para>- When this matter was before us on a former occasion, I, in company with other honorable members, received a communication from the engineers of Melbourne, urging that duties ranging from 30 to 35 per cent. should be imposed. Is&#39; it wise to tax mining machinery to the extent of 15 per cent. solely for revenue purposes? If it is desired to get at the mining companies they can be reached by means of an income tax. I admit that while we have power under the Constitution to impose such a tax, we are not likely to use that power ; but if, for example, the Commonwealth obtained &#163;10,000 a year less from Broken Hill companies in respect of the duty on mining machinery, the Government of New South Wales would be able to impose upon them an increased income tax. At the present time they pay an income tax of only 2&#189; per cent.,a rate which as applied to mining companies is, in my opinion, rather low.What has taken place under this Tariff? Since its introduction one company in Broken Hill has been required to pay &#163;6,800 by way of duty on machinery and other things. That company is now importing electrical and other machinery, which, it is asserted, cannot be obtained here, and upon which they will have to pay within the next few days about &#163;1,000 by way of duty. During the last twelve months 1,700 men have had to leave Broken Hill owing to the lack of employment. I admit that that want of employment is not due mainly to this Tariff. It has been caused to a large extent by the reduction in the price of lead ; but is it wise for. us to tax a company to the extent of &#163;6,800 in ten months, and thus make it more difficult for it to carry on operations ? The company to which I refer has made during the ten months in question a profit of &#163;70,000, and the &#163;6,800 paid by them by way of customs duties is equivalent to about 10 per cent. upon that sum.In urging the committee to allow the mining companies to obtain their machinery as cheaply as possible, I do not ask that all taxation on machinery should be remitted, althoughI should willingly vote, as I, have done, against every item of taxation. If the mining companies can obtain better work in Bendigo than elsewhere, let them do so. We have heard a great deal about a battery made in Bendigo ; but, although the Broken Hill market has been free for years to the manufacturers of machinery in that city, how much machinery have they sent there ? Is it due to blind prejudice, like that displayed by Harper and Co. - who preferred to pay &#163;1,500 in duty rather than have their machinery locally made - that so little machinery has been obtainedfrom Bendigo by the mining companies in Broken Hill? All the indispensable machinery used in the hat, boot, rice-cleaning, and many other manufactories in Victoria, has been imported. Iventure to say that without that machinery not one of those manufactories would carry on. </para>

I do not care much whether soap-cutting or glass- bottle-making machinery is allowed to come in free or not, although I should vote to make it free: but I think it is of the utmost importance that the duty on mining machinery should be removed. Upon the same grounds as those on which the honorable and learned member for Bendigo was prepared to vote against the duty on soapcutting machinery, I am ready to vote to make mining machinery free. </para>

          <para>- I feel that I ought to raise a protest against these duties. Whatever the honorable and learned member for Bendigo may say, there can be no doubt that these duties will act harshly in their incidence upon the greater portion of the primary producers of the Commonwealth. It seems to me that it is of the utmost consequence that in a country like this, which for many years to come will have to depend upon its primary industries - and upon the prices obtained for its products in the markets of the world - the producers should be enabled to obtain their means of production as cheaply as possible. I was speaking quite recently to an expert from England - I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas,</inline> a gentleman who is interested in the proposed bonus on iron - and he assured me that England to-day can compete both as to skill and enterprise with every country in the world. I was delighted to obtain from him such testimony to the splendid capabilities for production which are operating to-day in England. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo has told us - and it is a most astounding statement for any honorable member to make - that a duty is necessary in order to develop mechanical skill.Follo wing the Socratic method, one needs only to put to him a question in order to show how absurd is the statement. If Tariffs develop mechanical skill, why is it that those countries which have the most perfect system of protection are at the very lowest ebb in that respect ? </para>

            <para>- The honorable and learned member for Bendigo said so. He said that we require to impose these duties in order to develop this skill and ingenuity, and that we cannot have those qualities operating in our arts and sciences in Australia unless by means of protective duties. I have said in reply, that in Canada, where they have the most perfect system of protection, it has not developed this skill. The honorable member for Bourke asks - &#34;What about America?&#34; Honorable members opposite have only one country to which they can point, and that is America. The reply is : that there is only one America in the world, and that no other nation in the world can be like America, no matter how much they may try, and no matter what duties they may impose. There is no use in quoting America at the end of every verse and chapter of this debate. Why not go to other countries of of the world, where the protective system has been in operation even longer than in America? Why do not honorable members quote the European countries - the celebrated Belgium about which we have heard sp much, Germany, France, or Russia <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> In none of these . countries will they find that the people have acquired anything like the skill and ingenuity which the people have acquired in free-trade England. I say we do not need to argue upon the contention that it is necessary to impose these protective duties in order to give people a particular kind of brain, and to bring about a particular kind of development. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo also told us - and it is as well that the people of Bendigo should understand  the position  - that we require this modicum of protection only as a kind of ad vertisement, and in order to prevent Bendigo directors sending to England to get worse machinery than can begot in Bendigo. The honorable and learned member&#39;s statements were to the effect that in Bendigo they can beat the world in the manufacture of mining machinery ; that people  who  have any sense at all always go to Bendigo for their requirements ; but that because of the perversity and senselessness of the directors of large enterprises there, he desires that these duties should be imposed as a slight impediment - but especially as an advertisement for the Bendigo manufacturing firms. The honorable and learned member to-day whittled down the case for Bendigoprotection to an absurd point in saying that they want only a slight impediment, and do not desire to prohibit the importation of the machinery that will compete with the Bendigo machinery. If protection is a good thing, why not build a wall which will shut out all machinery made elsewhere? When we can supply the people of Australia, who require this machinery, very much better than can anybody outside, would it not be the greatest kindness to the people of Australia to restrict them to the Australian market, which is so infinitely superior to idi others, and I apprehend cheaper too ? Surely the honorable and learned member has not had the courage to state his case as he ought to state it. If I believed, as he does, that we have only to tax the people enough to &#39;make them prosperous, and to give them acute brains, ingenuity, and mechanical skill ; if I believed, as he evidently does, that we have only to shut out the foreign article to give the people inside the ring a cheaper and a better article, I would not argue as the honorable and learned member has done to-day.  His  apologetics were miserable in the extreme, and they sound strangely when contrasted with the triumphant  declaration which he made on his entrance into this Parliament. Then he sounded a positive note of absolute triumph. To-day he has nothing but miserable apologies  for the system in which he believes, and which he says is going to effect this great revolution in the mechanical skill of the workmen of Australia. We ask simply that the people may be allowed to go to whichever market suits them best. Honorable members have to-day been taunting the honorable member for Barrier, because he said that if he were buying machinery he would probably go to Bendigo for it. I see nothing inconsistent in that. My own experience of the practical aspect of these matters is that whenever we find a protectionist talking loudest about protection, we shall find him hunting with the greatest keenness for the free-trade market for himself. I undertake to say that there are not three honorable members on the other side who, when they require a suit of clothes, will inquire particularly if they can get them of cloth made in Australia. They always go where they can get best value for their money, and if they find the imported cloth is cheaper and better, they go for it every time. The Victorian mills could be kept going night and day if the protectionists of Victoria were sufficiently patriotic to wear only the locally-made material. It is the essence of free-trade that a man should be allowed to go to any market he chooses. If he chooses voluntarily to buy at a higher price in the local market, all the more credit to his patriotism, but is quite another thing, by means of duties imposed by </para>

        <para class="block">Ministers with the assistance of their majority, to compel a man to pay a certain price for what he requires when he really has not the means to do it. I protest that the argument of the honorable and learned member for Bendigo to-day was of the most feeble description. Either he believes that protection is a good thing for Bendigo or he does not, and if he does, why docs he come here as a miserable apologist for it, and say that all we want is a slight impediment to the entrance of machinery from foreign parts ? What does the honorable and learned member mean by &#34; foreign parts&#34;? We have been told that all the competing machinery comes from Canada and America. Does the honorable and learned member believe that Canada is a foreign country ? He has been foremost in the federation movement ; he is an Imperialist of the well-known brand and order, and yet we hear him talking of England and Canada, and every other British country, as though they were foreign countries, and should therefore be kept at a distance when our manufactures are concerned. I say that I welcome the competition of these people, who live within the same Empire as ourselves, and who have something to send us which it will be to our advantage to receive. That is the Imperialism that I believe in - the Imperialism of free-trade, which is the only safe and sound policy to apply so far as our trade relations are concerned. I protest against the honorable and learned member speaking of these portions of the Empire as foreign countries. I feel that we ought to accept the request of the Senate. It is a moderate proposal, framed with a knowledge of the requirements of this great continent, of the relative importance to be attached to our primary industries, and having reference to our development. I think, therefore, that we ought readily to agree to make the requested amendment, instead of quarrelling with the Senate in this matter, as Ministers propose to do. </para>

          <para>- I do not propose to say very much upon this matter, which was thrashed out when these items were previously before the committee some months ago. On that occasion I voted for a duty of 15 per cent. as against the duty of 25 per cent. then proposed by the Government. To-day, I am inclined to accept the suggestion submitted from the other side that the duty should be 12&#189; per cent., because I think this is an opportunity to meet the </para>

        <para class="block">Senate, and to compromise matters with that Chamber. Though a supporter of the Government, I am not prepared to say that they have dealt very liberally so far with the requests submitted by the Senate. It is quite true that they have proposed to meet the Senate by accepting a particular word instead of the word originally used, and by agreeing to the request to make amendments consequential upon a misprint ; but I ask the Government to go a little further on this occasion, and, at least, accept the suggestion of the Opposition to compromise matters by agreeing to a duty of 12&#189; per cent., and allow the division which is about to be taken upon this motion to decide other motions dealing with duties under this heading. </para>

      <para class="block">The desire of the Senate is that these machines should be subject to duty, but we cannot agree to that. We are not slavishly following our own ideas, because we proposed in the first instance that type-setting machines should be dutiable.

        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BROWN</inline>(Canobolas). - I am afraid that the Minister&#39;s explanation is not very lucid. The Senate is proposing to come to the assistance of the Government in providing revenue by placing these machines upon the dutiable list, but it would almost seem as if the Minister were ranging himself on the side of the free-traders. I should like to know what reason the Minister can advance for exempting from duty type-setting machines which are imported by the wealthy newspaper proprietors for the purpose of displacing labour, when he is readyto tax the poor farmers by imposing a duty upon their agricultural implements? </para>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. MAHON</inline>(Coolgardie). - I think the Minister might be a little more explicit concerning his proposal to disagree. I do not quite agree with the honorable member for Canobolas, because the Minister has been consistent throughout in imposing taxation on the poor, and allowing the rich to go free. Nobody except the rich newspaper proprietors could afford to buy linotypes, but the type used by the poor printers was subjected to a duty by the Government. </para>

          <para>- Several good supporters of the Government, including the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, the great apostle of protection in Victoria, voted against the Government in regard to the paper duty. I think linotypes and other type-setting machines should be dutiable. I regret, however, that the duty is not likely to yield much revenue, because most of the large newspaper proprietors already have all the machinery they require in their offices. I shall certainly vote in favour of acceding to the Senate&#39;s request. </para>

            <para>- Honorable members will recollect that the words &#34;manganese steel parts &#34; were contained in the Tariff as it left this Chamber without any special definition. The Senate, however, has defined those parts to mean &#34; parts that are made of steel containing not less than 1 per cent. of manganese, and that are used for and worn in grinding, or crushing, or pulverizing material by coming in actual contact therewith.&#34; That is an elaborate definition ; but, of course, the desire underlying it is to protect what are generally known as manganese steel parts. In a great number of cases it will be found that steel parts, which cannot properly be described as manganese steelparts, contain more than 1 per cent. of manganese. I think that the provision was chiefly intended to apply to what are known as Hadfield&#39;s steel parts. These, I am informed, contain 14 per cent. of manganese. If we extend the exemption to all steel parts containing only 1 per cent. of manganese, I think we shall be extending it in a way that we do not desire. After conferring with my officers, I am inclined to believe that if we insert the figures &#34;10 &#34;in lieu of &#34; 1,&#34; we shall be mailing all the provision that is necessary. </para>

It appears to me that the whole provision is qualified by the words &#34;that are used for, and worn in grinding, or crushing, or pulverizing material by coming in actual contact therewith.&#34; If 1 per cent. of manganese is sufficient to temper steel so that it can be used in contact with these materials, the provision is right as it stands. By substituting 10 per cent., the committtee may altogether nullify the Senate&#39;s intention. </para>

          <para>- Originally we proposed a duty of 3d. per gallon, which was shown to be very high, and which was reduced to&#189;d. The proposal of the Senate is that solar and residual oils shall be made free. If these articles are imported they ought to pay some duty, and we think that &#189;d. per gallon is a sufficiently low rate to charge. </para>

        <para class="block">Trade and Customs pointed out that liquid fuel might come into competition with coal, and for that extraordinary reason he suggested that we ought to impose a duty. I have read statements in which honorable members on the other side have rejoiced over the possibility of the discovery of petroleum in Western Australia. If they really fear that it would compete with coal they must hope that the report that it is likely to be found in that State is untrue. Others of us hope that liquid fuel may come into use on suburban railways. It would do away with all the smoke, which would be a very great boon. It would also be of great service to the men who are engaged in iron manufactures. Iron can be heated much more easily by the use of liquid fuel than by any other means, and if we are going to establish ironworks it is an absolute necessity that the fuel should be cheap. It would be of very great advantage to many machine manufacturers and others to be able to get cheap liquid fuel. I have spoken to two manufacturers on the possibility of its coming into use, and each of them said that he was making an inquiry&#39; with a view of ascertaining whether its use might notbe of considerable advantage to his business, and that if it did give the advantage which was claimed for it, it would be a great boon. Both manufacturers expressed the hope that when that time arrived they would be able to get their supply free of duty. It is worth only 30s. a ton, f.o.b., and the duty is equal to 10s. per ton. </para>

            <para>- If the use of liquid fuel would cheapen the cost of transportation, it would be a very fine thing for all the coast towns. Surely we are not going to cling to an old style of fuel when a new one is introduced. I believe that in the Mudgee district, right down towards the head of the Colo, we may hope for the discovery of oil at some time or other. Surely the honorable member for Newcastle would not close up the works lest the oil might be used in place of coal in some directions ? At a time when we are trying to introduce motor engines with a view of opening up communication with Central Australia, would it not be a good thing if liquid fuel, which is their motive power, could be brought in as cheaply as possible? Under any circumstances, does not my honorable friend think that the duty ought not to be more than&#188;d. per gallon ? In some parte of Western Australia and South Australia, where the. supply of wood is scarce, it would be a great advantage to. be able to use liquid fuel for engines. </para>

          <para>- I hope that the Government will not insist upon refusing to make the requested amendment. When I was endeavouring to get a supply for the purpose of driving an engine, I found that the duty in Victoria was just sufficient to keep liquid fuel out of the market. I also find the federal duty of &#189;d. per gallon effective in keeping the article out of the market. No fuel oil can be obtained in Australia to-day. It costs from 13s. to 15s. per ton at the port of shipment, the freight and landing charges run from 15s. to 18s. per ton, and the duty of &#189;d. per gallon is equivalent to 10s. 5d. per ton. I do not think I am justified in voting for a duty of 50 per cent. on the cost price of an article which is coming into general use. When we learn from the honorable member for Melbourne that Messrs. Claus Spreckles and Co., of SanFrancisco, are about to fit up their steamers running to Sydney for the use of fuel oil, surely we are not going to impose a prohibitive duty of this character ? In an article which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Mining Standard</inline> of 24th April last, it is stated that a duty of&#189;d. per gallon is equal to 10s. 5d. per ton, or about 50 per cent. of its capital value, and that that rate is absolutely prohibitive. I draw special attention to that statement, because the Treasurer is of opinion that a duty of &#189;d. per gallon is equal only to about 25 per cent. If he is able to secure a duty of 25 per cent. upon this line, I take it that he will be satisfied. </para>

          <para>There is no possible chance of this class of oil being produced in the Commonwealth ; our only source of oil supply is from kerosene shales, and the residue from the distillation of these is a slag, and not an oil, and no distilled oil could be produced at a cost low enough to allow of its being used for fuel purposes. </para>
          <para>All classes of the community would directly or indirectly benefit by the introduction of fuel oil, as by its use the cost of haulage and manufacture will be materially reduced. One ton weight of fuel oil is equal in calorific value to two tons of the best coal, and could, therefore, be carried at half the cost. </para>

The low-grade propositions at Broken Hill, Bendigo and Ballarat, to say nothing of longer distances such as Kalgoorlie, Cobar, Charters Towers, etc., could frequently be worked economically with fuel oil, when they have to be abandoned under present conditions, and thousands of extra miners would probably be employed. </para>

          <para>Becauseresidual oil would enable the brown coal deposits of Australia to be worked successfully, as it is necessary to have some substance of this description in order to make briquettes from it, and residual oil is the cheapest and best article for the purpose. The manufacture of these briquettes, and the production thereby of a cheaper and more economical fuel, would be of immense benefit to the manufacturing industries of Australia. </para>

        <para class="block">The last paragraph should appeal to the honorable member for Melbourne Ports who desires to keep the workmen of Victoria employed. It is especially interesting to Victoria where immense deposits of brown coal exist. In order to make that coal a marketable commodity, it is only necessary for residual oil to be introduced and used. Very recently a gentleman requested me to obtain for him samples of brown coal from Gippsland. He desired to see whether it could not be manufactured into briquettes and placed upon the South Australian market, but I was unable to obtain any large quantity for him. This matter should come home to the Minister for Trade and Customs, who is always anxious to see the people of South Australia placed upon an equal footing with those of other States. If the importation of liquid fuel into Australia is encouraged, South Australia will be greatly benefited, for she has large quantitiesof shale in the far north. Reference was made to those deposits by the State Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jenkins,</inline> when he said that although his Government would not undertake now to enter upon the iron industry, they might do so in future, because they had a large body of low-grade coal, and it was possible that a superior kind of coal might be found. </para>

The Indian Government will pay 30s. per ton for as much of this fuel as they can obtain, and taking this as the cost to Australia (which is much further from Borneo or Sumatra than India) it would cost 40s. laid down at the sea port with the duty added, which is prohibitive. </para>

          <para>- I have not troubled the committee much in the discussion of these requests of the Senate ; but I think this is a subject upon which the committee does not seem to have been well informed. When the matter was previously discussed here I did my utmost, as did also the honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn,</inline> to point out the great importance that this liquid fuel was beginning to assume in the manufacturing world. It seems to me that if we refuse to make the requested amendment to exempt liquid fuel from duty we shall be setting our backs against the march of enlightenment and progress in manufacturing methods. It is definitely ascertained now that this fuel must in the near future play a very important part in manufactures. I think there is nothing in. the argument that its use is likely to affect in any disastrous degree the value of the coal deposits of this country. In all these inventions it would appear that that which we immediately fear is the very thing that never comes to pass. It was believed that the introduction of the steam-rail car would mean that horses would no longer be required, but we find that subsequent to its introduction more horses have been employed than ever before. So I say that upon the introduction of this liquid fuel we shall find that more coal will be used than has ever been used before. This fuel has some specific advantages over coal and for certain classes of work, and in certain localities it will be very much to the advantage of those who require steam power to use it. The cost of the freight upon it will be much less than upon coal, and it is also more easy to handle. Again in many respects it is a much safer fuel than either coal or wood. That must be evident from the fact that at a moment&#39;s notice, by simply turning a cock, we can stop a fire in case of an accident due to inability to get water into a boiler or anything of that sort. Any one who has had a practical acquaintance with large works must know the difficulty  and danger attaching to the operation called &#34;drawing the fires &#34; in the case of accidents where ordinary fuel is used. I have here a very valuable article, appearing in  the  issue of <inline font-style="italic">Mature</inline> for 19th June, 1902, upon the subject of liquid fuel for steam purposes. The writer is not like some of the authorities quoted pro and eon on this and other subjects, whose information is worked up to buttress or support one side or the other of the fiscal contention. He is simply dealing with the subject from the point of view of one who hails a modern advance in methods of manufacture. He says - </para>

          <para>The  possibility  of burning a liquid fuel with very great advantage in most circumstances, as compared with a solid fuel, has been so long recognised, that it is astonishing the practice has not been more generally adopted. The success that has been gained in the hist few years, however, will undoubtedly lead to a greatly extended use in the near future. </para>

        <para class="block">He goes on to explain the economical difficulties of its use which, he says, have been overcome. He says - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>For this reason, engineers who have perfected the methods of burning liquid fuel have always considered the possibility of its use becoming limited in certain circumstances, and all modernappliances are so constructed that with slight trouble coal alone may be used in them to the best advantage. One of the great claims to be considered in favour of liquid fuel is the ease with which the burners can be extinguished, and the coal fires substituted, thus enabling consumers to take every advantage of fluctuations- in the - price of both fuels. For marine purposes this is most desirable, since at many ports liquid fuel would be far mora economical to ship for boiler use than a suitable steam coal, whilst the vessel trading from a port-such as Cardiff or Newport - would naturally replenish her bunkers with the steam coal at hand. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">This is very largely what the supporters of the requested amendment have contended. It is claimed for liquid fuel that it has distinct advantages in certain directions, and, when we have been spending so many months in trying to assist various manufacturing industries, we should not put an embargo upon certain manufacturers by actually prohibiting the use of this fuel, for that is what the high rate of duty proposed by the Government actually amounts to. The writer of the article, to which I have referred, goes on to give an analysis of liquid fuel and to explain its use, and he shows it to be a very economical fuel, indeed, contrasting favourably with coal in most instances. He says further, on the subject of a definite trial of liquid fuel - </para>

          <para>We are indebted to the carefully recorded results obtained by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Urquhart,</inline> ou the Graz and Tzaritzin  railway, for probably the best published figures of the relative merits of solid and liquid fuel. In the winter he found that liquid fuel was 41 per cent, in weight, and 55 per cent, in cost, better than anthracite coal ; or compared with bituminous coal, 49 per cent, by weight, and 61 per cent, in cost, better. This was under the worst climatic conditions, and, as might be expected, in summer better results still  were obtained  . It must be borne in mind that these figures were deduced from the work of a large number of engines. </para>

            <para>- I do not know the price. I know that wood fuel is very cheap in many parts of the  world, and in many parts of the Commonwealth. I know also that in some of the mining districts of the Commonwealth it is very dear. I know that to my own cost, because I have been in a mine which has been pumping for the last eighteen months - and pumping my money away at the same time - and the expense has largely been due to the use of wood fuel. In the case of a mine like that, and of many mines throughout the Commonwealth, where it is difficult to get wood fuel, this liquid fuel would be an important assistance. Again, liquid fuel would be of very great assistance to farmers who drive small engines in connexion with farming operations, such as chaff-cutting, and so forth. I believe it will no more interfere with the great interest with which the honorable member for Newcastle is concerned - the coal deposits of Newcastle - than  with the man in the moon. All these are things which we require to assist us in our manufactures, in keeping us up to date, and in enabling us to march abreast of the times. We must take advantage of every modern improvement and invention, and it will be a suicidal policy for this committee to hold out for the very high rate of duty which Ministers persuaded us to adopt on a previous occasion. It does not appear to be a very high duty, but in proportion to the value of the material, it is a very serious tax. The Prime Minister, when approached at home on the subject of the duty upon this liquid fuel, and asked to allow it to come in free in the interests &#34;of mining investors in 1 Western Australia and elsewhere, made the most absurd reply that I ever heard upon this question. He is reported to have said that to persist in what was proposed would be to set the coal-miners against the goldminers. I do not think that in this matter we have  anything  to do with either coalminers or gold-miners, but with the&#39; whole body of the people of this Commonwealth, who are interested in steam, in manufactures, and in enabling the Commonwealth to produce as cheaply as possible all that she requires.. I repeat that it will be suicidal for this committee, by holding out for the excessive duty proposed, to shut out this liquid fuel, which, on the best information we possess, is shown to be a coming thing, which must play an important part wherever it is found necessary to raise steam or use steam power. There is nothing in the contention that it is likely to interfere with our coal mines. This fuel will be used for raising steam where it will not be raised if we have to depend upon the use of coal. For the reasons I have given I hope the committee will agree to alter its original decision and accept the requested amendment of the Senate. In addition to its use as fuel, this material has been used  with very great advantage in some cities of the world for pouring upon the streets, instead of water, for the purpose of laying dust. The experiment in some of the cities of America has been reported upon very highly, and for this purpose it is reported to be cheap, expeditious, and efficacious. If we could only obtain the material cheaply enough it could be used for a similar purpose here, when very frequently we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of water. Its advantage in this respect is due to the fact that owing to its natural characteristics it does not evaporate, but is mixed with the material forming the streets. For the reasons I have stated, I hope honorable members will not be induced &#163;o impose a duty upon this article, in order to guard against something that will never happen. </para>

            <para>- No; but the honorable member spoke before on this subject. I wish he had been out of the chamber at that time, as we should then have been enabled to get this article admitted free. A mistake was made by the Government originally in putting this on the same line as kerosene with a duty of 3d. per gallon. When the Treasurer found that he had made a glaring mistake he agreed with me that it should be made free. Then the honorable member who represents the coal-fields district of Newcastle arrived, and sat near the right honorable gentleman for some time. There was a sudden change in the Treasurer&#39;s opinion, and I can only surmise that it was due to the vicinity of the honorable member for Newcastle. If the honorable member had not entered the chamber at the time this article would have been free of duty. I should be sorry to characterize the fears of the honorable member for Newcastle as absurd, but he is certainly displaying an extraordinary degree of nervousness. In 1900 the total output of coal and lignite was 750,000,000 tons, and the quantity available for export 180,000,000 tons, whereas the total output of solar oil and liquid fuel was only 20,000,000 tons, of which only 5,000,000 was available for export. Although I know that in some of the Great Eastern Company&#39;s locomotives oil is used as fuel without the admixture of coal, I have seen it stated in a publication called <inline font-style="italic">Petroleum</inline> that very good results have been obtained by mixing the oil with coal. Therefore the use of oil, by increasing the efficacy of coal, is likely to increase its consumption. I hope that the honorable member for Newcastle will help us to secure the reduction of this duty. </para>

            <para>- No ; we were absolutely beaten in the attempt to secure as a compromise the reduction of the duty to&#188;d. per gallon. The present rate of duty,&#189;d. per gallon, is equivalent to 33 per cent., so that a duty of&#188;d. would be equivalent to 16&#189; per cent., and I am informed that the oil cannot be imported under a higher rate of duty than 10 per cent. <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline></para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BROWN</inline>(Canobolas).- It cannot be contended that this duty is necessary to encourage the local production of these oils, because we have no oil mines within the Commonwealth, so far as our present information goes. But the objection appears to have been raised that solar and residual oil is likely to compete in public favour as a fuel with coal, and that to protect the coal mining industry we should legislate against the importation of liquid fuel.From the inquiries which I have made, the fear that the importation of liquid fuel will reduce the consumption of coal appears to be groundless. The honorable memberfor Newcastle will remember that when we were both members of the State Parliament a leading politician there opposed the construction of the electric tram which now runs down George street, upon the ground that it would take away employment from the &#39;buses, and injure the farming community by reducing the quantity of horse feed required in the metropolis. Electric trams have now, however, been laid in George, Pitt, and Castlereagh streets, and the system has been extended to many of the suburbs; but, so far as I can gather, the consumption of horse feed in Sydney is larger to-day than it was before electric trams were known there. Similarly, I think it will be found that the introduction of liquid oil will bring about an increased consumption of coal, and thus materially assist the coalmining industry. I understand that this oil is very suitable as a fuel in remote places where coal, because of the cost of transport, cannot be used, and where wood is scarce. In my own electorate, and in other parts of the inland districts of New South Wales, machinery is largely used for pumping water from wells, tanks, and rivers, and to do other farm and station work. It would be impossible to use coal to generate the power required, and oil engines are therefore generally employed, because of. their simplicity and cheapness in working. </para>

            <para>- I am informed that it can and will be used. If machinery is to be used for the development of farming, grazing, and mining in remote districts, it can be used only where cheap fuel is obtainable. In most places, coal would be altogether too expensive a fuel, and, therefore, if no other fuel could be obtained, machinery would not be used there. But if a cheaper fuel can be obtained, the assistance which will be given to the development of these industries by the use of machinery will indirectly lead to a very large consumption of coal in various manufacturing processes in places where it can be profitably used. In this connexion, I might instance the history of the Cobar copper mine, where originally they employed wood for smelting purposes, but the process was so expensive that they had to suspend operations. With the extension of the railway to Cobar, however, they were able to obtain coke, and to carry on their operations profitably, the matter which was made locally being sent to Lithgow for further treatment. Although a comparatively small quantity of coal is used at Cobar, the various processes connected with the refining of the ore, which are carried out in other places, requires the use of a very large quantity of coal, and in the same way the development of mining, pastoral, and agricultural industries by the aid of machinery will increase the consumption of coal. An article, which appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> last Tuesday, shows that, whereas the consumption of oil in California up to June, four years ago, was about 1,000 gallons per annum, it has now increased to 1,000,000 gallons per annum, and the honorable member for West Sydney pointed out that by the use of oil on their roadways they are able to control the dust fiend. If it were possible to keep down the dust in cities like Melbourne and Sydney, business people would effect a great saving, and all who live or are employed in them would be greatly convenienced. The protectionists have accepted duties of 15 per cent. as providing reasonable protection to many of the main lines of industry, such as the manufacture of machinery, and I think, therefore, that 15 per cent. would be a very fair rate to impose on these oils, even from a protective point of view. As they are so largely used to promote the infant industries of our back country, I should like to see them introduced free of duty, but under no circumstances should the duty be more than about 15 per cent. </para>

          <para>- I am under the impression that residual oil is not liquid fuel, although the discussion has been conducted on the assumption that it is. The oil used for liquid fuel purposes is the crude product of the wells before it is subjected to the refining process. Residual oil is used for gas-making purposes, and large quantities are utilized by the Metropolitan Gas Company of Melbourne. I know that liquid fuel is the oil as it comes from the wells in Borneo or Russia. Two trial shipments of crude oil from Russia and Borneo respectively have been sent to Australia for use as liquid fuel. If residual oil is not liquid fuel, I can see no advantage in reducing the duty. </para>

        <para class="block">The original proposal of the Government was that the duty upon this item should be 1s. per cwt., but without a division the committee adopted a rate of 9d. per cwt. We are now asked to reduce that to 6d. per cwt. That the present duty is not a prohibitive one is evidenced by the fact, that during the past six months we have collected &#163;20,000 from this source, or at the rate of &#163;40,000 per annum. If the reduction requested be made, unless there is a much larger importation, we shall sustain a loss of revenue of at least &#163;13,000 a year. Cement is nowbeing manufactured in most of the States, and I am informed that in Queensland the industry is rapidly expanding. Moreover in connexion with an article of this sort we must realize that our manufacturers can only command the Australian market, whilst those of Europe are able to send their surplus stocks here, and to sell them at a very low rate indeed. In this connexion I am sorry to say that the Metropolitan Board of Works have recently accepted a tender for a considerable quantity of German cement at a price which shows that the contract must have been cut very fine indeed. </para>

            <para>- But a contract was let a few weeks ago at a much lower rate. I repeat that cement is being produced very largely in the different States, and in view of the conditions under which our manufacturers labour as compared with those of other countries who are able to send their surplus stocks here, and to sacrifice them, we should be acting very unwisely if we reduced the duty at present operating.

Thus the illiteracy of the masses will be increased, and they will be more likely to fall in with protectionist view&#39;s, seeing that they will be unable to distinguish between right and wrong.

We have here a state of trade which is certain to revive the old system, and should that happen steamers and sailing vessels would be only too glad to take cement as ballast. The volume of trade is not going to be nearly as great as it has been, so that freights will be reduced, competition increased, and the difference in favour of the local manufacturer consequently lessened. </para>

          <para>- Under the Tariff as it was framed by the committee cameosand precious stones unset were allowed to come in free. There are practical objections to acceding to the request of the Senate. I think that while some cameos and precious stones would pay duty, a large number would be introduced in a small compass, and so the honest trader, who would be willing to pay the duty, would be placed at a great disadvantage. The imposition of a duty would also have a serious effect on the manufacturing jewellery business here, because jewellery made up with precious stones, and unset preciousstones, would come in at practically the same rate. We know that the value of the made-up article, as a rule, is very little more than the value of the jewels it contains. I think it would be unwise to impose a duty which it would be very difficult indeed to collect ; which would cause a great amount of fraud,and which would act injuriously to one of our industries. Under these circumstances, I move - </para>

          <para>- Unfortunately the Senate does not. I am sorry that we did not lower the duty from 25 to 12 or 10 per cent., because at that rate it does not pay a man to smuggle. When it is remembered how easy it is for a man to introduce a large quantity of jewellery in a carpet bag, it will be seen how utterly impossible it is to collect the higher rate of 25 per cent. I have not the slightest doubt that the effect of fixing the duty on some classes of jewellery as high as we did has been to encourage smuggling, and so deprive the Commonwealth of considerable revenue. It must be apparent to every one that a man could land in a small handbag all the cameos and precious stones which were wanted. Under the most rigid system of Customs supervision we could have, it would be impossible to collect a duty on such articles-. Therefore it is one of those cases in which, for practical reasons, we must refuse to accept the amendment requested by the Senate. </para>

        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir MALCOLM</inline>McEACHARN (Melbourne). - I think that the Senate made a mistake in regard to this duty, and that the misunderstanding arose owing to the action of an honorable senator who asked those in the trade whether anything could be done for them by imposing a duty. It was suggested that a duty upon cut opals might assist the trade. The honorable senator made a mistake, and I hope and believe that the Senate will be prepared to agree to what we propose now to do. I have a petition - of course, it is too late to present it now - signed by 100 persons in the trade, urging that the Government should be supported in their action. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports has a petition signed by 200 workmen, requesting the committee to disagree with the Senate&#39;s proposal. </para>

          <para>- Honorable members will recollect that we had a very long discussion with regard to the proposed composite rates on this item, and that we ultimately decided that a duty of 30 per cent. should be imposed. We are now requested to reduce the rate to 20 per cent. I am afraid that a misunderstanding arose in another place in regard to this particular line, because we find that they determined that six of the lines should stand at 30 per cent., and passed a request that only one should be reduced to 20 per cent. The revenue received from boots in this particular division is about &#163;70,000 per annum, and of that amount it is estimated by some that one-fourth, and by others that one-half, is obtained from men&#39;s boots which are affected by this proposal. Thus a considerable amount is involved. We have to remember that if we reduce the duty our markets will be practically thrown open to the American boot manufacturers, while we shall have but very little chance of competing with them in their own markets. The material used, such as glace kid, and certain other articles, is also dutiable to some extent. In these circumstances, I move - </para>

          <para>- I do not understand what actuated the Senate in refraining from touching the other lines of boots. Although we have allowed a duty of 30 per cent, to be imposed on men&#39;s hats, there is some distinction between the manufacture of men&#39;s hats in which machinery is involved, and the manufacture of boots. </para>

            <para>- The manufacture of boots is not so complicated as is the manufacture of hats. I do not want to go into what has already been said on this question, but I think that when the matter was last before us, it was clearly proved that the manufacture of boots in Sydney had increased by leaps and bounds without any duty, and that at the introduction of the Tariff the industry in Sydney was not only a very large one,&#39; but that one or two boot factories there were rather an improvement upon anything to be found in Melbourne. No doubt when high protective duties are imposed an industry is increased and forced, but very much to the detriment of the interest of consumers. I shall have to divide the committee on this motion. </para>

I think that the mistake made by it was in failing to request an all-round reduction to 20 per cent. It is all very well for the right honorable gentleman to talk of protecting industries, but in New South Wales we have succeeded without any protection in establishing the industry. The output there is greater than in Melbourne, where, in some cases, the boot manufacturers have worked under protective duties ranging as high as 100 per cent. The price of boots has been raised to a considerable extent in New South Wales since the imposition of the duty. </para>

I remember that upon a certain occasion a pair of boots was produced in this chamber, the soles of which consisted, for the most part, of cardboard. They had been purchased in a boot shop in Melbourne, and no doubt were sold cheaply under the protective system. It would be much better for the purchaser to be able to obtain a good pair of boots. </para>

They sent him a pair of boots sold at 5s. 3d. or 5s. 6d., which they said was the cheapest made by them. Those boots were very different from the pair exhibited by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports.

            <para>- Of course. I believe they were made for the occasion in order to help . the Government to carry the duty proposed by them. Although the Victorian manufacturers have had their own market secured to them, and the markets of New South Wales open to their goods, the boot manufacturers of New South Wales have been able without any protection to turn out a cheaper and a better class of boots, and to manufacture them in greater numbers. I think the honorable member for Melbourne Ports must admit that to impose such a heavy duty as &#39;that proposed by the Government will be to inflict a great hardship on the general body of the people. Only a few evenings ago an honorable member sitting on the Government side of the House told me that since the imposition of the duty he had been called upon to pay 5s. 6d. per pair more for his boots than he had previously paid for them in Sydney. I admit that the Senate has not gone far enough. If I had my way I should make all boots free. &#34;When we had free boots in New South Wales they were cheap. </para>

            <para>- No doubt all the boot manufacturers will have to go to New South Wales. They will be able to produce better boots in Sydney than they can do here, judging by the class of machinery that the manufacturers of Sydney have been using, as compared with that employed in Victoria. Good machinery has been shut out of Victoria, owing to the- heavy duties, with the result that the people cannot afford to buy the best class. If the cement industry established in my own electorate had been started after the introduction of the Tariff, and if the duty originally proposed by the Government had been passed, it would have cost those engaged in that industry over &#163;15,000 for duty on the machinery required to commence operations. I raise my protest against the Government proposal. I  know it is  useless to do so at the  present time,  but I hope that the time will come when the people will have an opportunity of speaking on the question. I believe that this policy which has been adopted, contrary to the Maitland speech, will work seriously against the best interests of the Commonwealth, and I enter my protest against the iniquities of the Government. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CONROY</inline>(Werriwa).- This matter has not yet been discussed from the point of view of revenue, and it must not be forgotten that by imposing a duty of 30 per cent, we are depriving the Commonwealth of a tremendous amount of revenue, because that duty is almost prohibitive. This view of the question is one which should influence honorable members coming from the smaller States, because in so far as their supplies are drawn from Melbourne and Sydney, the people &#39;of the smaller States will have to bear this taxation, while their States will lose the revenue. I think I am well within the mark when I say that a 15 per cent, duty will return from &#163;100,000 to &#163;120,000 more revenue than a 30 per cent, duty, and that is a very large sum to vote away in a light-hearted manner. It cannot be said &#34;that this duty is proposed solely for protective purposes, because, as has been well shown, New South Wales, without a duty at all, had only  500 less hands employed in the boot trade than Victoria, and even that difference was steadily diminishing. The reason for that was that the industry there was conducted upon solid lines, and the manufacturer was not drawing from anybody any more than he was entitled to as the reward of his skill and industry. In Victoria the position was totally different. In that State the manufacturer was hedged round by a ring fence of protective duties, and was drawing money from the rest of the people. It must be remembered that the people of New South Wales constitute onethird of the population of Australia, and I ask honorable members opposite whether they really think that it is fair that a 30 per cent, duty should suddenly be imposed upon so large a section of the people of the Commonwealth * We are now a Federation, and, whatever our individual opinions may be, we ought not to try to force them upon large sections of the population who do not agree with them. The request of the Senate in this instance, that the duty should be reduced to 20 per cent., is one which I think this committee might well agree to. Ministers have referred to the fact that upon similar lines, in connexion with which in our opinion the duties ought also to have been reduced, no request for a reduction of duty has been made by the Senate. But they will remember that that is due to the absolute </para>

            <para>- I was pointing out that we are sacrificing from &#163;100,000 to &#163;120,000 of revenue, and that a duty of 30 per cent, is altogether too high. Fortunately another election will come along shortly, and if it were not imminent I believe there would be a revolution, because the people will not submit to increased taxation of this kind. It is idle to say that it is for the benefit of the public, because&#39; one body of manufacturers in New South Wales has shown that they are able to do without this duty. I enter my protest against the motion, and I hope the requested amendment will be carried. I have been very much pained to learn from the Minister for Trade and Customs, that there is no likelihood of the Senate insisting upon any of the requested amendments with which we do not agree. If there is anything in that statement, we shall observe the course of the honorable senator to whom I have referred with further anxiety. </para>

          <para>- With the exception possibly of the duty upon fuel oil, this line represents the high water mark of protection as favoured by the Government. Though the duty of 30 per cent, here proposed is not intended particularly for revenue, but to some extent to discourage importation in the interests of local manufacturers, I notice from the return submitted by the Treasurer giving the amount of revenue collected  under the Tariff, from the 9th October to 30th June, that on this line of boots and shoes a revenue of &#163;17,950 was collected in New South Wales, &#163;7,538 in Victoria, &#163;7,190 in Queensland, &#163;3,950 in South Australia, &#163;11,309 in Western Australia, &#163;1,447 in Tasmania, or a total revenue of &#163;49,384 for all the Commonwealth. This revenue has been derived not merely from New South Wales, where there was formerly no duty, but very largely from Victoria, where we were told the boot industry has been built up under the fostering care of a protectionist Tariff to a position of almost absolute perfection. I regret that the Senate, instead of confining its request to men&#39;s sizes above 5, did not ask us to review the whole duty, but, no doubt, a large part of the revenue which has been received from this duty has been paid upon importations of men&#39;s boots. That is certain to be the case in connexion with the Western Australian revenue. Seeing that the working classes are not able to purchase the best make of boots, and, therefore, require more boots than other people, I think we should not do anything to increase the prices which they have to pay, but while I should like to see the duty made still lower, I feel bound to support the request of the Senate. </para>

          <para>- It seems to me that instead of leaving it to be defined by departmental by-laws what description of material is to be exempt from duty as stay-paper and stay-cloth, we should insert a definition in the Tariff. I have had some experience of the delays and inconvenience caused by this practice of interpreting the Tariff by departmental bylaws. I have been informed by an importer that he has a large quantity of this material now upon the water, but when it arrives here, if these departmental by-laws are not framed - and they are not likely to be - he will haveto pay duty upon it, against the evident wish of the committee.

        <para class="block">The Senate was very evenly divided upon this item, and the proposal for the reduction of the duty was carried by a majority of only one. We decided that the six different groups of vehicles dealt with in this division should be subject to a duty of 25 per cent. The Senate have reduced the duty to 20 per cent. in three instances, and have allowed the duty to remain at 25 per cent. in the others, but I can see no reason why two different rates of duty should be adopted. If the duty had been reduced in all cases to 20 per cent., we might have been able to discuss the matter. As the Senate appear to have been very evenly divided, and as the duty is one which will afford protection to an important industry, employing a large number of skilled artisans, I think we should adhere to our original decision. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir WILLIAM</inline>McMILLAN (Wentworth). - The fact that the Senate did not do its duty completely should not deter us from complying with their request, so far as they have proceeded in the right direction. The principal reason urged for the reduction of the duty was that the import charges upon such bulky articles as vehicles are so high as to afford sufficient natural protection to the local manufacturers without any duty. Certainly such a high duty as 25 per cent. is not required, because if the natural protection is added the advantage to the local manufacturers will amount to 50 or 100 per cent. <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline> In New South Wales we have been able to manufacture buggies and other classes of vehicles in nearly all the small country towns without the aid of any duty whatever, and we should not now retain a duty which would be practically prohibitive of imports. </para>

          <para>- I do not care what action the Painters&#39; Society has taken ; and in a matter of this kind I do not trust the statement of the honorable member. For the sake of the manufacturers of Victoria, we have placed certain macihne tools upon thefree list.But, although the entire Tariff bristles with exemptions which have been made for the purpose of meeting the mechanics of this State, when the ordinary working man - the painter - is concerned, it is proposed to levy 25 per cent. upon his tools of trade. I say that the proposal of the Government constitutes an outrage. In the first place, we have no right to impose any duty upon the painter&#39;s tools of trade, and in the second there is no justification for levying proportionately a higher duty upon them than has been imposed upon hundreds of other articles. With the exception of the duties upon boots and caps, the tax upon these tools of trade is equal to the highest duty in the whole Tariff. </para>

          <para>-Yes ; when the matter was previously under consideration I received shoals of letters in regard to it. I claim that the Tariff ought at least to be equitable. We ought not to deal harshly with one class and leniently with another. There ought to be some principle of equality permeating it. In other words, there should be equality of sacrifice as well as equality of privilege. I shall certainly divide the committee upon this question. </para>

            <para>- I think that they know more about this matter than does the honorable member. Probably in Sydney they do not manufacture brushes equal in quality to those produced in Victoria. In this State, however, we have the testimony of the wholesale men, of the vendors, and of the journeymen painters that the locally-made brushes are equal to anything that is imported. I am aware that years ago they- entertained the silly prejudice of my honorable friend. The poor struggling painters, about whom he is so uneasy, have not entered any protest against the imposition of the duty. </para>

            <para>- We do not know anything, but the honorable member for Melbourne Ports is a perfect walking  encylopaedia.  He always uses the expression, &#34;We know,&#34; as if &#34; We, us, and company &#34; were the embodiment of Victoria. I wish to tell him what the painters of New South Wales say in this connexion. They declare that these brushes should be placed upon the free list. I think ihat we should exempt the painter&#39;s tools of trade from duty, just as we have exempted those of almost every other occupation. Why should we single out the painter for exceptional treatment? Surely if it is a good thing to put the tools  of trade of the mechanic, the mason, and the carpenter upon the free list, it is equally good to admit the painter&#39;s tools of trade free. Why is this distinction made ? Is it more difficult to manufacture painters&#39; brushes than it is to produce other tools of trade ? We have been told by the Treasurer that the action of the Government is prompted by consideration and pity for the blind of Australia.. I have an idea, however, that we can find better occupations for : the blind of the community, and something-&#39; more suited to their unhappy condition, than is the manufacture of brushware. </para>

            <para>- If the honorable and learned member will permit me to know one little thing - and that of a negative character - I would say that they are not largely engaged iri the manufacture of  painters&#39; brushware. They produce plenty of other articles which it suits them to make very much better. There is absolutely nothing in the statement that the proposed duty is required in the interests of the blind of Australia. But even if such action were of material consequence to that afflicted class I still hold, that the painters should not be singled out for special taxation, even in so good a cause. If we must give consideration to the blind, let the tax be distributed over the whole of the industrial enterprises of the country. I do not know why the Senate allowed this duty to remain even at 20 per cent. I think that their request, to impose that rate upon the tools of trade of the painters should be scouted. The other Chamber ought to have endeavoured to place these articles upon the free list. There is absolutely no reason why the painter should be subjected to special taxation as compared with other artisans, and, for that reason, the least we can do is to agree to the moderate request of the other Chamber. </para>

          <para>- I trust that the Government will accede to the request of the Senate. A few minutes ago the Minister for Trade and Customs interjected that the proposed duty did not amount to the whole of the 3s. 6d. which is charged for the class of brushware required by painters. From his manner one would think that a brush would last a painter for a long time. I venture to say that if the Minister were engaged in casual painting he would complain very bitterly of the present duty. I would further remind the honorable member for Melbourne Ports that he does not know all the working men in the world. Quite a number of painters in South Australia have complained to me of this very heavy duty. A painter&#39;s brush has a very short life, and very often he has to purchase two or three in a month. Moreover the work of these men is intermittent, dangerous, and unhealthy. Indeed, there is no body of tradesmen which has to submit to more broken time than have the painters. The action of the Government in refusing to accept a reduction in this duty is simply monstrous. The least they could do is to approve of the request of the Senate. </para>

I remember having brought this matter before the committee upon a previous occasion, when the Government deliberately promised me that they would grant a recommittal. But - through a misunderstanding, I admit - the promise was not kept, and so we were not able to discuss the question again. Some time ago a deputation of painters waited upon me in the precincts of this Chamber, and after they had submitted a sample of brushes I asked them to set forth in a letter the information which they had conveyed to me.

            <para>- If painters are called upon to do any work, and cannot get the necessary brushes here, they must get them where they can. The writer of this letter says that the brushware which is required to do first-class work cannot be purchased in Victoria, and the proof that it cannot be obtained here is found in the fact that painters&#39; brushware to about the value of &#163;5,000 was imported into Victoria last year. It is not the workers of New South W ales, but the workers of Victoria, who have asked me to propose that painters&#39; brushware be placed on the free list. I have placed their representations before the committee, because I believe that a gross injustice is being done to a large body of deserving men. </para>

The honorable member has also made a great song about a number of articles which are used in various trades having been made free.

        <para class="block">They show very clearly that the Victorianmade article is a first-class one ; but simply, because of one or two particular brushes, in regard to which some one has written to my honorable friend, we are asked to reduce the rate for the whole line. It is peculiar that although the ranks of the Opposition contain three or four honorable members from Victoriawho hold free-trade views, not one of them was asked to bring this matter- before the committee. The request was made to an honorable member from New South Wales. Of course honorable members from that State have a perfect right to bring the question forward, and I do not object. It is clear that those who sell brushes in New South Wales are very anxious to obtain the Victorian-made article, and that the manufacturer&#39;s name should not appeal upon it. This is a case in which we should afford a reasonable amount of protection. I spoke very briefly when introducing this request, and I should not have risen again but for the remarks made by the honorable member for Macquarie. The honorable membermade so much of the matter that I felt that in the interests of those engaged in the industry I should place these facts before the committee. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline>B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). - All that the Treasurer has said does not do away with the fact that it is proposed to inflict a glaring injustice upon one class. Seven columns of the names of tools of trade of various manufacturers and workmen appear on the list of special exemptions, and, on examining them closely, honorable members will see that the painting trade is the only one which has been omitted. As we have exempted every other tool of trade used in the Commonwealth, it is idle for the Treasurer or the Minister for Trade and Customs to tell us that the fact that these brushes are made here is a warranty for imposing a duty upon them. There should be no distinction made if we are going to deal justly, and as the request involves only a matter of 5 per cent., it seems to me that the Government are adopting an extraordinary position in fighting for the retention of the duty in the interests of a few brushmakers,  as compared with the whole of the people engaged in the painting industry. If, as they say, the brush-making industry is so successful that those engaged in it are compelled to work night and day in order to keep up with the demand, surely a difference of 5&#39;per cent, cannot ruin those engaged in it ? Although the honorable member for Melbourne Ports - who sometimes stands here as the representative of, and pleader for, the bone and sinew of the country - says he represents the painters, I tell him that he does not. Painters in other States have told me that they feel this duty. If any one tells me that a painter does not think it unjust that his tools of trade should be taxed to the extent of 20 per cent., while those used by other workmen, including even those of the plasterers - -whose tools are small - are allowed to come in scot-free, he cannot know anything about human nature. There is not a single point of justice in the Government proposal. It will not stand, and I ;am surprised to see men in responsible positions pleading for this signal injustice to an important craft. It has been said that the committee has only been approached in regard to this question by the master painters. Who approached this committee with regard to the 101 duties that have been placed on the Tariff? Who approached the committee with regard to boots ? Who approached the committee in regard to caps and hats&#39;? </para>

            <para>- You may have asked them to do so, but they have not done it, and I am only replying to statements made by honorable members who have not kept to the motion before the Chair. You, sir, know as well as I do that there is no member of the committee more amenable to remarks from the Chair than I am, and I say the discussion has wandered away from the question before. I shall only say now that it seems to me to be an extraordinary thing that this proposal should be made in the interest of what must be a twopennyhalfpenny industry. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports shakes his head, but I can refer him to an industry in connexion with which &#163;2,000,000 worth of stuff has gone in and come out of a factory in a year, and yet all these industries are taxed right through for the purpose of supporting these twopenny-halfpenny industries in Victoria. Why should we tax the whole country to uphold one or two factories here? We are told that the  brushmakers  here are working night and day to execute their orders, and under the circumstances this proposal is only a greasing of the fatted sow. I say this is a scandal and an injustice, and I protest against such a signal injustice as .a proposal to tax the tools of trade of one class of workmen when we have exempted those of every other class of workman, and the machine tools used in connexion with every manufacture in the Commonwealth. </para>

I was disposed to vote with honorable members opposite, as it seemed to me rather anomalous that the tools of trade of painters and paperhangers should alone be taxed to the extent of 25 per cent., but after hearing the resolutions that have been carried by the Painters&#39; Society, by the workmen and master painters as- well, I am inclined to alter my opinion. </para>

          <para>- The honorable member is quite mistaken. I listened attentively to what was said, and the resolution quoted not only praised the locallymade brushes, but also requested that the duty on brushware should not be lowered. We find that the coach painters are also doing the same thing. I suppose their reason is that they believe that the effect of the duty will enable them to get good material made within the State in which they live ; and they consider, as I do, that that will be for the benefit of the community generally. Under these circumstances, I am not prepared to go against the wishes of the men engaged in the industry. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CONROY</inline>(Werriwa).- A duty of 25 per cent. is a charge of 5s. in the &#163;1, and we have now a statement from the Treasurer that so far as the painters are concerned they must pay this 5s. in the &#163;l on their tools of trade, because in his opinion is. in the &#163;1, the duty which the Senate requests us to fix, is too low a duty. Surely that is a statement which the painters throughout Australia ought to take notice of ? It shows how little the interests of that class are considered by the Government. The Government propose to take 5s. in the &#163;1 from men like these in order that they may hand it over to some syndicate in connexion with something else which they possibly favours. I suppose that next week we shall know how much is to be taken from the people to hand over to a particular syndicate. There is no use in addressing reasonable arguments to persons who are without knowledge, and who are unable to understand arguments founded upon reason. The fact that there is a science of political economy is, apparently, unknown to honorable members on the other side. The Minister for Trade and Customs could not think of allowing liquid fuel to be admitted free because it would interfere with the coal mines. The right honorable gentleman, if he could, would stop the sun shining that there might be perpetual winter, and that employment might be given to men in getting coal out of mines. All this shows the curse of having had a legal Ministry at the head of affairs in dealing with the Tariff. It is the worst thing that could happen to any community. </para>

            <para>- The Senate has here made an extremely moderate request that the dutyupon these articles should be lowered to 4s. in the &#163;1, and the Government still say that they must get 5s. in the &#163;1 . The request being a reasonable one, we cannot expect the Ministry to agree with it. I am certain that the want of knowledge exhibited by the members of this legal Ministry has done more to set the people of the Commonwealth by the ears than anything else. I do not know where we shall be in the long run, but fortunately an election will very shortly come on, and we shall have an opportunity of setting things right by abolishing these duties. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BROWN</inline>(Canobolas).- I gathered from the remarks of the Treasurer that the manufacture of brushes has reached such a stage of perfection in Victoria that the local manufacturers are able not only to supply local requirements but also to supply to a considerable extent the requirements of the whole of the Commonwealth. Though the manufacture of brushware has been brought to such perfection here there is still a considerable importation into Victoria. I find that for the eight months dealt with in the return submitted by the Treasurer, the revenue derived in Victoria from these duties amounted to no less than &#163;4,328. Possibly that revenue is derived from the class of brushes which the Senate wish to have exempted from duty. </para>

            <para>- I can quite understand that whitewash brushes and other rough brushes could be readily made in all the States, but there may be considerable difficulty in the manufacture of the finer class of brushes,and upon these a more reasonable duty, such as that requested by the Senate, might be imposed. New South Wales has not previously had the benefit of a protective Tariff and, according to the theory of the protectionists, the brush-making industry cannot have been developed to any great extent in that State. We might expect, therefore, that the importations into New South Wales would be very much greater than the importations into Victoria; but that is not the case. Although the Tariff in this respect is designed for purposes of protection, it produces a considerable amount of revenue, and, according to the return to which I have already referred, the revenue from the whole of the Commonwealth under this item amounts to &#163;15,937. Naturally, those who have to pay the duty are desirous of some relief, and I am not prepared to say that it falls most heavily upon ordinary painters ; but the return shows that a large importation is taking place, despite the dimensions and perfections of the brush-making industry in Victoria. Prom the evidence adduced I am disposed to support the requested amendment. </para>

            <para>- I beg to submit that the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Parramatta is not in order. What we areauthorized by the Constitution to do is to make any of the omissions or amendments requested, with or without modification. What is the principle underlying the honorable member&#39;s amendment? If it be competent for us to ignore what we ourselves have done, and what the other Chamber has done in this Bill, by reducing a duty without any limitations, it must also be competent for us to ignore it. by increasing a duty to any extent. For instance, we sent up a proposal to fix this duty at 25 percent. The Senate requests that an amendment be made reducing the duty to 20 per cent. According to the interpretation of the section in the Constitution involved in the amendment now proposed, we should be able to say - &#34;We shall rebuff you by making it 30 per cent. or 35 per cent. instead of 25 per cent.&#34; I think that illustration puts the position as well as any argument I could use. What the Constitution means is, simply, that this House may, if it thinks fit, make any of such omissions or amendments with or without modification. In this instance, the Senate have requested us to amend an item by reducing the duty from 25 to 20 percent. We may make that amendment or we may make it with any modification, by reducing the duty to any rate between 25 and 20 per cent. But it is only within those limits that we can act. We are estopped from increasing the duty by our own original proposal, and from decreasing it by the request of the Senate. If we went beyond those bounds we should not be making the requested amendment with a modification; we should be ignoring the Senate&#39;s request, and making an altogether new proposal. If the contention of the honorable member were correct, we should have this extraordinary position : that whereas, if the Senate exercised the right which it has in regard to certain kinds of legislation to make amendments, we should, in dealing with the measure afterwards, be confined to the scope of those amendments, where the Senate, having no right of amendment, but simply a right to make requests, we should be allowed to substitute altogether new proposals. The object of the procedure in which we are now engaged is to enable the two Chambers to draw nearer together ; but if the interpretation of the honorable member were adopted, it might be a means of pushing them further apart. I venture to submit that the honorable member&#39;s proposal is not an amendment with a modification, but something which, going behind the former decisions of the House of Representatives and beyond the request of the Senate, it is not competent for us to consider. </para>

        <para>Mir. Joseph Cook.- The AttorneyGeneral has put only one part of the case. I take it that the section of the Constitution means that we may treat the Senate&#39;s requests as a whole, if we choose, instead of dealing with them individually, as in the present instance. Suppose the Senate requested the reduction of the duty upon certain articles, and wished to have the duty upon other articles intimately related with them increased, surely it would be permissible for the House to deal with the two requests together, and to harmonize the Tariff accordingly ? </para>

To make an entirely new proposal is not to make an amendment with a modification. </para>

          <para>- I notice that to-day the Executive Council appointed a commission to inquire into the accuracy of the statements which have been made regarding the condition of the transport <inline font-style="italic">Drayton Orange.</inline> Whilst I was perfectly willing that such a commission should be appointed, I regret to learn that it consists of Members of this Parliament. I do not object to its personnel, but I do think that it is not a good thing for us to initiate the practice of constituting commissions from amongst politicians. There is a danger that in future it may be regarded as a precedent, and that the party in power may use it to make purely political appointments. We do not desire anything of that sort. Of course, all Australia is interested in the present inquiry, and I think therefore, it would have been wise to appoint men who were more in the nature of judges, and who would be free from any suspicion of political bias. I admit that in this case no such suspicion can arise, as the members constituting the board of inquiry have been selected from all sides of the Parliament. I merely wish to protest against commissions being appointed from amongst politicians unless they are called upon to deal absolutely with si political question, and we must not forget that perhaps the administration of the Defence department may be called in question. </para>

          <para>- I wish to draw the attention of the Acting Prime Minister to the fact that I recently addressed two letters to the Minister for Trade and Customs, of which I have received no acknowledgment. This practice of leaving communications unanswered is not peculiar to the Customs department ; it applies to some other departments. I trust, therefore, that the Acting Prime Minister will take steps to remedy it. It would not hurt the departments to acknowledge communications which are forwarded to them. I am aware that in some of them printed forms are kept for acknowledging the receipt of correspondence, so that the services of. a boy only are required to address the envelopes. But when honorable members do not know where their communications have gone, they are naturally led to believe that the department is not conducted upon business lines. </para>

          <para>- I am sorry that the Acting Minister for Defence is absent, but perhaps the Attorney-General will be good enough to take a mental note of my complaint. In the forces of the Commonwealth for some months past the maintenance of the strength of the various corps has been prevented by the issue of an order, at the instance of the Government, which prohibits them from recruiting. I think that no one will question the  accuracy  of my surmise when I say that no essential changes in the organization of the forces are likely to occur during the present year, and if the practice of prohibiting the maintenance of the existing strength of the various units be continued for a few months longer, the forces will get into such a depleted condition that at a later stage practically double work will be involved in their reorganization. On a previous occasion, I brought this matter before the House, and the Minister directed that the practice of recruiting should be permitted. But on the very day of his departure from the Commonwealth, the Government issued instructions that the system should be discontinued, and with most ludicrous results. This is a matter of considerable gravity. If the Government do not wish to cripple the forces of the Commonwealth for several years, they will remove the embargo of which I complain. I am quite satisfied that the military authorities cannot have advised the Government to continue that embargo, and if it is continued they will have the satisfaction of knowing that they are seriously interfering with the efficiency of the forces in every part of the Commonwealth. It is a question of starving the maintenance allowance of the forces, and if any money is saved it is saved in an illegitimate way. The removal of the embargo does not involve the passing of the amount for expenditure in the coming year. But it does involve the maintenance of proper efficiency in the troops. I happen to know that more than one commanding officer has said officially that he will not be responsible for the continued efficiency of his corps, unless he is allowed to recoup the inevitable drainage of the men away from his command. The policy has been to keep men passing through the ranks. Tq have men going out and none coining in is most ridiculous, and I cannot understand how the Government permit it to continue. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. SYDNEY</inline>SMITH (Macquarie).I understand that it is the intention of the Government to-morrow merely to propose the second reading of the Post and Telegraph Rates Bill, and then to ask the House to adjourn. I have brought several matters under the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs, and I shall be glad if he can acquaint me with the departmental decisions before I leave Melbourne to-morrow. In one case some delay is alleged to have taken place in the settlement of a dispute with regard to some tanners&#39; machinery. In another  case, Messrs. Vale and Son, of Auburn, near Sydney, have been trying to obtain a decision from the department with regard to certain goods alleged to be dutiable. Like others in the trade, they are anxious to ascertain whether the goods are dutiable or not in order that they may be able to act in a business-like way. The Minister knows that whenever a dispute arises in regard to certain items in the Tariff it is impossible to do any business, because, until it is known whether the goods are dutiable, a price cannot be fixed. &#34;While a disputed matter is unsettled it causes considerable trouble and inconvenience to the firms who are concerned. I shall be very glad if the Minister can give me some information about the two cases I have mentioned. </para>

          <para>- It would require some hours to discuss the many difficulties which have arisen since the Tariff was introduced; but, amongst others, I might instance the fact that we cannot get any settlement of the question of the drawbacks on sugar. I have brought it before the Minister several times, both privately and publicly, but we cannot get a decision. Apart from that matter, I hear of all kinds of difficulties which are experienced by commercial men. The other day, I was told by a gentleman, who was perfectly prepared to pay any duty which might be demanded under the law, that he had to submit to his goods being put into a bond, at his expense for cartage and rent, pending the ability of the department to pass the entry which he presented in Sydney. It really calls for an inquiry by the Minister. It is a disability which ought not to be allowed to exist. It is imposing extra taxation on the traders of the community. I desire to ascertain from the Acting Prime Minister how far the Government have secured the co-operation of the Imperial authorities in the proposed inquiry concerning the treatment of the troops on the <inline font-style="italic">Drayton Grange.</inline> When I first heard of the episode, it seemed to me that we had no real effective power of holding an inquiry, and that the Imperial authorities ought to be represented on the Royal commission, otherwise the inquiry might end in. smoke. I do not quite agree with the strictures of the honorable and learned member for Werriwa that the appointments - political appointments as he called them - are ill-advised. </para>

            <para>- The Government have picked out two honorable members in whose report the House will have the utmost confidence. Probably they are the two best men who could have been selected for the purpose from both sides of the Chamber. I do not believe that any injury is likely to result from the selection of members of the House to make an inquiry of this sort. I think that they are well qualified and able to conduct an inquiry, and, providing that the Ministry show the tact and discretion which have been displayed in selecting from each side an honorable member who has the confidence of the whole House, we need not fear the result of the inquiry which is demanded. </para>

            <para>- No doubt; but it will disappear shortly, owing to the completion of our labours in connexion with the Tariff. Apart from the difficult work in connexion with the initiation of one uniform system for six different States, the fact that the House has been in session for over a year has prevented that Ministerial attention being given to departmental matters, without great difficulty, which ordinarily could be given with ease. No doubt there has been a great strain upon the officers. Last Friday, for example, I was without the services of both the ComptrollerGeneral and the Collector of Customs in Victoria. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stephens</inline> was able to return last Monday to his work ; but I regret to say that the Comptroller </para>

        <para class="block">General, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wollaston,</inline> will probably have to apply for leave - which, of course, if applied for will be granted - and that a prolonged absence on his part may be necessary. I do not think that any effort is being spared by the officers to cope with the exceptional circumstances. As to the complaint made by the honorable member for Parramatta that certain letters have not been replied to, all that I have to say is that I took those letters as appertaining more particularly to myself. I thought that it would be considered better if the matter were attended to and the complaint remedied rather than that the honorable member should be troubled with a formal acknowledgment? </para>

            <para>- In view of the relations which exist between Ministers and other honorable members, I did not consider that honorable members were likely to make a point of the matter to which the honorable member for Parramatta has referred, if attention were paid to their requests. As to the matter to which the honorable member for Macquarie called my attention, and which was referred to by the honorable member for Parramatta last Thursday - in regard to a question affecting the Custom-office - I have only to say that it was put right before midday on Friday. Unfortunately, I did not have an opportunity of informing them that their wishes had been complied with, before they left for Sydney on Friday, but no doubt they are perfectly satisfied that what they required has been done. Every attention is also being paid to the other questions. As to what has fallen from the honorable member for South Sydney, I really believe that he is mistaken in saying that owing to the plethora of work at the Customs department certain goods were put into bond, instead of the entries being accepted at once. If the honorable member will let me have for my official information all the facts relating to the complaint, it will be looked into. I am very sanguine that the authorities in New South Wales would not have permitted anything of the sort, although I have no doubt that a report setting out the particulars stated by the honorable member was made to him. I venture to say that when the true facts are placed before him, they will be shown to bear a very different complexion. I have no doubt that if such a thing had taken place, it would have been reported to head-quarters. </para>

            <para>- We shall look into the matter, and I hope that when it is explained the honorable member will find cause to withdraw the charge he has made against the Customs authorities. Instructions have been issued that in all cases of disputes as to duty, a deposit of the duty shall be accepted, and that the owners of the goods shall be allowed to have them. The question of drawbacks is a very troublesome one, and we have been compelled to consider it very carefully. I have come to the conclusion - and I am supported by the result of official analyses - that in some cases the State has been got at. I allude especially to a case in Tasmania, in which an official analysis disclosed that while we were allowing drawback at the rate of 50 per cent. on sugar, the quantity of sugar contained in the jam was really not more than 36 per cent. </para>

          <para>. - In regard to the question of commissions, I have only to say that as their objects differ immensely, their character should also differ. The case to which reference has been made is one in which it appeared to the Government that the kind  of elements we combined by appointing some honorable members, as well as professional men, who have been chosen to constitute the commission, was the best that could be obtained. I admit that in some cases it would be desirable to have a commission consisting of men removed entirely from military or political influence. </para>

            <para>- In that case the department will receive an exposure as thorough as is required. The matter of recruiting to which attention has been called is very important. Inquiries will be made to discover the reason for the course adopted, which I feel sure was taken on the advice of the general officer commanding. With regard to the Imperial commission, of course there wouldbe every desire to obtain the very valuable assistance which sucha commission could render, but we must first deal without loss of time with the Australian incidents - the accident that happened at Albany, and in the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Norfolk,</inline> that which occurred at Adelaide. These, perhaps, were the main causes of the loss of several lives. We do not need any Imperial commission to deal with them, but there may be other questions upon which the findings of an Imperial commission would be very valuable. </para>
