          <para>- Upon an occasion like this, when a large number of requests have come from the other . Chamber, and the Government have deliberately decided to make certain amendments and to refuse to make others, I think we should not be called upon to deal with the requests item by item without having some general statement by the Government and a general debate. If ever there was an occasion upon which a general discussion was necessary, it is this. We are entering upon a stage of our constitutional history which is quite unique. As the Minister was about to declare, the other Chamber has the power under the Constitution to make these requests. No one denies that for a moment. </para>

The Government have concurred in this view by agreeing to make some of the requested amendments, and I think it is only fair and reasonable that we should have an opportunity to consider them as a whole before we discuss particular items.

          <para>- If our real desire is to have the Tariff settled, we should avoid a great many possible dangers by dispensing with a general debate. If there is to be a general discussion, it is almost inevitable that questions will be raised in this Chamber - as, doubtless, they will also be raised subsequently in the other Chamber - that will not conduce to the early settlement of this important matter. Many honorable members are content to let sleeping dogs lie, but if some one starts to stir up these clogs or to express opinions as to their colour or character, those who think differently are bound to have something to say. It would conduce to an early settlement of the Tariff if we confined ourselves to discussing the requests as they come before us.

            <para>- It is useless for the honorable member to utter any such platitude as a reason for his objection, because he knows very well that discussion cannot be prevented. The  Chairman  cannot prevent discussion. Upon a motion that we should make &#39; an amendment requested by another Chamber we could discuss the constitutional aspect of the whole of the requests. There is no use in talking about our foregoing our rights, because they are all preserved to us by the Constitution. I suggest, therefore, that the Minister should be permitted to make a general statement regarding the whole of the requests and the attitude of the Government with respect to them. My own impression is that this will result in shortening the discussion. </para>

            <para>- At any rate, I have endeavoured to act as courteously to all honorable members as circumstances, and perhaps my peculiar temperament, would allow. It must be recognised that honorable members upon this side of the Chamber, who have been engaged in an uphill battle, deserve some consideration in fighting for principles which are probably acceptable to the majority of the Australian people. I am indeed surprised that the Ministry have declined to allow a general debate upon this matter, seeing that they themselves must have put the whole of these requests through a crucible similar to that through which we desire they shall be put. Bid they discuss each item separately, without regard to its general effect upon the whole Tariff? After the Minister for Trade and Customs had placed his proposals before his colleagues, did not they examine them in the light of their effect upon the Bill in its entirety ? Whatever blame may attach to the Government or to either side of the House, for having extended the present session over a period of fifteen months we cannot alter matters now. But I say distinctly that if this session is prolonged, and if we are forced to engage in a struggle with the other Chamber, the responsibility will rest upon the heads of the Government, and chiefly upon that of the Minister for Trade and Customs. It does not require any great stretch of imagination to understand what took place in the triumvirate protectionist conference which met when this Bill was returned from the Senate. When that conference assembled in the midst of the ruins of its own handiwork, I can well imagine the Acting Prime Minister with his usual pliability urging the Minister for Trade and Customs to be a little moderate in his demands, and to concede sufficient to satisfy the honour and constitutional position of the other Chamber. I can also imagine the Treasurer saying &#34;Hear hear&#34; to that expression. But what has the right honorable gentleman yielded on behalf of the Government? I venture to say that in the whole of the document which I have in my hand, and which covers 104 items, practically no concession is made to the other Chamber. Can honorable members credit that statement in view of the fact that out of 104 requested amendments it is proposed that 50 shall be agreed to? But in these 50 items there are not more than seven which practically affect the position between the two Houses, and there is absolutely none which touches the principles of the Bill. I am perfectly alive to the responsibility of my position to-day, and I feel that no words should be uttered by me which would be in any way likely to kindle strife between two almost co-ordinate Chambers. Therefore, although honorable members upon this side of the House are not the authors of this Bill, we are determined as far as lies in our power to bring about a solution of the difficulty which exists as speedily as possible, so that we may go into recess. Honorable members must not imagine that we desire to foment trouble between the two Houses. Whilst we do not own this Tariff in any respect, still, for the sake of the country and of the commercial interests of Australia, we say that the sooner it is settled the better. We shall therefore do everything in our power to arrive at finality. </para>

            <para>- That is a very impertinent and unnecessary remark. When I am not quiet I am willing to weigh my remarks for intelligence and substance with those made by the honorable member. I am making a statement which I can prove. The Senate has made 104 requests. The Minister is willing to agree to 50 of the requested amendments, but insists upon disagreeing with 54. Ministers of the Crown - whatever honorable members may think - are, therefore, perfectly satisfied that the Senate has acted within its constitutional rights. Furthermore by signifying their willingness to make certain amendments requested by the other Chamber they have admitted that those requests are not merely idle words, that it is necessary to placate the other House and to recognise to some extent that it has a right to insist upon them. That is clear. If that right be allowed, do honorable members think that the Senate will be satisfied with the mere pretence of yielding on the part of this House? I shall read to honorable members the requested amendments of a substantial character to which the Government propose to agree. There are only seven of them. The duty upon arrowroot, as passed by this House, was1d. per lb. The Government now agree to reduce it to &#189;d. per lb. A 20 per cent. impost was levied on oilmen&#39;s stores&#39; by this House, and the Senate has requested that that rate shall be reduced to 15 per cent., to which proposal the Government agree. The duty upon starch is to be reduced from 2d. per lb. to &#189;d. per lb.; that upon parasols from 30 per cent. to 20 per cent., and that upon mangles, axe-handles, and composition belting from 20 per cent. to 1 5 per cent. It is true that the adoption of one or two of these amendments will give a certain amount of relief to the consumer, but, taken as a whole, they are absolutely worthless as a concession. The other requested amendments of the Senate which the Government will make are either of such an unimportant character as to be practically valueless, or are such alterations as the protectionist side of this House would have agreed to under any circumstances for the purpose of improving the Bill. I shall read to honorable members a few of the amendments which the Government will ask us to make as a sample of the whole, and I ask any intelligent man in this Chamber whether those items affect the principles of the Bill in any way whatever ? Let us, for example, take the request by the Senate to omit from the special exemptions to item 36 of the Tariff the word &#34;frozen,&#34; and after &#34;meat&#34; to add the words &#34; preserved by cold process.&#34; That is one of the proposals to which the Government intend to agree. Another is to add to the special exemptions to item 50, &#34; Seed, cotton,&#38;c.&#34; the words &#34;for making methylated cotton-seed oil under departmental by-laws.&#34; A third is to omit from item 55 the words &#34;including sparklets,&#34; and add &#34;sparklets&#34; to the special exemptions. Although upon the surface the Government agree to make 50 of the Senate&#39;s requested amendments, only seven of them can be regarded as containing any real concession. </para>

            <para>- I am perfectly certain that the honorable member is so steeped in his own fiscalism, and has so little regard for the manifesto of his chief or the election pledges of his party, that he would do anything in that direction. I repeat that out of the 50 requested amendments to which the Government propose to agree, there are only seven of any importance whatever. I hope that the honorable member understands that. Another request to which the Government propose to accede, is that all accoutrements, badges, buttons, braids, and lace for naval and military uniforms under departmental by-laws be added to the list of exemptions under item 58. They propose also to agree to add certain bags - with the exception of hessian flour bags - to the list of special exemptions to item 59. That is a very important concession. Again, we find the Government proposing to agree to the request of the Senate to add to the list of special exemptions under item 65, parasol, sunshade, and umbrella handles, sticks, and fit-ups, whether mounted or not. They propose to agree to the Senate&#39;s request to add the word &#34; horse&#34; before the words &#34;haircloth,&#34; in the list of special exemptions to item 66. That is a wonderful concession. They are also ready to adopt the Senate&#39;s request to strike out the word &#34; canvas &#34; from the list of special exemptions to item 66, and substitute the words &#34; tent and sail canvas and.&#34; Another great concession is the proposal to accept the Senate&#39;s request to leave out the word &#34;boot&#34; before &#34;cutters&#34; in the special exemptions to item 78, and to insert &#34;root.&#34; The Government also propose to adopt the request -that after the word &#34;  strawsonizers,&#34;  in the special exemptions to item 78, the words &#34;and other fieldspraying machines &#34; be inserted. </para>

            <para>- That is not the point. The point is that if the Government and those who support them had  any common honesty they would allow ari explanation showing the utterly unreliable character of their proposals. We come now to another request which the Government propose to adopt, and that is that after the words &#34;12 superficial feet&#34; in item 92, the words &#34;per 100 superficial feet &#34; should be added. It is  unnecessary  for me to continue to quote these proposals. I desire to put forward the simple statement that the Government have made &#39;no concession whatever to the Senate in regard to the main requests ; that so far as the people of Australia are concerned it matters little, if anything, whether the Tariff Bill is passed as it left this Chamber, or agreed to as proposed by the Government at this stage.  I challenge any honorable member to show that any concession which the Government propose to make to another place would affect the principles of the Bill. </para>

            <para>- I refer to its protectionist principles, from which honorable members of the Opposition have dissented from the first. In relation to items upon which duties of 15, 20, 25, and up to 30 per cent, were placed by this Chamber, it will be found that scarcely any alteration is proposed by the Government. The Tariff remains exactly the same highly protective measure that it was when it left this Chamber. Certainly it is not as highly protective as it was when introduced, but practically we are asked now  to  enact a farce. It is proposed that we shall agree to amendments which it would not be creditable to us to reject. Many of the requested amendments to which the Government are willing to agree relate to omissions which would occur in any Bill, while others are so small that they do not affect the measure as a whole. The Senate has exerted its right to put these requests before us, and if we are to deal with it as being to a certain extent a co-ordinate branch of the Legislature, we ought certainly to receive its requests with courtesy. If we are going to compromise we ought to compromise substantially. No one  anticipated  for one moment that all the requests made by another place would have been absolutely accepted by the Government, but honorable members of the Opposition did expect that the Government would have made some substantial concession. The Opposition thought that the Government, knowing the strength of the Senate, knowing that, like this Chamber, it has the popular element at its back ; knowing that its members are not all fools, and will not be deluded into accepting what is apparently a concession, although in reality it is not, would have said : &#34; The present session has extended over fifteen months. We are faced with a state of commercial distress, accentuated by the drought, which has brought about a condition of affairs that must grow in intensity during the next two years, and the like -of which has never been experienced in Australia for the last twenty years, We cannot obtain everything. AVe are dealing with a giant in strength ; we are dealing with a Chamber which can force this House as well as itself to go to the country, and winch, if we do not concede a reasonable number of its requests, will be able to prolong the agony of this conflict and place upon our heads the responsibility.&#34; My simple point is that if we are prepared to make a compromise for the sake of peace, for the sake of bringing this awful controversy to a finality, and for the sake of assisting the mercantile and other interests of Australia, that compromise ought to be fair, liberal, and substantial. It should not be practically a farce, as proposed by the Government. </para>

But I desire to point out - and I cannot do so too strongly - that if we analyze the whole of the concessions proposed by the Government it will be found that, with the exception of seven, they are practically of no importance. The whole pith of the requests of the Senate&#39; are embodied in the other proposals to which the Government do not agree. Do we think that the members of another place are not of the same bone as we are ?

            <para>- I do not understand the honorable and learned member. Altogether 104 requests have been made. Out of that number the Government are prepared to accede to about 50, of which only seven are of any importance, and even those are not vital to the Bill. The remaining 54 of which the Government disapprove embody the substantial differences between the two Houses. Undoubtedly the Senate will fight for them if it had any reason for making them. Do honorable members think that members of the Senate will allow it to be placed on record that they attended in tile Senate day after day simply for the purpose of wasting the time of the country - that they made utter fools of themselves and did not intend to insist upon the acceptance of a reasonable number of their requests ? I do not desire to be forced into any struggle with another place. I do not wish to be forced into expressions of opinion as to what the Senate will do. But when the Government proposals - which, notwithstanding the jeers of honorable members opposite, give nothing, although on the surface they appear to concede a great deal - are placed before honorable members of another place, they will show at once that they are nob fools. No one knows better than does the . honorable and learned member for Indi, with whom I had the honour, of sitting in the Federal .Convention, that under the Constitution framed by that Convention the House with which we are now dealing is largely co-ordinate with this Chamber. </para>

            <para>- One moment. No one knows better than does the honorable and learned member for Indi that financial measures must be initiated in. one House, and that we cannot have two Houses holding absolutely co-ordinate powers in regard to them. But we are not dealing now with the question of an Appropriation Bill, with which I think, save in extreme circumstances, the Senate should not interfere. We are dealing with the foundations of a Customs Tariff, which is a great taxing machine placed in the hands of the Commonwealth Parliament. We have agreed that the Senate has a perfect right to make requests for amendments in the Tariff, and we know that behind that power there is a power to make every honorable member of this House go to the country. There is behind it the great power of veto. If we recognise by our debate to-day that that power exists, surely in dealing with requests made by the Senate, whose members comprise probably some of the best men in the political life of this country- </para>

            <para>- We  must  assume that these requests have not been made simply as a matter of child&#39;s play. We must assume that they have been made in a spirit of earnestness by honorable members of another place, knowing the giant power that they possess under the Constitution. The honorable and learned member for Indi may not have had time to closely investigate the details of, the Government proposals, but if he will study them for one hour it will be quite sufficient to enable him to grasp the position and to&#39; say whether there is any real concession made to the Senate in the Government proposals. I say that there is not, and that they constitute a piece of  effrontery.  16 would have been far better for the Government to absolutely refuse to concede any of the requests made by another place, than, having considered them, to propose to give that House a stone. </para>

            <para>- That does not affect the position of the Government. The Government have made the position difficult for the Opposition and for their own supporters who have been loyal to them throughout the consideration of the Tariff. Their proposals are simply a farce. I blame my right honorable friend the Minister for Trade and Customs, for whom I have great respect, for having failed to deal with this matter in a broader and more statesmanlike spirit. The position now taken up by him is simply part and parcel of the difficulty with which we have had to contend from the first in dealing with the Tariff. I venture to say that if this Tariff had been treated in a more liberal spirit - in the spirit, indeed, in which we ought now to deal with the requests of the otherChamber - we should have been able to return to our homes long ago. I think I have shown myself to be a sufficiently moderate man to entitle me to say that, if the Tariff had been framed on the lines of the Maitland manifesto, I should have readily agreed to it. I would ask honorable members who may not have read this document very closely to analyze it, as I have done. If they consider the requests to which the Government propose to agree, they will find that out of 50 items, 40 deal with matters of no importance whatever. We may eleminate 40 item? from the 104 dealt with, and we shall have this position : that of the requests in connexion with 60 items of any substantial character, not more than 10 - I say not more than 7 - are agreed to by the Government, and those 7 are of very little importance. In the requests upon 50 items with which the Government propose to disagree thereis involved the whole question that has been raging between both sides of this </para>

            <para>- There has been no concession. The Minister for Trade and Customs has studiously picked out everything that was absolutely of no importance, and has put it into this schedule. It goes forth to the public that out of 104 items upon which requests have been made by the Senate, the Government have conceded amendments in respect of 50. But I say that that is not the position at all. The position is, that of the requests affecting about 60 items of any importance, the Government have not conceded ten. Although I do not desire to say much with regard to the other Chamber or the future, from my point of view, if we do not radically alter the proposals of the Government, and if we do not concede a reasonable and sensible number of these requests, we shall be simply inviting a struggle of which no man can see the end. I do not think we should do that. I think it is the duty, even of honorable members on the other side, if they will allow me to say so, to give way somewhat in their own view, in order to secure peace and finality. </para>

            <para>- Apart from the heat of this controversy, I believe it -will be admitted by honorable members on both sides that if we can possibly agree to a certain number of these requested amendments will avoid a prolonged conflict with the other House, and we should be prepared to give way to a certain extent in order to avoid that. I believe we do not desire to bring about trouble. I am pointing out now, as I might have been allowed to do in the course of a general debate, without any necessity for moving the  Chairman  out of the chair, that honorable member should know the general effect of the proposals of the Government before they begin to debate the different items. They should know that there is really no actual concession worth talking about embodied in these proposals, and when we come to deal with the 50 different items in connexion with which the Government have decided to refuse to make the amendments requested by the Senate, we should consider them very carefully, and be prepared to yield as much as possible for the sake of peace and finality. </para>

        <para>The Senate may at  any  stage return to the House of  Representatives any  proposed law which the Senate may not amend, requesting, by message, the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein. </para>
        <para class="block">On the difference between the two, a very long debate took place in the Convention, as the honorable and learned member for Indi knows. I cannot do better than read some passages of the debate which took place at the time, which will put the point more fully than I could do at the present moment. We know that what was asked for on behalf of the Senate was that they should have the right to amend any proposed law. We know that in the convention the representatives of the smaller States pressed very strongly for that. At the time the representatives of the larger States could not see their way to give the Senate an equal power with the House of Representatives, but, as a compromise, they suggested that the Senate should be allowed to send down a message requesting amendments. The difference was very clearly put in these words by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The right honorable member quoted <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, to show that there was very little difference between the (rawer of suggestion, and the power of amendment. I, with the greatest respect to that authority, think that there is a very great difference between the two powers. </para>

            <para>- I rise to order. I do not wish to interfere with the honorable and learned member in discussing this Constitutional point, but I should like to know whether you rule, now that the matter is put before you, that under cover of a motion that you do now leave the chair, we can discuss the Constitutional question as to the rights and powers of the Senate. I should be the last to do anything to curtail any honorable member&#39;s light of speech, but I think that the proper way to discuss this question - apart from allowing the leader of the Opposition a right to discuss details touched upon by the right honorable gentleman in charge of the Bill - would be by a specific motion upon the matter, or under cover of a motion for adjournment. I do not think it can be held under any circumstances that under cover of a motion that you do now leave the chair it is competent to discuss the Constitutional question of whether the Senate has certain powers that are or are not set down in the Constitution. I therefore think it would be very much better, if you were in any doubt about the matter, to restrict the debate to the matter really before the chair, namely, the action of the Government iu this particular instance in submitting their proposals upon the requests&#39; sent down &#39; from the Senate. </para>

            <para>- I was saying that by treating these messages as amendments we are practically doing away with the difference set forth in section 53 of the Constitution. We are now deciding for all time - and that should not be forgotten - that there is practically no difference whatever between a message requesting amendments and amendments themselves. I very much doubt whether we ought to do that. The point I raise does not deal with the question of the Tariff coming before us, and at present I am entirely concerned with the way in which the Ministry have chosen to treat this message from the Senate. The difference to which I have referred has been so well put in the speech to which I have referred, that I crave the indulgence of honorable members to continue the quotation - </para>

            <para>- The statement of the Minister for Trade and Customs is practically a motion. The very form of our procedure seems to show that we have entirely waived the objection, and that in time to come this- case will be quoted as an authority against us, fixing the procedure for all time. </para>

            <para>- I confess that I do not see that the Government have suggested that the proper form should be followed. In the absence of any standing order there is only one proper course to pursue, and that is for the Ministry to ask for the suspension of the standing orders, with a view to introducing a Bill, and allowing honorable members to deal with the items in which the Senate has requested amendments to be made. It is proposed to go into committee, and either to agree to or disagree with the amendments requested by the Senate. </para>

            <para>- By adopting  this method of procedure, we are abolishing the difference that exists. However, if honorable members on that- side, or on this side, are quite prepared to waive that difference there is little more for me to say. I have entered my protest against the procedure, and I think that at no very distant time this difficulty may make itself very prominently felt, because on our action depends the question whether it is the Senate or this House that throws out a Bill. The responsibility must be- thrown on one House or the other. Are we or are we not going to accept our responsibility <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> That is the question, I think, for us to determine. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. JOSEPH</inline>COOK (Parramatta.)- On&#39; the present occasion our course is comparatively simple, and I do not know that there need be very much said, although I cannot help feeling that the statement of the acting leader of the Opposition is a most appropriate one, having, regard to the importance of the question, and also to the absolute silence of the Government. There has been a change of attitude on the part of the Government. We were told by inspired paragraphs, in what are practically the  Government organs, that we were to have a statement made by the Minister for Trade and Customs, together with all the information which the Government had collected, and that then there was to be an adjournment of the House, so as to give honorable members a chance to consider their proposals in connexion with&#39; that information. That was what &#39; we thought would be the order of procedure, whereas to-day the Minister comes&#39; down, and, when the House is formally moved into committee, proposes to go on with the Bill without making any statement on the constitutional aspect of the. Tariff question, without indicating what the relation of the Government to the Senate is to be, or without giving the committee the slightest lead in what is deemed to be a settlement of the relations of this.

This was an occasion when there might have been <inline font-style="italic">some</inline> statement on the part of responsible Ministers concerning their attitude to the Senate in regard to the taxation of the people. It was due to the House that they should have made their minds clear to us in some formal way. It was also due to the House that in the light of the Minister&#39;s statement and in the light of  the information  which it ought to have contained regarding the operations of the Tariff,, and its modification by the Senate, to postpone the debate until to-morrow, when it could have been continued with better knowledge.

            <para>- May I remind the honorable and learned member that one result of this attitude of silence was the declaration, by the honorable and learned member for Ind i j  just   now that honorable members take&#39; no notice of what the Government do. He said triumphantly, in reply to the acting leader of the Opposition - &#34;This House has not yet said what it is going to do.&#34; Surely honorable members who sit behind the Government are going to support their policy in the main ! What does the honorable and learned member mean when he makes this declaration of independence on the part of honorable members who sit behind the Government? There is every reason why the Government should say what it is going to do. Are we to have repeated the spectacle, that we have so often seen during the already brief history of this Parliament, of honorable members on both sides repudiating the Government, and practically making them turn their proposals inside out ? Probably we shall see in this committee - as we have seen so many times before - Ministers completely abrogating their responsible functions, and consenting to be made the mere mouth-piece of the House, irrespective of which side happens&#39; to direct them at the moment. That is an unfortunate position, and  it is one which ought not to exist in connexion with the important issue before the Chair. When we have the small details of their policy to consider - as to which it does not matter much what the opinion of the various sides of the House may be - we can understand some little pliability. But here is a matter which goes to the very vitals of their existence as a responsible Government. They ought to have taken the first opportunity of saying what their constitutional attitude as a Government is to be in relation to the Senate&#39;s requests, and as to how they are to be dealt with. But we are to have nothing, it seems, except the policy of sitting tight. We are asked by honorable members on the other side whether we are going to champion the Senate in connexion with these taxation proposals. I do not see why that question should not be answered in the frankest way. I take it that we are going to champion the free - trade section of the Senate when we know them to be acting within the four corners of the Constitution. These requests from the Senate were carried by a section who believe in our views, and have striven honestly and constitutionally to give effect to them. When a request comes to me from honorable members in the Senate to follow a. course of action which I have been strenuously endeavouring to follow in this House, I should be recreant to my constituents, and to the principles I profess to advocate, if I did not cordially acquiesce in such request. Of course, what the attitude of the two Houses is to be in the main has to be settled. We are not asked by Ministers now to deal with the matter m <inline font-style="italic">t/lobo ;</inline> to make any declaration of our principles in relation to the Senate. The Minister for Trade and Customs invites us to deal with the items as they occur, and not in a form which would enable us to pronounce on their merits. I take it that; whenever a request is made to us which is in keeping with our own ideas, we shall not hesitate in the slightest degree as to the  course we  should follow. Honorable members on the other side, who see their policy being mauled about and whittled down until there is very little difference between their proposals and those of mere revenue tariffists, may try to get up this constitutional bogy if they like, but the time foi&#34; raising that question is not now, and I have yet to learn that the Senate has done anything which it ought not to have done in making these requests. </para>

            <para>- Surely the honorable member for Echuca asked us on this side whether we wanted to champion the Senate?We do wish to champion the free-traders in the Senate in their efforts to make the Tariff a more moderate one. I take it that they and we shall be acting within the four corners of the Constitution in taking up an attitude of that description. </para>

            <para>- Of course, that follows. Because I believe that the freetraders in the Senate, together with ourselves, do represent a majority of the people of the continent on this fiscal question, I shall the more cordially concur in any requests which they have made for the shearing down of the Tariff. There can be no doubt that there is clearly traceable throughout the Customs Tariff Bill an indication on the part of the Cabinet to adhere steadily to what they believe to be a moderate protective policy. Their handiwork can be clearly traced in this memorandu m before the House, and that is wh y those matters, where they agree with the Senate, are all matters of complete unsubstantiality. This shows that we ought to steadily adhere to the proposals of the Senate, which have for their object the shearing down of the protective incidence of the Tariff, to bring it more into accord with the wishes of the country. </para>

          <para>- The situation in which we find ourselves thisafter- noon is altogether too serious for any exhibition of party feeling. I regard the moment at which we have now arrived as one of the gravest that has been reached in the history of this Parliament, because to-day we must ascertain the opinions of theGovernment and of the more reflective members of the House in regard to the relative rights of the two Chambers. Some honorable members, however, have treated the matter with a flippancy which is entirely unbecoming. The Ministry are called upon as a matter of duty toinform us as to their view of the powers of the Senate in regard to this Bill. Does the Minister for Trade and Customs suppose that he can take a vote on party lines upon each of the Senate&#39;s requests, and escape the responsibility of giving an opinion upon the great constitutional issue which is involved? If he credits the members of the Senate with as much fixity of purpose as he possesses himself, what does he suppose will be the result of the flippant treatment of their requests? For my part, I fling aside all considerations of free-trade and protection in defiling with this matter. The issue is an infinitely more serious one than the fiscal question. I have heard honorable members speak of the Senate as if there were the closest analogy between its position and that of the Upper Houses of the States Parliaments. As one possessing some knowledge of constitutional law, I regard the term &#34; request &#34; as applied to the Senate&#39;s action in regard to the provisions of a money Bill as an utter misnomer. The Senate possesses the constitutional right to amend money Bills as fully as that right could be given to it by any Constitution. </para>

            <para>- Yes. I am not concerned at this moment with what may have been the intention of the members of the Convention, nor with the literal meaning of the wording of the Constitution. It is an easy matter to invest a body with unlimited constitutional power, but unless in the last resort that body can depend upon the assistance of some physical force, its constitutional power is of no use to it. On the other hand, the most harmless words may have been placed inour Constitution, but if the second Chamber has been empowered to throw out measures sent to it by the House of Representatives, and to resist, except under certain circumstances, all attempts to dissolve it, the framers of the Constitution have done what is tantamount to giving it unlimited power. What is the position which we now have to face? Let us suppose that the Minister in charge of this measure is able to induce a majority of protectionists to agree to the more trivial requests of the Senate, and the measure is returned to that body with all its substantial requests disregarded. Does he think that he has to deal with an assembly of children, or of men of less strength of character than he himself possesses \ Is it not rather to be supposed that the members of the Senate will stand upon their constitutional rights, and exercise their powers to the fullest extent? They would be recreant to the trust placed in them, as the representatives of the States as separate entities, if they did not do so. This House represents the people of the Commonwealth on a proportional basis, but the representation of the Senate is upon a totally different foundation. Whereas Tasmania in this House has a representation in proportion to her population of. 160,000, the representatives of those people in the Senate are invested with exactly the same constitutional power as the representatives of the 1,350,000 people who constitute the population of New South Wales. Honorable members are reckoning without their host if they suppose that this question can be treated in a light-hearted way, merely because there is in this committee a majority favorable to protection. If the measure goes back to the Senate, and the members of that body choose, as I believe they will, to insist upon their requests-- </para>

            <para>- What could the House of Representatives do; or what could the Governor-General do, if the Senate threw out the Bill ? No constitutional power has been given to the GovernorGeneral which would enable him to send the members of the Senate to the country, or to interfere with any legislative act of that body. Then what would follow ? This House would have to be prorogued, and the measure&#39; would, have to be sent to the Senate again after an interval of three months. Is it to be supposed that the members of the Senate, most of &#39; them thoughtful men, and quite as well versed in constitutional law as we are, would then change their attitude? If they did not, what would happen ? By an almost automatic process both Houses would be dissolved and sent to the people. The members of the Senate would then have this justification for their action : That they  represent the  people as representatives of the States, and not upon a proportional basis, and, therefore they have a constitutional right to say, &#34;We will not accept the measure, because there is not a majority of the States in favour of it.&#34; I have no hesitation in saying that every free-trade senator who now represents New South Wales would in that case he re-elected, and that a sixth freetrader would be returned in place of the one protectionist who now holds a seat there. </para>

            <para>- I rose to . find fault with the Minister because, in moving that the House resolve itself into a committee of the whole to consider this Bill, he did not pay us the compliment to express his .opinion upon the grave constitutional issue which underlies the whole question, and which is infinitely more important than the framing of a Tariff. We are to-day laying the foundation-stone of our Constitution, and we ought not to take one side or the other upon an issue of so much importance, merely as we happen to hold views in favour of protection or of free-trade. There is no parallel between the position of the Senate and that of the Upper House of any State Parliament. In New South Wales it is a very easy matter, when the Legislative Council proves recalcitrant, for the Government to nominate half-a-dozen or a dozen new members ; and it is very easy in a State like Victoria to hold out the threat of an appeal to the Imperial Govern ment for constitutional reform. </para>

            <para>- I do not intend to enter upon a fruitless inquiry as to what the people of Australia would or might have done. I contend, however, that if the smaller States had been told that whatever compromise was entered into between the two parties in the House of Representatives would be held to be binding upon them in the Senate, they would never have entered into the federal compact. </para>

            <para>- Quite so. But each representative voted as a separate individual.  <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BRUCE</inline> SMITH. - Of course, unless we arrange to have automata in Parliament instead of men, we must have personal votes, but the question is : &#34; What is the representative value of each vote?&#34; Here vrc have 26 members representing New South Wales, whilst for the State of Tasmania there are six. That is one way . in which we may test the value of the resolutions arrived at in this House in connexion with -the Tariff. The circumstances in the other Chamber are entirely different. The Tariff has not only to pass through a Chamber in which the people are proportionately represented, but through a House in which the States are equally represented. Are we now to turn round, and say that we intend to insist upon the Tariff, as  it has been passed by the representatives of the people in a proportionate sense, and that we ignore the requests of the House in which the States are equally represented - that we deny the right of the States as represented in the Senate to exercise the power to throw out the measure if they do not approve of it ? </para>

Although my manner may appear a little emphatic and aggressive, I am endeavouring to add force to my arguments, in order that the committee may not ignore&#39; the issue before us. This is not merely a matter of free-trade and protection, but a serious constitutional juncture, and even honorable member had a perfect right to expect the Minister to indicate the attitude that the Government would take up. </para>

            <para>- My contention is that even supposing compromises were made in this Chamber - and my opinion is that they were - they had no binding effect upon the Senate. Who has the power to bind the Senate <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Has the Minister for Trade and Customs the power to bind senators who support protectionist principles, or has the acting leader of the Opposition power to bind honorable senators who hold free-trade views ? Would not senators be utterly unfitted, for their positions if they gave up their rights as representing the States, because an agreement had been made between honorable members representing the people of Australia proportionately ? The idea of a compromise arrived at in this Chamber having any binding effect upon the Senate is ludicrous, and no one who had the slightest acquaintance with the elements of the Constitution would contend that ari agreement made in this Chamber, in which the States are proportionately represented, could be binding upon the Senate, which stands upon an entirely different footing. To me the present moment is pregnant with very important consequences, because unless this House is prepared to recognise the right of the Senate in <inline font-style="italic">its</inline> State representation to have an important voice in the framing of this Tariff we may depend upon it th,at we are in danger of a very grave crisis in the history of the Commonwealth.

            <para>- I am not proposing that this House should give way. First of all, I say that the Government ought to have explained to the committee why they have assented only to trivial requests made by the Senate, and ignored every one of its substantial requests. It was due to honorable members that they should have an opportunity of discussing the general constitutional question, but that opportunity would have been denied them had not the acting leader of the Opposition moved the  Chairman  out of the chair, which in itself was a very irregular proceeding. I would further point out that in discussing this matter the mere question of free-trade <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> protection is not the only one to be considered. We must be prepared to compromise fairly with the Senate, and if we insist upon all the substantial duties agreed to in this committee, and give way only upon trivial matters, we shall be creating, consciously or unconsciously, all the elements of a grave constitutional crisis. </para>

            <para>- I took it that the honorable member did not desire any general debate upon the first request of the other Chamber. Having come down prepared to adopt a different course, I altered it to-day for the reasons I have mentioned. When early this afternoon the honorable member desired to change his mind, I rose for the purpose of complying with his request. What more could I do? I take no objection to what followed, because in a matter of this sort the general wish of the committee ought to prevail, and I do believe that wish is that we should deal with the urgent business demanding our attention without unnecessary talk, recognisingtwo things - first, that the requests of the Senate are entitled to every respectful consideration, and, secondly, that it is highly desirable - seeing the long period during which we have been engaged upon the fiscal debate - that this question should be concluded as soon as possible, in order that the commercial community may know where they really stand, and that business may proceed upon its ordinary lines. Now what is the position ? I am not going to introduce any unnecessary controversial matter. God forbid that anything of that sort should be introduced ! The public is crying out for a settlement of the terms of the Tariff, and the sooner finality is reached the better. He who, at this stage, introduces into the consideration of this question unnecessary controversial matters which may have the effect of disturbing a happy arrangement, and delaying its early settlement, will undoubtedly be blamable in the highest degree. We propose to do nothing of the sort. I do not propose to trespass in the slightest degree upon the question of what are the rights of the Senate. We have the requests of that Chamber before us, and it is for honorable members to indicate by their acts how they regard them. Weshallgive those requests every courteous attention and consideration, and where we believe that they constitute an improvement upon the Bill, shall adopt them ; but where we do not believe that, we shall refuse to agree to them. That is the simple question, and, it seems to me, the only question, which we have to consider. </para>

            <para>- I mean an improvement - a better thing for the community. We stand here in the public interest. The Senate also believes that it is acting in the public interest. Under ordinary circumstances - if this were a case where the Senate had not the right of request, but of actual amendment - we should simply address ourselves to a consideration of the question whether the amendments made were right and proper. If they were we should adopt them, but if not, we should refuse to do so. Is the position in any way altered by the fact that in this particular instance some limitation attaches to the power of the Senate ? Certainly not ! It is true that the other Chamber cannot amend this Bill, but it can request us to. make amendments. But the fact that it has a more limited power in this connexion constitutes no reason why we should adopt any unusual course. When we receive amendments from the Senate, whether they be in the form of direct amendments or of requests for amend? ments, our course is perfectly plain. Letus consider them upon their merits and act accordingly. Where we are satisfied that requests ought to be complied with, we shall comply with them cheerfully and,gracefully ; but if we are not  so satisfied  we shall refuse to do so, trusting to the good, sense of the other House to see- which, is the better course. That is the practice which is adopted in the case ot direct  amendments made  by the Senate, and there is no reason whatever for departing from it in this particular instance. There may be some who desire to -see- a con&#39;  flict  between the two Houses. We are not in the slightest degree provoking it when we say that we shall adopt the usual course, and treat the requests of the other Chamber as though they were amendments. In acting thus we believe that we are doing that which will commend itself to the good sense of a majority of the Senate and of. the public generally. Why should we depart from what is fair and right? What does the acting leader of the Opposition say? He says that the Senate has made 100 requests and that we propose to agree to only about one-half of them. I do. not care whether there are 100 or 200 requests by the other Chamber. It is not a question of proportion, but of&#39; whether those requests commend themselves to. our good sense of what is proper under the circumstances. Did any honorable member ever hear any proposition so ridiculous as that laid down by the acting leader of the- Opposition ? In certain cases it might be too much to give way upon 10 pep,cent. of the Senate&#39;s requests, whilst in others- it might not be too much to yield upon 90 per .cent.. We have to consider the merits of the requests before us. Let us- then address ourselves to the consideration of each and every one of them. For the acting leader of the Opposition to talk as he did was simply ludicrous. &#34;Look,&#34; he said, &#34; the Govern-  ment- agree to this, that, and the other, which are only trivial Mattel&#39;s.&#34; What does he suggest that we ought to have done? Ought we, as regards trifling requests, to refuse to accede to them ? Nothing of the sort. lt is a mockery, a delusion, and a snare to point to a number of requests, and exclaim-&#34; The  Government have  assented to these, but as regards others they have done, nothing of the sort.&#34; We did not introduce this comparison to the committee. It was reserved to the honorable member, with his arithmetical ability, to indulge-in such a farcical analysis. I hold that we ought not to be expected to examine these requests from the point, of. view of- the number of assents and dissents given to them. The question which- we have to consider is what is right, fair, and. proper, and. nothing else: This is a case which- is peculiar in itself, Many, a Bill would, pass through this House which would not be subject to half the keen scrutiny and criticism to which this Bill has been, subjected-. In an ordinary measure many things might have been overlooked, and many forgotten ; but this Bill has - been thrashed out with parties fairly represented, and I am inclined to think that a fair compromise was. arranged - a compromise with which the public would have been satisfied, and which would have been for the good of the community. There is not a line or letter in this measure which has not been practically voted upon by the whole of this committee. No item has been forgotten, because: there has been a settlement sometimes by &#38; majority, <inline font-style="italic">but,</inline> in far more  instances, by compromise .and agreement. This Bill was forwarded to the Senate with the imprimatur of: the House of Representatives upon it to a degree possessed by no other measure, when one reflects upon the keenness- of the criticism to which it was subjected. Now that it has been returned, to this Chamber what is the position <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> We have previously voted and agreed upon these items. But I say, -so far as that is   concerned-  i- &#34; Do not let us hesitate to further scrutinize the Bill, and every request proffered by the Senate.&#34; If we find good, fair, honest reasons why we should reverse the decision at which we previously arrived, by all means let us- adopt that course. But having the Bill before us- as we had it previously, it is the1 duty of those who wish to secure an: alteration to establish their claim to i6- not by threat, because I deprecate threats being, indulged in either by this House or by the Senate - but by honest, fair argument, having in view the good of the community. If they can establish their claim, let us vote for the alteration suggested, bub do not let us, from any fear of consequences which might be inconvenient to ourselves, depart from any line- or letter of the Bill in which we believe we have honestly declared, for that which is wholly for the good of the community. </para>

          <para>- That is so ; ib was only when they were forced by the power of honorable members of the Opposition that they conceded certain proposals made by us. In many cases it was proposed from this side that articles upon which high duties had been imposed should be placed on the free list. When such a proposal was rejected, another amendment was moved that the duty should be reduced to 10 per cent., and if that proposal failed, a still further amendment was moved to reduce the duty to 15 per cent. In some of those cases we were successful, bub can it be said that because the Opposition used every constitutional means to secure a reduction of some of the iniquitous duties proposed by the Government, and were forced to accept a compromise, the Senate should be bound by those compromises ? </para>

            <para>- Honorable members behind the Government said so. When the leader of the Opposition referred upon one- occasion to the number of free-traders and protectionists in the two Houses of this Parliament, his contention was contradicted by honorable members behind the Government. It was only by a traitorous sacrifice of principle on the part of one or two- honorable members of the Senate that the Government were able to carry some of their proposals. The Minister for Trade and Customs has referred to what he calls a happy arrangement. Has he shown any disposition to arrive  atany  happy arrangement ? How many requests of any importance have the Government indicated bli eh&#34; willingness bo accept ? Time after time reference has been made to the deplorable condition ofmany of the settlers in- the interior owing bo the drought, and appeals have been made to the Government to reduce the fodder duties or to suspend them for the time being. But the Government shirked their responsibility. They said - &#34; We have no constitutional, way of making any  alteration  of the duties on hay and straw and other agricultural products ; but the matter can be dealt with by the Governments of the States affected.&#34; The Minister for Trade and&#39; Customs has a constitutional power to afford- some relief by accepting the requests made by the- Senate that certainagricultural products shall be free. Has he availed, himself of that power-? No ! Has he shown any. desire to help those  unfortunate  settlers, many of whom have been-, or- are being, ruined. by the drought? No-! Does- the- Tariff bear any evidence  of  sympathy on the part of the Government for the struggling farmers and settlers? It does not. When a moderate request is made by the Senate that the duty on mining and certain agricultural machinery shall be. reduced from 15 to 10 per cent, it is rejected with scorn by the Government. They do not desire to give any consideration to the mining and agricultural interests of Australia, but they are prepared to help manufacturers who have been protected in many cases to the extent of 35 per cent, under the Victorian Tariff for the last 30 years, by placing 20 per cent, and 25 per cent, duties upon the articles which they manufacture, and exempting their machinery and tools of trade. For the farmers who are struggling against the drought, and for the miners who have been struggling under a reduction in the price of metals and consequent depression, the Government have done nothing. What is a natural protection to the manufacturers of Victoria - the distance from foreign ports - is a natural drawback to the miners and agriculturists, who have to compete in the markets of the  world. Has the right honorable gentleman brought forward  any  justification for the unfair treatment which he has meted out to the mining and agricultural industries ? </para>

            <para>- I voted against the proposed allowance of &#163;8,000 a year to the Governor-General, but I voted for the allowance of a lump sum of &#163;10,000, because of an undertaking which had been made by the Government. I shall always be true to any undertaking made in a fair and honorable way. The. <inline font-style="italic">Votes and Proceedings</inline> will show that 80 per cent, of the honorable members of this House shared my view of the matter. The Government have endeavoured to show that a great loss of revenue would be likely to arise from the acceptance of the requests  made by  the Senate. They pointed out on a former occasion that by reducing various duties we should be placing the Commonwealth in what might be almost an insolvent condition. But I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that one of the supposed free-traders - one of those who received the support of the free-trade party because of his promise to uphold the principles of free-trade - agreed to a protectionist duty of 30 per cent, on boots. </para>

            <para>- We have been attacked by the very honorable member to whom I refer. That honorable gentleman attempted to justify the inconsistent and unjustifiable course of voting for a duty of 30 per cent, on boots because of the action of certain &#34; so-called free-traders &#34; - that was the way in which he referred to those who had voted for the remission of the duties on- tea and kerosene. I voted for and took an active part in the remission of those duties. Why did I do so? I explained my action at the time. Notwithstanding all the re,ductions we had previously made in the Tariff, and we were then nearly at the end of it and could make no further reductions of importance, the &#39; Treasurer came down with a statement in which he estimated that he would receive in a normal year nearly &#163;500,000 more than he had previously anticipated and had estimated as necessary to balance the finances of the Commonwealth. I felt, therefore, that I was justified in voting against these duties, because there was then no justification for placing additional burdens upon the people. I, therefore, contend that the  President  of the Senate had no justification whatever for voting for a protective duty on&#39; boots, and then for giving as the excuse for his action that some free-trade members had voted against the imposition of the duties upon tea and kerosene. I do not propose to deal with the constitutional question. It is not the question at issue at the present time. When discussing the Commonwealth Bill I pointed out, as has been pointed out to-night by the honorable and learned member for Parkes, that if we were not very careful there might be some trouble between the two Houses. I am glad to say that, as the Senate is at present constituted, it is composed of a majority who think as I do upon the fiscal issue. The Government, by proposing to concede some of the requests made by the Senate, have admitted at once that that Chamber has power to make suggestions, and I therefore see no reason for raising the constitutional question at this stage. The complaint I have to make against the Government is that they have not shown the compromising spirit which many expected them to show in dealing with the various requests submitted by the Senate. </para>

            <para>- They have the last word, and where then is the power to which the honorable and learned member for Corinella refers ? In dealing with  the  Constitution in the first instance, all these matters were gone into and fully discussed, but we have the Act now as adopted by the people of Australia, and we have to be guided by it. The constitutional question is not raised, and, judging by the action of the Government, is not likely bo be raised ab this juncture, and I therefore fail to see any necessity for dealing with it. I referred just now to the treatment by the Government of the farmers and miners as compared with their treatment of the protected manufacturers of Victoria. We proposed to reduce the duties upon apparel, but we were unsuccessful. Honorable members opposite fixed the duties at 25 per cent. The Senate have made a request to reduce those duties, but have the Government agreed to that request ? </para>

            <para>- I have not seen that admission yet. Here we have the Government proposing heavy duties upon&#39; the clothing required by the people, as though with the drought and other difficulties they have not already sufficient burdens to bear, W e have a proposal before Parliament at the present time to give a bonus to private individuals, plus protection. In view of the bonus proposals of the Government, the Senate have made requests for the reduction or abolition of certain customs duties proposed by the Government. The Government propose to disagree with those requests because they want to give the bonuses proposed, plus heavy protective duties. Is that the way in which requests submitted by the Senate should _ be met ? I think the honorable member for Wentworth was perfectly justified in taking the course he did in moving the  Chairman  out of the Chair. There was really no other course open to the honorable gentleman. In view of the fact that over 100 requests have been submitted by the Senate in connexion with the Tariff, and in view also of the fact that the Government have been engaged during the last fortnight in securing financial returns, bearing upon the Tariff items under discussion, we had a right to expect that members of this committee would be accorded the courtesy to which they are entitled, and that the Government would have submitted the information  they have obtained as to the probable effect of the alterations of the Tariff involved in the  requests submitted  by the Senate. We had a right also to expect that the Government would  lead the committee upon this question, and submit the reasons which actuate them in proposing to approve or disapprove of the Senate&#39;s requests. Have we had any sign of leadership in connexion with this question ? We have found the Minister for Trade and Customs merely submitting a document showing that the Government propose to agree or disagree with the requests of the Senate. We  have been  furnished with  no financial  returns, and no explanation has been given to the committee or to. the country. The acting leader of the Opposition was forced to take the course he did in order to obtain information. It was only by determined action in forcing the Government to state their position that we were able to get any information from the Minister for Trade and Customs. Like other honorable members, I desire to shorten the session as much as possible. I do not think many honorable members wish to remain in Melbourne longer than they can help. It is only the duty which we owe to the people that com.pels us to stop here. I feel, however, that it is consistent with that duty to endeavour to bring about an early recess. But I fully expected that the Government would show a conciliatory spirit and a desire to compromise in connexion with the requests which have been made by the Senate. Have they done so ? As has been pointed out by the acting leader of the Opposition, they propose to agree with very few of the requests which have been submitted, and they give no consideration whatever to the great primary producers of this country. I feel, that it will be our duty, even at great personal inconvenience and sacrifice, to endeavour to secure a larger measure of justice than is proposed by the Government for the interests to which I have referred. I have spoken warmly, because I believe that the Government have not treated honorable members and the country in a fair spirit. </para>

          <para>- I was surprised that the Minister for Trade and Customs, although so very vigorously repudiating what the honorable and learned member for Parkes had said in some respects, should altogetherhave ignored his principal contention with regard to the relative positions of the two Houses in dealing with this Tariff. The Government is not asked to consider a possible situation. What is desired is that some consideration should be given to circumstances which haveactually occurred - to the requests which have been made by the other Chamber in connexion with particular items in the Tariff.It is idle to argue that these requests can be dealt with in the off-hand manner suggested by the Minister for Trade and Customs. Although theyare called &#34;requests,&#34; we must all recognise that they are <inline font-style="italic">defacto</inline> amendments; that if it comes to a struggle between this and the other Chamber, the last word is to be said by the other Chamber, and we are, therefore, in duty bound to consider our attitude towards their requests in view of a possible constitutional crisis. I am one of those who, takingthe cuef rom the speeches of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Home Affairs, declared on the hustings in favour of a compromise between the two existing fiscal systems. When the Tariff was brought down I was extremely sorry to find that no attempt had been made by the Government to carry out that compromise, and accordingly I was obliged to fight for what I considered a fair compromise in the circumstances. I regret very much that the Government are still taking up this extreme attitude. I had hoped that the majority of the House, as led by the Government, would have given some consideration to therequests of the majority of the members of the Senate. That, I take it, is not only a sensible course, but is evidently in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution. I am again reduced to the necessity - an unpleasant necessity in some respects - of doing what I can to bring the schedule into accordance with the principles of compromise which I enunciated on the hustings, and which I believe the Government should have attempted to put in practice. I may be told that I have a duty to this House to perform, but I have a higher duty still, and that is to the people who sent me here. While the Government are talcing on their shoulders a responsibility which, to my mind, is a very serious one, I shall have no hesitation in endeavouring, so far as lies within my power, to make the schedule approximate to the compromise which the people of the Commonwealth were repeatedly promised. </para>

          <para>- The Minister for Trade and Customs spoke of the Senate&#39;s requests for the amendment of the Tariff as being entitled to respectful consideration, and further on he showed the respectful consideration which he is prepared to give to those requests by intimating that this House must show that it will adhere to its own ideas, and that each request must be dealt with on its merits. There can be no objection to dealing with the requests on their merits, but, at the same time, there must be a spirit of compromise enteringinto their consideration if we are to arrive at anything like finality in our dealings with the Senate. The Minister must recognise that, if we have rights to uphold, if we have the duty cast upon us of vindicating our own opinions, equally that responsibility belongs to the members of the Senate. The senators must be expected to hold their opinions with some degree of sincerity, and with some tenacity of purpose, and we cannot reasonably expect that we shallbe able to get all our own, way, andthat those whodiffer from us will merely recognise our superior wisdom or our superiornumbers, or perhaps recognise, what some honorable members may consider our superior position in the Constitution. We have reached a stage when a great deal of cautious statesmanship is required in managing the business of this House, and I do not think that the Government have shown any particular statesmanship in bringing matters forward for our consideration to-day. Of .course, I agree with the acting &#34;leader of the Opposition that it -would be preposterous to expect the Government, as leaders of the House, to give all their opinions &#62;away, to practically give the -Senate its own way in dealing with the Tariff, and they cannot be blamed for attempting to effect a compromise with that body. But the course they have followed has not been in  the  direction of compromise at all. As has been pointed out by one speaker after .another, the concessions which &#39;are &#39;to be made are &#39;not real concessions. They -represent nothing very substantial, either in the way of revenue or in the way of consideration, from a fiscal point of view. On the &#39;Contrary, it would appear as if the document which has been circulated had -been framed almost with a view to misleading the House and the country into tire belief that the Government are conceding -a great deal, while really they are conceding nothing. I -do not mean to insinuate that there is any deep-laid scheme  of concealment, because such a thing could not be attempted on an intelligent public or on an intelligent Parliament, but it bears on its face the impress, at least, of having been framed for the purpose of  making  somebody believe that great concessions are being made when substantially none are made. We labour under a considerable disadvantage in speaking on such a motion as the acting leader of the Opposition has been forced to move, because it is hardly possible now to do justice &#39;to a great subject of this kind. &#39;It is a pity &#39;that any objection was taken to a ministerial statement being made in an earlier part ;of the sitting, in which the Minister could have fairly indicated the policy of the .Government, and the reasons which had led to its- adoption. It would have contributed to the orderly discussion of a very grave subject if it had been introduced by a ministerial utterance which would have covered the whole ground of the proposals to be made to the committee, and which would have given us clear reasons for the course which the Government propose &#39;to take. I do not intend to enter into any &#39;discussion of the constitutional right of the Senate to make these requests, or of the constitutional right of this House to resist those requests, or to endeavour to obtain as much of its own way as it is possible to get. It is a good thing in .many respects that the Constitution permitted the rights of some of the States being maintained as .they have been by their representatives in the Senate. I have only to instance the very large and important St ite of Western Australia, with a gigantic industry on which its welfare depends. It is represented in this House by five members, and in the Senate, half the size of this one, by six members. In the Senate it was possible at least for the-industries and the welfare of the people of that great State to be adequately voiced by its representatives. Certainly the representatives of the State in this House ably championed the rights of its people. Four of its five representatives were able to speak with no uncertain sound as to thestate of public opinion. But, of course, four men could not be heard here with the same effect as a similar number could be heard in the House which represents the States as States. When a question so important to the interests of Western Australia as the proposed duty on mining machinery was discussed here, there was almost an unanimity of opinion on the part of its representatives. as to the objectionableness of that duty. But although there was practically that unanimity of opinion on their part, they were overborne b)7 numbers, who showed a disregard of the interests of a great State. In the Senate, however, they were able to have their views more emphatically voiced, and it is due to the Senate that its requests on behalf of the States it represents should be considered by this House not only respectfully, but very seriously. </para>

            <para>- I have no doubt that the honorable member is in a great hurry. It is a most remarkable thing that j all the talk from the other side to-night j comes by way of interjection. It has been  almost impossible to break up the conspiracy ! of silence which has existed on the other  i  side during the afternoon. All we can get j are interjections. Indeed, for two hours this ! afternoon we could not get an indication cf ! the Government policy except by way of interjection. After half-a-dozen honorable members had spoken from the  Opposition  benches, the Minister for Trade and Customs did condescend to/make a few remarks, but they can hardly be called a Ministerial  utterance. I do not think that he attempted for a moment to give anything like a clear and lucid statement of the Government policy. I was pointing out one of the advantages which accrued from having a representation of the States as States in one House. I am not going to defend the principle of equal representation in the Senate. Nor am I inclined to go to the length to which the honorable and learned member for Parkes did in his championing of the rights of the Senate. But at the same time I submit, as one of the advantages in connexion with this form of Constitution, that a great State, which had an important industry at stake, was able in a most effective&#34; way to have its interests represented in one House, while those interests, though ably represented here, were overborne by numbers and opinion. I think that we all came into this Parliament imbued with the idea that we have to consider the interests of all the States. This is not merely a Commonwealth, but a union of the States, and one of the great services that the Senate has been able <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> render to the Commonwealth in this very early stage of its existence, has been to prevent a ruthless disregard of the interests of the various States. Having put in that chock, and prevented this House by its majority from ruthlessly disregarding the interests of some of the component parts of the union, I submit that we ought not only respectfully, but very seriously, to consider the Senate&#39;s recommendations before we send them back as the Minister proposes to do. We shall have frequent opportunities of referring to some of these requests, and to some of the proposals of the Minister as the business proceeds. I hope that the committee will take the Senate&#39;s recommendations into its very serious consideration, remembering that the Commonwealth exists for the purpose of promoting the interests of every State in the union. </para>

        <para class="block">The proposed reduction of the duty upon ale, porter, and other similar commodities, was a matter to which we gave a good deal of consideration upon a former occasion, and there was then a substantial majority in favour of retaining the rates proposed by the  Government.  I do not know any good reason for reducing those rates. We want revenue, and beer made abroad is a fair subject upon which to levy an import duty. The rates existing in the Tariff are not in excess of those which obtain in a number of the States Tariffs. We are satisfied that if they are reduced the Commonwealth will lose a considerable amount of revenue. It is difficult to calculate exactly what that loss will be, but I think that we are justified in putting it at about &#163;20,000. At the same time the consumer is not likely to benefit by the reduction of the duty. There might be a larger consumption of imported beer if the duty were reduced, but it would not make up for the loss of revenue which will be created by reducing our present receipts by one-sixth. Furthermore, an increase in the consumption of imported beer would probably affect in some degree the consumption of locally-made beer, though, as a general rule, the two articles do not compete against each other. </para>

          <para>- I agree with the acting leader of the Opposition that any objections which we have to make to the course suggested by the Government should be stated as briefly and as concisely as possible, because I desire to see the termination of this Tariff question. When the question was before us on a former occasion, I desired to obtain the reduction of the duties upon ale and beer,and failed to do so. But results which we could only foretell then arc now appreciable, and I am about to place before the committee figures which show that, so far as New South Wales is concerned, the heavy&#39; rates which have been adopted have tended to reduce importation, and thus to diminish revenue. It may be said by some that if the importation of beer were reduced Australian brewers would benefit by the larger consumption of the locally-brewed beer. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">But one of the largest of our brewers has informed me that he has no objection to the reduction of the import duty, because . it would not affect in the least degree the consumption of the locally-brewed, imported beer and locally-brewed beer being ! consumed by different classes of persons. From the 9th October, 1901, to date, 270,000 gallons of beer in  bottles,  and 263,000 gallons in bulk have been imported into New South Wales. It would not be fair to compare the importations for that period with the importations between October, 1900, and July, 1901, because the latter, were unusually heavy, in anticipation of an alteration of duties; but I find that between 9th October, 1899, and 28th July, 1900, when there was no disturbing fiscal question to affect importations, the quantity of bottled beer imported was 445,000 gallons, and of bulk beer 348,000 gallons. </para>

            <para>- The importations show a deficiency compared with a normal year of 173,000 gallons of bottled beer, and 85,000 gallons of bulk beer during the 41 weeks under the new Tariff conditions. As regards bulk beer, it must be remembered that importations are  never made   largely ahead of demand, because of the liability of the beer to lose condition if kept in stock for any time. Therefore large stocks of bulk beer are never held. The bonded stocks amount to 221,000 gallons of  bottled beer,  and 193,000 gallons of bulk beer, which is practically a six months&#39; supply, showing that the consumption has been much less than the importers anticipated. An import duty affects the consumption of the article on which it is imposed, in proportion to its percentage upon the original cost, and where a duty has been imposed for protective reasons, we must consider whether the rate is not unnecessarily high, even on that ground. Now the selling price of bottled beer in Sydney is lis. per dozen, and, deducting 3s. for the duty, 3s. 2d. for the freight, insurances, import, landing, and delivery charges, and ls. 3d. for packing, the net return to the shipper is 3s. 7d. a dozen. By the same method of calculation the net return to the shipper for bulk beer can be shown to be &#163;1 17s. per hogshead of 50 gallons. </para>

        <para class="block">The rate of duty now in force is equivalent to 3s. per dozen bottles - the contents being two gallons - or S4 per cent.  on bottled beer, and on bulk beer it is ls. per gallon, or 133 per cent. Those are enormously high <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties, and I feel sure that if they were reduced to the rates requested by the &#39;Senate an amount of revenue as large as, and possibly larger, than that now obtained would be produced without injuring the local brewers. I see no good reason why we should refuse to comply with the request, and I must therefore oppose the motion. </para>

          <para>- Whilst my sympathies are generally very much in the direction of the requests made by the Senate, I intend to vote against them when they conflict with my judgment. I regard ale and porter as fair subjects of taxation, and think that the duty should be fixed at the rate which will yield the largest amount of revenue. Generally speaking, when taxes are reduced they afford relief to the consumer, but I believe that, in this instance, the merchant will derive the largest amount of benefit from any reduction that may be made, and that, except in very few instances, the actual consumer will derive little or no advantage. I do not regard the requests of the Senate from the point of view of protection or free-trade, but with a strong desire to see the Tariff controversy brought to a close as soon as .possible I hope that a reasonable spirit of compromise will be displayed on both sides of the Chamber, and that in cases where the judgment of honorable members may be in the balance, they will cast their votes in favour of acceding to the requests of the Senate, It is desirable that we should dispose of the Tariff as speedily as possible, so that the trading public throughout the Commonwealth may once again be able to pursue their .business free from the harassing influences of constant changes in duties. I feel compelled to support the Government in this case, because I do not think that the public interest would be served by the reduction of the duty. </para>

          <para>-The question we have to consider is what rate of duty will yield the maximum amount of revenue, and I think that the import returns show that, as a result of the high duty imposed by the Tariff, importations of beer, and particularly of lager beer, have been materially reduced. It is true that this has led to an increasein the consumption of locallybrewed beer; but as the excise duty is only 2d. or 3d. per gallon as compared with the import duty of1s. 6d. per gallon, the revenue has suffered to the extent of something like 2d. for every bottle of the imported article displaced by locally-produced beer. By unduly encouraging the production of the local article wehave led thepublic to consume less imported beer, and the revenue has diminished accordingly.If the excise duty were raised I should not object to retain the import duty at1s.6d. per gallon, but until the Government assure us that they propose to act in this direction, we should impose a moderate duty which would yield the maximum amount of revenue. This duty was discussed in the Senate purely from the point of view of revenue, and it was considered that the reduction to1s. 3d. per gallon would lead to an increase in the receipts from this source. A large quantity of lager beer brewed in Melbourne, is exported to South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania, and those States are credited only with the excise duty of 2d. or 3d. per gallon, as compared with the duty Of 1s. 6d. per gallon on imported beer. This will make a very considerable difference to the smaller States. Unless we are prepared to throw away a large amount of revenueandto unduly foster the lager beer industry, we should accede to the request of the Senate. The local brewers do not require protection, because the Poster BrewingCompany report that they are exporting largely to South Africa, in competition with the brewers of America and Europe. </para>

No doubt, if the duty is reduced, a corresponding reduction will be made in the prices charged to the consumers, but, in any case, a duty which amounts to from 84 to 130 per cent. might very well be reduced to &#39;the extent required by theSenate. </para>

          <para>- I do not regard this duty from a protectionist stand-point because I do not believe that the local &#39;product has supplanted the imported articleto any appreciable extent. Those who drink English beer will not drink the colonial product while the English beer is available. The locally-brewedlager beer might, to some extent, displace the imported article, but unfortunatelyfor the health of our people, no very strong disposition has been shown by them to substitute lager for the heavier English beers. I believe that the revenue derived Prom the higher duty will be larger than that from the reduced impost. </para>

            <para>- The Tasmanian brewers are in a better positionto compete with the English brewers than are those in any other State in the Commonwealth, because the water and climate in Tasmania offerspecial facilities for producing a beer closely approaching that brewed in the old country. It is estimated that a reduction of 3d. per gallon would involve a loss of revenue amounting to between &#163;22,000 and &#163;23,000 per annum. Those who desire English beer will not be deterredfrom obtaining it by a slight increase in the price, and, further, it must be rememberedthat by far the larger quantityof English beer consumed in Australia is drawn from the cask, and is not the subject of any increased charge to the consumer. Several of thelarger hotels in Sydney have not increased the price of bottled beer to the consumer, but probably in stores where it is sold by the dozen the full amount of the duty has been added. To those, however,who merely purchase a bottle of beer or a glass of beer the price has not been enhanced. I think that we are likely to derive more revenue from a duty of1s. 6d. per gallon than from a rate of1s. 3d. per gallon and therefore I shall support the Government in refusing to make theamendment requested by the Senate. </para>

In addition, 19,84.1 gallons of.sugar beer were imported, or .a total, after allowing for re-exports, of 547,-33S gallons, which produced a revenue of &#163;31,959. </para>

            <para>- In New South Wales, where &#34;the duties were 9d. -per gallon upon bottled beer, and 6d. per gallon upon bulk, or slightly more than half those of Victoria, the total -quantity of beer imported, after allowing for re-exports, was 1,298,000 gallons, which produced a revenue of &#163;46,000. It will therefore take a lot to convince me  thata high  duty would not reduce the consumption of imported beer. I would further point out that upon every gallon of colonial beer which is consumed in lieu of the imported -article we get very little revenue. I am confident that the imposition of a .higher rate of duty will, to some extent, increase the consumption of colonial beer, and, therefore, decrease that of the imported. It stands to reason that it must reduce the revenue derivable from this source. I shall, therefore, vote in favour of the acceptance of the Senate&#39;s request. </para>

Of course, this is purely a question of revenue, and I hold that if we impose a duty which is unduly high, its operation must either increase the price of the article or reduce its consumption.

We have, further, the assurance of many honorable members that the cost has not been increased to the great bulk of the consumers. In some hotels there has been no increase in the price of imported beer retailed over the counter. It appears to me that, as a result of &#34;the operation of this duty, persons who are well able to pay, have had to contribute a little more to &#39;the revenue, which is exactly what we should strive to -bring about. From stimulants I think we should raise as much revenue as possible, and especially so in the impecunious States, where -revenue is needed. I am inclined to think that there is no truth in the statement that  persons who are  in the habit df purchasing bottled beer by the dozen are likely to drink colonial beer in preference to imported, if the price of the latter were increased by the amount of the duty imposed. The Customs experts affirm &#39;that the-acceptance of the Senate&#39;s request would result in the sacrifice of a large amount of revenue, and I shall therefore support the Government in this matter.

            <para>- I shall follow out the figures, and the honorable member will be able to see how they correspond. A further deduction of ls. 3d. has to be made in respect of the cost of picking, reducing the price of the beer in bottles to 3s. 7d oils. 9^-d. per gallon. From 50 gallons of bulk beer the net return is &#163;1 17s., the selling price being &#163;7 duty paid. The two things therefore correspond. The original cost of bulk beer cannot be as dear as the Minister says it is, having regard to the price at which it is sold. For instance, he tells us that it costs 2s. per&#39; gallon. Fifty gallons are  sold  duty paid at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;7.</inline> The cost of tha&#39;t quantity at 2s. per gallon would be &#163;5, or duty paid &#163;7 10s., without the freight charges. .Yet the Minister says that the original cost is 2s. per gallon. His own figures are absolutely disputed by the fact. I do not wish to -allow my figures to be impugned without showing their correctness. </para>

          <para>- In that case there is no evidence that the price of imported beer has been increased ; there is no evidence, however, that for the last ten months the revenue has exceeded the Government estimate. After some months&#39; experience&#39; of the working of the duty of ls. 6d per gallon we cannot get away from that fact. I am a reasonable man, and I have been convinced by the statement of the officers of the Customs. The Government have produced evidence that the rate of ls. 6d. per gallon will produce more revenue than would a duty of ls. 3d. per gallon. I believe that a good revenue should be raised from stimulants and narcotics in the smaller States, and I shall certainly accept the assurance of the Minister for Trade and Customs, who has informed us that the statement made by him is based upon the deliberate opinion given by the experts of the department. </para>

      <para class="block">That the amendment requested be not made. </para>
      <para class="block">This motion is, of course, in. support of the previous decision affirmed by a very considerable majority in the House of Representatives. At this moment I know of no reason which has not been considered by this House why we should in any way alter our previous decision. If we were to agree to make the amendment as requested the result would be this : At present we impose a duty of 6s. 3d. and 15 per cent. on cigars. The cheaper cigars, which are sold at about 3d. each, pay duty at the rate of about 6s. 8d. per lb. Honorable members know the extent to which cigars vary in value, and upon those which are sold at about 18s. per lb. we collect duty at the rate of about 8s. 6d. It seems to me fair that the more valuable cigar should pay duty according to its value to some extent. The Senate requests that instead of the duty of 6s. 3d. and 15 per cent. at present proposed, there should be a uniform fixed dutyof 7s. imposed upon cigars. Honorable members will see that that would result in the cheaper cigars being hit harder than under the present proposal, and as regards the much more valuable cigars, it would reduce the possibility of getting a fair duty in respect of them, and would let them in much cheaper. I put it to honorable members that we cannot justify a proposal to raise the rate as regards the cheaper and morecommonly-used cigar, and to let the more valuable cigar in at a lower rate. This increase in the charge upon the cheaper cigar was, I believe, in the Senate intended to be accompanied by an increased excise charge, or else, of course, there would have been additional protection given, which was not asked for as regards the manufacture of the cheaper cigar. There are two objections to the Senate&#39;s proposal - one that it proposes unfair treatment of the cheaper article, and unnecessary advantage in respect of the dearer article ; the other, that the scheme of the Senate in the- matter has failed. I. therefore ask honorable members to adhere to the duty as previously imposed by this House. I remind the? committee that a provision of this sort -was shown to be unjustifiable by the acting leader of the Opposition, when the matter was previously under consideration here. The honorable gentleman, in suggesting that the duties should be 7s., instead of fis. 3d. and 15 per cent, as proposed, confined his proposal to cigars other than Havanas, and as regards Havanas, the. most valuable cigars, he was prepared, to fix the duty upon them at a rate other than that  here proposed:. If we adhere to the- duties upon which we previously decided, we shall treat all lands of cigars fairly, according&#39; to value, while if we.make the amendment re1quested the- result will be that which I have stated. </para>

I should like honorable members to. recollect the history of these composite duties.&#39; This was, I think, the: first composite- duty dis* cussed in this Chamber. As time went- on and honorable members grasped more completely the character of the Tariff, there was a decided desire- expressed, to. abolish this system of composite duties, and the result was that, with the exception- of this one item, every composite duty disappeared from the Tariff. </para>

          <para>-  I believe  it was recommitted, and for some inexplicable reason- honorable members refused to alter the previous vote. But I am now speaking generally with, regard to the action taken hi connexion&#39; with the principle of composite duties. The argument of my right honorable friend applies to every fixed duty. We- place a fixed duty upon an article,, not because we believe that it is on the whole- the fairest - because where- we can get at the value of an article the- <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty is the better form: - but because there are articles the- value of which it is hard to&#39; determine, and we take a rough approximation sooner than run the chance of having the revenue- cheated through the adoption- of the. ad valorem system. In other words, we know what we are doing, although the plan we adopt may not be the most perfect. AVith regard, to this- matter of cigars, the argument against the composite duty goes much, further. It was pointed out. to Ministers and to members of  the committee that this composite duty intruding an aci <inline font-style="italic">valorem:</inline> duty- into the sale of cigars is very unfair to traders in that particular article. </para>

          <para>- Cigars are generally sold in bond. When we have a fixed- duty everybody knows exactly what it is, but where an.&#39; <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty is imposed it is collected upon, the original cost of the  article,  and of. course when it is ultimately paid the original cost of the article must be disclosed. Consequently when a merchant is- selling his cigars in bond instead&#39; of getting his profit as he likes - and I suppose we all believe in perfect freedom, in that respect - he has actually to disclose the cost price of- the article because of the existence of the-- <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty. It&#39; has been said that everybody has to do that. But that is not the case. An ordinary  importer  pa)&#39;s his <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty and. then sells his goods. Practically we do an injustice to the trader by making him disclose the cost price of the article during the process of sale, and cigars are often sold two or three times over in bond. I say we have no right to introduce this principle in. this- instance. The principle of composite duties- may have been known to some extent in Victoria, but certainly it was not known in most of- the other States. This is the only composite duty left in the Tariff. I think the Senate have taken up the same position that I take up. now : that it is not fair that this principle of composite- duties which has-been rejected as applying to all other classes: of goods, and to goods in connexion with which it might have been much more strongly defended, should be-, retained only in this. instance. I believe honorable members gene rally on this side do not desire to discuss very fully what- happened before, or to deal with the absolute rights and wrongs of the case, and, apart from that, I ask whether on the whole this is not a matter in which we can reasonably concede the request of the Senate. I think it is, because by so doing we shall be following the lines previously adopted by most of the. States. We know that in connexion with a fixed duty there must always be a certain amount of injustice. Furthermore, cigars we know are a luxury, and even if this proposed duty should press unduly upon persons who smoke the common cigars, I do not think that it will be such a- tremendous injustice after all. I ask why we should not apply thesame principles to tobacco. There is no composite duty upon tobacco. </para>

I know that honorable members contend that where an article varies greatly in price, a fixed duty is not a fair one. But, at the same time, by means of a fixed duty, we strike an average afterall. We have not introduced this principle in dealing with tobacco, and I ask why we should disfigure the Tariff by this one composite duty, when we have absolutely eliminated the principle from every other item. Apart from all special pleading, I think this is one of the cases in which, in view of the custom in vogue in the different States, and in view of all the surrounding conditions, we might reasonably give way in order to get as near to agreement with the other Chamber as possible. </para>

        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CONROY</inline>(Werriwa). - I think that, in a matter like this, where the Senate has expressed the opinion that we ought to do away with composite duties, thecommittee should pay some attention to that opinion. Ifthe debate in the Senate is read, itwill be found that it waspractically settled on that ground. So far, we have not treated any request by the Senate with any consideration. If it is thought that an import duty of 7s. per lb. is too high the rate might be lowered. I think it is a little too high, though, possibly, the Senate might have intended to increase the excise duty. I ask the committee whether it intends to retain the last of the composite duties. Honorable members who have a practical knowledge of the working of the Tariff haveshown that a composite duty is rather a hardship to traders. It is well-known that many objections have beenurged against the principle by business men. They do not care what rate is adopted, but they do suggest that the duty should be specific, not specific and <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline> Is it not worth while for us to meet the view of the other Housewhere the composite duty was disapproved by a majority of sixteen to twelve ? I am quite willing to support the Ministry in fixing the duty at 6s. 6d. or 6s. per lb., or whatever may be determined to be the equivalent of the composite duty. I trust that there will be some discussion if only to show that we. are prepared to meet the Senate as far as we possibly can. </para>

          <para>- If we had not recommitted this item at the end of our consideration of the Tariff, the argument used by the last two speakers would have been pertinent, but it was recommitted, and the committeere-affirmed its decision. Thehonorable member for Robertson moved that the duty should be 6s. 6d. per lb. on Manila cigars, and 8s. 6d. per- lb. on Havana cigars, so as to have a double rate. </para>

            <para>- I know that the honorable member for Robertson spoke in favour of the proposal. If we agree to the suggestion of the honorable member for Wentworth, we shall be decreasing the duty on the expensive cigar and increasing, the duty on the common cigar. He has stated that in all probability there is as great a difference in the value of cigars as in the value of tobacco. I feel confident that any one in the trade will tell him: that cigars vary in value from 25s. to &#163;18 per 1,000. He will not find that tobacco increases- in value to the same extent. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. THOMSON</inline>(North Sydney).- I do not think that if the committee appreciated the effect of this composite duty on trade it would insist upon its retention. It has always been the custom to sell cigars in bond. No drawback is given on cigars, consequently importers or holders deal with them in bond, so that they can either pay the duty or export them. If they pay the duty they cannot export the cigars, because no drawback is given. What has been the effect of the imposition of the composite duty ? When a buyer sends round to a holder of cigars for a quotation he must ascertain the cost price. He can only know what duty he will have to pay by ascertaining when the quotation is given what the cigars cost the holder. Many firms, in Sydney at any rate, refuse to quote for cigars in bond, and only quote for cigars duty paid. It is hampering the export trade, which is altogether undesirable. It is not the duty, but the system of duty, which is hampering business. Is it the intention of the committee to prevent the growth of the export trade? </para>

          <para>- I look upon a cigar smoked either by a rich man or by a poor man as a luxury, but I do not think the man who smokes a cigar worth ls. should escape with the payment of the same amount of duty as must be paid by the man who smokes a cheap Manilla. This matter has already been debated very fully. I have read carefully the report of the Senate debate, and the arguments used there were the same as those which have been used in this Chamber. As upon a second consideration of the question, the committee decided . by a large majority that the composite duty should stand, I think we should&#39; abide by that decision. This is one of the fairest duties in the Tariff. I know a man on a Queensland station who is in the habit of receiving every year a box of cigars as a Christmas present. They are sent to him from the old country, and whereas formerly he has had to pay only 1 8s. in duty, last year when he presented his invoice he was charged about &#163;2. </para>

But we must make some compromise with the Senate, and this is a line upon which we might very well give way. The Government have told us that they would lose no revenue by agreeing to the amendment suggested by the Senate. The imposition of fixed duties upon cigars is always in favour of honest importers. The honorable member for Maranoa has just shown us that the honest importer who produces a <inline font-style="italic">bon&#226; fide</inline> invoice has under the present system of duties to pay very heavily upon his cigars, but unscrupulous men; are tempted to produce manipulated invoices, and to thus defraud the Customs. The system which the Government wish us to adopt offers a premium to dishonesty,&#39; because honorable members must remember that it is very difficult for any but experts to determine the value of cigars. </para>

But I would point out to him that, estimating Manilla cigars to be worth 30s. per 1,000, and Havannah cigarsto be worth &#163;12 per 1,000, under the present duty the smoker of Manillas would be charged about 265 per cent., and the smoker of Havannahs about 60 per cent. </para>

            <para>- It is the opinion of men in the tobacco trade that composite duties are bad, and it cannot be urged in favor of the Government proposals that they put the smoker of cheap cigars upon an equality with the smoker of dear cigars. I agree with the Treasurer, that it is necessary to have a heavy specific duty, because it is very difficult to determine the value of cigars apart from their brand. I should not object if the duty were fixed as high as 7s. per lb., because most of the cheap cigars are manufactured locally. </para>

          <para>- The duty on arrowroot was originally fixed at1d. per lb., and the Senate now desire that the article shall be added to the list of special exemptions. The imports of arrowroot are very small indeed, and the revenue derived, during the nine months from 9th October, 1901 to 30th June, 1902, is returned at &#163;29. Whilst we do not desire to impose a high duty, we think that in view of the fact that the production of arrowroot has assumed considerable dimensions in Queensland it would not be wise to admit the. article free of duty. At the same time we are anxious, if we possibly can, to meet the views of the Senate, and we think that we might reduce the duty to &#189;d. per lb. without endangering the local industry.

        <para class="block">The production of arrowroot is an important industry in Queensland, and as the duty of1d. per lb. does not impose any heavy burden upon the consumers, it might very well be retained. The industry has assumed considerable magnitude in Queensland, largely owing to the aid afforded by the duty of1d. per lb., imposed prior to the introduction of the Tariff. I find that in 1900 there were thirteen arrowroot mills in Queensland, and that the area of land under cultivation of this crop was 700 acres. In the same year the northern State manufactured 772,282 lbs. of arrowroot, of which she exported 463,617 lbs. In the cultivation of arrowroot, none but white labour is employed. That ought to be an inducement to the committee to support the retention of the present duty. When this item was previously under discussion in this Chamber, I ascertained that various growers in the northern part of Queensland contemplated erecting a number of additional mills upon the Johnstone River, but that their action was entirely dependent upon the continuance of the duty of1d. per lb. If that duty be reduced, I venture to say that the industry in Queensland will absolutely disappear. At the present time it employs about 400 white people, and with the encouragement afforded by the retention of the existing duty it is destined to become in the near future one of the largest industries in Australia. I should not be discharging my duty to the people who are interested in it if I did not read to the committee a communication which reached me only last month. It comes from men who have a practical knowledge of the subject of which it treats. It reads as follows :  - </para>
        <para>We, the undersigned arrowroot manufacturers of Queensland, desire to draw your attention to the result that will follow the recent action of the Senate in proposing to remove the duty from arrowroot imported into Australia.. Owing to a succession of bad seasons, culminating in the present disastrous drought, our crops of arrowroot for the past two years have been the lightest ever known in the history of Queensland Previous to federation, with our usual rainfall, the crops were good, but our market was handicapped by import duties of the other States, and consequently prices to the grower ruled low, never exceeding &#163;12 per ton in bulk. With the advent of intercolonial free-trade, our surplus stocks found a market in the southern States, and large quantities were exported at the rates above quoted. When the House of Representatives imposed a duty of1d. per lb. prices firmed, and we have since been enabled, in some measure, to recoup ourselves for the very low rates of selling for the last five years previous to federation. With the protection afforded us by the import duty passed by the House of Representatives the industry recovered, fresh areas were cleared and planted, and we looked forward to recoup ourselves for the low prices prevailing for some years. The effects of the present drought in Queensland are too well known to reiterate here, but this we would emphasize - </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CONROY</inline>(Werriwa).- In reply to the remarks of the previous  speaker  I desire to point out that, according to the <inline font-style="italic">StatisticalRegister,</inline> Queensland exported in 1900, without the aid of any duty, -463,617 lbs. of arrowroot, valued at &#163;3,534. Therefore, the long explanation into which he entered is scarcely worthy of consideration. The production of arrowroot in Australia is practically confined to Queensland, which in 1900 exported &#34;190,942 lbs. to New South Wales, 35,125 to the United Kingdom, 39,328 to New Zealand, 92,599 lbs. to Cape Colony, and 3,248 lbs. to British Columbia. Seeing that it is possible for Queensland to export to outside countries, there is no necessity for the imposition of any duty upon this particular article. At any rate, we might well accept the proposal of the Government. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline>E. McLEAN (Lang).- When honorable members find the Minister for Trade and Customs in a compromising mood, they ought to accept his offer. Apparently the honorable member for Oxley has omitted to take into consideration the fact that from the 9th October, 1901, to the 30th June, 1902, only about 3 tons of arrowroot were imported into the Commonwealth. Only &#163;29 was paid in duty upon that commodity, half of which was collected in New South Wales. This item, therefore, seems to be a very paltry one to discuss, and as the Government are apparently in the humour to compromise, I think we should meet them in that very excellent spirit. Evidently the duty of1d. per lb. is a prohibitive one, as the small importations into the Commonwealth prove. </para>

As the last  speaker  referred to the past history of this product, I wish to point out that we are not legislating for the past, but for the future. Moreover, our population requires to be educated regarding the uses of arrowroot. There are tens of thousands of people in Australia who have no idea of its qualities as a food. It is a nutritious article of diet, which can be advantageously used from childhood to old age. I want to see the 400 or 600 men engaged in this industry protected. </para>

      <para class="block">This item affects a very large industry amongst our people. The duty originally proposed was 3d., and that was adopted by the House of Representatives. We have now been requested to reduce the duty to 2d. per lb., and the Government think that reduction ought not to be made. Even with a duty of 3d. per lb., we are collecting revenue at the rate of &#163;6,000 per annum, which shows that there is still a very large import of these articles. </para>

          <para>- The collections under this item do not appear to have been affected by the drought, because, as a matter of fact, they have been diminishing. The amount of revenue which will be collected during the twelve months upon a duty of 3d. per lb., will be &#163;6,000, and, if we reduce the duty by1d. it will mean that to get the same amount of revenue we shall have to import 50 per cent. more of the article. That necessarily means - I will not say the destruction of this industry, because it is a large one - but it means that it will be seriously injured. This, I remind honorable members, is a primary industry, and we should be very careful before we agree to any reduction of the duty unless it can be shown that it will result in some real benefit. I think we ought to be able to produce here practically all the bacon and ham we require. </para>

          <para>- No; but I do not propose to enter into the whole subject at this stage. We have already declared that the article is to be dutiable, and we have only now to decide whether the duty is to be 3d. or 2d. per lb. I repeat that to derive the same amount of revenue under the reduced duty proposed we must have a largely increased import ; and that will mean that, while we shall be getting only the same amount of revenue, we shall be taking away employment from our own people. I see no reason why we should adopt that course. </para>

          <para>- This is about the most indefensible duty in the whole of the Tariff. There are two main objections to it. In the first place the Government have lumped bacon and hams, though the price of bacon is, I suppose, about 4d. per lb., and the price of ham from lOd. to a ls. per lb. in ordinary times. To propose the same fixed duty upon both is clearly an absolutely unfair way of dealing with two articles, one of which is 100 per cent, more in value than the other. Then a duty of 3d. per lb. is practically a prohibitive duty at ordinary times, though it may not be prohibitive in times such as we have just been passing through. New Zealand is probably the only competitor we should have, and if we take bacon at 4d. per lb., and add to that 3d. per lb. duty, making 7d. per lb., and then the freight and charges across, will anybody tell me that this is not an absolutely prohibitive duty? I have been quite willing, as members generally oh this side have been, to vote for reasonable duties which will give revenue, and which, at the same time,  will have a protective incidence.  But so far as bacon is concerned, this is an absolutely prohibitive duty, and even at 2d. per lb. very little business will be done with New Zealand. If the committee will not recognise the reasonableness of this suggestion by the Senate, there is very little use in our discussing any of its other suggestions. On honorable members opposite must rest whatever trouble may come, and I have no doubt that they .are quite ready to meet it. We saw in the case of arrowroot the influences which have been at work. Pressure has been brought to bear on honorable members. It is very clear in whose hands tha Government are in connexion with these bogus proposals for agreeing to small concessions to the Senate. The present duty is unfair to the consuming public. Our platform has been in favour of the primary producer, whom I am as anxious to assist as is any one. But there is a large population who consume this article. If ever there was a cruelty imposed on the people in a time of drought, in a time of scarcity, it was when, not by an act of providence, but by an act of this Chamber, the price of ordinary commodities was almost doubled in a large portion of the Commonwealth. It does seem a cruel  irony  to say to them that there is to be no importation of a certain class of commodities on which poor people depend for daily sustenance. It is very clear that honorable members on the other side, who for the present form a majority in the Chamber, are determined to support the Government in all their proposals, and on them must rest the responsibility. </para>

        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. MACDONALD-PATERSON</inline>(Brisbane). - I rise to say that I am a pig-breeder, and that the honorable member for Wentworth does not \inderstand pig-breeding. The duty has no effect on the price of pork, and the honorable member cannot tell me when there was a side of bacon, introduced into Australia from any country outside New Zealand. The duty is collected on the hams. Those who like to enjoy York hams should pay a little extra for them. No one could obtain a York ham in Melbourne to-morrow if he tried. As a pigbreeder, I can say that the industry is flourishing, and that the drier the season is the better the pigs do, because they bore into the earth with their snouts and eat all the roots as the moisture retires from the shores of the swamps. A drought only affects country where pigs never have been or will be. Where the pure merino wool grows, pigs do not flourish. I, was surprised to hear my soft-goods friend giving himself away on pork when he knows very well that he should hold his tongue and leave the discussion of the question to specialists like myself and the honorable member for Maranoa, who know where pigs do flourish. </para>

        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline>E. McLEAN (Lang).- I do not happen to be a pig-breeder, but at the same time I think that the honorable and learned member for Brisbane has not enlightened the committee very much as to whether this duty should be reduced or not. He appears to be doing very well, but I submit that the amendment is a fair and reasonable one. If we agree to a duty of 2d. per lb. on these articles we shall give a very substantial measure of protection to the industry. In suggesting that the duty be reduced to 2d. per lb. the Senate has not taken an extreme course. It is not free-trade run mad, nor is it likely to be seriously destructive of revenue. It comes to us as a reasonable&#39; and proper compromise, and it ought to be met by the committee in that spirit. With reference to the remarks of the last  speaker  about a want of knowledge on this subject in certain quarters, I may say that the acting leader of the Opposition has a very much larger commercial interest in colonial industry in this respect than has any honorable member, and perhaps as large an interest as has any man in Australia. It is altogether out of place for an honorable member to throw such a suggestion across the Chamber. Everybody knows that the honorable member for Wentworth is very largely interested in the disposal of this kind of produce, and stands behind one of the greatest concerns representing the farmers of this country. I resent any suggestion that because an honorable member is largely engaged in the soft goods trade he knows nothing about the pastoral or agricultural industry. In this case the shot has missed the mark, because the honorable member at whom it was aimed happens to be perhaps more largely interested in the industry than is any man in the chamber. </para>

          <para>- If there is any one product that we should be able to produce sufficiently to meet our own requirements it is that of the pig industry. If the duty were 6d. per lb., it would not add one fraction to the price. On the contrary, a fairly substantial duty will have the effect of inducing more people to go into the industry, and the more people it employs the cheaper the product will ultimately become. When it suits my honorable friends on the other side they preach the cause of the primary producers ; but I notice that when a division is taken on a question affecting their interests, they invariably, like city men in another place, vote against them. In a few instances, the Senate offers a compromise in respect of the duties on primary products, but in most eases it proposes to abolish the duties. I hope that the committee will have a sufficient sense of fair play, although I know that the country element is very small here, to allow a reasonable amount of protection when it is quite patent that the duty cannot increase the price to the consumer. </para>

I am aware of the struggles and the hardships which the agriculturists have continually to endure ; but I also know that there is a large class of breadwinners outside the agricultural interest who must be studied. I am confident that a duty of 2d. per lb. on hams and bacon would be an ample protection to the great struggling class of farmers throughout the Commonwealth. I desire in every instance to encourage settlement on the land, and when we reach another item I shall in all probability give instances which will be against some of the free-trade advocates on this side, because I can speak from a practical knowledge of the subject. I am confident that the agriculturists throughout the Commonwealth can produce pork and bacon in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of all the States, and that they will be well protected by a duty of 2d. per lb. I hope that those honorable members on the other side who are closely identified with the agricultural interest will rise to the occasion and say that they want a fair measure of protection, if they choose to call it by that term, but that they do not require any extravagant protection. </para>

          <para>- We know that he was a great upholder of the stock tax which weighed more heavily on Victorian consumers than did anything else. There are many honorable members on this side of the Chamber who represent country constituencies which are much further away from any metropolis than is the Gippsland constituency, and in which there are more farmers than there are in Gippsland. If the honorable member for Gippsland believes that the higher the duty is made the lower the price becomes, why does he not move to increase this duty to 6d? But the fallacy of his contention is shown by the fact that in New South Wales the prices of bacon and hams have been higher since the duties were imposed ; und honorable gentlemen opposite tell us that the drought has not lessened supplies. </para>

            <para>- They have control of the local market now, because hardly anything besides York hams is imported. The duties are practically prohibitive now, und if honorable gentlemen are not satisfied, it seems to me that they ought to carry their policy to its logical conclusion, and introduce a measure making it penal to import foodstuffs or eatables. I think that the Government might readily lend an ear to the moderate voice of the Senate. A duty of 2d. per lb. is ample protection, and will make it possible for consumers to obtain supplies at reasonable prices in times of scarcity. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HENRY</inline>WILLIS (Robertson).The proposal of the Senate is most reasonable. The duty is an unnecessary tax upon the consumers of bacon and hams. The industry requires no protection. I represent a&#39; country constituency, and am very largely interested in the primary industries of Australia. I have had practical experience in pig raising in a large way, and I know that if the honorable member for Brisbane forces his pigs to subsist upon the roots which they are able to obtain in dried-up swamps, he is not engaged in the bacon industry. All he can keep are store pigs. To make good bacon and hams, the pigs must be fattened on the best food available. In New South Wales they are very largely fattened  upon corn and peas&#39;, and farmers at a distance from railway stations increase the value of their corn by turning it into bacon, and sending it to market in that form. All that the producers of ham and bacon require is a fair field and no favour ; they do not fear  the competition of the people of other countries. In my opinion, the Senate might, in the interest of consumers, reasonably have asked that the duty be remitted altogether, and I hope that their moderate request for a reduction will be agreed. to. </para>

          <para>- I hope that the Minister will not agree to the Senate&#39;s request. The acting leader of the Opposition said on a former occasion that there is no bacon or ham to be found in Australia which is superior to that produced in Queensland, and his statement wasborne out by the fact that at the last show of the Royal Agricultural Society, in Sydney, nearly all the prizes for bacon and ham were taken by exhibits from Queensland. That state of things is due to the operation of the Queensland State duty of 3d. per lb. upon bacon and ham, which has made it profitable to introduce good breeds of pigs, and to establish factories for the proper curing of bacon. This has also reduced the prices of bacon and ham to the consumers. I attribute the high prices now prevailing in Sydney largely to the drought. I know that Queensland bacon, which can be bought in Melbourne for lOd. per lb., costs ls. Id. in Sydney, although the cost of freight is less. Although the honorable member for Brisbane talks about keeping pigs in swamps, the}&#39; are reared most profitably in country where lucerne, maize, and pumpkins can be grown to fatten them. In the northern parts of New South Wales and the  southern  parts of Queensland, they are now importing fodder, and even maize, from the Argentine, to improve the condition of their pigs, notwithstanding the existence of the fodder duties ; and the price of pork has gone up in consequence. </para>

            <para>- I think that there has. At any rate, very little locally grown fodder has been procurable, even in districts which have hitherto done well in times of drought. I do not think the consumer will suffer owing to the imposition of this duty, because we shall shortly produce enough bacon and hams to meet all the requirements of the Commonwealth, and probably be able also to export large quantities. Some free-traders urge that as soon as an industry readies the exporting stage . there is no further need for protection, but the duties which assist local producers to secure their own market enable them to eventually export their surplus supplies,and thus  developed  the industry. I think, therefore, that the protection which has helped the industry up to the present time should be continued. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline>PATERSON (Capricornia). - I am almost ashamed to confess that I also have an interest in this industry. I have reared and cured pigs, and during the land boom in Melbourne I used to sell the output of one of the largest bacon and ham factories in Victoria. The demand for bacon and hams is largely a question of taste. There is one factory in Ballarat which produces bacon of such high quality that it sells at better prices than those realized for English bacon. Those who make good bacon do not need protection ; only those who turn out a bad article require any such adventitious aid. I agree with the honorable member for Lang, who spoke very temperately, that it would be -most unreasonable to refuse the request of the Senate, which errs on the side of moderation. The senators must have been in a particularly happymood  when they discussed this&#39; duty, otherwise they would have suggested a further reduction. I hope we shall not make a laughing-stock of the Commonwealth by imposing such a high duty as 3d. per lb. upon a primary product which does not require it. </para>

          <para>- This is one of the duties which operate only when the community can least afford to bear the burden imposed upon them. Whilst it is intended to confer benefit upon the producer it does not operate in that direction under normal circumstances. I do not agree with the honorable member foi1 Gippsland that by raising the duty we shall cheapen the commodity to the consumer, and I do not know how the honorable  member can consier  that by  cheapening the article  he will advance the interests of the farmer, whose profit depends upon the enhanced price he is enabled to secure owing to the duty. According to the return supplied by the Treasurer, it appears that the duty collected upon bacon and hams in New South Wales between the 9th October, 1901, and 30th June last amounted to &#163;1,020. Victoria realised only &#163;119 ; Queensland, &#163;74 ; South Australia, &#163;657 ; Western Australia - under the uniform Tariff - &#163;2,573 ; and Tasmania, &#163;33 ; the total amount being &#163;4,476. According to <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan,,</inline> the imports of bacon and ham into New South Wales from the other States during 1901 amounted to 1,216,688 lbs. Victoria supplied 208,000 lbs., Queensland 616,000 lbs., South Australia 391,000 lbs., and Tasmania 75 lbs. There was also imported from New Zealand 384,000 lbs., from the United Kingdom 95,000 lbs., and from the United States 91,000 lbs. The importations from other places were very small. The total importations into New South Wales from all sources amounted to 1,790,747 lbs., of an estimated value of &#163;58,095. During the same year New South Wales exported to the other States 453,971 lbs. of bacon and hams. To Victoria she sent 22,000 lbs. ; to Queensland, 1,000 lbs.; to South Australia, 70,000  lbs.;  and to Western Australia, 333,990 lbs. </para>

            <para>- The honorable and learned member appears to think that my argument is based on the fact that the Tariff has brought about a decrease in the exports, but I do not wish to advance any such  proposition  What I contend is that the large reduction in the supply of meat foods brought about by the drought has increased the demand for bacon and hams for local consumption. The New South Wales Government have recently supplemented their railway concessions to residents in the country who have been suffering from the drought, by reducing the freight upon food supplies, including bacon and hams, which are required to meet the demand hitherto supplied by locally-grown live stock. Under abnormal conditions, such as those now existing in that State, the whole community is being placed at a great disad vantage by the operation of the Tariff, because the price of food is increased by the imposition of the high duties. On the other hand, under normal circumstances, the producers, whom the duty is intended to benefit, do not reap any advantage from it, because it ceases to operate. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CONROY</inline>(Werriwa). - I had hoped that Ministers would show us that they were prepared to adopt some of the requested amendments of the other branch of the Legislature. Prior to the accomplishment of federation I find that the duty upon bacon and hams in Queensland and South Australia was 3d. per lb., in New South Wales they were admitted free, whilst in the other States the duty ranged from1d. to 2d. per lb. The Senate has now asked this Chamber to agree to an impost of 2d. per lb. - a course to which we might very well assent. Before the advent of federation Victoria was annually exporting 2,250,000 lbs. of bacon and hams, so that it cannot be urged that the imposition of any duty is really necessary. I would further point out that during a period of nine months the total imports in this line amount in value to only &#163;4,476, and I doubt whether even that quantity would have been imported had it not been for the disastrous drought through which we are passing. Under ordinary circumstances the demand is not quite so large, and, therefore, local consumption would not have overtaken our production as it seems to have done during the past seven or eight months. I am surprised at the attitude which the Government have assumed upon this question. Do not honorable members see that if all the requests of the other Chamber are to be treated as though they are of no account, we shall create a spirit of antagonism there whichwill bode very ill for the future of theCommonwealth? Owing to the bad administration which has taken place, general dissatisfaction and disappointment are experienced in connexion with federation. I have no doubt that if Australia were polled to-morrow, a majority of the people would vote against the federal union. I wish to avoid anything that is calculated to lead to a collision between the two Houses. If there is a collision upon what I regard as merely a second-rate matter, and a vote is taken upon it in New South Wales and Queensland, we shall have a dissolution of the union. This matter is a most important one, and I hope that Ministers will reconsider their decision. I regret that they have not manifested any spirit of fair dealing in connexion with the requests of theother Chamber. Under the bi-cameral system this House alone cannot expect to lay down the principles of government. If honorable members think that no consideration should be given to these requests, there must be an end to the bicameral system. Where we can make a satisfactory arrangement with the Senate, we should do so. This is a request which we can accept without causing any destruction of an industry, even from the most rabid protectionist point of view. Even Victoria, in the height of her protectionist fury, did not dream of imposing more than a duty of 2d. per lb. on bacon and hams. In New South Wales there was no duty. In Queensland there was a higher rate than that now proposed ; but the export of bacon and hams from that State was so large that it showed the duty to be inoperative. Some honorable members have denounced importations from foreign countries, but in this case New Zealand is the chief exporter. The very fact that honorable members opposite show no desire to consider these requests, indicates how incapable they are of joining in the government of a country. </para>

          <para>- I think it is unnecessary to discuss this request at any length. We had a very long discussion over the last item, and the argument with regard to it applies with equal force to this proposal. The returns show that the duty yielded between &#163;1,500 and &#163;1,600 per mouth during October, November, and December. That indicates that there is a very large importation - which consists for the most part of cheese - owing, no doubt, to the drought. I hold the same view of this request as I did of the last. </para>

        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir WILLIAM</inline>McMILLAN (Wentworth). - I do not intend to repeat the arguments used in regard to the request that the duty on bacon and hams should be reduced, and which apply with equal force to the proposal now before us. The price of butter ranges from 8d. to1s. per lb., while the price of cheese is only about 4d. per lb. ; yet we have the same duty on both articles. I agree with the honorable member for Canobolas that ingood times these duties are absolutely inoperative, and that in bad times it is a positive cruelty to the consumers to impose them. They increase the price of the article. I have some knowledge of this matter. So far as cheese is concerned the duty has been ingeniously put at the prohibitive point. When the duty is added to the cost price of4d. per lb., together with freight and other charges, the point of prohibition is absolutely touched. At a time like this, however, these goods must be imported, no matter what the price may be, because of their scarcity in Australia. Although many of these duties are presumably placed in the Tariff to protect the primary producers, we have this peculiar position : That in a time ofdrought, such as we are experiencing in many parts of Australia, these very primary producers are willing to have the duties removed. To me, as acting leader of the Opposition, it is really a question of whether there is anything to be gained by discussing these requests in view of the attitude of the Government. As far as I can understand, the Government have determined not to give way unless forced to do so by a vote of the committee, and honorable members opposite intend to confirm everything proposed by the Government. I presume that honorable members of the Opposition have to do their duty to the country and give their reasons for disagreeing with the Government proposals ; but I do not intend to make any long speeches. I intend to assist in getting a vote taken as quickly as possible, and I shall do my utmost to have what is, to a large extent, practically a farce, brought to a close during the current week. </para>

          <para>- I quite agree that there ought not to be any discussion unless some new facts can be brought to bear on any of the questions before us. I think that in the return which has been supplied to honorable members, showing the Customs and excise revenue for the past eight months, or a little less than nine months, there is a new fact which was not presented to us when we last considered this item. Upon that occasion we had before us an estimate of the revenue for the twelve months,showing that it was anticipated that the total revenue to be derived during the year from a duty of 3d. per lb. on butter and cheese would be slightly over &#163;4,000. But from the 9th October, 1901, to the 30th June last, the total revenue collected from this item was no less than &#163;57,975. That is a considerable advance upon the estimate of revenue to. be collected from this particular duty. </para>

            <para>- At any rate the tax upon the consumers is shown to be considerably greater than it was anticipated it would be at the time this matter was previously before the committee. I may refer to another point, though it may be considered that I am dealing with the matter from a parochial stand-point. There are those in this committee who consider the interests of their own States before the interests of the whole Commonwealth, and there are those who are continually talking of the necessitous States and their need for money. Whilst some States are necessitous from want of money, others are necessitous because they are being overtaxed. They are taxed too much, and their necessity is that they should not be taxed to that extent. If the whole Commonwealth were taxed to the same extent as Western Australia, this Tariff would yield more than &#163;20,000,000 per annum. I call the attention of the Government to the fact that of the total revenue of &#163;57,975 collected during the nine months under the Federal Tariff from this item, no less than &#163;22,592 was collected in Western Australia. </para>

In connexion with this and half-a-dozen other items, notably spirits and narcotics, the taxation in Western Australia is altogether out of proportion to the population of that State. Under these circumstances, I would ask that some consideration should be paid to that State. Honorable members are continually talking of the needs of Tasmania, Queensland, and South Australia, because of thenrevenue requirements, but some  consideration  ought to be paid to the fact that certain of the States of the Commonwealth are over-burdened with taxation. </para>

I believe that every member in this House representing Western Australia, with the exception of the Minister for Defence, has stated that the people of Western Australia never desired the local Tariff, and are not now in favour of it. I remind the committee that there is at the present time a motion under consideration in the State Parliament of Western Australia for the abolition of the sliding scale of local Customs duties, and I have no doubt that if the matter were submitted to a referendum of the people of Western Australia, those duties would be abolished by a two to one majority. </para>

            <para>- It has been proposed by the leader of the labour party, and there is a prospect of it being carried. I know that if the State Parliament represented the people of the States it would be carried by an overwhelming majority. I hope that some consideration will be given toWestern Australia in this matter, and if honorable members will only consider the position of that State in connexion with this particular item they will be prepared to concede the request of the Senate. Another point to which I should like to refer is that the request of the Senate in connexion with this item was carried both as regards butter and cheese by very substantial majorities. The proposal to reduce the duty upon butter was carried by sixteen votes to twelve, a majority of four, and the proposal to reduce the duty upon cheese was carried by seventeen votes to eleven, a majority of six. These are very substantial majorities, in favour of the request made upon each of these items, and I hope the committee will hesitatebefore they treat this request of the Senate with that discourtesy with which the requests of that Chamber have been treated up to the present. </para>

            <para>- I wish to say a word or two with respect to a matter upon which I have asked two or three questions within the past few days. I refer to the recent appointment of ten drill instructors to South Australia. The appointments have excited considerable feeling and much indignation in that State, especially in military circles. The grievance is that local men who have done the work for years past- and done it most efficiently - have been passed over, and that men from outside have been appointed at a cost to South Australia of over &#163;1,600 per annum. At the outset, I would like to say that I do not wish to utter one word against the men who have been appointed. I imagine that they are good men, and I have no reason to suppose that they are not. But I am sure that they have not beenappointed on the ground of any special efficiency, but simply because they were retrenched in other States, and it has been found convenient to send them to South Australia. I think honorable members will agree with me that what has been done is most unfair to the local men. In order that the House may be in a position to form an opinion on the merits of the matter, I shall state a few facts. About eighteen months ago the military forces of the State consisted of 3,000 men -the largest number for many years. The instruction was imparted by four drillinstructors, whose salaries aggregated the annual sum of &#163;690. In this work they were assisted by men who received the special pay of 3s. 9d. per night as militia drill-instructors.From the hands of these instructors have gone forth men who on the battle-fields of South Africa have done credit to South Australia, and on the parade-grounds of Melbourne and Sydney have presented a most satisfactory appearance. </para>

Under the circumstances, as may be imagined, it came as a great surprise to find that ten men from New South Wales and Queensland had been appointed to act as drill instructors in South Australia.

            <para>We consider that to appoint outsiders without first giving us an opportunity to compete for the positions is a great injustice. We are not afraid to compare our qualifications with those of any non-coms. from the other States, and leading officers have remarked that the South Australian forces in point of drill and discipline compare with any troops within the Commonwealth. Thousands of men have passed through our hands, and so far we have not been told that the result of our instruction has not been satisfactory. We have been completely passed over, and the sting is in the fact that we Were not given the slightest hint that permanent instructors were to be appointed. If we had known that we would have sent in applications. The pay of a sergeant is &#163;1 7s. 6d. a quarter, and those who have acted as instructors have received 3s.9d. extra for every night they were engaged in instructing. The whole of the forces have been trained by us, and while we have done the work for a few shillings a week the new men will get over &#163;3. After all we have done, is it too much for us to expect to be allowed to compete for. the permanent positions? </para>

          <para>The non-commissioned officer I am quoting puts the case very fairly indeed, when he says that he thought, not that the South </para>
          <para class="block">Australians should have been appointed, but that they should have been on an equality with others in applying for the positions. As some one may say that this statement is prejudiced, I now quote the <inline font-style="italic">South Australian Register,</inline> which may be regarded as impartial. That journal states the case in this way - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The point argued is that sergeants not on the permanent staff, but in thepartially paid regiments, have for the last ten years done practically the wholeof the instruction work, and should have been given the option of competing for the new permanent positions that are to be filled. In the &#39;public functions of the last few years South Australian troops have won encomiums both on their own ground and in parades in Victoria and England, as the result of the training given by non-commissioned officers of their own regiments, and  Colonel. Taunton  only this year expressed in general orders surprise at their efficiency in manvres in the Easter camp. Local officerscontend that their hard work, against great disadvantages, and with little remuneration, in maintaining the forces in their present efficiency, entitles them to some consideration, as well as does the fact that the South Australian contingents that have done such good service in South Africa were trained by local men. They point out further that some of those who have handled troops on hostile fields will as the result of their&#39; devotion to the country&#39;s service find themselves out of employment, and would, therefore, be glad to continue a military career. It can hardly be contended, either, that the imported officers will be more efficient, for the whole routine of drill is changed by the drill text books just issued, and. the local men would have as good opportunities of mastering the novel technique as they. Lastly, when the State has to suffer by the retrenchment of men from some departments, it is only fair that it should benefit by increases that must be made in others. </para>

            <para>As there are instructors in excess of numbers at present required in New South Wales and Queensland, some are being transferred to South Australia, instead of otherwise either increasing the total number of permanently-employed instructors under the Commonwealth, or of dismissing instructors who are qualified from other States in order to make fresh appointments in South.

          <para>Technically the appointment of local men would be &#34; fresh appointments,&#34; but fair play would say that the men who had done the work in the past should be continued in their employment, and not be made to suffer because in their State rigid economy had been practised. Last week the Adelaide press published a report which purported to be a defence by the Commandant.From this statement it would appear that military instruction in South Australia has been very seriously neglected in all arms of the forces, due to a want of efficient instruction ; that it is necessary to increase the instructional staff of South Australia, so as to bring its forces up to the same level as those in the larger States ; and that there are no qualified instructors in South Australia who will satisfy the conditions. When that statement was read it created great astonishment. The result was that a well-known Adelaide officer was interviewed, and this is what he said - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I should like to ask on whose authority the Commandant condemns us. He cannot know anything about the efficiency and discipline of the troops from personal knowledge, and it is impossible to believe that the late Commandant of this State could have so libelled us. In fact, Brigadier-General Gordon has always spoken in complimentary terms of this command. If the Commandant had acted on the report of  Colonel Taunton  - whom he specially sent here to inspect and watch the troops at work during the last Easter manoevres  - he would not have sent a single instructor from the eastern States. No officer could have spoken in more glowing and complimentary terms about M-hat he saw, and on the top of such a report, how can any one sneer &#60;it  the  efficiency of the men? The &#34;neglect&#34; which is spoken of is positively not due &#34; to a want of efficient instructors,&#34; for fully-qualified  non-commissioned  officers have always been available when there were recruits to be drilled and trained. One fact that should not be lost sight of. is that before any non-commissioned officer can be appointed to take charge of a  squad  he has to pass a stiff examination. Most of them went through the ordeal with flying colours. I admit that the local instructors are not equal to training nien for the crack Imperial regiments, but Australia does not want and does not require troops educated in all the ceremonial drill and frippery which characterize many of the regiments in the old country. </para>

All I can say is that, notwithstanding all the advantages in the way of musketry and gunnery schools, our forces compared favorably with those of the other States during the Sydney and Melbourne demonstrations. In drill and discipline when on parade, and in general soldierly bearing when off duty,  our  troops were not one whit behind the others. </para>

          <para class="block">I dare say that some curiosity is felt by honorable members as to what it was that  Colonel Taunton  did and said. I may explain that he was sent to South Australia last Easter by the Commandant to watch the troops during the encampment manoeuvres and that he reported that he thought the mounted rifles were as good troops as he had seen in Australia, well turned out, well mounted, and steady on parade. But that is not all. The Commandant himself comes into the matter. In sending on  Colonel Taunton&#39;s  remarks to  Colonel Rowell,  MajorGeneral Hutton made this statement - </para>

          <para class="block">There is  nothing  said there about inefficiency. Taking all the facts into consideration, I think the House will agree with me that it is not surprising that indignation prevails in South Australia, and that the local taxpayer resents being called upon to pay &#177;&#39;1,600 per annum when a very much less sum would have met all the requirements of the case. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BATCHELOR</inline>(South Australia).I wish to support the statements of the last  speaker,  who has put the case so exceedingly well that very little more needs to be said. I look at these appointments from two points of view - first, that the expenditure is unnecessary ; and, secondly, that injustice has been done to the local men, who have been performing these duties for so many years. Does any honorable member believe that there are no qualified men in South Australia to do this work ? The work of our drill instructors has been placed alongside that of the men who are supplanting them and has compared favorably with theirs, and to say that there are no qualified instructors in the State is, to my mind, most ridiculous. A special reason why  it cannot be so is furnished by the verv action of the Commandant in selecting for promotion, to the very much higher position of Commandant of the Victorian forces,. Brigadier-General Gordon, who for many years was Commandant of the South Australian forces, and who primarily must be held responsible if, as is stated, there are no drill instructors in the State. When the Estimates were under consideration the Government promised to reduce the military expenditure by the sum of &#163;130,000. Yet, in the face of that promise, they have appointed ten instructors to a very small force in a State where there are no recruits, and where there can be precious little work for drill instructors to do. It would seem that the only reason for appointing these instructors was to find billets for men who would otherwise have had to be retrenched. This House has decided that the military expenditure of the Commonwealth should be out down to the lowest limit consistent with efficiency, and therefore it was an entirely wrong thing to increase the military expenditure of South Australia by &#163;1,600 a year in themanner to which the honorable member, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Langdon</inline> Bonython, has rightly called attention. </para>

              <para>- That has nothing to do with the question which I am discussing. The officer to whom the honorable member refers would seem to be responsible for the inefficiency, according to the latest reports, of the South Australian forces. No opportunities were given to our local drill instructors to show that they are competent to do the work. Men have been sent from New South Wales to perform duties which were being performed by fully competent men for a few shillings a week, and South Australia will be called upon to pay their salaries. I do not thinksomuchof thatasof theinsultwhich has been put upon our officers. This is not the only instance in which the action of the Government has tended to render federation nauseous to the people of the Commonwealth. Some one has bungled, and we should have an explanation on the subject from the Minister. The reports upon the drill and movements gone through by the forces at Easter time were satisfactory, and therefore we should know why a change has been made. </para>

            <para>- The case put forward by the representatives of South Australia demands explanation. I do not know, now that the States are federated, that exception can be taken merely to the transfer of officers from one State to another, but I fail to see why highly-paid officers should be sent from another State to do work which has previously been done efficiently at low rates by local men. I wish to remind the Minister, while we are discussing military matters, that the House was promised an explanation in regard to the retirement of Colonel Templeton. </para>

              <para>- I fail to see how any saving can have been effected, since Colonel Templeton was not paid. The serious aspect of the question is this : That the 23,000 men who belong to our rifle clubs are deeply dissatisfied, and, as we must regard them as the nucleus of any force which may be required to defend our shores, such a state of affairs should not be allowed to exist without some attempt being made to remedy it. I hope that the Minister will reconsider the position, and allay their dissatisfaction. </para>

            <para>- The facts brought forward by the representatives of South Australia are worthy of the consideration of the Minister. They suggest that he should carefully scrutinise the recommendations of the military officials, however high in rank those officials may be, especially as, in the absence of aFederal Defence Act, it cannot be said that the Australian forces have, strictly speaking, been federalized. As a matter of fact, all the State laws relating to defence are still in force, and it is open to very grave doubt whether the military authorities have power to transfer men who have taken service under the laws of one State to serve in another State. It would be interesting to know under what authority these drill instructors have been transferred. In any case, the representatives of South Australia made out a strong case why they should not have been transferred. It does not appear that fresh appointments were necessary, because the old arrangements for the training and drilling of the South Australian forces could have been carried out without the assistance of officers from another State, since temporary men paid by the night could have been employed. In my opinion, the rights of South Australia and of the military officers there have been unnecessarilyinterfered with. It would also appear from <inline font-weight="bold">Major -General</inline> Hutton&#39;s report with regard to thelast </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Easter manoeuvres in South Australia that the forces of that. State were very well organized and trained, and in a high state of efficiency. Therefore, there could hardly have been any occasion for a special inundation of ten additional instructors, and an increased expenditure of &#163;1,600. I think the Minister would do well, not only to protect the interests of the temporary instructors, but to prevent the burdens of the State from being unnecessarily increased. I join in the hope expressed by the honorable member for Echuca, that the case of  Colonel Templeton  will be reconsidered. I understand that his retirement has been decided upon on the ground that his ageexceeds the limit mentioned in the regulations. I would, however, remind the Minister that when  Colonel Templeton  was appointed to the command of the Victorian Rifle Clubs a regulation was passed by the Victorian Government especially exempting the commanding officer of the rifle clubs from the operation of the age - limit provision. Therefore,  Colonel Templeton  could not be dismissed on account of his having exceeded the age limit. No &#39;doubt the power of the GovernorGeneral in Council is supreme, but the Victorian law is still in force and is ap7plicable to the rifle clubs of Victoria. Therefore, the Victorian Government, and consequently the Federal Government have no legal right to dispense with the services of  Colonel Templeton  on the ground that he exceeds the age limit  I respectfully invite the Minister to consider whether the decision relating to Colonel Templeton cannot be reversed. </para>

              <para>- I am referring to matters other than that mentioned by the honorable member. I must ask honorable members after what has taken place with reference to the military estimates, not to press for a re-appointment or a readjustment in every case where it has been found necessary to retire officers and men on the score of retrenchment. I first heard of the matter to which the honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Langdon</inline> Bonython, has referred when a question was asked in the House with regard to a paragraph published in one of the newspapers. On inquiry I found that the appointment of the additional drill -instructors was decided upon by the general officer commanding. I do not think that it is within the province of the Minister to make himself acquainted with details regarding the appointment and distribution of officers and men, unless his attention is specially directed to cases. I would point out that the military administration for the whole of Australia is being conducted from one centre, and not in the interests of any special State. </para>

Although each State may have to pay its own bill, the Defence administration must be of a general character, or it cannot be successfully carried out. Honorable members must expect officers and men to be moved from State to State, as occasion may require. When the appointment of additional drill-instructors in South Australia was brought under my notice, I ascertained that the matter had not been brought before me for approval in a  formal  way. It was a case in which the general officer commanding had, in the redistribution of the staff, decided to send additional men to South Australia.

These reductions have necessitated a decrease in the instructional staff, and the transfer of instructors has not involved increased expenditure to the Commonwealth as a whole. Honorable members declare that there is efficiency here and efficiency there ; but though I have had considerable experience in investigating these matters, I do not pretend to say where there is efficiency and where there is not.

              <para>- I know that, and I do not wish it to be inferred that I hold that the South Australian drill instructors are not efficient. But the Commandant there controlled them for a long period, and I suppose that he is being consulted by General Hutton. Who is better qualified to judge of their efficiency 1 I may tell honorable members that I have had to undertake a very difficult task in discharging a great many officers and men. I am determined, however, that the men shall not be retrenched without officers being similarly treated - that there shall not be a large number of men discharged and no officers. Upon all hands I am now being asked to reinstate officers who have received notice that they will be retired under the age limit to which reference has been made. I had no hand in fixing that limit, hut I have not varied it in one single instance. The moment I do, Ishall receive a shoal of applications to reinstate men who have received notice that they are to be retired. Moreover, the enforcement of the age limit relieves me of a very heavy responsibility. I have no desire to discharge either officers or men, but I have to perform a very thankless and disagreeable duty. As regards  Colonel Templeton  he is above the age limit. </para>

              <para>- I am informed that that regulation, under present management, is not in force. However, that is a technical point upon which I do not intend to offer an opinion at the present time. I wish, however, to express the hope that each State is not going to &#34;get its back up &#34; because this or that man is interfered with. The States must view this military question from a Commonwealth stand-point. The rate of payment to the men in New South Wales and Victoria is higher than that in any other State. I think that South Australia pays its men the lowest rate, and the great difficulty which I have to face is how to make the payment uniform. I am not going to attempt to reduce the payment made in New South Wales and Victoria to the level of that in South Australia, and I cannot very well increase the rate paid in South Australia to the average of the other States. </para>

              <para>- I shall ask why - that statement was made, and under what circumstances, and I have not the slightest doubt that I shall receive a satisfactory answer. I repeat that the question of the payment to be made is the most difficult problem with which I have to deal. I have already announced that the pay of the Naval Brigade in Sydney is to be reduced from &#163;10 to &#163;8 10s. per annum, and there must be some reduction in the rates received by the men in the highly-paid States. I will not reduce them very much if lean possibly avoid doing so. At the same time, I cannot increase the payment made in South Australia to the rate in vogue in the other States until that course can be adopted, without incurring very much additional expense. The recommendation of the general officer commanding is that we should have a uniform payment throughout the States, but it is impossible to give effect to that recommendation, and at the same time to conform to the direction of the House to the extent desired. lit connexion with this matter, I hope that reason will prevail, and that no hysterical agitation will be promoted in South- Australia or any other State. In New South Wales there is a stronger feeling of antagonism in military circles against the Government proposals than there is in South Australia, but it has not found expression in this Parliament, despite the fact that there has been- greater retrenchment in that State than in all the others combined as far as officers are affected. When the time comes for me to explain the whole of this scheme of defence retrenchment, both as regards the military and naval forces, honorable members will see that the  Statements  which &#39;have appeared in the Melbourne press to the effect that great reductions are being made in Victoria, but not elsewhere, are absolutely without foundation. In New South Wales a greater number of officers have been retrenched than in any other State, and a large proportion of them are under the age limit. I think, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that it is unnecessary for me to say more. I ask honorable members not to allow themselves to be carried away, as some appear to have been, by the agitation of the military and other persons&#39; interested in South Australia. The. statements of interested persons, such as the military officer to whom reference has been made, must be discounted. I do not know who the officer is, but he has criticised the general officer commanding, and I should say that is rather a serious offence. I think that the general officer commanding will take that view of tho case.&#39; If officers criticise acts of their general officer commanding, we shall have no military discipline. Such conduct is very much to be deprecated. I shall have a further conversation with the General in order that I may obtain fuller information. I have endeavoured to secure all the information available, but if I am satisfied - and I shall have to be satisfied personally - that there are tpo many of these instructors sent over, and that there is no work for them, the only thing for me to do will be to discharge some or all of them. </para>
