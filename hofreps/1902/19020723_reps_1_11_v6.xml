Colonel Taunton, who watched the recent Easter manoeuvres here, also expressed great pleasure at the evidence of careful training and discipline which he observed. Our instructors have worked on with very little encouragement for years, and it is only reasonable that they should expect some consideration when it is decided to employ regular instructors. Some of the best non-coms. in the active forces have expressed a determination to resign in consequence of their shabby treatment, and no wonder. </para>

                        <para>Following on the notification that the Victorian system of passing entries is to be adopted in this State, it seems that instructions have been issued that officers are not to give information to importers regarding the correct rate of duty to be paid on goods. This new and unpleasant instruction came into effect this morning. Importers who were in doubt regarding the correct rate of duty discovered that the approving officers could give no assistance as formerly. They must, therefore, in future use their best judgment and run the risk of the consequences should they commit an error of judgment, or go to the extra trouble of sighting the goods. This is exasperating, especially as it is difficult to see where an injustice would be done to any officer, or how the revenue could possibly sutler by the extension of what after all is only ordinary business courtesy. </para>

The only new direction given has been issued for the purpose of preventing the public from being led into error, and in order to secure to them the best advice as to the way in which they should make their entries. I found that some of my officers who were not competent to do so had been advising the public with results which ought, if possible, to be avoided. I therefore wrote the following minute : - </para>

                        <para>Confusion evidently arises from the loose practice which frequently prevails of every officer assaying to reply to inquiries by the public as to Tariff questions, and verbally. I desire that officers specially qualified be selected for this purpose, and that they will give their advice in writing in all cases, limiting it to declarations that in their opinion goods of certain descriptions - specifying them - are dutiable under specified Tariff items at specified rates. They will not initial any invoice until entry is duly made. </para>

Will the right honorable gentleman inquire into the matter and see how his instructions are being carried out, so that any officer who has to check an entry - prior to its presentation - may say what he will pass as the correct duty upon any particular article ? </para>

                            <para>- There is no intention to require anything in the shape of correspondence, but for the security of the public and to prevent the department being misrepresented, instructions have been issued that the decision must be given in writing. The idea is that the public, when approaching the skilled officer whom we shall select, may mention a certain item, and ask the rate at which it is dutiable, and that the officer shall give his reply. The last portion of the minute which I read just now distinctly sets out that he is not to overhaul the invoice till the entry has been made. Some time ago, instead of being required to answer a simple question as to the duty chargeable upon a specific article, there was practically an invitation to Customs officers, by perusal of the invoice, to assume the responsibility of themselves deciding, the rate of duty upon goods, variously described, which they had not seen. The proper course is for the importer to make the entry. Afterwards the checking, as regards the accuracy of the invoice, is undertaken by the examining officer. </para>

                        <para>- The question to which the honorable and learned member refers was brought forward some time ago. I communicated with the various Ministers for Works in the different States with regard to it, and I received replies which I think I gave to honorable members. Subsequently another question was asked upon the same subject, and I believe that I then wrote to the Department for External Affairs, asking that the States Premiers be communicated with. If the honorable and learned member will submit a question on the next day of sitting, I will give him a positive answer. </para>

                        <para>- The paragraph referred to appears to have been based upon an entire misconception. In the first place, no structural alterations whatever have been made in this building. In the second place, no additions have been made to the Parliamentary buildings for the accommodation of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, who are accommodated in rooms formerly occupied by members and officers of the State Parliament. Partitions have been erected in some of these rooms, in. order to provide accommodation for the typewriters. There could have been no undue expenditure in that respect, because the total cost of the alterations made since this building was taken over by the Commonwealth eighteen months ago amounts to only &#163;336. The paragraph appears to have been based upon a misunderstanding of the cost of all the repairs; furniture, fittings, and other outlays incurred in connexion with Parliament House during the past eighteen months. As honorable members are aware, that expenditure covers the provision which has been made for the press and for honorable members themselves. </para>

                            <para>- There has been no outlay upon these buildings except that rendered necessary by the fact that this is the Federal Parliament and not a State Parliament. Very much greater provision had to be made for the accommodation of members, officers, and the press. Although this is an extremely handsome and stately building, honorable members who formerly occupied seats in the Victorian Legislature know that it was extremely inconvenient in many respects, and I think that those associated with this Parliament know that it does not yet possess too many conveniences for the transaction of public business. </para>

                    <para>- Allusion has been made to the probability of an election for the House of Representatives and an election for the Senate taking place at the same time, under the same returning officer. This is suggested in the interests of economy ; but the clause provides that each polling booth shall be provided with &#34; a ballot-box,&#34; apparently not contemplating such a contingency as I have mentioned. This is an important point in connexion with economy, and I ask the Minister to give it consideration, especially in view of the suggestion by the honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton,</inline> that provision shall be made for the retirement of members of this House at the same time as the retirement of half the members of the Senate. Such a course, if adopted, would mean the saving of thousands of pounds. </para>

                    <para>- According to clause 156, which deals with the conduct of the scrutiny, the counting of the vote for each House will have to commence at practically the same time. In the South Australian Act it is prescribed that the scrutiny must commence without delay ; but it is obvious that the presiding officer cannot proceed with the counting of the votes for both Houses at one and the same time, and some special provision is required to cover the case. In South Australia they get over the difficulty by first counting the absentee votes for both Houses, which occupies only half-an-hour or three-quarters of an hour, and thus the Act is complied with. </para>

                        <para>- Clause 156 provides that the scrutiny shall commence &#34;as soon as practicable&#34; after the closing of the poll, and I should say that it was not &#34; practicable &#34; to count the votes for both Houses at one and the same time, so that I do not think any trouble may be anticipated. As to the point raised&#39; by the honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. V.</inline> L. Solomon, I do not think that there need be any doubt as to the meaning of the clause, but, should there be any necessity for amendment, it can be recommitted. </para>

                        <para>- There is another objection to the amendment. In South Australia, in centres where the poll is a large one, as at the Town Hall, Adelaide, a long table is provided, at which several polling clerks have seats, one issuing papers to electors whose names begin with any initial from A to H, another to electors whose names commence with initials from I to M, and so on. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but it is useless to challenge a vote at the ballot box. The time to do so is when the elector asks for his ballot paper. When there is a rush, and a dozen electors are applying for ballot papers at the same time, it is very difficult for one scrutineer to watch all of them, and make objection to any he thinks should be challenged. </para>

                        <para>- The New South Wales practice has been to have in the country one polling booth, one place to vote in, and one ballot-box ; and in the cities, where the voting is likely to be large, to have a number of ballot boxes, a number of poll clerks, and a number of compartments. The honorable and learned member for Darling Downs wishes to allow candidates to appoint a scrutineer for each compartment. It is impossible for one scrutineer to scrutinize the electors who present themselves in a dozen compartments. </para>

                        <para>- The ballot-papers may be issued by several poll clerks, but they must all be signed by the returning officer. It is usual for candidates to appoint two scrutineers, who may relieve each other, but who cannot both be present in the booth at the one time. There is no need for more than one scrutineer, because directly an elector asks for a ballot paper his name and number on the roll are called out loudly by the poll clerk who gives it to him, and the scrutineers then tick them off on their rolls. I have never heard candidates in South Australia suggest that they should be allowed to appoint more than one scrutineer. </para>

Candidates will then be allowed to appoint a scrutineer wherever a presiding officer is in charge. If half-a-dozen scrutineers&#39; were allowed, candidates might be put to considerable expense. </para>

                        <para>- I am afraid that if the word &#34;compartment&#34; is adopted, candidates may be able to appoint as many as perhaps a dozen scrutineers at some places. In South Australia, at the last election, a public &#39; hall was &#39;divided into a polling booth for the Legislative Council and another for the Legislative Assembly, and the clause would enable a candidate in such a case to appoint two scrutineers to represent him in the one room. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. L.</inline>E. GROOM (Darling Downs).Scrutineers are appointed so that they may, with the assistance of the electoral rolls, check the voting, and challenge any elector whom they think should not be allowed to record his vote. But under the clause as it stands, if there were one polling place but six polling booths, only one scrutineer could be appointed by each candidate, and he would be unable to check the voting in the six booths. It would, therefore, be advisable to .adopt the Queensland system, and allow one scrutineer for each polling booth. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BATCHELOR</inline>(South Australia).It would be a great mistake to permit candidates to remain inside the polling booth. I remember one case in which the partners of a candidate stood outside the door of the booth and tried to influence electors. That was considered as something approaching a scandal, but if a candidate were permitted to exercise his influence upon voters in the booth, the position would be much worse. </para>

                        <para>- I hope the committee will not agree to the amendment. In the summer time seven o&#39;clock might not be too early, but in winter it would scarcely be light at that hour, and, moreover, it would be difficult to have everything in readiness for conducting the poll. The various States have had a long experience with regard to the best hours to fix for polling purposes, and we should be guided by their practice. I find that in New South Wales the polling hours are from eight o&#39;clock to six o&#39;clock ; in Victoria from eight o&#39;clock to seven o&#39;clock - in the metropolitan districts ; in Queensland from eight o&#39;clock to four o&#39;clock -these hours may be extended by proclamation ; in South Australia from eight o&#39;clock to seven o&#39;clock ; in Western Australia from nine o&#39;clock to seven o&#39;clock ; and in Tasmania from eight o&#39;clock to six o&#39;clock. We are extending the hours in three of the States, but providing three additional hours in Queensland - except where a proclamation is issued extending the time - and an additional hour in Tasmania and New South Wales. Therefore I hope the committee will not agree to the amendment. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BATCHELOR</inline>(South Australia).In South Australia the practice has been to open the polling places from eight o&#39;clock in the morning to seven o&#39;clock in the evening, but all elections have been held on Saturday. But what I wish to put before the committee is that in South Australia it has not been found that the time allowed for voting is too long, although the elections there have always been held upon Saturday, when the bulk of the business men and workmen are disengaged. Under this Bill, however, the elections may be held upon any day, and as a great many people leave their homes at seven a.m. and cannot return from work in time to enable them to change their attire and record their votes by seven p.m., I do not think that eight p.m. is too late an hour for polling. </para>

He then has a hurried meal and begins to count the ballot-papers. At midnight he ceases counting. We have adopted extraordinary provisions to enable those who may be incapacitated to vote, but I hold that the closing of the polling booths at seven p.m. will disfranchise more electors than would be prevented from voting on account of serious illness and infirmity. Some men do not cease work until six or seven p.m. Take the case of hawkers. </para>

The point raised by the leader of the Opposition last night was that a man might move to another division and. the fact be overlooked that his name remained, on the register, there being no means of reaching him in order to ascertain whether he had the same qualification.

                    <para>- I think there is some need for the insertion of these words, inasmuch as a peculiar anomaly now exists in Victoria, and, possibly, in some of the other States, owing to the fact that, while the State electoral law says that only persons who are 21 years of age shall be entitled to vote, our land laws permit persons to select land when eighteen years of age, and their names often get upon municipal and parliamentary rolls as those of registered holders of land. </para>

                <para class="block">I desire the insertion of those words, because the question as to qualification is a vague one. An organized attempt might be made to poll men in a division from which they have removed; but if such men are asked directly if they still live within the division they will be less apt to give false answers than if a vaguer question is put to them. Furthermore, a man may believe that, although he has ceased to reside within the division, he is still qualified to vote in it, and he might therefore unwittingly give a wrong answer if asked - &#34; Are you still qualified to vote in this division?&#34; and thus render himself liable to serious penalties, although he had no evil intent. But if he is asked - &#34;Do you now live within the division?&#34; he will be able to answer the question with knowledge. </para>

                        <para>- I propose to accept the amendment of the honorable member for North Sydney, but I shall take care that the clause as amended will not conflict with the provision which I propose to introduce, continuing to an elector his right to vote during the interval when he has left one electorate and has not qualified for another, and providing for the case of teamsters and others whose occupations compel them to be continually travelling. I promise the honorable member for Bland that the matter will nob be overlooked, and that if there is any difficulty this clause will be recommitted. </para>

The amendment proposed by the honorable member for North Sydney will have the effect of disfranchising a number of electors in the metropolitan constituencies, because changes of residence are frequent. Some provision should be made so that an elector may not be disqualified from recording his vote in one electorate during the period which must elapse before he can qualify to vote in another. </para>

My experience is that returning officers are not very well acquainted with the law relating to elections, and that very often when they ask questions they do not. realize the true significance of the answers given, and find themselves in a, dilemma. The question as to residence should be put in a definite form, in order to indicate the period of absence which would disqualify the elector. Then there could be no doubt in the mind of the returning officer as to whether the elector was entitled to vote. </para>

In the first place, we should have to alter the provision that the returning* officer may put all or any of these questions. Supposing, for instance, he put the first question - &#34; Are you the person whose name appears on the roll for this division ? &#34; and the elector replied - &#34;Yes.&#34; It would be absurd to then ask, &#34; Are you otherwise disqualified from voting ? &#34; </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. L.</inline>E. GROOM (Darling Downs).Are we to understand that it is intended that the decision of the returning officer shall be conclusive, and that no question can be raised at the court of disputed returns ? There does not seem to be any provision in the Bill for afterwards dealing with any vote which may be called in question. Supposing a returning officer were to improperly allow an elector to record his vote ; what provision is there for dealing with the matter at a later stage? In Queensland, at the last election, the question of residence was raised, and a number of votes were challenged on the ground that the electors were not qualified at the time their votes were recorded. These cases could be brought before the elections tribunal, as . the votes were identifiable by the numbers placed on the ballot-papers. There is no such provision in this Bill, and apparently the question whether a person is entitled to vote rests entirely upon the decision of the returning officer. I admit- that in Queensland great objection is raised to the numbering of the ballot-papers, on the ground that the practice destroys to some extent the secrecy of the ballot. We might, however, make some provision for placing the votes questioned in a separate box, in order to permit of an investigation before the court of disputed returns. </para>

                    <para>- I think the ballot-papers should be numbered, because otherwise it will be difficult, if not impossible, in cases of impersonation to trace the votes given by those who violate the law. In some cases it is absolutely necessary for the purpose of inquiry to ascertain in which way the impersonator casts his vote, and it would be unfortunate if we adopted a system which would not permit of the votes being traced. </para>

It would be extremely hard if, owing to some omission or error, an applicant were refused a vote, even though the presiding officer had thoroughly satisfied himself as to his identity. The insertion of some general words would, I think, cover every possible trivial error that could arise, because we always have the safeguard that the voter must be sufficiently identified in the opinion of the presiding officer. </para>

                    <para>- I should like to know if the provision relating to the spelling of names is to have a general application. Paragraph (b) of clause 113 also contains a reference to the writing of the candidate&#39;s name by electors. If it be possible for a man to write his own name incorrectly, I am sure that the risk of error is greatly increased when he is called upon to write some one else&#39;s name. Only recently, in a North Queensland newspaper, I saw the Prime Minister referred to as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Barton. Therefore I desire to know if the provision in reference to the spelling of names is to be general in its application? </para>

                    <para>- I would suggest to the Minister the wisdom of inserting after the word &#34;officer&#34; the words &#34; or poll clerk.&#34; In some polling places the officials consist of the presiding officer and half-a-dozen poll clerks. It is the duty of the latter to hand the voting papers to the electors, and it is equally their duty to tick off upon the roll the names of the voters to whom ballot-slips have been issued, so that a record may be kept of those who have voted. But it is impossible for the presiding officer to undertake the whole of this work, which should properly devolve upon the poll clerks. </para>

At any rate I ask the Minister to take a note of the point which I have raised, and to look into it very carefully. We certainly require a record to be kept by a properly authorized officer of the whole of the voters to whom ballots lips are issued.

If there is to be only one presiding officer for each polling place,andthere arehalfadozentables,I do not see how he can perform all the duties required of .:him. Some alteration will have to be made, and the question raised is worthy of consideration, in connexion with not only this, but with other clauses. By an amendment in clause 126, or elsewhere, the presiding officer should be given power to appoint a substitute to perform certain of the duties, or else the poll clerk should be appointed to perform them. </para>

                <para class="block">This amendment has been suggested to me by an old and experienced returning officer in South Australia. To allow an elector to himself place the voting paper in the ballot-box seems a departure from the custom which prevails in some other places. In South Australia the paper is handed to the returning officer, who then has a means of seeing whether there is only a single paper, and of detecting any fraud, and the system has worked very well. The amendment also has the advantage of allowing the presiding officer to exercise better control in the case of double elections which, in the futherance of economy, we hope may toe adopted for the Commonwealth Legislature. In South Australia cases have occurred in which the ballotpapers for the Legislative Assembly have found their way into the box for the Legislative Council, and <inline font-style="italic">vice vers&#226;,</inline> and it is desirable that such occurrences should be prevented. In my opinion there is an element of danger in allowing the electors to themselves place the ballot-papers in the ballot-boxes. </para>

The electoral legislation of that State has been the model for much of the electoral legislation of the other States, but none of the frauds which appear to have been so frequent in Queensland have been practised there. Perhaps an efficient safeguard is provided by requiring the voter to show the returning officer the ballot-paper with his signature upon it. </para>

                        <para>- The voter has the satisfaction of knowing that his vote is recorded as he wishes. I think that the latter part of the clause, which provides that any blind or illiterate person may be accompanied to the polling booth by someone else, gives large possibilities for influence, compared with which those given by the postal voting provisions are insignificant. There is nothing to prevent persons from pretending to be illiterate, and I know that in one case 50 electors voted as illiterates at one polling booth, so that it should be known if any one went wrong. </para>

                        <para>- He could tell by the heading which was the top. In South Australia we have never made provision for illiterate voting, and it has never been found to be necessary. Why should we load up the Bill with provisions intended to meet only fanciful difficulties, which as a matter of practical experience have been found not to exist? This cumbrous provision may result in the elector having indorsed upon his voting-paper something contrary to his wish, and I see no object in allowing two or three men to accompany the voter, when he can do everything that is required by himself. </para>

                    <para>- If we could believe that illiterates no longer existed in Australia, or that they were likely to cease to exist in the immediate future, we might abandon any idea of providing for them. Unhappily, however, owing to the sparse settlement in many parts of the Commonwealth, schoolmasters cannot reach the whole of our people, and many children are now growing up as illiterates. This state of affairs will continue until the country is much more thickly populated. There is no reason why we should add to the disabilities under which an illiterate man labours by preventing him from exercising the right to vote which he may have earned by his good character and conduct. </para>

                    <para>- I hope the Minister will adopt the suggestion of the honorable member for Bland. My constituency is one in which there are a great number of people who have grown .up in ignorance because they were not within reach of a &#39;school. Many children are being brought up in the bush without any chance of going to school, or even of seeing a township. Some of the people in Western Queensland never saw a railway train until a few years ago, and to this day there are many who have not seen the sea. Surely people so situated should not be disfranchised because, owing to circumstances beyond their control, they cannot read and write. The honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor,</inline> apparently thinks that South Australia can do no wrong, but in that State . we find that the percentage of voters who exercise the franchise is lower than in any other part of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I have had dealings with electoral matters ever since I have been in Queensland, and I know of the dodges which are resorted to. On one occasion, when I was acting as scrutineer, an illiterate elector came in, and told the returning officer that he desired to vote for a certain candidate. The returning officer thereupon struck out the wrong name, and proceeded to place the voting-paper in the ballot-box ; but I interfered, and demanded that the paper should be altered, and thus secured a vote for the candidate in whose interests I was working. On another occasion upon which I was acting as scrutineer the returning officer gave an illiterate voter a paper, and told him to strike out the name at the bottom of the list. The desire of the elector being to support the candidate against whom I was working, I wished to secure the man&#39;s vote. I entered into conversation with bini, and succeeded in turning the paper upside down. The elector then took the paper into the voting compartment, and struck out the words &#34;ballot paper,&#34; and the name of the candidate first on the list. </para>

                        <para>- After he secured his voting paper I had a conversation with him. On another occasion, a man who was nearly blind would not permit the returning officer to mark the paper for him. The printing on the ballot-paper was very faint, and the elector made his marks on the back of the paper instead of on the front. There will always be illiterate persons in every electorate, and I hope that the Minister will consent to insert some such provision as that suggested. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline>B. EDWARDS (South Sydney).The provision intended to permit any person indicated by the voter to accompany him to the voting compartment for the purpose of marking his ballot-paper is fraught with very great danger. If we were to leave it entirely to the returning officer, there might also be some danger, but the marking of the paper might be left to the presiding officer and two scrutineers. The marking of the voting-paper should not be left to any person indicated by the voter, because that would open the door to fraud. No doubt many electors are illiterate through no fault of their own, and there is no reason, or justice, or policy in denying them the right to exercise the franchise. We ought, however, to provide such safeguards as will insure the carrying out of the intention of the voter without opening the door to fraud, and that can be done only by leaving it entirely to the returning officer, &#34;or to the returning officer and one or two of the scrutineers. </para>
                <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HENRY</inline>WILLIS (Robertson).We shall offer encouragement to fraud if we afford the agent of the candidate an opportunity to satisfy himself that an illiterate voter whom he has bribed has cast his vote as desired. There are a number of men to be found in large communities who would not hesitate to sell their votes, and there are others who would buy them, provided they could satisfy themselves that the votes were cast in a particular way. We should leave the illiterate electors to their own resources, as in South Australia. The results can be no worse than have been recordedinthatState. </para>

                    <para>- As honorable members will observe, this provision deals with elections for the Senate, and the question naturally arises, to what extent this House should assist in laying down the conditions upon which the members of the Senate shall be elected. The clause practically provides that whenever vacancies arise in the Senate, the electors must vote for the full complement of senators required. That is to say, they are debarred from plumping. I desire to excise the last sentence from this clause. It may be laid down as a principle that this House should leave to the Senate the task of determining the conditions under which its members should be elected, but I think we are quite within our powers in indicating those upon which we think they should be returned. The other Chamber has already asserted its powers in this direction by deciding that it shall have the right to approve of the electoral divisions mapped out for the return of members to this House. It it for us to exercise a similar power. Ido not believe that any elector should be compelled to vote for the full number of senators required to fill vacancies. The individual voter should have an absolute choice in the matter. If out of those who are nominated he is of opinion that he can conscientiously vote for one only, he should be allowed to exercise his conscience freely and to vote accordingly. If he is compelled to vote for the full number of senators to be elected, it may be that the very vote which he is obliged to record in favour of the individual whom he desires to see excluded will result in his return, as against the candidate whom he particulars favours. I hold that complete liberty should be given to the elector in this connexion. In other words, he should have the right of plumping. Therefore I move - </para>

                        <para>- My argument is equally good if applied to other States where the members of the Upper Houses are elective and not nominee. I think it is unfair for the Senate to require that the electoral divisions for the House of Representatives shall be approved by that Chamber. Should the States be divided into electorates for the return of members totheSenate,as they may be under the Constitution, I should hold that the other House was the proper body to determine the boundaries of those electorates. If this House interfered in a matter of that sort I think that the Senate would rightly object. </para>

                        <para>- In the States the Legislative Council has never been allowed to determine the electoral divisions for the popular Chamber. The honorable and learned member for Darling Downs wishes to give the electors the right of plumping for the Senate. I do not think that we should interfere with what the other House has done in regard to this matter. If the Senate desires that the elector shall vote for the full number of candidates to be elected, why should its wish not be respected ? As far as I am personally concerned, I do not approve of plumping, and I hope that the committee will reject the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. It is a question of legislating for the Commonwealth, as awhole,by the Parliament of which we form one part, and the Senate another. Concerning this particular clause it seems to me that in declaring that the elector shall vote for the full number of candidates required, the Senate stopped short of doing that which would to my mind have been a good thing. The value of the present proposal is very question- able. If the other House had decided that the-elector should vote for candidates according to the preferential method, it would have accomplished some good. But as the honorable and learned member for Darling Downs has pointed out, it may fall upon an elector to vote not only for the candidate of his choice, but for one whom he does not wish toseereturned. </para>

                        <para>- That is the same thing, and I rather regret the Attorney-General is not in the House to advise the Government on this one of the first occasions on which the question of the relative powers of the two Houses has arisen. I contend that Parliament must be taken as a whole, and that both Houses have equal rights in dealing with the machinery under which members of the Commonwealth Parliament are elected. The analogy drown by the Minister is not quite correct when he likens the Commonwealth Constitution to the original State Constitutions. The Senate is in no respect an Upper House. We may use the terms &#34;Upper &#34; and &#34;Lower,&#34; but they do not apply to the Constitution under which we live. There is neither an Upper House nor a Lower House; one House represents the States and the other House represents the people, and both have equal rights in this matter. On that point I feel, asa layman, quite clear. With the right honorable member for Tasmania, Sir Edward Braddon, I should have preferred the Senate to &#34;go the wholehog,&#34;and provide for preferential voting. But &#34; half a loaf is better than no bread,&#34; and to do away with plumping is, at any rate, one step nearer to the condition of affairs which those who advocate proportional representation are seeking to bring about. If we allow plumping it will mean plumping all round. Every section of the community - religious, political, and social - will plump for a particular candidate or candidates, and in that way we shall not get the expressed will of the people. The result will be those accidents of party warfare which are to be deprecated ; and the only way to avoid them is to oblige the voters to vote for the total number of candidates to be elected. The honorable and learned member for Darling Downs has pointed out the difficulties under which electors will labour in having to vote for men in whose political views they have no confidence. But the remedy is&#39; in the hands of the electors, who ought to see that candidates are nominated for whom they can vote. Unless the full number of members required are voted for, we shall, as I have said, get only sectional voting. The labour party will naturally vote for a certain restricted number, and the same with the fre&#34;e-trade and protectionist forties. And these parties will be split up on religious, temperance, or other questions. The only way in which we can provide against Such a disastrous state of affairs is to adopt the clause in the Bill. On the other point, I shall always claim that both &#39;Houses are equally free to deal with the machinery devised for carrying out the provisions of the Constitution. </para>

That system would have had the advantage that in both Houses the basis of representation would have been community of interests; nothing has been substituted for proportional representation, and, in my opinion, we have a perfect right to deal with the measure from any point of view. </para>

                        <para>- I know that the Minister put the question rather as a matter of propriety or courtesy. I presume the Government had good reasons for proposing the system of proportional representation, and, seeing that the Senate rejected that proposal,&#39;! think that this House ought to have an opportunity of discussing the question and adopting such modifications as it may think fit. I will not strain the point raised by clause 24, although no doubt we have a precedent in the fact that the Senate made some proposals interfering in matters more particularly concerning the House of Representatives. </para>

                    <para>- There is something for consideration in the view of the honorable member for the Grampians, that we are now asked to view this measure, not as it was originally formulated by the Government, but as it emerged after having been considered by the Senate. I question the stand taken by the Minister - that it is not advisable for this Chamber to express an opinion on this particular clause. It is the duty of . the House of Representatives, as well as that of the Senate, to voice within the walls of Parliament the public opinion which, prevails outside. The fact that this clause happens to&#39; relate particularly to the Senate is no reason why the desires of a large section of the people should not be expressed within this Chamber. A big principle underlies the amendment of the honorable and learned member for Darling Downs. That proposal simply asserts the right of every voter to judge for himself as to how many or how few of those nominated shall receive his support, and we should be careful in limiting that right. At the senatorial elections in New South Wales there were what were known, as &#34; bunches&#34; run. There were &#34; bunches&#34; of six representing respectively the two big parties of free-traders and protectionists : there was a &#34; bunch &#34; in the labour interest, consisting of two nominees, and one in the socialist interest, while several nominees ran &#34;on their own.&#34; There were something like 50 candidates nominated for the six vacancies, and the result of the election showed that a large number of the electors preferred one or two members short of the number required by law. The result was that these voters, in what I consider a legitimate and reasonable exercise of their right of choice, were disfranchised. This is sufficient evidence of a very strong feeling amongst the electors that they should not be compelled to vote for men of whom they do not approve. The honorable member foi- South Sydney says that the electors should see that such nominations are made as will permit them to exercise their votes ; but it is more in accordance with natural rights to give a choice of those who are nominated. I shall support the amendment, which I regard as fair and just. </para>

                    <para>- I do not think that we need have any doubt as to the propriety of this Chamber dealing with this clause. No restrictions are imposed upon us in this connexion, and we have a perfect right to deal with this matter, just as the other Chamber has a right to express views as to the basis of the elections for the House of Representatives. But I am absolutely against the proposal to allow plumping. If it is desired, under our system of Government, that sections should be represented, we have adaptations of the Hare-Spence system, and there is also the method of single-member constituencies. But I am absolutely against introducing into .this measure any proposal which would result in the state of affairs seen in three member constituencies in New South Wales when plumping was allowed. </para>

                        <para>- I am satisfied that by such means we shall not obtain the representation of the will of the people. Sharp electioneering agents frequently managed under that system that men should be elected who would have had no chance of success had they contested the seat against some of the candidates who were .rejected. That is not a representation of the people. Under that system, while a proportion of the electors would give their votes for the full number of candidates to be elected, less scrupulous persons might be influenced by organizations to give all their votes to the one candidate, who would receive also the votes cast for him by electors who voted for the full number, and selected him as one of them. In that way a candidate might slip into the position of a representative without really representing the views of the majority. The objections to the system were made manifest in New South Wales at election after election, and it is not desirable to introduce it here in connexion with Commonwealth elections. If it is considered desirable by the majority of the committee that we should have proportional representation, let us adopt that system : but if a simpler system than that is desired, but one which will give approximately similar results, let the senators for each State be returned individually by separate constituencies. </para>

                        <para>- In my opinion, the preferential voting system is unsuitable where there are single constituencies, but, by having single constituencies, you can obtain roughly what is aimed at. The system of plumping is one which may be worked to the advantage of the sharp and unscrupulous, against the simple but more honorable and scrupulous. It has not worked in the direction of securing fair representation, and I therefore prefer the provisions of the clause. </para>

                    <para>- I have no hesitation in recording my vote for an amendment of the clause, because I consider that I was sent here to represent my electors in regard &#171;to the determination of the conditions which shall prevail in the election of senators as well as in regard to other matters. As I understand the meaning of the term &#34;plumping,&#34; it is something quite different from what certain honorable members have in their minds. In the old country, it is customary at certain elections to give the electors as many votes as there are candidates to be elected, and they can vote for the full number of candidates, or give the whole of their votes to one candidate, or dispose of them in any other way. But the system suggested by the honorable member for Darling Downs is. something quite different. It simply gives each elector the right to exercise his judgment in regard to the various candidates, and allows him to vote for one or more as he thinks right. Although I have heard many objections to this so-called plumping system, I have heard no satisfactory reason why it should not be adopted. There seems to be a good deal of objection to it in the minds of many honorable members and persons outside, because of the possibility it affords of allowing electors to cast all their influence for the return of certain candidates, and it is urged that it is likely to be exercised largely on behalf of labour representation. In <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> opinion, however, it is more likely to be used against labour representation than in favour of it. Amongst the working classes there are more electors prepared to give votes to other than labour candidates than there are electors among the other classes who are prepared to give votes to labour candidates. We are told that the system will prevent the verdict of the people being obtained upon any definite issue, because electors will be influenced by considerations other than those actually placed before them. But. if a man wishes to practically disfranchise himself we should let him do so. It might happen that an elector who was called upon to decide between the free-trade and the protectionist parties might say that he was a protectionist, but would not support a Catholic. He might discover that there were two or three candidates who were both Protestants and protectionists, and he might then decide to still further limit his selection by saying that he would vote only for an ardent teetotaller. In that way, he might cut down his privileges, and even disfranchise himself, and, if he chooses to do so, I do not suppose the country will be much the worse. Parliament would not be justified in compelling any elector to vote for candidates of whom he did not approve. It would be immoral to do so. Instead of getting nearer to the preferential system, when we compel the electors to vote for the full number of candidates required we are getting further away from it, by preventing them from exercising any reasonable choice, since if a man has to vote for six candidates he may have to vote for several to whom he has the strongest political and even personal antipathy. </para>

                    <para>- I trust that the amendment will be carried. I have known of elections in Victoria in which the electors should not have been compelled to vote for any candidate, but the Bill requires electors to vote for the number of candidates to be elected, which is wholly opposed to the principle of proportional voting, which was originally proposed by the Government. The honorable member for Flinders has given notice of his intention to move that an elector who fails to vote shall be fined&#163;5 for the first offence, and between&#163;10 and &#163;20 for the second. Perhaps he would make the penalty for the third offence hanging. If that motion were carried it would be monstrous to compel an elector to vote for the full number of candidates to be elected. No elector should be compelled to vote for persons whom he does not think should be elected. It has been said that as in Victoria the protectionists are in a majority, the free-traders of this State will have no representation in the Senate, but I think that a minority, especially if it is a substantial one, has a right to representation, if it can secure a sufficient number of votes to return a candidate. No man should be compelled to vote for a candidate who would not adequately represent his views. At the last federal elections four out of the six States allowed the electors to please themselves as to the number of candidates for whom they voted, but in New South Wales and Victoria the block-vote system was adopted. It has been urged that the electors are allowed even under this system to practise plumping, because they throw away some of their votes upon candidates who have no possible chance of election. This, however, is not likely to be resorted to extensively, because if a deposit is required, there will not be the number of candidates that there was previously in States where no deposit was required; and there will not be the same opportunity for throwing away votes. The effect of the system proposed will be to secure the representation of the political party which may be in the majority, however slight, and to ignore the rights of the minority, however large. The press will issue their political tickets, and the chances are that in New South Wales the free-trade party will be triumphant, and that in Victoria, the protectionists will carry the day, to the exclusion of all other sections of the voters. Forty- nine per cent. of the electors may be in. favour of a certain candidate, and yet be unable to secure his return. We should afford the electors every opportunity of deciding for whom they will vote, and we need not fear that plumping will be very largely, resorted to. Some honorable members hold that we have no right to decide the conditions under which the elections for the Senate shall take place, but I contend that we are perfectly entitled to amend the Bill in the direction proposed by the honorable and learned member for DarlingDowns. </para>

                    <para>- The amendment proposed by the honorable and learned member for Darling Downs is so reasonable that I am at a loss to conceive what objections can be urged against it. The honorable and learned member is now taking up the position which was originally assumed by the Government. The provision which it is now sought to amend was inserted after the introduction of the Bill. The object of the amendment is to secure to the electors a perfectly open franchise, which they may use in any manner they please, whereas under the clause as it now stands they will probably be compelled to vote for one or more candidates of whom they cannot approve. Suppose that three senators had to be elected, and that of the only really eligible candidates two were free-traders and one was a protectionist; would not a hide-bound protectionist do great violence to his feelings if he had to vote for the free-traders? Similarly, I might be called upon, in order to cast the required number of votes, to vote for a man whom I should regard as a political fossil. Such situations must constantly occur if the provision is passed as it stands. Electors will, in many cases, have to vote against the dictates of their conscience, and, act in a way which will militate seriously against what they conceive to be their interests. The honorable member for South Sydney stated that certain scandals and complications of a serious character had occuredinNew South Wales when plumping was allowed, and he urged that the wish of the people rather than that of the individual should be expressed. I would point out, however, that individuals must have a perfectly free hand in choosing their representatives in order that the views of the people may find adequate expression. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable member for Yarra made a very strong: point when he declared that,ifwe agreed to the clause as it stands, we should place the whole of the States under the control of the press, and absolutely destroy State rights. So many people would be practically disfranchised as to entirely neutralize the effect of the voting facilities granted by the other provisions of the Bill. The Minister for Home Affairs is absolutely; fair in. most matters, but in this instance he is taking; up an unreasonable attitude. If we had adopted the Hare-Clark system, the votes cast would have been estimated at their proper value, but if the clause is passed in its present form hundreds of conscientious people will abstain from voting rather than support candidates of whom they cannot approve. If I were called upon to vote for three candidates, and could not approve of more than two of. them, I should probably throw away my third vote upon a man whose chances of election I regarded as hopeless. Thousands of others might do the same, and an utterly unworthy representative might be elected. </para>

                <para class="block">Protectionists might be compelled to vote for free-traders, and free-traders for protectionists. I remember one case in America in which seven candidates submitted themselves: for election, and only one of them had not shot a man. If in that case the electors had been called upon to vote for three candidates out of the seven, those who did not believe in murder would have been compelled either to vote for two murderers or to abstain from voting. If three senators had to be elected for Tasmania, and only one of the candidates was opposed to &#34; Tattersall&#39;s&#34; sweeps, the conscientious opponents of &#34;Tattersall&#39;s&#34; sweeps would be compelled to vote for two supporters of that institution, or abstain from voting. </para>

I must ask the Minister, as a man of reason and justice, to carefully consider this matter. The proposal in the Bill will practically disfranchise every church throughout Tasmania at the next senatorial election. It will simply compel a few of us to put our hands into our pockets for the purpose of running dummies. Great heaven ! have we not enough hypocrites and sycophants in Australia ? I appeal to the Minister not to insist upon a provision which compels an elector to vote for a candidate irrespective of whether or not he desires to support him. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member credits the States with very little intelligence if he thinks that it is impossible to secure the services of six thoroughly qualified candidates. If any important question is likely to engage the attention of this Parliament, and if there be a sufficient number of electors in favour of one candidate to insure his return, the same body of voters can nominate and return five other candidates holding similar political opinions. What possible harm can accrue to the Commonwealth if the electors are required to choose the six most suitable candidates from their point of view? If they find that there are not six candidates in accord with their views, there is nothing to prevent them from nominating six who are. I cannot understand the argument of the honorable member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Malley,</inline> who declares that under this clause a large number of the electors in each State may be disfranchised. It is evident that those electors must be in a minority, and the principle of democratic Government is that the majority shall rule. I intend to support the clause. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member proved himself a democrat just now by seeking to deny representation to those holding a different political faith from that of the majority. I ask the Government to adhere to the Bill as nearly as practicable in the form in which it was originally introduced. At that time it contained provisions for the adoption of proportional representation - provisions which have since been eliminated. I think it is incumbent upon the Government in such circumstances to adopt the next best scheme, instead of the other extreme, namely, . that of the block vote. Under a system of proportional representation, the idea is to secure a fair representation of the views held by the people. The adoption of the system of the block vote will entirely defeat that object, and will ensure not only that the majority shall rule, but that the minority shall be absolutely unrepresented and unheard. Under the block-vote system, if in any one of the States the two opposing political parties were almost equal in numbers, nearly half the community would be entirely unrepresented in the Senate. </para>

In Victoria there is believed to be a majority of protectionists, and in New South Wales a majority of free-traders. Is it suggested that in each case only the majority shall be represented independently of their numerical strength? That would be a scandalous position to assume. </para>

                        <para>- Majority rule is one thing and representation is another. While the majority must rule in this House, the members returned are able to submit divergent views ; this is something more than the mere recording place for the views of the majority. We do not always receive the proposition from the Chair with our minds fully made up ; there is always the opportunity of converting a minority into a majority. Our recent political history has shown that the free system of voting has returned members of no less ability than those returned under the block system. In South Australia the people were allowed to vote as they liked, and that State has in the Senate to-day an absolutely fair representation, of which as a South Australian I am proud. On the other hand, three or four years ago, at the time of the elections to the Federal Convention, not a single labour representative was returned, except Mr. Trenwith of Victoria, and he was &#34; run on a ticket.&#34; I do not say that labour representatives would have been superior, or even equal, in mental calibre and statesmanlike ability to the gentlemen who were elected to that Convention, but that fact remains that, owing to the enforcement of the block system, no such representative was returned, notwithstanding that so large a proportion of the population belongs to the labouring classes. That is an illustration of the absolute tyranny of the majority. Ten members had, in South Australia, to be elected to that Convention, and amongst the candidates were three representatives of labour, the object being to secure a fair representation. The position was similar in every State except New South Wales. Most of our party voted for the three men and for liberals, bringing the number up to six or seven ; but the same electors had to vote for men whom they did not desire to see at the Convention, and to whose political views they were utterly opposed. The Adelaide press, and every fair-minded man, recognised this as a most unfortunate result of the block vote. Is the honorable member for Macquarie a party to a movement to prevent any labour representative obtaining a seat? </para>

                        <para>- The representation of New South Wales in the Senate would give greater satisfaction if that State had sent some labour representatives. I acknowledge the undoubted ability of the senators from New South Wales, but I am speaking of the best means of expressing the will of the people. The result of the Federal elections in South Australia was the return of three protectionists and three free-traders to the Senate, and three protectionists and four free-traders to this House, the balance thus being, slightly in favour of the freetraders. Would it have been fair for South Australia to be represented by free-traders only <inline font-style="italic">t</inline></para>

                        <para>- It is not a question of majority rule, but a question, of whether the minority, and a large minority, shall be absolutely unrepresented in this House. There were four protectionist candidates in South Australia. Would it be fair for this House deliberately to say that in such a case the protectionist electors might vote for four candidates of their own faith, and then be compelled to nullify their choice by voting for free-traders ? Electors cannot be asked to vote solidly for men of whom they have no knowledge, and it may be that sufficient protectionists, with chances of success, cannot be found to come forward as candidates. At any rate, it is undemocratic to force people to vote for men whom they do not want to see in Parliament. </para>

I ask honorable members not to regard this matter from the party aspect, and selfishly seize what looks like an opportunity for gaining a party victory, because the majority of to-day, becomes the minority of tomorrow. </para>

                        <para>- The &#39; minority always has an opportunity of placing its views before the Chamber, but under the system which I am opposing, the minority outside will have no opportunity to secure the representation of its views. I am sorry that the honorable member has left the paths of democracy to secure what can be merely a temporary party success. lc has been said that each party can put forward as many candidates as it likes, but no party would gain any particular advantage by doing that. Besides, we do not want every little section of the community to put forward the full number of candidates, so that it may not be compelled to vote for candidates whom it does not want to see elected. I think that as a rule it is a mistake for electors to plump ; but it is &#39;quite another thing to say to them - &#34; You shall, in every case, vote for the full number of candidates, although among them there may be men whom you do not want to see elected.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I had no voice in the framing of that provision of the Constitution which provides for the equal representation of States. Personally, I think the Commonwealth will ultimately work in the direction of unification, because of the great difficulty in governing small separate communities. I do not think that any real damage can be done where plumping is resorted to, because unless a majority vote for some one candidate he cannot be returned, notwithstanding the plumping. The plumping system gives proportional representation to an extent which is impossible under the block-vote system. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but in a haphazard way it secures something which is equivalent to proportional representation. At the federal elections in South Australia there was practically no plumping, and that practise is not very likely to be largely resorted to in the future. As a rule the electors voted for as many candidates as represented their political views. It is not our business to dictate to the electors as to the men for whom they shall vote. They have a right to return just such men as they desire to see in the House and no others. Some electors may not know enough of any six of the candidates to justify them in voting for the full number, and I would point out that every vote that an elector gives to a candidate with whose views he does not agree nullifies the support he accords to those whom he desires to see returned. In South Australia four protectionists only offered themselves as candidates for election, and it would have been most unfair in that case to compel the electors to support men who were opposed to their way of thinking. The proposition is a preposterous one, and only needs to be fairly stated in order to secure its general condemnation. The Government proposal would to an even greater extent than the single electorate system perpetuate the tyranny of the majority. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable member for South Australia apparently wishes to put back the clock, and revert to the plumping system. Some of the States have been divided into single electorates in order that the majority of the people may be properly represented, but the honorable member is not in favour of proportional representation. The honorable member made a strong point of the fact that if any particular party were to put forward any two or three candidates, and had to vote for six, they would be practically disfranchised ; but in such a case the party would be only reaping the reward of its own neglect. Under the system proposed by the honorable and learned member for Darling Downs the labour party would nominate a certain number of candidates, and the free-traders and protectionists would do likewise. The prohibitionists, the supporters of &#34; Tattersall&#39;s,&#34; the licensed victuallers, and the socialists would also put forward one or more members of their respective parties, and the supporters in each case would plump for their own particular candidates. This would probably result in the return of representatives of a number of small parties. The representation of small parties is not to be desired in the general interest, and if strong parties are to be returned, majority representation must be provided for. Therefore, I am in favour of the Government proposal. </para>

                <para>I should prefer to see only two parties. A third party is generally impotent in itself, and it is only by alliance with another that it is able to accomplish anything. Generally the result is more harmful than otherwise. I am as democratic os is any honorable member, and I have supported every democratic measure that has been brought forward. It would be impossible for the members of the labour party to do anything without the co-operation of the democrats on this side of the Chamber. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. RONALD</inline>(Southern Melbourne).Under the provision, as it stands, the electors would be compelled to vote for the most objectionable candidates. At the last federal election in Victoria the labour party, to which I have the- honour to belong, submitted three candidates, and the instructions given were that the votes were to be cast first for the three labour representatives, and next for the most objectionable men, or those who would have the least chance of being returned. It was represented that if those who voted for the labour representatives were to support other liberal candidates, they would injure the chances of those they specially desired to return. That was a sneaking way of plumping, I admit ; but we had to resort to that subterfuge in order to overcome the effects of the iniquitous system of compelling men to vote for those whom they do not regard as fit to legislate. We have no right to insist upon the electors voting for a given number of men any more than we are entitled to compel every man in the community to record his vote. If the block vote is insisted upon, the electors will, in many cases, be compelled to support candidates of whom they do not approve. That is the position in which the electors of Victoria were placed at the last federal election, and the Bill proposes to perpetuate a most unfair system. We shall actually be forced to vote for men who, upon moral, intellectual, or political grounds, may be absolutely objectionable to the community. I sincerely hope that the Government will hearken to wisdom. There is no need to discuss the question of freetrade, democracy, or protection in connexion . with this clause. The greatest authority on democracy at the present time is Lecky, who, although a free-trader, declares that democracy is frankly and avowedly protectionist all the world over. That is a sufficient answer to anything that has been said in that direction. I hope that the Government will see the error of their ways, and not impose upon a large section of the community a condition which is immoral in its end, irrespective of whether or not its intention is immoral. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir EDWARD</inline>BRADDON (Tasmania). - We have heard a good deal about majority representation and majority rule, but I scarcely think that those who talk so glibly about majority rule grasp the full significance of that term. Does it mean that the whole representation of a country, of every interest and of every class, shall be monopolized by just a bare majority of the electors ? Could anything be worse in the interests of a State than that it should be represented by persons who were hostile to a&#34; good deal more than half of its people ? Let us assume that in Australia four-tenths of the electors are free-traders, three-tenths protectionists, and that three-tenths are in sympathy with the labour party. Under the block-vote system it is almost certain that the great bulk of the representation would be divided amongst the free-traders and protectionists, whilst the labour party would be entirely unrepresented. We have seen what proportional representation has done in Belgium. Prior to the adoption of that system, the clericals had it entirely their own way, but since its adoption the liberals have obtained . a fair share of the representation. Is not that what we all want to see <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Do we not wish the interests of every section of the community to be voiced in our councils <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Do we not desire that Parliament shall be a reflex of the true feelings of the nation ? Surely the only way in which that result can be attained is by the adoption of the system which was originally contained in this. Bill - that of proportional representation - which, even at this late hour, I should like to see the Government make an endeavour to force through. If, however, they decline to do so, by all means let us amend the clause under discussion so as to make it approach as nearly as possible the result which would have been obtained under their original proposal. I intend to move to add to the clause the words - &#34;but may make the votes preferential by placing the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, &#38;c., in&#39; the squares oppos&#38;c. the candidates&#39; names,&#34; thus indicating the order of the electors&#39; preference. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BROWN</inline>(Canobolas). - To my mind, the principle of majority rule does not enter into the consideration of this question, which is one of legal tyranny. Under this clause the electors are asked to select those who shall represent them in the Senate. The Constitution requires that six senators shall be returned for each State, and because of that provision the Government propose to compel every elector to record six votes, irrespective of whether or not he can conscientiously approve of six candidates. If there are not six candidates who commend themselves to his conscience and good judgment, he is either compelled to become a hypocrite by casting his vote in favour of the return of men in whom he does not believe, or to disfranchise himself. I therefore support the amendment. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. THOMSON</inline>(North Sydney).- I should not have addressed myself to this matter a second time but for the remarks which have been made by certain honorable members. Those who support the clause in the Bill have been accused of advocating a hypocritical and immoral proposal. I think the confusion of ideas which prompted such a statement ought easily to have been seen by those honorable members who made that assertion. Do they mean to suggest that it is immoral that the majority should rule? Do they not recognise that two or three votes in this House are sufficient to determine the policy of the country ? If it is absolutely immoral that a small majority should possess that power, why do they support the institution of which they are members ? </para>

                        <para>- Has the honorable member had no connexion with associations which compel men either to vote for a particular individual of whom they may not approve or to abstain from voting? Has he never been connected with any organization which has chosen one particular individual as its representative and which has prevented any other candidate from coming forward in that interest? Has no vote been decided in meetings of different parties by a majority of one? Have not governments been supported in power by a majority so obtained? Whilst an honorable member may have what he thinks good reason to object to this provision, and to favour giving the elector the right to vote for a less number of candidates than there are vacancies to fill, I do not think it becomes him to accuse supporters of the clause of hypocrisy, and of advocating an immoral proposition. I should like to know whether the Government are in earnest in their support of this clause, and therefore I shall watch the division with very keen interest. </para>

I do not impute motives to those who hold a different opinion from that held by myself, and motives should not have been imputed to those who support the clause as it stands. In a single electorate it may be that 49 per cent. of the people are not represented by the person who is elected. All that is held is that in a number of constituencies that effect is balanced : and that is the reason for the democratic support of single electorates. So with State electorates. It is not true that, if there is a majority of free-trade voters throughout the Commonwealth, every State will be held by free-traders. One State may return all free-traders, and another all protectionists, and the same balancing influence is felt as with single electorates. Of course, there may be an objection to equal representation in the Senate which gives the same effective vote to the smaller State as to the larger State : but that is part of the Constitution. </para>

                    <para>- I should be the last to impute motives to honorable members because of the attitude they assume. I am much obliged to the honorable member for Robertson for his assurance that &#34;Codlin is our friend, not Short,&#34; but I do not know that the remarks of the honorable member have any particular bearing on the subject at issue. Democrats exist in both fiscal camps, and I hope that will continue to the end. As to compelling men in organizations, of whatever political complexion, to vote for particular men to the exclusion of others, the honorable member for North Sydney must, on reflection, see that most of the candidates within an organization, whether it be in a freetrade, protection, or labour organization, hold exactly the same set of opinions as those which govern the members. There is, therefore, no sacrifice in their agreeing to sink individual liking of the candidates, and voting for those selected by the majority. That applies to organizations formed for the purpose of carrying out certain sets of political principles, but it does not apply to the case of a number of candidates at a general election. In that case there are a number of <inline font-style="italic">men</inline> with whom the electors agree on one point, but with whom they disagree on every other; and there is, therefore, a much wider range for the expression of different opinions than is the case in an organization. The two cases are not parallel, and the argument is hardly fair. </para>

                        <para>- It is outside the organization of which we are speaking in this connexion. There are two aspects of the matter which have not been referred to. There are four States exit of the six whose representatives in the Senate were elected under the plumping system, and the result in the States where the block system prevailed was the absolute obliteration of the country vote. That was the case in both Victoria and New South Wales. </para>

I do not share to the fullest extent the fear of some honorable members that if the clause is carried the! labour party will be wiped out in the Senate. That may be the result in some States, but at any rate, the Bill will be the means of enabling the labour party &#34; to wipe the board &#34; in Queensland. </para>

                        <para>- That would be good as a compensation, but it would not be a result which we could hail with any degree of delight. It would be much better to have a reasonable degree of representation in each of the States. Whether the matter particularly concerns this Chamber or the Senate, I do not see why we, as a Parliament, should not have a voice in deciding the question of how the Commonwealth is to be represented. The Constitution allows- us full power, and it would be foolish to divest ourselves of that power, and let the senators look after their affairs and we after ours. Each&#39; Chamber should be consulted, and have a voice in the election of Parliament. I trust the committee will see the necessity of giving minorities some degree of representation, and preventing unfair compulsion on electors to either vote for men they do not want, or to run &#34; dummy&#34; candidates. </para>

I fail, however, to see that the analogy which that honorable member drew proves any inconsistency. &#34;Under the Bil&#93;, a man who claims his right of choice is disfranchised* No one can see what a man -does in the ballot-box, and the organizations are simply a combination of voters of like political views, who desire the return of candidates in favour of those views. Such organizations are common to all parties, and if a traitor be found in any he is simply &#34; passed out &#34; of the camp. There is no .analogy between disfranchising a man because he exercises his right of choice, and the action of an organization in removing a man with whose political views it is not in sympathy. </para>

                    <para>- So many arguments have been used on both sides that it is necessary for me to explain the vote which I intend to give on this important question, I have experienced both modes of voting in contesting elections in South Australia. At the first election for the Federal Convention in South Australia the voting was on the block system. The result was that a large and powerful section of the community*- the labour party - was virtually unrepresented. Personally I had no reason for complaint, as I was one of the ten who were chosen. But upon the occasion of the elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate, when the people of South Australia had the right to vote for the whole number of candidates required, or any smaller number they thought fit, the result was that the Senate was represented in each House by freetraders, revenue-tariffistS) labour representatives, and protectionists. Therefore, I feel that we should trust the good sense of the people in this matter. I have no sympathy with the proposals to provide for contingent voting. So long as the ballot is conducted as it is now, the electors should have the freest opportunity to combine, if they think fit, to obtain increased representation. I shall vote against the clause as it stands, and for the election of both senators and members of the House of Representatives in the manner in -which they were elected by the people of South Australia on the last occasion. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. FOWLER</inline>(Perth). - I have listened very carefully to the whole debate, and I have not heard any one say that the system of block voting is amy thing more than an expedient. No one has attempted to refute the argument that to compel an elector to vote for candidates whom he does not wish to be elected is immoral. The labour party will be able to play the block vote game as well as any other party can do so. I have not been asking for a concession in the interests of that party. I have been protesting against the provisions of the clause as immoral and inequitable. But if they are carried into law, it will be found that the labour party, instead of, as in the past in South Australia, putting forward only one or two candidates in a timid, hesitating way, will put forward the full number of candidates required, and in view of the position which we have taken up upon this question, both here and in the Senate, we shall have every justification in asking the electors to support them. If the clause is carried as it stands, both sides will have reason to rue the day when they put aside principle for the sake of a mere temporary expedient. </para>

                    <para>- I do not think that the , honorable member for Perth should attempt to threaten the committee by telling us that in future the labour party will put forward the full number of candidates at every election. If at the last election they put forward in South Australia only one or two nien in a hesitating fashion, I presume it was because they thought that no more than two had any chance of election. If they had believed that they could carry the election of six candidates, they would have put six men into the field, and in future, whether the clause is passed or not, they will put into the field as many candidates as they think will be elected. In Victoria we have always looked upon proportional representation as .something essentially conservative, and it has always been supported by the conservative press. I have strongly .opposed it, because I consider that it makes for the representation of sections instead of majorities, and one of the fundamental principles of democracy is majority representation. This is the first time, indeed, that I have heard the members of the labour party put forward any other principle. We have been told that the adoption of the block vote will bring the machine system into politics; but the only party that has done that is the party which is opposing the clause. </para>

                    <para>- I should like to know what attitude the Government intend to assume with regard to this clause. I believe there is a very strong feeling against the contingent vote, and I, for one, am opposed to the introduction of any of these fancy systems of voting. As it is probable that at the next federal election the two Houses will go to the country at the same time, the introduction of the contingent voting system would lead to a great deal of confusion. I do not know that the object aimed at is of sufficient importance to justify us in unsettling the minds of the electors, and thus, perhaps, disfranchising a very large proportion of them. In certain cases the contingent vote might not attain the object aimed at. On rare occasions, in New South Wales, a candidate has been returned by the votes of a minority ; but this has happened to every party in the State, and it is not at all certain that the results would have been altered by the operation of the contingent vote. As personal considerations enter so largely into the selection of candidates - especially in single electorates, such as are provided for in connexion with the election of representatives to this House - it is very difficult to say which candidate would be returned upon the second ballot. Further than that, in Queensland both parties counsel their supporters not to use the contingent, vote. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but that might result in still greater confusion. I am informed that the Queensland Ministry, which introduced the provision for the contingent vote, immediately after it had been passed counselled all their supporters not to use it. The clause might be eliminated altogether or amended by providing that a cross should be placed in a square opposite the name of the candidate for whom it is desired to vote. This method proved very successful in New South Wales at the Convention election in 1897. Although ten candidates - no more and no less - had to be voted for, the election resulted in the smallest percentage of informal votes ever recorded. In 1901 the elections for the Senate under the old system of crossing out the names of the candidates for whom the electors did not desire to vote resulted in the largest percentage of informal votes ever recorded - between 30,000 and 40,000. </para>

                    <para>- In theory the contingent vote appears; sound, but the method proposed here is not quite the same as that adopted in Queensland. In that State, after the first vote, the names of all but the first and second candidates are struck out, and the votes are divided between the two remaining. That is in the case of single electorates. The proposal in the Bill is that if there are four or five candidates, only the last one shall be struck out in the first instance, the votes belonging to the rejected candidate being distributed amongst the others. Then the lowest on the next count is struck out, and so on until only one remains. The system is somewhat complicated, and I took the trouble a day or two ago to work it out, with rather astonishing results. I found that it was possible for the candidate who obtained the largest proportion of number three votes to secure an advantage over his opponent who received the largest proportion of number one votes, and consequently my faith was very much shaken in the scheme contained in this Bill. I think that I accurately gauge the feeling of the committee when I say that we ought not to persist in the proposal for the adoption of the contingent vote. Therefore, I purpose altering the clause under consideration - a course which will necessitate amendments in a number of other clauses. I move- </para>

It seems to me that at every stage, upon the slightest opposition to their proposals being evidenced, they have either welcomed amendments or openly courted defeat. No doubt we shall witness the same sort of conduct in regard to the Tariff suggestions. Ministers had it in their power to make this Bill confer upon the people true representation at any rate so far as the Senate was concerned. They have grievously failed to do so, and in the humiliation that ought to follow I leave them. </para>

There should be some definite provision in the Bill, as to the course to be followed. If we allow the matter to te provided for by regulation, it may happen that in a number of places where only a few votes are recorded the electors may be influenced. Most of the difficulties which have arisen under our electoral laws, have been due to the fact that matters which should have been definitely provided for have been left to regulations, and have been dealt with differently by different returning officers. </para>

It is almost impossible to lay down a hard and fast rule in the Bill as to the number of electors who must vote at a polling place to enable the votes to be counted there, but it might be provided that where a polling place is within reach of the central polling place within a reasonable time - say seven or fourteen days - the ballot box should be sent there unopened, but that otherwise the assistant returning officer should count the ballot papers on the spot. </para>

                    <para>- So far as I understand the position, the honorable member for Maranoa, and other Queensland representatives, desire to have the ballotpapers counted at some central polling place. The New South Wales practice has been for the presiding officer at each polling place to count the ballot-papers at the conclusion of the poll, in the presence of the scrutineers. He then fills in a form stating how the votes have been cast, and, enclosing it with the ballot-papers, forwards the ballot-box to the returning officer for the electorate, by whom the papers are again counted. By this system the people at each centre are enabled to quickly ascertain how the voting has gone. It has been objected that at small polling places it may allow employers to know how their employes have voted ; but I cannot see any great objection to it. However, the difficulty will be met by requiring the ballot-boxes to be sent unopened to the divisional officer. Of course, if they had to be sent to the chief electoral officer it would delay the returns considerably, and a large amount of work which is now performed by the country officers would devolve upon the central office. </para>

                    <para>- I foresee some trouble in connexion with this clause. It is provided that no electoral expense shall be incurred by a candidate for the House of Representatives in excess of &#163;100. Clause 175 provides that &#34;electoral expense&#34; shall include all expenses &#34;incurred by or on behalf or in the interests of any candidate,&#34; and in order to make this clause consistent it will be necessary to amend it by providing that no expense shall be incurred by a candidate, &#34;or on his behalf or in his interests,&#34; in excess of &#163;100. I am decidedly in favour of this clause, although I regard it as a triumph of hope over experience, because I do not think we shall succeed in reducing election expenses to any great extent. We should, however, make our attempt as effective as possible, and the clause in its present form would not prevent political organizations from incurring very heavy expenditure in the interest of certain candidates. </para>

                    <para>- I should like the honorable member to carefully read clause 175, which was inserted for the special purpose of accomplishing what he now desires. That provision was intended to - and I believe does - govern clauses 173 and 174, and any other clause in which the words &#34; electoral expense &#34; occur. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the honorable member for South Sydney is quite right in his contention. Unless we adopt the amendment submitted, the clause will provide that no candidate for this House shall himself incur electoral expenses exceeding &#163;100, but will contain no limitation as to expenditure incurred on his behalf or in his interests. </para>

                    <para>- I think that we should best meet the necessities of the occasion by inserting in this clause the words &#34; on his behalf, or in his interests,&#34; and omitting them from clause 175. That will make the position very much clearer than it is at the present moment. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to ask the Minister if this clause is intended to meet two particular cases, namely, expenditure by a candidate and expenditure on behalf of or in the interests of a candidate? Under paragraph (c) of clause 185, if a candidate for this House spent more than &#163;100 he would be guilty of an illegal practice, and would be liable to prosecution. Is it also the intention of the Government to provide that if the expenses incurred by electioneering agents on behalf of a candidate, or in his interests, in conjunction with those of the candidate himself, exceed the amounts prescribed in this clause, such agents shall be liable to additional penalties? </para>

At the same time I desire to point out that expenditure may be incurred on behalf and in the interests of a candidate without his knowledge, and under such circumstances it would be extremely hard to render him liable to prosecution </para>
