                    <para>- Information has just been received that the Coronation of His Majesty the King has now been definitely fixed to take place on 9th August. Honorable members are perhaps aware that in order that due respect may be paid on that occasion to His Majesty, and that the members of the Commonwealth forces, who were chosen to represent Australia at the Coronation ceremony, should not be disappointed, they are being retained in London. This may necessitate a further request to the House to provide for the unexpected additional cost. The sum will not be large, and as soon as it is definitely ascertained I shall inform honorable members as to the amount. The expenses of the troops in London are being defrayed by the Imperial Government, but we have to provide for the payment of the men for the extra time they are being detained, and any extra amount that may be payable to the steamship owners who contracted to convey the troops back to Australia at an earlier date, and whose arrangements may have been interfered with by the postponement of the Coronation. </para>

                    <para>- Although most honorable members may desire to restrict the expenses incurred at elections, the limit fixed in this clause is too small, especially for large districts with scattered populations. For the purpose of returning members to the House of Representatives, South Australia will be divided into seven districts, each containing from 15,000 to 20,000 electors. The areas of some of these districts will be so large that ?100 would be altogether inadequate to permit candidates to place their views before the electors by advertising, or other legitimate means. When the South Australian ' Act, upon which this Bill is largely framed, was before the State Legislature, the object was not so much to restrict legitimate expenditure by candidates in placing their views before the electors, as to prevent the employment of numerous canvassers, and the exercise of unfair influence by the expenditure of large sums of money. Although £100 might be sufficient to defray the expenses of a candidate in an electorate within ten miles of Melbourne, it would be quite insufficient in a district extending over hundreds of miles of country, with numerous small polling places. The northern district of South Australia, according to the subdivision proposed in the State Parliament last session, would embrace an area extending from Port Augusta to Port Darwin, a distance of nearly 1,200 miles, with a stretch of country 500 miles in width. It was necessary to include this large extent of territory in order that the district might contain approximately one-seventh of the electors on the roll. Honorable members will see that it would be utterly impossible for a candidate to fairly place his views before the voters at the numerous pollingplaces which exist in that stretch of country with an expenditure of £100, which amount covers the hire of halls in which to address the electors, and the remuneration of scrutineers to look after his interests. I see by the marginal note to clause 174, that the main provisions of this portion of the Bill are taken from the South Australian Electoral Act of 1896. In that Act it is provided that the expenditure incurred by any candidate shall not exceed £50, plus an additional £5 for every 200 electors upon the roll in excess of 2,000. Under such a scale the limit of expenditure which a candidate may incur in a district containing 15,000 electors is between £400 and £500. That Act was intended to apply to much smaller districts than those which will be created when South Australia is divided into only seven constituencies for the return of members to this House. I have no desire to unfairly increase the amount which a candidate is entitled to expend. Indeed, I consider it is an excellent thing for candidates themselves that their electoral expenses should be limited. But there is a point below which we ought not to go. In connexion with the recent election of representatives of South Australia to this House, it was most difficult for candidates to get their views fairly put before the people. It will be still more difficult for a candidate who is contesting a district outside of the city or suburbs to attain that object. </para>

                        <para>- I am perfectly sure that it does not cost anything like as much in the way of legitimate expenditure. To place one's views before the electors in the Yarra district, foi" example, would not be nearly so costly as in a country electorate containing a scattered population. </para>

                        <para>- No; nor one-tenth. In South Australia the daily newspapers charge candidates four guineas a column for reporting their speeches on the first occasion upon which they address the electors. As evidencing the utter inadequacy of the limit of £100 in the case of a candidate for the House of Representatives, I may mention that when I addressed the electors in North Adelaide, three days after the Prime Minister had declared the Government policy at Maitland, the reporting of my speech in the <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">South AUStralian Register</inline> cost me £25. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, I am declaring what is an absolute fact. I mention this matter to show that if a candidate desires to have his views fairly placed before the electors, the proposed limitation of £100 would be totally inadequate to the necessities of a large district. What is the reason for this limitation ? Is it inserted for the purpose of preventing a candidate from having his political views circulated amongst the electors <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I think not. It is rather intended, I take it, to prevent the improper expenditure of money, thereby giving the wealthy candidate a most unfair advantage over the poorer candidate. </para>

                        <para>- I am using this information only to point the argument that, whilst we are entitled to insist that no candidate shall incur more than a reasonable expenditure, we are not acting wisely in limiting that expenditure to such an extent as to preclude a candidate for an outside district containing a scattered population from fairly placing his views before the electors. As the honorable member for Yarra interjected just now, the Senate has agreed to limit the expenditure of candidates for that House to £230.- Whether its members intend religiously to adhere to that provision . is their business, and not mine. But I certainly think that in elections for the House of Representatives, if it be possible to discriminate between metropolitan and outside constituencies in this connexion, it would be wise to do so. </para>

                        <para>- .To my mind, to insert a limit of £100 in connexion with a country electorate would be an utter absurdity. Even to send a circular through the post to each elector in a district containing 20,000 voters would cost more than the amount prescribed. I intend to move that the limit in regard to the expenditure of candidates for the House of Representatives shall be £200. </para>

                    <para>- When I submitted my amendment last evening there was scarcely time to point out the reason why something should be done in the way of altering this clause in the direction indicated. It was contended by the Minister for Home Affairs that by the inclusion of the words, " or in the interests of any candidate" in clause 175, he had covered the whole ground which my amendment is intended to embrace. I hold, however, that it would do ' no harm to express it more definitely here. If honorable members will turn to clause 185, which deals with the penalties to be imposed, they will observe that, under paragraph (c), any contravention by a candidate of the provisions of this portion of the Bill renders him liable to prosecution. But there is no provision in that clause for punishing any person other than the candidate himself. Consequently, even if this amendment be carried - and I hold that it is necessary to give expression to the evident intention of the Bill - there ought to be an addition to the clause imposing a penalty, in order to make sure that those who spend money on behalf of a candidate or in his interests may be reached. It is of no use limiting the amount of money a candidate may spend if we do not at the same time impose a limit on the amount which may be spent by organizations in his interest. If organizations ave left free to spend money, in order to secure the return of a candidate, the law may be evaded by the candidate subscribing to those associations. That is evident from our knowledge of human nature, and our past experience in politics. I am not now dealing with- the question whether it is right or politic to try to limit the expenses of a candidate. Such an attempt seems to me to be a triumph of hope over experience ; but if it can be done we ought to do it. The Bill may be an effort in that direction ; but the effort must be complete, or the clause should be dropped. In clauses 174 and 175 there is some confusion. Clause 174 defines in a negative way what " electoral expenses " may be incurred, and clause 175 defines those expenses in another way. But if we amend clause 173 we shall be able to strike out clause 175, and leave clause 174 as the only defining clause. If the expenses are limited to those set out in the sub-clauses of clause 174, all expenses outside of those will be illegal ; and, going further, we might insert a sub-clause in the punitive clause 185 dealing with those, other than candidates, who spend money in contravention of clause 174. I move my amendment in the present clause to test the sense of the committee as to whether we should make a legitimate attempt to restrict the expenses at elections. There is a good deal in the argument of the honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. V.</inline> L. Solomon, that we cannot expect a candidate to adequately place his views before a large constituency at the expense of so small an amount as £100. At the same time, we have legislated in many directions in order to secure that the wealthy man shall enjoy no privilege or power over others less fortunately placed. If we allow the expenses to be larger than are absolutely necessary, the wealthier man is given a better chance by reason of the fact that he can place his views before a larger number of electors, and thus be more likely to. secure a majority of votes. If £100 is not enough to allow, we can make the amount larger, still limiting it. But if we limit the amount in respect of candidates, we are only playing with the question if we do not also impose a limit in respect of others who may pay money .on the candidate's behalf or in his interest. The returns of expenses are to be made within eight weeks of the result of the election ; but I do not think that will work ' well, because many expenses might be paid subsequently. A candidate must spend money in order to place his views before the public by means of addresses and advertisements : but it is not necessary for anybody to incur expense on his account. It would <inline font-style="italic">bv</inline> better if we went so far as to make it equally illegal for anybody to spend money in promoting any candidature. It may be said that this is a limitation of the rights of the people ; but the rights of some persons are limited only by their wealth, which gives a larger political influence to its possessor than can be exercised by others. </para>

                        <para>- When I heard that that was the intention of the clause, I pointed out that any person might deliberately get elected to a candidate's committee, and, by spending money without the candidate's knowledge, invalidate an election. I propose when I come to clause 185 to provide that a candidate shall not be liable unless he is aware that the expenditure has taken place. I ask that the clause be allowed to pass, because, so far as I can gather, the words in clauses 173 and 175 are sufficient to prevent a candidate doing anything in contravention of the Bill. I shall later on deal with the question raised by the honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. V.</inline> L. Solomon. </para>

                    <para>- I think there is a little misapprehension. I care not what the definition of " electoral expense " in clause 175 may be, but it certainly has a very wide range of meaning. It includes expenses incurred " by or on behalf or in the interests of any candidate," but, whatever that means, we find that the meaning of clause 173 is limited. The latter clause provides that no " electoral expense " - giving the words their widest meaning - shall be incurred by any candidate beyond a certain amount. These words, " by any candidate," limit the whole operation of clause 173. We might make " electoral expense " include everything, but still no offence is committed by a candidate unless the expense is incurred by him. Consequently some amendment is necessary, though I do not think we ought to go so far as has been proposed. We might provide that the expense must be by or on the authority of a candidate," but it would not do to use the words "in the interests of," because a candidate might not only be perfectly innocent of the expenditure, but have expressly forbidden it. It would be unfair to make a candidate liable to penalties when he has done his best to prevent any contravention of the law. </para>

                        <para>- Clause 173 ought to be kept distinct. If we want to punish persons other than the candidate, I do not see how we are to do it. Is it to be that each person may not spend more than £100, or that if a number of the candidate's friends spend £100 exactly, and another person spends an extra shilling, there has then been an infraction of the law. That, I think, cannot be provided, and it is most important to keep clause 173 perfectly clear and distinct. It does not go far enough at present, because it allows a man's friends to spend money with his knowledge and sanction in excess of the sums mentioned, so long as he himself steers clear of personal expenditure above those amounts. If we inserted the words "or by the authority of," I think they would cover the whole ground, so far as it should be covered. It is not enough to say that " electoral expense " is a term having a wide meaning, and therefore covers the whole ground of prohibition, because the clause provides, not that no electoral expense shall be incurred in respect of any candidature, but that no electoral expense shall be incurred by a candidate. </para>

                        <para>- If he acts through an agent authorized for the purpose in some way. No one would wish to make a candidate guilty of an offence against the Act if his agent, contrary to his instructions, did something which should not be done. We know the sort of trickery which is possible even in connexion with agents. An agent might be got to put a candidate in a very unfortunate position, if candidates were in all cases bound by the acts of their agents. But while I look upon this clause as likely to set a good fashion, its provisions could easily be evaded. For instance, clause 174 provides that no electoral expense shall be incurred, except in respect of, amongst other things, election agents. Under that provision a candidate could practise the grossest corruption by buying the votes of electors under the pretence that he was employing them as election agents. It must not be forgotten that the organizations of poor men provide a vastly better electoral machinery than the services which wealth can command. I do not think any candidate is better off than the labour candidates, who have hundreds of men ready to work for them without reward. I think that the clause should be amended so as to provide that the candidate shall be liable for the acts of his agent, if, without himself incurring expense, he does something which shows that he authorized some one else to incur it for him ; but the giving of his authority should be proved, and should not be merely a matter of implication. It is as wrong for a candidate to say - " I shall not do this thing myself, but I want you to do it for me," as for him to actually commit the offence himself. But we must not apply the practices of the Customhouse in these cases, and presume that the candidate is guilty unless he can show that he is not. The honorable and learned member for Indi has pointed out that the provisions of clause 175, read in conjunction with the provisions of clause 173, do not make a candidate responsible for the acts of others committed without his knowledge and consent. The last offence defined in clause 187 will meet the case of any person other than a candidate who is guilty of a violation of the clauses which we are discussing ; but there is nothing to prevent ten agents from each spending £95 in respect of a candidature. That is one of the little avenues for cleverness which we cannot close by legislation. I look upon the clause as a well meant provision, which we must piously hope all candidates will observe ; but we must make it clear, since the violation of this provision may have serious consequences, that no candidate shall be held responsible for any act which he has not personally authorized. It may be that the provision of paragraph (c) of clause 185 providing that - </para>

In South Australia there is a strict law against practices of the kind which we are trying to prevent, and yet the licensed victuallers spent close on £2,000 in one electorate in trying to defeat me, and were not prosecuted. The man who understands how to run the show will always be returned. I look upon agents as a means of wasting money. You give them £50 or £100, and they go to a staggerjuicery and make persons drunk, and think they have done a good turn for you. What is the use of making laws which are to be broken ? </para>

                    (East Sydney). - I have looked into the point, referred to by the Minister, as to the liability of persons other than the candidate, and I am afraid there is no provision here that would make the actions of such persons offences against the law. The limitation is upon the candidate alone. It is stated that no electoral expense shall be incurred " by the candidate " in excess of £100. Clause 175 only defines "electoral expenses," and does not extend the operation of this clause to another class of individuals. The offence is really set out in this clause, and other persons acting independently of the candidate can spend as much money as they like. If we desire to make it an offence for a person other than the candidate to spend more than £100, we shall have to go further than is now provided. The amendment proposed by the honorable member for South Sydney would meet the case to some extent, because it would prevent, say, Jones, from spending more than £100 on behalf of a candidate, Smith. But supposing that Jones spent £95, and Brown spent £6, the two amounts could not be added together in order to make Jones an offender.

                        <para>- That is another point. We must make the candidate responsible for the acts of his agent. The English Act goes further, because it makes not only the candidate but the agent liable for the contravention of the Act.. It provides that any candidate or election agent who knowingly acts in contravention of the Act shall be guilty of an illegal practice. An agent could not shelter himself behind his principal, or plead that he did not know that it was illegal to exceed the expenditure of a certain amount of money. This Bill should be made as effective as possible. It is true that designing men with great financial resources may be able to defeat our object to some extent, but an effective provision would exercise an important moral influence upon the community. When subjected to pressure to incur extravagant expense, a candidate would be able tq plead that it would be illegal, and every honest candidate would endeavour to avoid breaking the law.' </para>

                <para>I think that in any case a candidate would be liable for the acts of his agent, but it is desirable that the offence should be expressly fastened upon the person whom it is intended to reach. Therefore, I shall support the amendment so far as it aims at making the agent responsible. </para>

                    <para>--! hope the Minister will reconsider the whole of these clauses. Whatever may have been the intention of the framers of the Bill, the provisions inserted are not likely to bear much fruit. The agent, as well as the candidate, ought to be made responsible, but if the honorable member .for East Sydney is correct in his contention that the friends of the candidate, to an unlimited number, can each of them spend £95, the provision will be of no avail. The candidate might very easily say that he did not authorize his friends to expend the money. </para>

                    E. GROOM (Darling Downs).I understood the Minister to say that really two classes of offences were aimed at in this provision - offences committed by the candidate himself, and by other persons on his behalf or in his interest. There is no offence created so far as agents are concerned, except in the latter class. The only expenses authorized are set out in clause 174, and if any expenditure were incurred for other purposes, an offence might be created which would come within the scope of clause 187. I am not sure, however, whether it is intended that the expenditure by persons other than a candidate for purposes beyond those mentioned in clause 174 shall be regarded as constituting a punishable offence.

EDWARDS (South Sydney). - I do not think that my amendment could be carried into effect without recasting the whole of these clauses, and as the Minister does not seem disposed to offer any assistance in carrying out the evident intention of the Bill, I do not see that any good object is to be gained by pressing my proposal. If it is intended to create two classes of offence, the clause as it stands fails to achieve that object, because no penalty is provided for the second class of offences, and some amendment must be made to cover the case of electioneering agents.

                        <para>- If we cannot make these clauses a little more definite than they are, it would be wise to eliminate the whole of them. They will never be effective, but, as has been said, their enactment will merely set up a standard of moral tone. Statutes are made to be carried out, and some of the most experienced members of this committee have declared that these clauses will be operative only in the case of men who possess good consciences, and that the candidate who desires to buy his way into public life will still be able to do so. If we seriously intend to attempt to suppress bribery, we must insert some provision which will have the effect of making an agent as well as the candidate liable for any breach of this portion of the Bill. I should like to go still further, but I can see that we cannot include what I desire in this clause unless subsequent clauses are remodelled. I, therefore, ask leave to withdraw the amendment with a view to submit another. </para>

Under the South Australian Electoral Act, upon which this portion of the Bill has been modelled, the limit to the electoral expenses which may be incurred by a candidate in a district containing 20,000 voters, is about £300. Within the past three or four weeks I find that in connexion with the House of Assembly elections in the State which I represent, the successful candidates for metropolitan constituencies, according to their sworn statements, spent the following amounts : -
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr- Dixon</inline>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jenkins,</inline>
                    the present Premier, who also contested an electorate within a radius of 3 or 4 miles of the city, £292;

                        <para>- I am sorry that I cannot agree with the honorable member. The recommendation made to me before this Act was framed was that we should limit the expenses of candidates for the House of Representatives to one-half the amount allowed to candidates for the Senate. I thought that I was going far enough in proposing a limit of £100 and £200 respectively. The object which the Government have in view is to restrict the expenses of elections as far as possible. I know that the newspapers make very heavy charges whenever they have an opportunity of so doing, and in the absence of such a provision as that under consideration, it is quite possible that they may levy still higher rates. But, perhaps,' their charges will be somewhat limited if they know that candidates are debarred from incurring more than a certain expenditure. I remember that upon one occasion 1 was charged £100 for an advertisement of less than a column. </para>

                        <para>- In Western Australia no limit is fixed, but there is a limit in Tasmania. To apply to the Commonwealth, however, the limit adopted in Tasmania would mean that each candidate would be at liberty to expend about £3,000.. I am told that some candidates do spend that amount. My own impression, however, is that if for the Senate and House of Representatives a maximum of £250 and £100' respectively is allowed it will be as much as candidates can bear, and as much as should be spent. I recognise that there may be some force in the contention that provision should be made for offences committed by two sets of persons. Perhaps the matter is not as clear as it should be, and at a later stage, therefore, I shall either propose an amendment or a new clause, to remove all doubt upon the subject. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to support the amendment submitted by the honorable member for South Australia to the extent of asking the Minister to agree to a compromise. I ana quite in sympathy with the object of the clause, and I agree that it constitutes a sort of coat of mail to honorable members by enabling them to defend themselves against undue demands. But I would point out that the provision which will chiefly limit electoral expenditure, and which will prove the greatest check upon the candidate, is clause 174, which specifies the direction in which expenditure is considered legitimate. </para>

                        <para>- To my mind, it constitutes the greatest safeguard. Surely the expenditure allowed under clause 174 should be sufficient to cover every legitimate outlay. Clause 174 provides for seven directions in which there may be expenditure. But even if we were to exclude all but two of these legitimate items of expenditure, £100 would not be enough. If a candidate in a scattered district, with, say, 24,000 electors, where the population could not be reached by any cheaper means, had to send a circular addressed to each elector, that alone would absorb £100. Then public meetings and halls have to be provided for ; and it must be remembered that under the extended franchise halls will be more largely used than in the past, in order that the women may hear the views of candidates. In an election 50 meetings would not be an extraordinary number - I myself held 46 - and if each meeting cost only £2, the £100 would be gone. </para>

                        <para>- The New South Wales Act specially excludes certain expenditure as non-allowable, and I, at any rate, have never incurred any expense outside that which is authorized. It is my desire, and no doubt the desire of other honorable members, to adhere to the law ; and I do not wish to insert a provision which it is impossible to observe. An unscrupulous candidate can, with the greatest ease, evade restrictions as to expenses. The returns have to be sent in eight weeks after the election and a candidate may appear blissfully ignorant of expenditure which has not at that time been made out of his own pocket, but out of the pockets of other people. No return is made of that expenditure, but after the eight weeks the candidate innocently discovers that it has to be met, and he meets it. In South Australia, some people were speaking to me about a candidate who had spent a very large sum of money, and I asked how that could be done under the law. I was informed, " Oh, that is . easy enough ; he did not pay it until after his return had been sent in." </para>

                        <para>- But the candidate is supposed to know nothing of the expenditure of which I 'am speaking, the money having been paid by other people. I would also point out that under this Bill a man need not spend £10, and yet be unseated, if the expenditure has been in directions other than those prescribed in the clause. That is a great security, and I think the Minister might agree to make the limit £1^0. I have shown that on two items alone it would be quite impossible, in scattered districts, to keep the legitimate expenditure within £100; but if the limit were made £150, there would be an opportunity to keep ' down expenses by refusing requests which are constantly made at elections, and, at the same time, of securing honest returns. </para>

                    E. GROOM (Darling Downs).Does the honorable member propose to make wagering the offence of bribery? The penalty shown in the schedule for wagering on the result of an election is £50, but if the present amendment be agreed to, and the offence be made one of bribery, the penalty will be a sum not exceeding £200, or imprisonment for a period not exceeding one year. That seems a punishment altogether out of proportion to the offence of wagering on an election.

                    <para>- Sub-clause (1) deals with promises of reward which clearly constitute bribery. A wager might in no sense be corrupt as an attempt to influence an election, but, on the other hand, it might be another form of bribery, and I take it that in such a case the court would so regard it. It seems to me that the provision in clause 187 is sufficient. </para>

                    (Coolgardie). - I am aware that clause 187 makes it an offence to wager on the result of any election, but wagering of the character which I wish to prevent is really bribery, and should therefore be dealt with in clause 179. It sometimes happens that a candidate's friends will lay £25 to nothing upon his chances, which is practically the offering of a bribe of £25 to a wavering voter. I think that the penalty provided for in clause 187 is not adequate for an offence of that kind. However, I shall not press my amendment if the Minister is opposed to it.

                    <para>- The candidate who wagers for the purpose of bribing electors will have to spend a tolerable amount of money, but I have known instances of candidates backing themselves simply as a sporting matter. However, I am willing that persons should be prevented from entering into wagers even as harmless as that. It must be remembered that a person who wagers upon the result of an election will be liable for a penalty of £50 for each wager. </para>

                        <para>- There is no such provision in the electoral law of New South Wales, and, I think, of other States. In many country districts it is impossible to secure any central building which is not an hotel. It has never been alleged in New South Wales that bad practices have resulted from the holding of meetings in hotels, or the addressing of assemblages from hotel balconies. In my own electorate, although there are 75 or 80 polling places, there are not public halls in more than ten of them. </para>

                    (Coolgardie). - I cannot understand why, if a candidate puts an advertisement in the newspaper, it should be necessary for it to be certified to by the person who authorizes its insertion. It is also unnecessary to enact that the name and place of business of the printer of any advertisement, hand-bill, or pamphlet shall be printed at the foot of it, because that is already provided for in the State laws. The provisions of this clause seem to have been taken from the South Australian law ; they do not exist in the electoral law of any of the other States. I move -

The provisions of the clause might be very beneficial to newspaper proprietors, but they would greatly swell the expenses of candidates, which we have just determined must not exceed £100.

                    <para>- When a similar provision was inserted in the South Australian law, it was pointed out that a good reason for its insertion was that it would prevent the enemies of a candidate from publishing unfair, scandalous, or scurrilous advertisements and lampoons without making themselves responsible for them. But it appears to me to be going to an absurd length to compel a candidate to add to a published address which he has signed a notification authorizing its publication. ' </para>

Solomon, has said, it seems to me that the provisions of the clause are carried too far. I was in South Australia at the time of the last general elections, and I noticed that a man could not put up a calico sign above his committee-rooms without having to print upon it the name of the person who authorized it. Furthermore, the newspapers charge pretty stiffly already for a three-line advertisement of a meeting, and if another line has to be added to show by whom the advertisement has been authorized, it will mean still more expense to the candidate. </para>

                    (Coolgardie).- The publication of unauthorized lampoons can be prevented by the provisions of paragraph (b). The printer could be proceeded against for libel, by either criminal or civil process. Printers are not fools, and the name of the man who authorized the printing of the lampoon would be revealed to the candidate. I shall press the amendment.

I need scarcely point out that not long ago an anonymous advertisement appeared in one of the Victorian newspapers, asking the electors to refrain from voting for a pro-Boer. Speaking from experience gained in South Australia, I affirm that this provision does not work disadvantageously to the candidate. On the contrary, it protects any man who wishes to contest an election upon honest lines. I trust that the committee will reject the amendment. </para>

                    <para>- In reply to the remarks of the honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton,</inline> I should like to point out that if the committee adopt the amendment, any person who is aggrieved by the publication of an advertisement in a newspaper will still retain all his rights at the hands of the civil and criminal courts. If a newspaper publishes an advertisement in which a candidate is held up to ridicule, or is libelled, the candidate has his remedy at law. He does not require a double-barrelled remedy such as he would possess if another person were made responsible for the libel. I cannot see that adoption of the amendment will produce the awful results pictured by the honorable member for South Australia. On the other hand it will save candidates a considerable outlay, and enable them to insert advertisements in the newspapers in the manner they have hitherto been accustomed to do in five out of six States. Consequently I support the amendment. </para>

                    <para>- This is a clause which, I think, ought to be recommitted. If a card be issued, bearing the words "Vote for" a certain candidate, it is apparent that it has been issued by that candidate, and it should not be necessary to publish the name and address of the person who has authorized it. This clause will operate so foolishly that it is necessary to make every protest against its passing. If an address is issued to the electors, it is apparent that it has been authorized by the candidate ; any court would decide that as a matter of fact. I move - </para>

                    <para>- I must support the amendment. When I was in South Australia during the last general election I saw the inconvenience which arose from such a provision as that contained in subclause (b). Unless the amendment be agreed to, the right honorable and learned member for East Sydney, if he were once more contesting that constituency, would have to show a printed authority on such posters as "Reid's Committee Rooms." That is the absurd obligation placed upon candidates under the South Australian Act, from which this clause is taken. These extra lines will benefit only the newspapers, against whose scurrilous attacks we should have some protection. The clause might have been better framed, and it would have been well if the Minister had consented to recommit it. We are endeavouring to cut down expenses all round, and I see no reason why candidates, by a clause of this kind, should be compelled to add to their own expenses in the interests of the newspapers. </para>

In the meantime there remains the Electoral Bill to be disposed of. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to draw the attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs to a matter which concerns those engaged in shipping business in Melbourne. Hitherto it has been the custom at that port, when over-sea vessels have arrived after the closing of the Custom-house at four o'clock, to grant permits for the discharge of goods on the wharf and into the sheds, the papers being formally dealt with next morning. At nine o'clock in the morning, when the Custom-house opens, there is generally a rush of business, and it is often ten or eleven o'clock before formal leave can be obtained for ships to discharge Lately the permits have been withdrawn, and consignees are under the necessity of waiting fifteen or twenty hours- that is, from about four in the afternoon until midday the following day - before goods can be discharged. I ask the Minister to take into consideration the advisability of renewing the issue of these permits, so that valuable time which in these cases means money, may be saved. </para>
