                            <para>by leave - On Sunday last the 3rd September, shortly after 8p.m. in Australian
              time, the Prime Minister of Great Britain announced that the time limited by a
              notification to the German Government had expired and that Great Britain was at war with
              Germany. An hour or two later, a proclamation was issued in the Commonwealth of
              Australia, declaring the existence of a state of war in Australia. In order that
              honorable members may have before them, and in order that we may have on record, some
              accurate statement of the affairs leading up to this tragic consequence, I am to-day
              laying on the table a White Paper, which contains the relevant documents exchanged
              between the Governments, together with such explanatory matter as may serve to connect
              one document with another. Nobody can foretell the course of events. Nobody can foretell
              how this war is going to be fought, what special dangers Australia may encounter, or what
              are the best services which we can render to Great Britain and the Empire; but we do
              know that we are together in this struggle, and we are confident that our unity and
              determination, being based upon justice, arc bound to succeed.</para>

                            <para>- Before referring to the documents which are contained in the White Paper, I
                should like, with the permission of the House, to make reference to a few
                preliminary matters which, although preliminary in point of recitation, are in fact,
                of tremendous importance.</para>
                            <para>In the first place, I should like very briefly to remind honorable members of the
            extraordinary succession of promises, and of broken promises, with which we have been
            confronted in recent years, because, until one understands those, one is at some loss to
            understand the mentality of any ruler of a great country who could plunge the world into
            war as Herr Hitler, I venture to say, has plunged the world into war. We are all, of
            course, possessed of a lively recollection of the fact that in the last few years,
            during the Hitler r√©gime, we have seen the downfall of Austria as an independent
            State; we have seen the downfall of Czechoslovakia as an independent State; and we are
            to-day witnessing an attempt by arms to destroy the independence of the Polish State.</para>
                            <para>Each of those matters, each of those excursions on the part of
            Germany, has been preceded by promises of so categorical a kind that the grossest breach
            of each of them had to be committed before the subsequent move could take place. On the
            30th January, 1934, Herr Hitler, speaking in the Reichstag, said this about Austria -</para>
                            <quote>
                                <para>I must in the most formal manner reject the further assertion of the Austrian
              Government that any attack against the Austrian State will be undertaken or is even
              planned by Germany.</para>
                            </quote>
                            <para>In May of 1935, speaking in the same place, he said - </para>
                            <quote>
                                <para>Germany neither intends nor wishes to interfere in the domestic affairs of
              Austria, to annex Austria, or to attach that country to her.</para>
                            </quote>
                            <para>At the same time, and in the same speech, he said that the German
            Government would scrupulously maintain every treaty voluntarily signed, even though it
            was concluded before the accession of that Government to power and office; in
            particular, they would uphold and fulfil all obligations arising out of the Locarno
            Treaty. I refer to that speech, because, as honorable members know, notwithstanding those
            quite categorical statements, Germany in March of last year marched into Austria,
            absorbed that territory, and brought to an end the independent existence of Austria; and
            notwithstanding the statement made about the Locarno Pact, Germany, subsequent to that
            statement, re militarised the Rhine, the demilitarisation of which was not only provided
            for by the Treaty of Versailles, but was also specifically reaffirmed by the three
            contracting parties, including Germany, in the Pact of Locarno. On the 7th March, 1936,
            speaking again in the Reich stag, Hitler said - and I draw attention to these words -</para>
                            <quote>
                                <para>I feel that after three years I can now regard the struggle for German equality as
              concluded to-day. Therefore, I think that the principal cause of our withdrawal from
              Europe's collective co-operation has ceased to exist. . . . We have no territorial
              demands to make in Europe.</para>
                            </quote>
                            <para>Subsequent to that, demands were made upon the Czechoslovak State in
            relation to those Germans who were living in the Sudeten country on the fringes of Old
            Bohemia. In relation to that matter Hitler again made a speech on the 26th September of last year, two days before the day of crisis that we all
            remember. He then said this -</para>
                            <quote>
                                <para>And now the last problem confronts us, which must be solved and which will be
              solved. It is the last territorial claim which I have to make in Europe, but it is a
              claim from which I do not recede and which I will fulfil, God willing.</para>
                            </quote>
                            <para>A strange blasphemy, I venture to say, for, in four days' time, he
            was to stand at Munich to make a joint announcement to the world with the Prime
            Minister of Great Britain that the methods of peace were thenceforward to be resorted to
            and none other, and within a few months he was to go beyond the limits of the settlement
            arrived at at Munich and complete the total destruction of the independence of the whole
            of the Czechoslovak State!</para>
                            <para>So we have, as clearly as anybody could have it, a series of statements made by the
            leader of the German people, from time to time, in relation to various problems, all of
            which have been dishonoured.</para>
                            <para>The inference to be drawn from all this is, of course, and has been throughout the
            last few weeks, of a most grievous kind. The only inference which people of intelligence
            could draw from this extraordinary history has been that, although the word may have
            been given, there would undoubtedly, so long as force or the threat of force could
            prevail, be a succession of attacks on independent States in Europe and, by steady
            degrees of expansion, an overlords hip of Europe by Germany to the destruction of
            independent communities and, what is much more serious, the destruction of liberal
            principles of government.</para>
                            <para>Now I turn to the immediate issue. I have referred to those other matters
            because they throw a lurid light on the mentality of the man with whom we have been
            dealing. I say " the man " because, even now that we are in the shadow of this
            war, I venture to say that there must be many millions of people in Germany who have
            liberal minds and who have no desire whatever for war. So I speak of their ruler - the
            man who has been able to plunge them into war, and the man who, undoubtedly, could have
            kept them at peace had he desired peace.</para>
                            <para>The problem of Danzig and the Corridor has of course been an almost constant source
            of irritation. We all know that from the very time that the Polish Corridor came into
            existence there have been debates about it among the German people. It is interesting to
            recall that the driving of the Corridor through to the sea, in order to give Poland
            access to the sea, which was necessary to complete Poland's real independence, was
            one of the fourteen points of President Wilson upon which the peace negotiations
            proceeded at the end of the last war. But there have always been irritation and
            differences of opinion about it.</para>
                            <para>In 1934, Germany and Poland entered into a pact of non-aggression. They agreed
            mutually to renounce all force, and they also agreed to the free negotiation of any
            contentious questions affecting their mutual relations. That pact was designed and
            expressed to last for a period of ten years. On the 20th February, 1938, Herr Hitler
            said in the Reichstag -</para>
                            <quote>
                                <para>The Polish State respects the national conditions in Danzig - </para>

                                <para>and Germany respects Polish rights. It has thus been possible to clear the way for the
                understanding of this problem of German and Polish relations and to enter into sincere
                and friendly collaboration.</para>
                            </quote>
                            <para>In September of the same year, Herr Hitler made the speech to which I
            have already referred in which he said that he had no further territorial claims to make
            in Europe. On the 31st March of this year, Czechoslovakia having been absorbed and the
            agreement at Munich having been dishonoured, the Government of the United Kingdom, in an
            earnest desire to bring this process to an end, and to provide some means of security
            and peace for Europe, and, through Europe, for the world, gave a guarantee to Poland and
            mutual undertakings were exchanged with the Government of Poland. The result of that was
            that, on the 28th April last, Germany denounced the 1934 pact with Poland, which, as
            honorable members will recall, was a pact of non-aggression, on the ground that it was
            invalidated by the Anglo Polish agreement. I have found, in reading these documents, and
            honorable members will find in reading them, how extraordinarily difficult it is to get
            into the mind of the other man; but I find it impossible to get inside the mind of
            a government that can say, " Our pact of non-aggression is invalidated because you
            have entered into a pact against aggression ". Yet that was the position. Because
            Poland received from Great Britain a guarantee that its integrity would be respected,
            Germany withdrew its guarantee that Polish integrity would be respected - one of the
            strangest incidents, I would have thought, in modern European history.</para>

            White Paper which is in the hands of honorable members. It will be found that the first
            document on page 1 of that White Paper is a letter written on the 22nd August 1939, by
            Mr. Chamberlain to Herr Hitler. I commend this
            letter to honorable members because while it was courteously phrased - and it is some
            satisfaction to realize that throughout the whole of this correspondence there has been
            a courteous and moderate expression of views by Great Britain, however clearly those
            expressions have been set forth - it also made it abundantly and properly clear that
            Great Britain did not intend to depart from its obligations to Poland and that Germany
            should not make any rash or unwise assumption that it could once more destroy the
            independence of a state without provoking war. I direct attention to the following
            paragraph in that letter : -</para>

                                <para>It would be a dangerous illusion to think that, if war once started, it will come
              to an early end, even if a success in any one of the several fronts on which it will

                            <para>From the second document, a letter from Herr Hitler dated the 23rd August, I read
            paragraph 1 as numbered in that letter. It is as follows : -</para>

                                <para>Germany has never sought conflict with England and has never interfered in
              English interests. On the contrary, she has for years endeavoured, although
              unfortunately in vain, to win England's friendship. On this account she
              voluntarily assumed in a wide area of Europe limitations on her own interests which from a national
              political point of view it would have otherwise been very difficult to tolerate.</para>
                            </quote>
                            <para>I direct honorable members' attention to that. On the 23rd August,
            Herr Hitler is saying in this highly unreal fashion that Germany had voluntarily limited
            itself in Europe and ought to be given gome credit for it. I content myself by pointing
            out that on that very date Germany's territory and population were both greater than
            they were before 1914. This limitation of which he speaks was a strange sort of
            limitation since it had brought him Austria, Czechoslovakia, the re militarization of the
            Rhine and a re armed Germany. A strange limitation indeed, that left him with vastly
            greater territory and vastly greater population and vastly greater military resources!
            Then Herr Hitler goes on in the letter to set out what must be now distressingly
            familiar to all of us after some months of reading of them - allegations about appalling
            terrorism and atrocities of which, mark you, the German people have invariably been the
            "victims at the hands of small neighbouring states." He ends up by saying -</para>

                            </quote>
                            <para>Then those letters, not very promising if honorable members read them,
            not containing very much hope of settlement in their terms, were followed by a
            conversation between Sir Nevile Henderson, the
            British Ambassador at Berlin, and Herr Hitler. In the course of that conversation,
            Herr Hitler gave Sir Nevile Henderson a message to
            the British Government, a message which was so substantially better in point of tone
            that when we read of it here we had great hopes that reason might at last be prevailing
            on these matters. Honorable members will read it and they will see underneath all the
            veneer of boast and self-satisfaction that one perhaps could be led to expect some
            possibility of peaceful settlement not only in Danzig and the Corridor but also in
            Europe itself. The British Ambassador took that message to London. He flew to London on
            the morning of Saturday, the 26th August, which was after all, only a week before war
            occurred, and he gave a full account of it to the Government of the United Kingdom,
            which considered it on the Sunday, when it had, no doubt, the benefit of the views of
            all of the dominion governments. At any rate I can say for myself that I took the
            opportunity on that Sunday to convey to the British Government what I thought were the
            views not only of the Government of Australia but also of the great majority of the
            people of Australia. What I said to Mr. Chamberlain
            I repeated in substance on subsequent occasions in relation to the circumstances as they
            developed. I suggested that he and the British Government should make it clear to Herr
            Hitler that we regarded the merits of Danzig and the Corridor as quite open to argument
            and that we should use our influence with Poland to procure some form of arbitrament or
            adjustment, so long as Germany was prepared to play its part, but we felt that the time
            was opportune for a general European settlement which would recognize Germany's
            obligations to Italy and ours to France. That had been mentioned in the German despatch.
            And we welcomed references to possible future limitation of armaments, because we felt
            that the present state of affairs must lead to a serious economic breakdown, in which
            Germany would suffer as much as any country. I went further and suggested that it should
            be emphasized that there was amongst all the British peoples a genuine desire for good
            relations with Germany, but this desire was not inconsistent with the determination to
            fight Germany in what seemed a just cause, yet it would be a tragedy if we should fight,
            each believing his cause to be just when unprejudiced discussion and desire to
            understand each other's point of view might have avoided it; and that, from that
            point of view, a clear statement by Herr Hitler of his aims and desires should if
            possible be obtained. I went on to say that I would not dismiss proposals made by Herr
            Hitler simply because they were vague or occasionally meaningless, but that it was
            essential our approach to the whole problem should be liberal and generous so long as
            generosity was at our own expense and not at the expense of others. I said that we must
            not connive at a Polish settlement which would leave Poland at such a disadvantage in the negotiations as would render it probable that
            its future history would resemble that of Czechoslovakia.</para>

                the Australian Government in relation to this matter, and I venture to believe - I
                dare to believe - that that represents the general view of the great majority of the
                Australian people. Well, the British Government had that advice, that point of view,
                before it. It had its own point of view. It considered this matter with great care
                on the Sunday. It completed its reply to Hitler on the Monday morning, and that
                reply, which will be found in Document 4, was taken back to Berlin. I think that it
                will be agreed by those who read it that the reply does express a liberal and
                generous approach to this problem. It was not a truculent document. It was a
                document which exhibited a really earnest desire to arrive at a settlement. It
                indicated that any settlement arrived at must be guaranteed by other Powers, and it
                emphasized the view that if there is to be any proper settlement of the Polish
                problems there must be direct discussions between the German Government and the
                Polish Government on a basis that would include the safeguarding of Polish essential
                interests - a settlement procured by international guarantee.</para>

            importance. At 7.15 p.m. on the 29th August, Herr Hitler handed his reply to Sir Nevile Henderson in Berlin. That reply is set out in
            Document 5. I do not propose to read it. It is rich in reference to the national
            dignity and honour of the German people. It is rich in reference to barbaric occasions
            of maltreatment which cry to high heaven, but it does ultimately go down into something
            specific, because it says this, as honorable members will see on page 12 -</para>

                            <para class="block">That is another point which I emphasize. At the time this note was
            handed over, the German proposals, on which so much play was made afterwards, had not
            been drafted, and therefore no representative of the Polish Government could possibly
            know what they were. Notwithstanding this, the Polish negotiator was to arrive in Berlin
            the next day with authority to commit his government, although he had no knowledge of
            the proposals, and had no instructions from his government regarding them! As a method
            of negotiation, I cannot imagine anything more absurd. When the note was handed over to
              Sir Nevile Henderson, he pointed out that as it
            required the Polish representative to attend in Berlin the next day, it was demanding
            what was not possible. The reply of Herr Von Ribbentrop was that this provision was
            intended only to stress the urgency of the matter in view of the fact that the two
            armies were standing face to face. The British Ambassador transmitted this note to the
            British Government and, on the next day, the British Foreign Minister sent a telegram to
              Sir Nevile Henderson. This telegram, which is

            applied itself to this problem - the Foreign Minister instructed the Ambassador in
            Berlin to stress the unreasonableness of the German request for the attendance of a
            Polish plenipotentiary, and suggested that the ordinary diplomatic procedure should he
            followed of inviting the Polish Ambassador to call, and of handing over to him the
            German Government's proposal. That was a good suggestion, since peace was surely
            worth a few hours of discussion. Peace was surely worth conducting the discussion in
            such circumstances as would enable the matter to be fairly considered as between
            countries negotiating as equals. On the same day, the 30th August, the British
            Government replied to the German Note. That reply is contained in document 10, and I
            direct special attention to it. When we realize that it was delivered within 36 hours of
            the outbreak of war, this document, becomes the most positive evidence of the
            willingness of Great Britain to further the ends of peace, and of its unwillingness to
            see war result. The Note acknowledges the friendly references in the German Note. It
            notes that the German Government accepts the British proposal, and is prepared to enter
            into direct negotiation with the Polish Government. It then goes on to say -</para>

                            <para>The Polish Government was informed of that, and agreed with the
            suggestion regarding the frontier. When Sir Nevile
            Henderson presented the reply to Von Ribbentrop at midnight, on the 30th August, he
            suggested that Von Ribbentrop should invite the Polish Ambassador to Berlin to call, and
            that he should then be given the German proposals for transmission to his Government
            with a view to immediate negotiation. Honorable members would be surprised to find that
            it was an unusual suggestion that a foreign minister should send for the ambassador
            of a foreign country stationed for that purpose in his city and say to him: "Here
            are the proposals of the German Government for the settlement of our troubles. Will
            you convey them to your government and obtain a reply?" But Von Ribbentrop's
            only reply to that was what we now know as the sixteen proposals. He read them out very
            rapidly in German. He refused to hand over a copy, and he said that it was too late to
            give them to the British Ambassador since the Polish representative had not reached
            Berlin at midnight. He refused to invite the Polish Ambassador to see him, but he hinted
            that the matter might be different if the Polish Ambassador asked for an interview. That
            was at midnight on the 30th August. When the reply of the Polish Government to the
            British Ambassador at Warsaw was handed over on the afternoon of the 31st August, the
            Polish Foreign Minister said " Contact with the German Government would be
            established by the Polish Ambassador at Berlin." The Polish reply contained a
            guarantee by the Polish Government that there would be no violation of the German
            frontier during the negotiations provided that, the German Government gave a similar
            guarantee. On the same day, the 31st August, the British Foreign Minister instructed the
            Ambassador at 11 o'clock at night to inform the German Government that the Polish
            Government was taking steps to establish contact through the Polish Ambassador in
            Berlin with the German Government. That evening, the evening of the 31st August, a
            little before that communication had been made, the Polish Ambassador at Berlin
            obtained an interview with Von Ribbentrop regarding the British suggestion that direct
            discussions between the German Government and the Polish Government should be initiated.
            During that interview - that is, the interview on the evening of the 31st August - no
            German proposals were communicated to the Polish Ambassador.</para>
                            <para class="block">After the interview, the Polish Ambassador was unable to report to his
            Government the result of his conversation with Von Ribbentrop because he found that the
            German Government had terminated communication between Germany and Poland. So that, on
            the night of the 31st August, while you have the Polish Ambassador in direct contact
            with the German Foreign Minister, there was no communication of the proposals to him;
            he was not even able to tell his Government about the unsatisfactory result of his
            discussion, because by the time the conversation finished, communication was cut off.
            And communication with Poland having been cut off, what came next? What came next was
            that the detailed German proposals for the settlement of the Polish-German differences
            were broadcast from a German wireless station. I may tell honorable members that all of
            these documents that preceded this were secret documents exchanged through diplomatic
            channels and not offered to the public. They were on the face of them designed to
            produce peace or a settlement of the differences. But these events having occurred, the
            German Government went on the air and then broadcast to the world proposals, a copy of
            which it had refused to give to the British Ambassador when he saw Herr von Ribbentrop
            at midnight on the 30th August. Simultaneously with the broadcast, the German State
            Secretary handed to the British Ambassador at Berlin a document setting out the detailed
            text of the German proposals. That document honorable members will find in the White
            Paper as Document 13. I am not going to read it for one moment though it would repay
            study; but I do want to draw attention to a passage early on page 17, remembering, as
            honorable members will, that these proposals were broadcast to the world about 9 p.m. on
            the 31st August. The document contains this statement -</para>

                            <para class="block">This is put forward late in the evening of the 31st August as a
            statement at that time of the German desire to procure a settlement. This document then
            handed to the British Ambassador has to be conveyed to London. The utterly fraudulent
            character of that statement can best be understood when we remember that it was only a
            few hours later that the German army invaded Poland. Literally a few hours, four, five
            or six hours, before that invasion occurs, we find the German Government solemnly saying
            in a diplomatic communication to the British Government handed to the British Ambassador
            in Berlin : " The Reich Government are, therefore, actuated by the idea of finding a
            lasting solution, and these are the terms on which we think it could be found ". At
            the time when the proposals were broadcast, no copy of them had been communicated to the
            Polish Government at all, and no copy was in the possession of the British Government.</para>

                            <para>There had never been any communication of those proposals to the Polish
                Government until they were actually broadcast, after which the German Government
                wasted no further time, as it would say, in its determination to march in. So far as
                Great Britain was concerned, the communication, if one could call it such, had been
                a very hurried reading in German to the British Ambassador, who speaks German, but
                who, like those who have some acquaintance of a foreign language, could not be
                expected to follow a document read at high speed in a foreign language. Apart from
                that, there was no communication to the British Government until the broadcast. The
                handing of the document to the British Ambassador took place at a time when
                circumstances rendered it physically impossible for that document to go to London to
                be considered by the British Cabinet, and for any action to be taken in relation to
                it. In the early morning of the 1st September following the broadcast late in the
                previous evening, Herr Hitler issued a proclamation to the German army stating that
                Poland had refused a peaceful settlement, and had appealed to arms. He had therefore
                decided to meet force with force. On the same morning, German troops crossed the
                Polish frontier at a number of points, and commenced general military operations
                against Poland. Thereafter, as document No.14 shows, the British Government gave
                notice that unless there was a withdrawal of troops on the part of Germany,
                Britain's obligation and undertaking to Poland would come into force, and would
                be honoured. The result of this I mentioned at the beginning of my statement.</para>
                            <para>To honorable members and to the people of Australia I just make one general
            comment on these documents. It is, I believe, abundantly clear to anybody who reads this
            history, that, had Germany not desired war, there would not be a war to-day in Europe.</para>

                institutions of parliament, and of liberal thought, free speech, and free criticism,
                must go on. It would be a tragedy if we found that we had fought for freedom and
                fair play and the value of the individual human soul, and won the war only to lose
                the things we were fighting for. Consequently I shall welcome criticism, but I do
                want to emphasize that our great task, however long this struggle may endure, is in

              between Great Britain - which includes Australia in this connexion - and Germany. I
              had expected that the Government would have seized this first opportunity of meeting
              the Parliament to outline, at least broadly, the intentions of the Government in
              respect of the defence of this Commonwealth, and of the general principles upon which
              it proposed to be influenced in framing its programme. I take it, however, that the
              right honorable gentleman will seize another opportunity to do that.

                                <para>- For my own part, I am not obliged to examine the events which led to this most
                dreadful calamity. I. think I can say that the outlook is so dreadful that, if one
                looks at it at all deeply, one must reel back appalled at the prospect which
                confronts this civilization. We can be a saddened but determined people in this
                crisis. We are not a militarily-minded people. We hate and abhor war, and we had
                hoped that the memories of the previous war would have been sufficiently vivid
                everywhere throughout the whole civilized world as to have impelled even the most
                ruthless of rulers to recourse to negotiation to the very limit in order to carry
                out, if he could, whatever were the national aims of the country. That has not been
                the case in this connexion, and I think that it did not require the White Paper to
                convince the people of Australia that the basic reason why the United Kingdom and
                the British Commonwealth of Nations are at war with Germany, is because Germany
                invaded Poland. That invasion followed a recourse to armed force and a refusal to
                allow whatever were the issues between Germany and the Polish State to be examined
                in the light of a free and reasonable discussion. Discussion and negotiations were
                thrust aside and there was no alternative but for this dreadful infliction to come
                to mankind.</para>

                            The Australian Labour party is concerned primarily for the defence and safety of the
            people of this Commonwealth who are involved in this war, and if is also concerned for
            the safety and integrity of the British Commonwealth of Nations of which Australia is a
            part. We know that it is idle to argue in respect of what might be some of the features
            of the Treaty of Versailles. There is no point now in endeavouring to hark back to lost
            opportunities when, perhaps, other courses might have produced a

                            development in Germany. We are faced with the
            facts as they now exist. So that there can be no misunderstanding as to where the
            Opposition is in this situation, I propose to read to the House a declaration which was
            drawn up by the party at its first meeting after the declaration of a state of war. The
            statement is us follows: -
                        </para>
                        <para>The Australian Labour party affirms its traditional horror of war, and its belief
            that international disputes should be settled by arbitration.</para>
                        <para>It deplores the fact that force, instead of negotiation and discussion, has plunged
            the peoples into war. It believes that resistance to force and armed aggression is
            inevitable if attacks on free and independent peoples are to be averted.</para>
                        <para>In this crisis, facing the reality of war, the Labour party stands for its platform.
            That platform is clear.</para>
                        <para>We stand for the maintenance of Australia as an integral part of the British
            Commonwealth of Nations. Therefore, the party will do all that is possible to safeguard
            Australia and, at the same time, having regard to its platform, will do its utmost to
            maintain the integrity of the British Commonwealth.</para>
                        <para>As to the conduct of An arabian affairs during this unhappy period, the Ausarabian

            Commonwealth of Nations.</para>
                        <para>We take the view that these measures should include the immediate control by the

            equipment-</para>
                        <para>There must be rigid control of commodity prices and house rents, so that war

                        <para>To ensure that this be done, it is essential that the Parliament of the Commonwealth
            should remain in session.</para>
                        <para class="block">That is an unanimous declaration, made at the very opening stages of
            this war.</para>
                        <para>Let me now say that I recognize, and . that the Opposition recognizes - as the first
            paragraph of that declaration says - that the efforts for negotiation were checked by
            the fact that Germany would not withdraw its troops from Poland and that therefore the
            situation in. which Great Britain found itself, having regard to its undertaking to
            guarantee the integrity of Poland. led to what I. shall describe as the fact of war.
            Germany knew that, if it did not withdraw its troops from Poland, war with Great Britain
            was certain. I think I can say that the German proposals - in part and in principle they
            were proposals capable of unprejudiced consideration - we i e apparently never genuinely
            intended for reasonable consideration or negotiation. I feel that we cannot blind
            ourselves to the certainty that this method of putting forward proposals for
            consideration was merely a repetition of the technique which was followed in regard to
            Austria and Czechoslovakia, and that the policy of Germany has involved very much more
            than a rectification of the injustices - to use the proper term - of the Versailles
            Treaty. Germany apparently has in mind very much more than the pruning down of what can
            be regarded as features of the treaty which were unjust. Its programme appeared to have
            been enlarged into one of complete domination - such domination of Europe as armed
            forces would procure. Even if we believe that Poland's cause is not entirely a right
            one, we cannot dismiss the fact that it would next be the turn of Roumania, Yugoslavia,
            Hungary and Bulgaria, and that Great Britain, France and the United States of America
            alone would stand in the path of totalitarian government marching throughout the
            civilized world. That being the case, and the fact of the war being about us, we have to
            consider the position of Australia. I say here that it is no contribution to the peace
            of the world, and it is no contribution even to the security of the British Commonwealth
            of Nations, for this country to attempt to do things that we would like to do, without
            first having made it as clear as human foresight can make it that we have completely
            discharged our responsibility to our own people. The safety of this Commonwealth must be
            the paramount consideration influencing every feature of Government "policy. What
            the right honorable gentleman has said is true, namely, that we are a democracy. It is
            as a democracy that we have to face this problem, because it is our desire to remain a
            democracy when the problem has ceased to exist. Therefore the Australian Labour
            party's platform, as the declaration states, has laid it down how best we can
            preserve democracy in the Commonwealth of Australia. I say quite frankly that it is but
            natural that we should be concerned for the fellow members of the family of nations of
            which we are an integral part. There is a great deal- that Australia can do in order to
            help the whole of the British Commonwealth. Our platform declares that nothing shall be
            left undone to ensure the greatest effectiveness among out people to hold this country
            for the citizens of the Commonwealth. In giving effect to that policy, as I see it,
            there ought not to be, but there may be, two major points of difference between the
            Government and ourselves. One is conscription, to which we are opposed. The other does
            not arise, in view of last night'? pronouncement by the Government that it does not
            contemplate expeditionary forces. Those two issues are, as the Government knows and as
            the country knows, issues upon which the Opposition is pledged, and we are determined to
            maintain the views and the principles for which we have stood and fought while we have
            been a party.</para>
                        <para>Outside those two considerations, there appears to me to be no reason whatever why
            the Opposition cannot fully reciprocate the hope which the Prime Minister expressed in
            his statement this afternoon. It is true, that there may be points of difference between
            us in regard to the degree to which policy can be carried out in the various measures
            which the Government will introduce from time to time.</para>
                        <para>
                            The suggestion that there should be a government composed of all parties in this
            Parliament appears to me to be one which, if carried out, would not be in the best
            interests of either the Parliament, the Government, or the people of Australia. This
            Parliament must not be a mere governmental echo during this crisis. The right honorable
            gentleman has said that he does not desire to have a muzzled Opposition. I think he will
            agree, and I think that those who examine the situation fairly will agree, that it would
            be a bad thing for the conduct of this war for the Government not to have to confront an
            Opposition, to face up to the examination which an Opposition can best give to
            government proposals. Tha!: ought not to mean unnecessary or undue delay in carrying out
            government policy. Such legislation as is required can be introduced, explained and
            examined. The Opposition can state its views concerning it, make suggestions as to what
            ought to be done, and indicate what objections, if any, it has to either a part or. the
            whole
                            <inline font-style="italic">oi</inline>
                            it; and the Government, being anxious to
            have - as I am sure it will be anxious to have - a united Australian people, ought to
            take into account the views which the Opposition will express in this House. For let it
            be remembered that, lit the lowest ebb of our political fortunes, this Opposition has
            always spoken for nearly one-half of the people of Australia; and, normally speaking, it
            may be' said that we just as much represent the people of Australia as does the
            Government, because, by and large, the distribution of a few votes in a few
            electorates' is alone what decides which party in this House will have control of
            the Government. I say to the right honor- :i bie gentleman that I see no reason myself
            why his Government, so long as it conforms to the general principles according to which
            Australia, no doubt, would approve of the war being fought, should not discharge its
            responsibility of administering the affairs of this country. We have no desire to enter
            into this Government, and our service to the Australian people is not conditioned by anl
            invitation to serve in the Government. I -ay quite frankly that we shall be able to Jo
            our duty fearlessly, and, I believe, usefully, by playing the part of watchdogs over the
            public . interest, and by maintaining the free institutions of this country during the
            twilight through which, inevitably, we have to pass before the dawn can come.
                        </para>
                        <para>
                            In the declaration I have drawn attention to two things - profiteering and,
            possibly, curtailment of the democratic rights of the people. I sincerely hope that the
            Government will not wait until profiteering has commenced in order to establish the
            requisite machinery to deal with it. That machinery should be set going immediately, so
            that at the very onset we can prevent the development of abuses, which are exceedingly
            difficult to check once they have become prevalent. Then I say that it is of very great
            importance to the maintenance of national unity, and of concord among the people, that
            the few who would take advantage of this dreadful calamity to exploit their fellow
            citizens shall not be given the opportunity to do so. A great deal of what may
            subsequently be described as subversive propaganda, will have its roots in the honest
            indignation with which the people will endeavour to combat unfair and unjust practices.
            Therefore, it is as necessary for the peace and unity of the Australian people
            internally to establish this machinery at the very onset of this situation as it is for
            the Minister for Defence
                            <inline font-style="italic">to</inline>
                            organize the military,
            naval and air forces of the nation. Then I say that there ought to be assured to the
            people liberty of speech ; there ought not to be the inroads, in respect of rights of
            public meetings, and the expression of the views of the people, which were a feature of
            the last war. .1 know that the censorship and other activities were engaged in because
            it was said that there were influences at work in Australia which were anxious to serve
            th". enemy. With respect to those agencies in Australia which are concerned with
            serving the enemy, there is no course which the Government would take to suppress them
            which this party would not support. We will not support treason, sabotage, insurrection,
            or activities which will be helpful to the enemy. But there is a radical distinction
            between helping the enemy and the exercise of the normal right of the Australian people
            to be free citizens in a country which is fighting for the preservation of freedom. I
            hope that a conference will be held with newspaper editors at an early date so that
            principles may be formulated, as I am sure they can be, to prevent a great deal of the
            folly which characterized the actions of the censorship in the last war. I welcome, as I
            am sure the country will approve, the declaration of the Prime Minister that he will not
            only seek to preserve democratic institutions when the war is over, but will also strive
            to maintain them while it is being fought.
                        </para>
                        <para>It is a dreadful pass to which the British Commonwealth of Nations has come. This is
            a grievous day in the history of Australia. The Opposition, like the Government, regards
            itself as the servant of the people of this country. We are as loyal to this soil, and
            to the institutions of this country, as any other political party in public life. We
            shall do our utmost to preserve and defend Australia against aggression, and we shall
            also make the best contribution we can make to ensure that aggression will ultimately no
            longer be relied upon by any other country. I conclude with the hope, however little
            there may be to justify it, that somehow, as early as possible, there will intrude
            itself into the councils of the countries at war, these influences which will persuade
            them to call a truce from warfare, so that they may, even now, while the guns are
            blaring, sit down to discover whether, after all, right cannot triumph without being
            backed by might.</para>

              every honorable member on this side of the chamber, and, in fact, in the Parliament,
              at the pronouncement, by the Leader of the Opposition
                                <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
                Cur-tin),</inline>
                                of the policy of his party. His words will give great
              satisfaction to the people of Australia. He left nothing unsaid that we wanted to
              hear. He left us in no doubt as to the attitude of Labour in this great emergency. I
              cannot conceive of any way in which his statement could be amended in the interests of
              Australia. He has assured us that, in all things necessary for the effective
              prosecution of the war, his party will co-operate wholeheartedly. He has given us
              reasons why his party would be unable to accept an invitation to join what is termed a
              national government. It is not for me at this moment to express any opinion on
              national governments, but- I agree entirely with the Leader of the Opposition when he
              says that what is demanded of a government in this crisis is that it shall have a
              definite policy, for which it shall be responsible to the people. And this can hardly
              be ensured unless it is composed of men who hold very definite opinions in common. The
              co-operation of the honorable member and his party will give the Government that
              support to which he justly says it is entitled. This has been promised, and it will be
              given to us. So we face this new and terrible ordeal as a united people.

                        <para>I feel swayed by emotions which make it difficult for me to give expression to my
            thoughts. Twenty-five years have rolled away since I stood in this Parliament holding
            the office which I now hold, confronting a situation identical for all practical
            purposes with that which faces us to-day. The memories of the years, dark and terrible,
            that followed will never fade. Now, once more Germany has plunged the world into war.
            Perhaps I may be permitted to read a brief extract from a speech which I made when we
            were in the early stages of the Great War, into which she had then plunged the world. I
            then said -</para>

                            <para>I quite agree that we have no quarrel with the masses of the German Nation; but we
              have a quarrel, and a quarrel to the death, with that intolerable Prussian military
              autocracy which, by this war, and by deliberate preparation during the last twenty
              years, has hoped to dominate the world and trample under foot liberty and democratic
              government. In order to meet the machinations of (this blood' and iron policy, the
              power given in this paragraph is obviously necessary. We are face to face with the
              most terrible realities. It is for us a struggle of life and death. We must not forget

            war, and for a season it seemed as though their sacrifices had not been in vain. Now,
            all the hopes of a world from which war had been forever banished, which we conjured up
            in our minds, are shattered; all the sacrifices of magnificent soldiers have gone for
            nothing. While our. streets are still crowded with men who fought and suffered in the
            last war, and while the treasuries of this country are still pouring our millions of
            pounds annually in order to make good in some fashion at least, the losses and
            sufferings of those who took part in that war, war has again come upon us.</para>
                        <para>The Leader of the Opposition has indicated what he conceives to be the line of
            policy the Government should pursue. He said, and I agree with him, that the first duty
            of this Government is to provide for the defence of Australia. We are very proud of
            being citizens of the British Commonwealth of Nations; but our first duty as Australians
            is to Australia, and the people of this country will expect us, in the dark days that
            may be ahead of us to take every means at our disposal to ensure the safety of
            Australia. This is our first, our paramount duty. Let me direct the attention of
            honorable members, for a few minutes, to the position which faces Australia to-day. At
            present, Australia is far from the vortex of the conflict. We are like men in a ship in
            mid-ocean. Wireless communications tell us of fierce cyclonic storms raging outside the
            radius of our movements. We note the fall in the barometer, the heavy oppressive air,
            but round about us is perfect calm. That is our position to-day. War is raging, but it
            is far off ; for a time at least we are outside its range. We arc, for a. season,
            removed. As we turn our eyes to the East, where a little while ago we looked with
            apprehension at the blood - red clouds gathered on the sky, we see that the horizon is
            lighter. The last fortnight has witnessed dramatic changes. The Russo-German Pact has
            completely altered, for the time being, the position in the Far East. For the moment,
            then, we are far removed from the war that is raging in Europe, and in the Far East
            there is a promise of brighter prospects. That is the position, to-day. What it will be
            to-morrow, or next week, or next month, no man can say. But this is clear : the
            international situation is violently unstable; no mau can say what a day may bring
            forth. The position of any nation that depends upon the assurances of other nations, is
            in the last degree, precarious. But yesterday we contemplated an alliance with Russia:
            to-day Russia has aligned itself with that nation which now threatens the very
            foundations of our national and imperial being. There is no safety for us, or for the
            British Empire; nor is there any possibility of lasting peace to be found, except in our
            own courage and our preparedness to resist aggression. I shall not speak of what the
            future holds in store. No man can say how long the war will last or what nations will be
            involved. Of one thing only we are certain, and that is, that the. possibilities of the
            struggle are incalculable. Herr Hitler, by his resolve to gratify his insatiable
            ambitions, has condemned millions of men, women and children, not only of other nations,
            but also of his own nation, to death in its most horrid shape.</para>
                        <para>
                            No one can say what effect the war will have upon Australia, but we must rid our
            minds of any illusions that the war will pass us by, and that we shall continue
                            <inline font-style="italic">to</inline>
                            be marooned upon this isle of the blest. To-day, the
            position of the people of Australia may be. regarded as fortunate compared with that of
            the people of England, France or any other nation in Europe. We are far removed from the
            possibility of mass attack from the air. That is the position to-day. What it will be
            within a few weeks, a few months, no man can say. All I have to say to the people of
            Australia is this : It is well for us that we have made the preparations that we have
            done. Australia is to-day far better fitted to defend itself against aggression than she
            was twelve months ago. Her young nien have flocked to the standard in overwhelming
            numbers, and I have no doubt at all that if more were wanted they would be available. On
            land, on sea and in the air, we have done and are doing what we can to ensure the safety
            of the Commonwealth. But because - for the moment - the Avar is far off, there is some
            danger that the people of this country may not realize that this is a struggle to the
            death, that there are involved issues which may shake to the very foundations of the
            structure of our national and economic life. To-day we walk proudly in this wide and
            fertile country and acknowledge none as our master. But there are other citizens of
            other democracies not less proud of their inheritance and jealous of their rights than
            we who have fallen. We see what has happened to the people of Czechoslovakia. We see
            what is happening to-day to the people of Poland. In the world as it is to-day, no
            nation is secure; all are menaced. There is, and can be no assurance of safety for the
            people of Australia, except that which is firmly based on the courage and preparedness
            of the Australian people.
                        </para>
                        <para>The Leader of the Opposition spoke of other steps that ought to he taken to protect
            this community. With others he spoke about the steps that ought to be taken to deal
            Avith profiteering and inflation of prices. About this I am not in a position to speak
            with authority, but I point to what was done in the last Avar, and I am of the opinion
            that that which the Leader of the Opposition has asked for should be done. The people of
            this country expect that while they are called upon to make sacrifices, those sacrifices
            should be made not by a section, by a class, but by all. None should make profit out of
            this war. About that I think we are all agreed and legislation designed to effect that
            purpose will, I am very sure, receive the wholehearted support of my friends mi the
            other side of the House. The time has gone by when we can talk about the merits of the
            issues on which war is raging. The people of this country want justice, not only to the
            Poles, but also to the Germans. But issues far greater than the status of Danzig and
            re-alignment of the Corridor are now involved. This war will decide whether right
            'or might shall rule in the world. That is the issue, and upon victory for right
            depends the existence of civilization. Our own hands are clean; and once again Britain
            has given a lead to the world. We can congratulate ourselves upon the attitude of
            Britain. She has done everything humanly possible to effect a peaceful solution; and but
            for Germany, she would have succeeded. There never has been in history a more shameful
            exhibition of Machiavelian tactics than those resorted to by the German Government as
            displayed in this White Paper. But as I have said, the time has gone when we can discuss
            the merits of the issues upon which this war is raging. We must face the situation as it
            presents itself to us. That is abundantly clear. We must defend ourselves. We are to do
            everything humanly possible to ensure the safety of Australia. With what we are to do
            with' regard to the Empire at large, we shall deal as circumstances from time to
            time indicate. But for the time being we are confronting a situation which was none of
            our making. We cannot contemplate defeat. We must, go on to victory.</para>

                                . - If ever a race of people entered unwillingly and with a clear conscience upon
              war, it is the British people who do so now. What the outcome will be, we cannot tell,
              but 1 do not think there has ever been such unanimity among all sections as there is
              to-day on the inevitable course we must follow. All differences disappear in the face
              of the disaster that the ruler of the German people has brought upon the world. I join
              with the Prime Minister
                                <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline>

              pledge of our full support for Britain and the rest of the Empire in meeting this
              dread challenge. I was pleased also to hear the Leader of the Opposition

                                join with the Prime Minister. But I cannot
              help feeling that the Empire is entering upon the climax of the greatest battle in it?
              history - the battle for peace. It is worth while at the beginning of this war to
              recount the efforts for peace which Great Britain and the British Empire have been
              making since the conclusion of the last great war. When the history of this period is
              written, the record of British policy in the last twenty years .... stand out in
              letters of gold as the epic of a race which strove with its utmost might to abolish
              the spectre of war from the earth. The greatness of the greatest empire the world has
              known is not in the proud story of its growth so much as in its attainment to the
              position where even its enemies concede it to be the strongest influence for peace.
              I!ts commanding sense of right and wrong and its love an fi devotion to that, Emerson
              says, is the Imperial trait which arms the Anglo-Saxon people with the sceptre of the
              globe. Only such an empire could have risked it? prestige as this Empire has in recent
              years in the cause of peace.

                        <para>It is true that the Treaty of Versailles was an imperfect instrument. But Britain
            was not the only party to it, and with the heroic vision of the League of Nations its
            signature to the Covenant was no mere formality. The League was the creation of the
            English-speaking peoples. It was Britain's hope that the Covenant would end the era
            of isolationist policies and secret diplomacy, and. bring enduring peace and
            understanding to war-shattered Europe by free discussion. Britain also joined readily in
            the Washington Conference for the limitation of naval tonnages - the first occasion upon
            which world powers reached agreement upon a reduction of armaments. Britain's
            participation in this conference was all the more exemplary since, while it could no
            longer claim to rule the waves with the same assurance, it was still the strongest naval
            power in the world. In its fulfilment of the terms of the Versailles Treaty, the
            magnanimity of Britain was at times such us to be resented in no small degree by its
            great ally, France. The encouragement of separatist movements in the Rhineland, for
            example, was discountenanced by Britain, and the Olive report was its direct
            contribution to the cessation of interference in the domestic concerns of the new German
            Republic. It was in direct contrast to the later attitude of the machinations of the
            Third Reich in the Saar, Austria, and the Sudetenland. It was Britain which took the
            lead in early post-war years in efforts to enable Germany to recover its economic
            prosperity, and its motive was none the less worthy because it saw this as a factor in
            the stabilization of Europe. It lent money to all of the ex-enemy powers in an effort to
            restore their economic systems and permit them to engage again in international trade.
            The occupation of the Ruhr in 1923 was undertaken against Britain's advice and
            without its co-operation. Tn the Lausanne Treaty, Britain's friendly attitude
            towards Turkey laid the foundations of a lasting understanding which has had such a
            fortunate outcome in thb grave emergency of to-day. Under the Locarno Pact Britain was
            prepared to guarantee the frontiers that were given to Germany. But the greatest effort
            towards peace was Britain's lead in the race for disarmament. Unfortunately thai
            particular effort of sacrifice in order to help the prosperity of the world has probably
            contributed to the crisis to-day. In the last three or four years Britain found its
            efforts to bring about peace were not going to be attended with success. Because Britain
            could not secure the active co-operation of the other powers, and because one man had
            set himself out to trample on every decent principle of international law and justice,
            Britain, since 1936, has been compelled to re-arm in order to resist the aggression that
            every one felt must come. Any one who reads the history of the last three or four years
            cannot avoid the feeling that, ever since 1936, Hitler has been engaged upon an
            undeclared war against the British Empire, in the course of which he has employed the
            blackest deception, and sold the honour of the German people. The Prime Minister has
            touched upon the record of the leader of Germany in this regard, pointing out how he has
            broken his promises and completely reversed his declared policy. In September, last,
            Hitler said -</para>

                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">Yet this September he is at war in an endeavour to enforce further
            territorial claims against a country which he attacked without first notifying the
            government of that country of the conditions which he desired it to fulfil. We in
            Australia, therefore, have no alternative but to join with the other parts of the
            Empire, for the sake of our honour, and, indeed, of our very existence, in the
            prosecution of this war. We are waging this war, not against the hapless German people -
            because they are the victims of this man's lust for power almost as much as we are -
            but against another of its maniacal leaders. The world will know no peace until
            Hitlerism is destroyed. There are two reasons why Australia should not isolate itself
            from this conflict. The first and higher reason is that it is our duty to fight for the
            preservation of world freedom, and for what real democracy stands for. The second is a
            more selfish reason, but a very important one, namely, our own preservation. This is a
            fundamental quarrel between the elements of right and wrong, between the law of force
            and the law of reason, between might and right. Just as our ancestors fought for their
            liberties, and for the right to worship in the way they wished, so we must fight now for
            freedom of thought and action, and for the right of small nations to exist free from the
            threat of aggression. Nobody has expressed the matter better than did His Majesty the
            King in his speech the other night, when he said -</para>

              which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order in the world. It
              is a principle which permits a State, in selfish pursuit of power, to disregard its
              treaties and its solemn pledges; which sanctions use of force or the threat of force

              security, of justice, and of liberty among the nations would be ended.</para>

            cannot afford to isolate itself at this time. The history of the last few years, indeed,
            of the last century, has made it clear that isolated weak nations fall an easy prey to
            those more powerful and less scrupulous. In the last analysis, we must depend on our own
            strength, and on the strength of the British Empire. Fortunately, the strength and
            courage of the Empire have been tested again and again. I remember reading an address by
            Emerson, the Great American essayist, delivered at Manchester about a hundred years ago,
            at a time when Britain was facing difficult times. In the course of this address he paid

            in this crisis. We have a huge Empire, and the magnitude of its resources gives it
            strength yet makes it vulnerable at many points. We should resolve that Australia shall
            be not the Achilles heel of the Empire, but a bulwark for its protection. To this end,
            we must employ all our strength, and marshal all our resources. It is possible that the
            only immediate advantage which wo may derive from the war is that it will induce us to
            see how best we can employ our resources for the purpose of securing the national
            safety.</para>
                        <para>Be the war long or short, it is our first duty to keep the people of Australia
            united as they are now. In my view, there is only one way of doing that, namely, to make
            all sections feel that they are getting an absolutely fair deal under war conditions. If
            there are sacrifices to be made, let them be made equally by all. We should, therefore,
            make certain at the beginning - because we have the lessons of the lust war to guide us
            in this regard - that wages do not have to chase prices all the time ; that real wages
            are maintained, and that every one is given substantial justice. When I looked up the
            figures, I found that, during the last war, the position in regard to prices and wages
            was as follows: -</para>
                        <para class="block">We should take steps now to prevent a similar lag occurring at this
            time. We must prevent profiteering from the very outset in regard to all undertakings,
            and not merely in regard to the making of munitions. Government establishments cannot
            supply all our requirements in the.s regard. They can do much, but we must have the
            whole-hearted assistance of private enterprise. There is no reason why private
            enterprise should not receive a fair return for the labour and capital employed in the
            making of munitions. but there should be no profiteering. Wages should always have a.
            reasonable purchasing power. Interest rates should be kept down because interest is a
            big item in the cost of production, as well as in the national budget.</para>
                        <para>Arrangements should also be made for thu sale of export surpluses at fair prices.
            Commodities should be, as far as possible, processed in Austrialia in order to provide a
            maximum of employment in this country. Before I left the Government, arrangements were
            being made for the purchase of our surplus products by the British Government in case of
            emergency. I urge, however, chat, when contracts for the sale of surplus product* are
            made, they should be subject to constant review. The term of the contract should not be
            for the duration of the war, which might last for years. They should be for no longer
            than a year, perhaps less. For instance, it would be wrong to sell the wheat crop of
            Austrialia ahead for four or five years at the present low prices, when conditions might
            change world prices in a very short time. The Government should keep this point in mind
            when negotiating with the British Government. It should also be provided that, if this
            exportable surplus is purchased by the British Government, and subsequently sold by it
            at a profit to other governments, the Au tral ian producers should participate in the
            profit. There should also he producer representation on the boards or authorities
            engaged in thu disposal of commodities. Ultimately, something in. the nature of pools
            will have to be established, in order to make arrangements for receiving the products,
            and for transporting, selling, and shipping them overseas. Already there is evidence
            that bags for grain are becoming rapidly dearer, and producers might find themselves
            faced with considerable losses unless something is done to keep prices a t a reasonable
            level. It will also be necessary to take measures in regard to insurance. There is
            always a sharp rise of insurance rates during war time, and in order to ensure that the
            right thing will be done, there should be consultation between the Government of
            Australia and the Government of the United Kingdom. We are already noticing the value of
            the statutory organizations which have been created during the last twenty years for the
            handling of produce. They constitute a sound basis on which to build.</para>

                            We should endeavour to achieve stability of government in Australia, and the widest

            number of voters, and it would be a good thing, if we are to make a whole-hearted war
            effort, to have all sections of the community represented in the Government. There would
            be plenty of criticism forthcoming if the actions of such a Government were not well
            directed.

            During the last war the States were cut off from some of the ordinary methods by which
            they financed themselves, and they had to abandon many of their activities as a result.
            I hope that the National Council, which was brought into being some months ago, will be
            made a live and active body with a permanent secretariat, so that it will be able to

            offer constructive criticism, and we shall insist on a fair deal to all so far as it can
            be obtained under the difficult conditions that war imposes. We recognize that, during a
            war period, much must be done by executive act and by regulation, but we believe that
            Parliament should be consulted as frequently as possible in order that members may
            discuss and supervise the making of regulations. Under these conditions we are prepared
            to offer the greatest, help to the Government.</para>
                        <para>I believe thai when the task of get! ing this country into a state of preparedness
            has been completed, Australia wall acquit itself as worthily as it did in the last war
            in which it gained imperishable renown. Herr Hitler's threats have in the past been
            pronounced and continuous. It is. in a sense fortunate that none of us has been under
            any illusion as to the. intentions of the German Dictator, who has deceived not only
            Britain but even his partners in the so-called anti-Comintern pact. He has opposed us
            with might; but on our side we have both might and right and, in the words of His
            Majesty the King, "With God's help, we shall prevail." The time will come
            for us to consider how, in our relations with the rest of the world, we can make our
            contribution to the solution of the- difficulties of international relationships. There
            can never be a lengthy international peace or universal harmony until the peoples of the
            world consume as. much of one another's goods as possible and trade freely with one
            another. When the war is over, I hope that it will be disposed of with the least
            possible bitterness. We recognize that we must devote ourselves wholly to the single
            task of finishing this war which we strove so hard to avert. Good faith and decency must
            he re-established amongst the nations of the world. We are fighting for every ideal we
            have cherished, and if it calls for the last ounce of our strength, the sacrifice is one
            which every one of us would prefer to the prospect of submission to the evil force that
            holds so much of Europe in thrall and is now directed at the Empire, the one great
            obstacle to its subjection of the earth's peoples.</para>

              world gained a quarter of a century ago, in our own lifetime we should witness the
              entry into another world war. Honorable members to-day listened with very great
              attention to the right honorable the Prime Minister's

                                elaboration or explanation of the document that has
              been circulated. It establishes for the people of this country and the members of this
              Parliament the background of this dispute; but it was really not necessary except for
              its useful information. One only wants to know one thing, that the German forces
              invaded Poland. That makes a war inevitable.. The documents tabled to-day, are a
              damning indictment, exposing a lack of faith and of honesty . One feels,, however much
              one abhors war - and I am sure we all do - that that cannot be allowed to continue.
              Again,, it is a struggle to determine whether democracy is to be declared decadent and
              totalitarianism triumphant. If this were permitted to go on, and one more small nation
              after another crushed out of existence, the triumphal, march of the dictatorships
              could not be stopped and democracy would go out of existnce.

            I do not. believe that, democracy would be served by a National Government. I believe
            that democracy will be well served by open discussion without anybody sacrificing the.
            principles he placed before the people who sent him here. The declaration made on behalf
            of this side by our leader, which represents the unanimous view of our party, is. that
            we. shall serve our country in the interests of democracy and justice without portfolio

            appalled at the prospects of another war. After all, what are our human instincts? They

            heroic efforts by men and women to rush to the aid of their fellow men and women. That
            is the human instinct.</para>

                                <para>- That is so. When I read the other day that a ship without auxiliaries and
                without any military attachment to it, in which innocent men, women and children
                were traversing the seas to or from their home land, had been ruthlessly attacked
                and' torpedoed in the open sea, I contrasted that with an incident which I
                witnessed myself in the Indian Ocean when a British ship on which I was travelling
                stopped in its course, turned about, and went 100 miles back on its course to
                respond to an So from a Dutch ship that a woman on board was likely to die unless a
                doctor came to her aid and that the ship carried no doctor. Every passenger on the
                ship on which I travelled, most of them Australians and New Zealanders, were
                thrilled by the thought that the ship would be put back to save a human life. That
                life was saved, and the passengers on the succouring ship subscribed to a fund to
                enable the woman to return to her home. That woman was a German. I contrast that
                human instinct of the human race to render help irrespective of nationality or of
                race with the deadly things that are done during a time of war. No wonder Ave abhor
                war. Our hope is that this war will have a speedy end, that right will prevail, and
                that the forces of democracy will triumph over the dictatorships. If we fail there
                will be no end to these horrors and the repetition of them. I join with my leader in
                offering suggestions and advice to the Government. We do not say offhand that it
                will fail to do certain things; but we have our obligations to our people and we
                must be sure that we have learned the lessons from the last war and that we do not
                allow some to make sacrifices and others to make profits. During the last war there
                was great suffering in Australia, among men, women and children through the greed
                and selfishness of people in our midst who took advantage of the national crisis.</para>

                for the defence of their country, we shall not hand out to those who risk nothing
                double rates of interest for the money they may lend, as was done on a previous

                        <para>I have very little more to say. We are part of the British Commonwealth of Nations.
            I believe it is in the interests of Australia that we should remain a part of that great
            Commonwealth; and we have our responsibilities to it. As my leader has said, we shall
            make our contribution to the defence of this country and to the maintenance of the
            integrity of the British Commonwealth of Nations in a way in which we can best give that
            assistance. We have not a surplus of man-power in Australia but, unfortunately, a
            shortage; we have, however, a surplus of foodstuffs and raw materials. I am not as
            concerned as is the right honorable member for Cowper as to the markets we may get for
            our raw materials as the result of this war. I am, of course, always anxious that the
            men on the land shall be assisted, but as a nation I say that we should not hesitate to
            give to feed the people of Britain, France or other countries in the world if they were
            threatened with starvation. I believe that the Government will best contribute to the
            cause by conserving our man-power and by contributing from our abundance of foodstuffs
            and raw materials. I hope that this Avar will soon be ended. I pray that right and
            justice will prevail and that the suffering* of human beings will not be of long
            duration.</para>

            first in internal politics to the in div duals and then in the international field.
            Doll fuss was assassinated hy the Nazis in Austria, and immediately Germany entered
            Vienna, a statue was erected to the man who assassinated him. Schusnigg when his

                            who succeeded President Genes in Czechoslovakia, was subjected to much
            the same treatment. So much for the agonizing of the individual. In his book, Hitler has
            not concealed what methods he intended to apply, and in his international relations he
            has applied those methods. We all know of the technique of fomenting trouble among
            minorities, and then coming to their salvation. One wonders how such a thing can come
            about in a democratic world. His justification is the doctrine of race consciousness. We
            as Britishers are inclined to flatter ourselves on our national consciousness, but
            Hitler by his race consciousness, his brutal intolerance, his persecution of minorities,
            his suppression of freedom, led Germans throughout the world to believe themselves to be
            a superior race, and that Germans not up to now in the Reich were to be brought back to
            the Reich to carry on the domination not only of smaller countries, but of the world
            itself. That is the plan laid down in

                            It is just as well we should know this and what a formidable war
            machine is opposed to us. All that I have said in introduction we well know by means of
            newspaper reports and radio broadcasts, and it has not been supplemented by this White
            Paper which has been tabled. It is 1914 all over again. We must be prepared for a
            prolonged struggle unless there is some disruption among the German people, and if is
            hard to say whether or not that is likely. I saw no evidence of it while I was in
            Germany last year. If it is there, it is well concealed. The spirit of deference
            displayed by huge crowds in the stadiums - crowds of 200,000 attending football matches
            - shows that among German individuals there is a sort of reverence even for most junior
            ministers - a custom that does not prevail in the democracies. Unless there is some
            disruption within Germany, it is evident that we must embark upon a long and terrible
            struggle. In these, the early, stages of the conflict, the battle is far from us, but
            unless our forces overseas are successful, how long will it be before war comes much
            nearer to our shores? The question I ask is "What can Australia do in this
            matter?" The events leading up to the war have been given to us to-day as a
            background only in the White Paper. The Leader of the -Country party
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline>
                            has stressed the importance of supplies.
            No doubt, it is a very important matter. Australia, with its great capacity for
            supplying the foodstuffs of the world, could be of immense help to the British and
            French forces at this juncture, and that help will be given. Already it has been
            announced that the surpluses of certain primary products in Australia will be purchased
            by the British Government, and that, no doubt, will be of great benefit to Australia,
            but the Government must see that there is no profiteering not only in the manufacturing
            of war supplies, but also in primary production. If Australian primary producers are to
            sell foodstuffs to fighting forces, then there must be a minimum of profit, if any at
            all.

                            Because I believe that at a time such as this our duty is to be helpful and
            critical, I throw out a suggestion which is one of three proposals I shall put forward.
            We speak frequently of our relations with our Pacific neighbours in the East, but how
            often do we look westward? The Indian Ocean is almost without exception bordered by
            British and French territory. Taking Perth or Colombo as its centre, there are South
            Africa, East Africa, Arabia, India and Australia, and just the interspersion of the
            Dutch possessions, through which runs our line of communication. The Indian Ocean
            countries are almost entirely British or French. A new line of communication was
            recently pioneered by the historic flight of the
                            <inline font-style="italic">Quia,</inline>
                            piloted by Captain P. G. Taylor, who, I believe, is now in Canberra.
            That good work must be continued. Let us examine for a moment, the products of those
            countries bordering the Indian Ocean. It will be seen that of the 35 raw materials that
            are essential to industry and to the progress of mankind Germany has only five. It is
            now endeavouring to make synthetic wool and synthetic rubber, and in order to guard
            against emergency has found it necessary to conserve huge quantities of oil in such
            places as disused mine-shafts. The position has, of course, been alleviated by the
            signing of the Russo-German Pact, which provides for the export of certain essential
            commodities from Russia to Germany during the next seven years. By means of this treaty
            Germany will have ample supplies of oil, fats., timber, wool, and several other raw
            materials to which previously it had not access. Germany lias also given Russia seven
            years' credit for the purchase of supplies in exchange for raw materials. The
            friendly countries bordering the Indian Ocean can export all of these essential
            commodities, and I suggest that Australia, might take the initiative and invite all of
            these countries to form a union of supply. Such a union would avoid the duplication of
            shipping and would be of benefit in many other ways. There is as yet no indication of
            the duration of the war, or what nations will be finally involved, and the formation of
            a confederation of" friendly nations, dominions and colonies pooling their resources
            of primary products would ensure that Britain could not be starved. Our first
            responsibility is to see that the country which is bearing the brunt of the fighting for
            the Empire shall be adequately supplied with those fundamental supplies necessary to
            carry on. I submit that suggestion to the Commonwealth Government in the hope that it
            will be given full consideration, and that an endeavour will be made to see whether or
            not the countries I have mentioned cannot be brought together in some federation of
            supply with head-quarters at, say, Colombo or Perth in order that their activities may
            be organized or coordinated. The war as yet is but a matter of a few battles, but in the
            future it can be something that will sap the stability and resources of most countries
            of the world.

                            Leaving for the moment the matter of supplies, are we satisfied that that is all
            that Australia can do ? Do we think that by just being the suppliers of foodstuffs we
            are playing our part, knowing as we do that should Britain be defeated it would be the
            end of Australia as a British community? We heard from the Leader of the Opposition
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline>
                            that no expeditionary force was to be
            sent from Australia to the theatre of war. That, I am sure, is news to everybody on this
            side of the House. It is too soon yet to tell what the alignment of nations is going to
            be. It is quite possible that other countries will come into the war, and make things
            uncomfortable for Australia but at present, it looks as if certain nations who were
            expected to support the Berlin-Rome Axis have abandoned their affiliations in that
            direction, and for that reason, Australia may be reasonably safe at present to send away
            supplies. If we cannot send supplies, we cannot send troops. A fine example to the
            countries of the Empire has been set by Great Britain. First it set an example in the
            introduction of disarmament. It has now been industriously training its manpower,
            producing munitions as fast as possible, and building up armaments in record time.
            Australia should also make its contribution to Empire security. During the last war
            Australia sent its quota of troops to the arenas of conflict, and in my opinion if any
            men feel now that they want to go to the assistance of the Old Country, they should be
            permitted to do so. But unless something is done in this matter there will be a
            considerable drain from Australia in an unorganized way of our man-power, because there
            are many men, not only Britishers living in Australia, but also Australians who would
            like to go overseas and, as so many speakers have said to-day, " do the utmost "
            to assist Great Britain in the present struggle. Therefore, I think that the Government
            should give some consideration to the question of whether or not it should ask the
            United Kingdom at this juncture, " Can we support you in man-power? Is it your
            desire that contingents be raised throughout Australia to assist wherever they may be
            wanted ? " Such an offer would be of immense moral support at this time. The
            immensity of the power which we are opposing in this conflict is well known; but, as has
            been adequately pointed out, it is not the citizens of Germany with whom we are waging
            war; it is the megalomaniacal leader whom we must see removed before We can have any
            peace. My second proposal is therefore, that the Commonwealth Government should at this
            early juncture ascertain from the United Kingdom whether or not an expeditionary force
            is needed. There are at present in the capital cities of the Commonwealth many hundreds
            of men who desire to join up, but they do not know whether or not their services will be
            required.

                we. would be able to hold this country. Our territorial responsibility is greater
                than that of any other country in the world. The population of Australia represents
                only two to a square mile, whereas in Belgium it is over 700 and in Great Britain it
                is 500.

            Parliament within ten days, which is a reason why Parliament should not have only a

            citizen forces are being called up, and many men have splendidly come forward and
            offered their services. Some of them are of middle age and hold key positions. They are

            their best in the interests of their country others, perhaps in the same factory, or
            office, will go on their way untroubled by this- disaster that has fallen upon the
            world. I think all honorable members will agree that that will not give equality of
            sacrifice. How then can that equality be assured? Simply by dealing with that section I
            have quoted by calling up a pertain quota of a given age. They may be eighteen years old
            or nineteen years old or any age that may be chosen. The Commonwealth has the
            statistics, and can readily ascertain how many are available. These men could go into
            camp for one month or two months, and learn the rudiments of military operations. We
            cannot be sure of victory. We may yet have to defend this country. The Commonwealth

                            shows that there are some 100,000 or
            150,000 young men who have turned the age of 21 years since 1929, yet who have done no
            military training. The Government should implement section 59 of the Defence Act
            forthwith, which is my third proposal. That is the way that men may be placed in camp
            without dislocation of industry, It would be an offence if an employer were to impede
            the military training of such young men in his employ. This would spread the sacrifice
            among all classes, and would be democratic. It. would not be that system to which some
            honorable, members are opposed,, namely universal training. Provision for it has been on
            the statutes-book since the inception of federation; it was. enacted in the original
            Defence Act. This I submit, should be considered by the Government immediately,, so that
            the maximum of man-power may be trained without dislocation of industry. There should be
            no weakening in any way.

                        <para>We have gone into this war with our eyes open. We have known of the menace with
            which we have been confronted for years by reason of the policy of the totalitarian
            governments. We have been tolerant. Some have been too tolerant. They have made excuses
            for Germany and have said that, it has had reason to oppose the Versailles Treaty. These
            forget that the Treaty of Versailles had in it the framework of the League of Nations,
            and that the League of Nations, after years of warfare which involved the lives of
            10,000,000 soldiers, apart from private citizens, was a sincere and an earnest world
            attempt to see that the rule of law, and not the rule of force, should actuate the
            nations of the world. We have been able to deal with many industrial disputes, by means
            of arbitration and with our civil disputes in the law courts. Only in the process of
            evolution shall' we ultimately be able to deal with national and international
            disputes by conciliation and arbitration. The President of that great nation, the United
            States of America, was the sponsor of the League of Nations, but his Parliament rejected
            his idea and would not co-operate at the inception of the League. That was a severe blow
            to this idealistic conception. Later Japan, after the intrusion into Manchukuo, withdrew
            from the League of Nations. Great Britain and other nations protested, but to no avail.
            Italy defied the League, and although sanctions were applied to it under the Covenant of
            the League they were not complete, and it was evident that the power of the League was
            weakened. That which was to have been a grandiose parliament of the world is an empty
            tenement. The rule of law has not prevailed among the nations, but eventually it will do
            so; we shall have to return to it. The totalitarian regime, and these difficulties which
            now confront us, represent only one day in our evolution. Man cannot of himself make a
            new system. Hitler, by the process of race consciousness which he applied to his people,
            has done some good within his own country;, there are evidences of it. Had he confined
            himself to the betterment of his own people, had his policy not impinged upon
            neighbouring nations, he would have been a great man. In Germany, the people can go to
            the opera, indulge in sport, and travel for a matter of pence. I believe that our own
            people are entitled te similar privileges. That has been done by rather clever
            legislation within the country itself. But I see no good in the system. I have mentioned
            in- this. House the . evidence of terror and tension in Germany; it can be sensed there.
            Hitler has now threatened Europe and the world with domination; under the belief that he
            really is, as he has been moved to believe that he is, above ordinary humanity.
            Throughout Germany, in every workshop', there is a huge picture of him surrounded
            with laurel leaves.. There- are busts of him in. every hotel. When telephoning, one has.
            to say "Heil, Hitler" before commencing a conversation.. The officials prefer
            this condition to that liberty which- we sometimes despise and sometimes do not
            understand. The democracies are now definitely on- the defensive, and we are not yet
            sure where the balance lies. In the immediate future, Germany may have some successes
            because it has a well-organized, well trained and well-equipped war machine. I have been
            through its aircraft factories and know what a preponderance of aircraft it has had.
            Great Britain is now fast overtaking Germany in this respect, and eventually will win
            out. When all this misery is over, we shall inevitably return to the rule of law and
            reason between the nations. We have to take a wider view than the present horizon, and
            realize that we must revert to the ideal of the League of Nations if peace, justice and
            liberty are not to perish.</para>

                                .- I do not intend to canvass the position as it has been explained to the House
              by the Leader of the Opposition
                                <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline>
                                in
              relation to the attitude of the party to which I belong ; that has been too ably clone
              to need amplification by me. I rise on this, the first day on which the Parliament has
              met, because so many honorable gentlemen have expressed their willingness to see that
              the people of this country are not exploited by soulless profiteers, as they were in
              the last war. This House should demand from the Prime Minister
                                <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline>
                                - and I wheel it right up to him, not in
              any critical sense - an immediate statement as to what the Government intends to do
              with a view to preventing the exploitation of the people of Australia in the present
              time of war. To me, a man who will make use of wartime in order to exploit his
              fellowmen is very little better than the enemy whom one is fighting. I say that
              emphatically. The Government should treat him nearly as badly as it would treat the
              enemy. If we are to have a united front in. this country, if we are to mobilize the
              man-power and strengthen the morale of this nation - which will have to be done -
              there will be weak links if some persons become wealthy at the expense of the miseries
              of the general mass of the people. The experience of the last war is clear. What steps
              does the Government propose to take with a view to the prevention of profiteering? The
              Leader of the Opposition has said that in particular it should take over all things
              necessary for the manufacture of munitions and equipment for war purposes. There is a
              great combine and monopoly in this country. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company
              Limited, which will provide all the raw materials and the basic materials needed for
              the production of munitions and equipment, the other day made to its shareholders a
              free issue of shares to the value of ¬£4,500,000. Is the Government willing to
              allow that company to make additional profits on that paper issue of shares valued at
              ¬£4,500,000? The issue was made on the eve of war - almost on the declaration of
              war. The company got in early, as it always does, and as is the practice of the
              Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited. I am not accusing the Government of an
              intention to allow it to make additional profits by this paper issue. But I assure the
              Government that if this Parliament is kept open it will have to answer frequently to
              honorable members should such a contingency arise. We i ave had the spectacle of the
              woollen manufacturing industry - an industry established only because of war, to
              manufacture jumpers and other woollen goods - making a profit of ¬£2,000,000 over
              and above its capital outlay in the years 1915 and 1916. The patriotic
                                <inline font-style="italic">Sydney</inline>
                                <inline font-style="italic">Morning
                Herald</inline>
                                increased by from 200 per cent, to 300 per cent, its charges for
              "In Memoriam" notices inserted by the widows and mothers of husbands and sons
              who had been killed, and thus raked off huge profits. As a public man, and a spokesman
              for some of the people of this country, I want the Government to make a definite
              statement concerning its intentions, not simply to say "We do not believe in
              profiteering ". That is not sufficient. If we are entering this war, as the Prime
              Minister says - and I believe that we are - with all the horror that will come to us
              as the result of it, for the preservation of democratic institutions and the liberty
              of our people, nobody should make a penny out of it. When it is over, nobody should be
              richer, but many should be thousands of pounds poorer; the wealthier section of the
              community, particularly, should have a lot less. I myself would take up a gun to fight
              in this country if the necessity to do so arose. I have always said so. No country
              could be proud of a man who would not defend his own soil. That stands for every
              Australian. I believe that our womenfolk, too, would fight, if necessary. If that be
              the case, surely no mie is to be allowed to make profits Surely when the war is over
              we shall not have a huge structure of debt such as has been depressing the economy of
              this country throughout the years that have elapsed since the last war. These are
              matters which impel one to speak, because we have had the deadly experience of what
              has happened since the last conflict. Men who were soulless and bowelless almost as
              devils in hell have exploited their own people and their own nation; they have piled
              up wealth in the post-war years. I hope with all other honorable gentlemen that this
              hellish war will soon end, and that civilization will not be destroyed ; that we shall
              not see often such a picture as I saw in one of the newspapers to-day - mothers in
              France wearing gas-masks and carrying babies in a gas-proof bag, whilst poison-gas was
              ruined down on them from the air. That is what man's management has brought the
              world to. It is nearly lime that wc gave woman a. chance to see what she could do. At
              present this is all the criticism 1 have to offer. But I assure the Government that so
              long as .1. have a right to stand here and a voice to speak I shall stand and speak as
              loudly and as often as I can against any person being allowed to make even a penny
              profit out of the blood and tears of the people. I hope I shall not be forced to enter
              upon a campaign of that kind. My present remarks are not uttered in the critical
              spirit which I usually feel forced to adopt; but having the experience of the years
              from 1914 to 1918 behind me, as other honorable members have, I wish to urge the
              Government with all the force at my command to act quickly so that profiteering shall
              be prevented. It is too late to wait until public companies water their stock. If that
              is allowed to happen, they may be paying dividends of 2 per cent., 3 per cent, or 4
              per cent, on watered stock which, may represent actual dividends of anything from 20
              per cent, to SO per cent, on the original capital. Wc should not wait until
              balance-sheets have been faked and all the machinery of the profiteers has been put
              into operation. Steps should be taken at once to commandeer all sources of supply of
              war materials. Why should that not be done? If men are prepared to lay down their
              lives in the defence of their country, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited
              should be prepared to hand over its machinery, or at least allow the Government to put
              into operation a government accounting system in its works t&lt;&gt; ensure that
              profits shall not be made out of the provision of war equipment. This is not much to
              ask, for after the war is over, the company would have returned to it the whole of its
              assets, and all its interests could be protected in the meantime. This policy should
              also be adopted in connexion with annexes, clothing factories, and every other
              organization engaged in the supply of war materials of any kind. No one should be
              permitted to make even a farthing profit out of the tragedy of the awful days, and
              possibly years, we may have to pass through until the war ends.

                                We must all agree that from the very beginning of this crisis he
              has behaved in a manner which justifies us expressing pride in him. More than any
              other leader in the Empire, he has shown restraint and a desire for peace, mingled
              with a firm determination to sep that all Australians play their part honorably and
              well. As a. returned soldier who fought in the ranks in the last war, and as the
              representative of the constituency in which, primarily, the principal defence point of
              Australia lies, I express my endorsement of the. methods so far applied by the Prime
              Minister, and of the genera.) attitude that he has adopted through these difficult
              days. My electorate include-5 people of all classes. I have bushmen and workers, civil
              servants and business men, military and naval officers and men, and people of every
              other class in my electorate. I know that whatever may be their differences on local
              issues - and wo all have our differences - my constituents will stand firmly behind
              the Government. They are ah good Australians. They are the flower of this country, and
              they are prepared to fight for it. We British people feel proud because we are the
              only nation on earth which gives to every adult citizen the full rights of
              citizenship. We value our citizenship and we shall do our best to defend it, no matter
              how menial the service required, nor how arduous the tasks demanded of us.

                            This is an emergency in which we must submit to leadership. I have full confidence
            in our national leader, however much I may differ from him on minor Australian issues. I
            reserve my right to criticize when my judgment tells me I should criticize, and the
            right honorable gentleman has invited us to criticize, though naturally he desires
            constructive and not destructive criticism. One of the strong points in a democracy is
            that it achieves its leaders over long periods of trial and error. When crises come men
            are available for leadership who have fitted themselves for the office. Instinctively
            they are ready and fit to become national heroes. The man who became a national hero
            during the last war was, in the few days before the war broke out, one of the last men
            who would have been selected by the House for its leader. Yet we know that he proved a
            God-sent inspiration. His influence has not yet waned. His name is still a talisman to
            every man who served in the Australian Imperial Force. We all still term him, with great
            affection, " The Little Digger ". I refer, of course, to that Nestor nf this
            Parliament, the Right Honorable W. M. Hughes. However,, with youth, eloquence,
            restraint, and ability on his side,

            manufacture of munitions. I hope that those people will emphasize the word
            "should" and learn the meaning of equity. We are fighting to safeguard our
            political philosophy and to preserve our sense of the fitness of things. We shall fight
            until our democratic outlook has been fully translated into actuality. The Australian
            people are imbued with the knowledge that, in a democracy, men and women are not turned
            out in the one mould. It has been well said that nature makes a man and then breaks the
            mould. Because I believe in our individuality, I will support the Australian Government
            and the Empireuntil the last shot has been fired. So will every other Australian who is

                                .- The disaster that has befallen us has- been impending ever since the failure of
              the attempt to prevent war by economic boycott. That attempt was made during the
              Abyssinian war by the peace loving nations of the world. Since its failure it has
              become inevitable that, sooner o'r later, the world would he engaged in a struggle
              of this kind. We have been like the Greek ruler who feasted always beneath a sword
              which hung upon a single hair. At last the sword has fallen, and the people of
              Australia, as part of the British Commonwealth of Nations, ust be prepared for war. I
              emphasize our membership of the British Commonwealth of Nations. I believe that
              membership in that commonwealth is an excellent thing for Australia. I hope and
              believe that our membership in that commonwealth will be perpetual. Even on the ground
              of self interest I would say this, for I believe that the day of the small nation is
              past. The small nations of the world to-day owe their very existence to the
              protection, or goodwill, or indifference, of the larger nations. The larger nations
              may, at any moment they like, destroy the small nations of the world. I cannot imagine
              that Australia would be better off if it were in a position like Poland, or Latvia, or
              Estonia. The bonds that tie us to the British Commonwealth of Nations are not the
              much-belauded bonds of community of race. They are the bonds of community of
              institutions and democratic traditions and of a common belief in the possibility of
              settled differences by the peacefully expressed decision of the peoples. It is these
              bonds which bind together the Frenchmen of Quebec, the Dutchmen of Orang i a, and the
              people of British and other races who inhabit Australia and other British dominions to
              the countries in which they live. This membership of the British Commonwealth of
              Nations creates not only advantages but also responsibilities and liabilities for the
              members of the partnership. When the predominant partner in that commonwealth are at
              war the minor members of the partnership are exposed to attack. No one of us in
              Australia can ignore this war, and say that we need not prepare for war. It cannot be
              said that other nations hostile to this Commonwealth would leave us alone if we stood
              out of the war. If Australia wished to declare its desire to remain out of the war it
              should have done so before the war started and not after. I cannot conceive of any
              nation enjoying the advantages of membership of the British Commonwealth of Nations
              and reserving, at the same time, the right to declare its neutrality; and I cannot see
              how we could expect Britain's enemies to respect such a belated declaration of
              neutrality. Consequently, whatever we may think about the merits of this conflict, we,
              in Australia, us prepare for our own defence, and for the defence of our
              institutions. Looking al the merits of this struggle it is indicated, so far as we can
              see, that only in the greatest stress and urgency has the British Government gone to
              war. Whatever we may think of
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline>
                                and
              his policy it is perfectly clear that he did every thing possible to avert a collision
              with the German Government and the German Chancellor. He has been reproached for that,
              but whether it i= merit, or demerit, it is a fact that he did everything possible to
              put off the ultimate inevitable collision. Now our primary responsibility is to
              Australia. That has been stressed by everybody, and the Prime Minister
                                <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline>
                                himself well stressed it. We have to
              defend Australia and we hope that there will be no question of our doing anything'
              else.

                            spoke about the desirability of sending an expeditionary force and said that if we did
            not the men would go of their own accord. There is no objection to men going of their
            own accord, but there is great objection to the organization of an expeditionary force.
            The experience of the last war proves that after the first sprightly running of recruits
            to the forces enlistment slows down. Attempts are then made with all forms of pressure
            to induce men to go to the war, and when the various forms of military and economic
            pressure have lost their force there is an attempt to resort to legal compulsion. I
            believe firmly that voluntary recruiting for overseas service on the lines of the
            recruiting in the last war leads inevitably to a demand for conscription from} the
            parents, wives, and dependants of those who have already gone. Consequently, I oppose
            voluntary recruiting as being the first step towards compulsion. Naturally I oppose
            compulsion for overseas service. If the Prime Minister who has made a wise, magnanimous
            and statesmanlike speech to-day, preserves the spirit which animated that speech, he
            will not resort to anything that will create divisions in the people of Australia which
            will long survive this struggle.

                        <para>At the start of this trouble, just a.3 at the start of the struggle of 1914-18,
            there is a popular attempt to distinguish between German people and the German
            Government. It was said that the Great War was a war against the German Government and
            not against the German people; but when in the course of that war it was found that the
            people of Germany were behind the Government of Germany ' strongly and determinedly,
            people of German extraction in this, country had visited upon them the wrath of all
            ranks of the Australian community. I am perfectly satisfied from my reading and study
            that the active section of the German people is behind the German Chancellor. I think
            that the people of this country will be disappointed if they hope for any early
            breakdown of the German system, or any breakdown at all. There is iu the German people a
            feeling that they lost the last war largely because their morale was broken by appeals
            made to them by the allied statesmen and leaders that the German people would be treated
            liberally and magnanimously by the Allies if they revolted against the Kaiser. I do not
            believe that the German people will abandon their Chancellor. They believe that he is
            carrying out the policy essential to Germany. That being so, in my small capacity, I
            warn Australians against being provoked into any discrimination against the vast number
            of people of German extraction in this country. Those people have helped to develop this
            country. Great numbers of them came here to escape religious and political persecution
            and they have made a vast contribution to this country. Many of them hold important
            positions in the community. Many of them are men and women of value in all ranks of
            life, and I hope that this country will not blindly inflict its wrath upon them. This
            community will protect itself against seditious acts of aliens. It is entitled to do
            that and it is making provision for that. But it must avoid doing what it did in the last
            war - punishing the Australian-born German people. At the beginning of that war a vast
            number of German people in this country believed that the best thing that could happen
            would be the downfall of the then rulers of Germany, so that a social democratic system
            would follow its fall. But when there was an indiscriminate attack upon the
            Australianborn Germans in this country, vast numbers who started out thoroughly loyal
            and earnest were converted into being either lukewarm Australians or out-and-out
            sympathisers with the German Government. I do hope that our people will avoid that. I

            events that will try the people's nerves and I hope that the excellent spirit in
            which this struggle has commenced will not fade away. I hope that we shall not attack
            the liberty of the citizen or discriminate against those people who are descendants of
            strangers who came within our gates and have lived and been treated as our own.</para>

                                .- The White Paper before us plainly indicates that Great Britain enters this
              conflict with a clear conscience. Our one purpose is victory over the forces of
              aggression which face the democratic countries to-day. Just as Britain is calm,
              united, dogged and resolute in this crisis, so we in Australia, whose existence and
              freedom depend on the success of the British Empire, must be united and fully
              organized. In this connexion, I wish to refer briefly to the remarks of the Leader of
              the Opposition
                                <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline>

              not think it essential to-day that we should have a national government. I disagree.
              The Leader of the Opposition has clearly indicated that the Labour party represents a
              very large proportion of the people; and that being so, the Labour party should be
              represented along with the Country party, in a national government to face the present
              crisis.

                we are far removed from the centre of activities but we must be prepared for any
                emergency at any time. All Australians undoubtedly will unite in making common cause
                and in giving all possible service in this conflict. The same I should say applies

                            The question of profiteering has been referred to. No doubt the proposals which the
            Government will bring down will effectively check this evil, and I am one with those
            members of this House who would deal in no uncertain way with would-be profiteers. The

            must keep the wheels of industry moving. I believe many supplies will be cut off from
            this country, and I, therefore, suggest that there are many industries in Australia
            to-day which will expand in such a way that there will be full employment for many
            sections of the community. The Government, therefore, should take full cognisance of the
            need in calling up the Militia to ensure that those men who hold key positions, unless
            emergency otherwise demands it, will be retained, if possible, in those positions in a
            systematic way so that they may keep full employment and maintain essential services. I
            believe that the whole of the people of Australia are behind the Government in its
            policy in this crisis.

                                .- The document which the Prime Minister
                                <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
                Menzies)</inline>
                                placed before the House this afternoon containing the record of
              the negotiations between the Government of the United Kingdom and the German
              Government during the last few days before the outbreak of war is of profound interest
              to all of us. I am glad that the Prime Minister placed the matter before the House in
              that form, because we are now in possession of authentic information regarding the
              details of these most important negotiations. The document placed before us makes it
              clear that the German Government adopted methods in the handling of this affair which
              were utterly foreign to those to which we, and other people of British countries, are
              accustomed. We all expected that before action was taken, time would be allowed for a
              proper consideration of Germany's proposals, but that was not done. It seems
              clear, therefore, that the leader of the German nation had decided upon his course of
              action, and that he was determined to pursue that course no matter what proposals were
              submitted in the final stages. I have heard it argued that the guarantee of the
              British Government to Poland had had the effect of stiffening that country's
              attitude in the course of the negotiations. I have also heard it suggested that the
              Polish Government, for its part, was equally determined to force matters in its own way
              to a conclusion. That argument, however, seems to me to be discounted by the contents
              of the document placed before us, which refers to the German demands on Poland and the
              methods adopted in presenting them on the one hand and to the attitude and readiness
              of the Polish Government 'to negotiate on the other.

                        <para>The Prime Minister stated that responsibility for the present situation should not
            be placed entirely upon the German people. He suggested that we should be considerate in
            our judgment of them, and should rather place the responsibility upon their leader. It
            is reasonable, therefore, that we should ask ourselves why a government that according
            to the White Paper is capable of doing such 'things as the German Government has
            done should receive the support of the German people, who a re no less intelligent, and
            no less cultured than the peoples of other parts of the world. Their capacity for
            intellectual and industrial activity is well known.</para>
                        <para>It has been said over and over again", and it is fitting to repeat it, that this
            war is the outcome of the last war. It has been suggested to us in this debate that it
            is not desirable at this stage to make a close l' X alI]ination of the effects
            of the Versailles Treaty, but I believe that it is our duty to consider that treaty in
            relation to the events that are now taking place it i Europe. It is clear that the
            Versailles Treaty imposed on the German people a set of conditions which they
            undoubtedly resented. In fact, the sufferings which fell upon the German people as the
            result of that treaty were directly responsible for the rise of the very man against
            whom we are struggling now. It would be well for us to keep that thought in our minds.
            [ visited Germany in 1926, and made as close a study as I could of the people, and
            of the conditions prevailing throughout the country. I visited Krupps' factory at
            Essen, and noted that this huge concern, which had formerly been engaged in the
            production of armaments, was now manufacturing agricultural implements. It was pleasant
            to reflect that the people working there were now engaged- upon the production of
            implements for the benefit of mankind, instead of upon implements destined for their
            destruction.</para>
                        <para class="block">
                            The yards were full of agricultural machinery, and the mau who was
            showing me over the factory said how anxious they were to find a market for those
            products. When I was travelling through the German countryside I noticed that the people
            were still using the old methods of agriculture. They were still cutting the wheat with
            scythes, and raking it into bundles as they had done in olden times. I remarked on this,
            and pointed out to my guide that there seemed to be a great market in their own country
            for the agricultural machinery which they were manufacturing. His reply was that the
            people did not have the money to buy the machinery. As the result of the reparation
            payments imposed upon Germany by the Versailles Treaty, and subsequent reparative
            agreements, and of the currency inflation which had followed - whether of set purpose or
            not - the entire savings of the people had vanished overnight. It was pointed out to me
            that the employees at Krupps' establishment had, over a long period, built up a
            large benevolent fund for the support of aged workers, and those injured in the course
            of their employment. This fund, too, had vanished overnight as the result of inflation,
            and those who had depended upon it were left without means of support. I saw very few
            young people. They were scattered far and wide over the countryside looking for work.
            When I saw the hardships which the people were suffering due to the economic conditions
            which had been imposed upon them, and remembered that the country had been refused
            admittance to the League of Nations, it crossed my mind that the average citizen of
            Germany, and particularly members of the rising generation, must feel a deep resentment
            against those whom they regarded as responsible for their sufferings. As time went on
            they would inevitably condemn the existing regime in their country for not trying to
            free them from such conditions, and any one who rose up among them with a promise of
            better things, no matter whence he came, would be likely to win their support. That is
            why I am convinced that the conditions for which the Versailles Treaty was largely
            responsible contributed to the rise of the present leadership in Germany which now
            menaces the world. On looking back over the last few years it seems a sorry state of
            affairs. It is worth mentioning now so that we may see things as they are to-day in
            their proper perspective. When a war between two great nations is over, it is difficult
            to say who was the successful party to it. Somehow, I feel that no one can really claim
            to be successful ; every one seems to suffer almost equally. We must remember that the
            German people, like ourselves, have traditions and ideals, and that they love their
            homes and their country. We cannot crush a whole people like this out of existence, and
            therefore, the Prime Minister's reference to the German people as such is worthy of
            particular notice. We must be tolerant in our approach to these problems if we are to
            avoid creating a worse evil than that which we set ourselves out to destroy in the first
            place. Therefore, it is not inappropriate at this time to consider the Versailles Treaty
            and its effects. The Attorney-General
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline>
                            could no doubt recall some very interesting incidents in connexion with the final
            parcelling out of Europe after the last war, perhaps even in regard to the Polish
            Corridor, and the drawing of boundary lines between countries which cut off large
            numbers of people from their former associations. It appears to me to be an
            extraordinary thing to separate a large group of the people of a particular nationality
            from the country with which they were for long closely associated. It has been said here
            to-day that the problem of the Polish Corridor was a source of constant irritation to
            the countries concerned. Most of the Powers have felt that, at some time or another, an
            adjustment would have to be made, and no doubt the British Government was hoping that a
            peaceful solution of the problem could eventually be reached. The unfortunate condition
            of suffering and anxiety that has arisen from the last war is still fresh in our
            memories. As the right honorable member for Yarra
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
              Scullin)</inline>
                            said, none of us expected that in our lifetime we should again
            witness conditions embodying such wholesale destruction of human life as existed during
            that war. We did not think it possible that conflict could again arise within the short
            space of time of a little over twenty years. I do not know what the people of other
            countries knew or thought, but I suppose that, having regard to their position in Europe
            to-day and the struggles that have been continually taking place over past generations
            between Poland, Prance and Germany, involving change of frontiers and so on, there was
            in their minds and hearts a continual antagonism towards one another. I suppose it is
            difficult, in such circumstances to eradicate antagonism entirely from the minds of
            these people. When we endeavour to look at these difficult matters through their eyes,
            we almost despair of any real reconciliation between various countries whose differences
            have existed over such long periods.
                        </para>
                        <para>I believe, however, that the only basis upon which a peaceful solution of these
            difficulties can rest and. one likely to bring about real peace in the world is the
            betterment of these deep-rooted economic conditions, upon which the safety and security
            of mankind depend. Whether we are Germans, Britons. Italians or nationals of any other
            country, the one thing paramount in our minds is to provide for ourselves and those who
            depend upon us. In the minds of all people, irrespective of colour or race, that is
            instinctively their purpose in life; it is the real Christian and civilized spirit which
            is the guiding force in all our. deliberations. If we find in one country oppression
            based on low standards of living, economic insecurity which makes people doubt where the
            next meal is to come from, and no provision for old age and so on, the struggle to
            survive must present grave peril to the nation. I think that it is those internal
            conditions in Germany which brought about the rise of Hitler to power. So great were the
            difficulties confronting the German people that the people were willing to listen to
            anybody who claimed that he could free them from those difficulties and provide some
            form of security. In 1926, 1 did not think that the German people would ever lend
            themselves to the establishment of a dictatorship. I thought that their outlook was more
            determined and fixed in their existing form of government, that they were not fickle in
            these matters, and that, they would be very slow to change the methods that had existed
            so long. I am, therefore, firmly convinced that economic conditions in Germany have
            forced the people of that country to the change which has since taken place. These
            unfortunate conditions applied not only to the masses but also to the middle classes,
            people who had accumulated savings and parents who over the years had made provision for
            their children to secure a better standard of living and a better start in life- than,
            they themselves enjoyed. The middle classes had lost everything due to the collapse of
            the currency. That alone would be sufficient to give rise to a feeling that anything was
            better than their existing conditions. Therefore, they apparently proclaimed that they
            would follow anybody who could wreak vengeance on those whom they believed had been
            responsible for the unfortunate conditions under which they were living, and thus
            followed, may I repeat, the rise of Hitler to power.</para>

                question. It is argued on our side that they must be attributed to the Kaiser, of
                whom so much was said during that war, and who, it was said, should be hanged, but
                still lives on; but I do not think any honorable member will deny that they were
                brought about by the struggle for trade, the struggle to control markets which other
                countries occupied, the clash between vested interests in the different countries
                and to one set of capitalist interests striving to outdo another in order that,
                markets might be established or raw materials might be more easily procured. I
                believe that one of the finest speeches ever delivered by a British statesman was
                delivered by

                dispute. He said that the supply of raw materials was the burning question in which
                most countries in the world were interested and that it was desirable that the
                League of Nations should evolve some formula whereby all countries would have access
                to the raw materials they needed for their normal internal development.

                of raw materials by one country to the disadvantage of others. That was a remarkable
                contribution by a British statesman to a subject upon which many had given much
                thought but may not have had the courage to express their views lest other nations
                might be led to say that the British Empire had access to certain raw materials
                denied to other nations and that the other nations should be placed on an equal
                footing with Great Britain. I think that point is worthy of mention. In the struggle
                which has developed, all these elements have been involved.

                        </continue><para>In considering this matter, I have been influenced by the conditions which I saw in
            Germany subsequent to the war and by developments which have since taken place. Also we
            should not fail to keep before our minds the conditions that have prevailed in our own
            countries since the war. I believe that we in this Parliament cannot divorce ourselves
            entirely from accepting our responsibility for the economic conditions which exist in
            the world to-day. We talk about our democracy and the struggle we have had to maintain
            it. I put it to honorable members that this country, and others which claim to be
            democratic, have not by any means all the elements of democracy that they should have in
            order that their people may live, develop and prosper as they ought to do. Conditions in
            Australia in recent years, and in Great Britain too, have been such that many have
            suffered great privation through long periods of unemployment. If the financial systems
            of the democracies are such as to bring about unemployment, the question must surely
            arise in all democratic countries as to whether the form of government, they now
            support, the democracy of which they speak so much, is really a democracy, and whether
            some radical changes should not be made in order to prevent the continuance of this
            state of affairs. I am reminded very forcibly of the position even in New Zealand in
            this connexion. When the New Zealand Government recently went on the London market to
            raise money to meet loans falling due in Great Britain, contracted not by the present
            Government but by its predecessors, it was told by the London financiers that if it did
            not modify its social security programme it would not get the funds it needed, and, in
            effect, that funds required to provide adequate defence for the Dominion would not be
            forthcoming. That was a very serious matter and makes one wonder if, while such
            conditions prevail, we have a democracy. If the financiers of London are to say whether
            or not the people's will in New Zealand is to prevail, there is no freedom.</para><para>I wish honorable members to keep in mind the point that I have been attempting to
            make throughout my observations, that the whole problem of peace depends upon the
            maintenance of economic security for the people of all countries. I have said often that
            the real test of the question of the peace of the world must be settled in the homes of
            the people. In our civilization it works right back to that starting point. The home is
            the cornerstone of the nation. All that the people ask is that they have the right to
            live decently and to make provision for those who depend upon them. If we can establish
            peace and security in the homes of the people I am sure that upon that foundation will
            rest the peace and security of the world. Failure to provide peace and security in the
            homes of the people must give rise to dissatisfaction, which in turn seeks to overthrow
            the form of government that brings it about. This has happened in Germany, and will
            happen elsewhere. Peace in the home is the whole basic structure of peace in the world.
            It has been said that Hitler's rise was due to the efforts of the younger generation
            who felt that nothing was before them and that they had, as it were, no place to rest
            their heads. It is claimed that these young people gave to Hitler the incentive to go
            on. As the rise of Nazi-ism could start in Germany in that way, it could start
            elsewhere.</para><para class="block">Therefore, to that extent the peace of the world finally rests on the
            forms of government in various countries and the kinds of men who happen to control
            those governments. In these circumstances we have a man at the head of the German people
            determined to take the course of war who so far has had the backing of sufficient
            numbers to put his programme into operation.</para><para>I put it to honorable members that circumstances following the last war have left
            conditions in our own country of which none of us can be proud. Debts have been piling
            up; interest payments have had to be met; and increased taxation has had to be imposed.
            In the process of imposing this additional taxation industrial development has been
            curtailed, living standards have been reduced, the cost of living has been increased,
            and more scientific methods have had to be introduced to meet the problem. With the
            introduction of more scientific methods in industry less labour is engaged, and so this
            internal struggle is going on, resulting in great misery and suffering among our people.
            The debates in this Parliament since the war, and particularly during the last nine or
            ten years, have drawn attention to this unsatisfactory state of affairs. Therefore, if
            that which we were forced to face in the past must again be encountered, it is difficult
            to say what the position of the democracies will be when the present conflict
            terminates. When we ask the Government to provide money to help those in industrial
            difficulties we are told that it is impossible to obtain it. Regardless of the urgency
            of certain public works and the pressing needs of suffering humanity, we are told that
            funds are not available, but when war occurs there is no limit to the financial
            resources of the nation. Although I have expressed briefly these thoughts which have
            been expressed before, it is fitting that they should again be brought under the notice
            of those vitally concerned. I do not absolve myself from a small share of the
            responsibility which must fall upon me in these matters. It is a responsibility which we
            all must face. We are all anxious that many of the traditions we have built up in this
            country under our form of government - many of which we hold near and dear to us - will
            be retained. I would be loth to see the freedom which we exercise in the matters of
            religious liberties, speech and association, and many other rights we possess to be
            impaired in any way. We cannot allow circumstances such as have been experienced during
            the last nine or ten years to continue indefinitely.</para><para>Finally, we are in this struggle, and being in it we must endeavour to bring it to a
            successful conclusion. The Leader of the Opposition has stated clearly the policy of the
            Labour party, and he has said all that we feel is necessary. We are anxious to defend
            those privileges which I need not elaborate, but which are clearly in our minds. We know
            that the, man who commenced this struggle has now thrown practically everything aside
            with one objective in view. We have seen him change his opinions almost overnight,
            entering into a pact with a nation that he has scorned and repudiated, and, strange as
            it may seem, it was the policy of that nation which enabled him to rise to power in his
            own country. He is as changeable as the wind. What we have seen is simply a foretaste of
            what we may see later. We shall assist in the defence of this country and endeavour to
            marshal all its resources. Our manpower will be required for the defence of our own
            country, but we shall make foodstuffs and other requirements available when needed, and
            steadfastly stand by the policy of the Labour party which has been in operation for many
            years and played such an important part in the defence of this country. We are all
            anxious that the struggle will be of very short duration. I hope that the German people
            may be assisted to remove that form of government which now exercises so much power,
            authority and influence over them, and that in the final settlement the suffering of
            humanity will be reduced to a minimum and economic security will be provided for the
            peoples of all countries of the world.</para></speech>

                                . - I should not have intervened in this debate but for the ministerial office
              which I hold. Extraordinary unanimity has characterized the very notable series of
              speeches initiated by the right honorable the Prime Minister
                                <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline>
                                this afternoon. Nothing could be more
              satisfactory - if anything associated with this tragic hour can be satisfactory - than
              to find that honorable members on both sides of the House agree that our entry into
              the war was completely unavoidable and completely justified. I propose to deal with
              only one or two aspects of the subject, and to endeavour to show that the people of
              the British Empire are fighting, not only for a great abstract principle - for the use
              of negotiation as against force in the settlement of international disputes - but"
              also for their lives and the lands which they occupy. Before entering upon that phase
              of the question, I wish to refer to a few points that have been made by previous
              speakers, and particularly to one remark made by the Leader of the Opposition
                                <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin).</inline>
                                My colleagues and I were surprised to hear
              the honorable gentleman say that the Government had indicated - I think in some
              statement made last night - that during this war, no expeditionary force would be sent
              overseas. I know of no such statement having been made by any member of the
              Government,, or of any indication that such a statement would be made. The Government
              has not yet seriously discussed the question of an overseas expeditionary force. As we
              see the position, our first duty to ourselves and to the Empire is to ensure, so far
              as lies within our power, the safety of Australia. When Australia is considered to be
              adequately protected we shall be in a better position than we are at present to assess
              the strength of our enemy, and the nature of the conflict before us. As the position
              becomes more clearly denned the Government will, guided by circumstances, evolve and
              announce its proposals with respect to Australia's further participation in the
              war. Further than that, it is not the intention of the Government to express any
              opinion with respect to the future. We are dealing first with the safety of Australia.
              We shall then observe how the war develops, evolve our programme and submit it to the
              people of the Commonwealth.

            of the war German nationals in Australia, Germans who are Australians by birth or by
            naturalization, carry on as normally good citizens, I am confident that they will not be
            interfered with in any way by this Government, and I doubt very much whether they will
            be interfered with by Australian citizens. But if they engage in any kind of activities
            or propaganda detrimental to the safety and interests of Australia, they must take the
            consequences.

                        <para>I should like to emphasize not only to the members of this House, but also to the
            whole of the people of Australia, that in this war we are fighting for our own homes and
            lives, and, indeed, for the preservation of our own nationhood. In a speech which I
            delivered in this chamber some months ago, I ventured the opinion that if Germany were
            allowed by force to transgress eastwards into or through Poland into the Ukraine and
            also further, into south-eastern Europe, there would sooner or later come a time when,
            with greatly increased strength, it inevitably would turn westward to the imminent
            danger of France, Holland, Denmark and the whole of the western seaboard of middle
            Europe.</para>
                        <para>I should like to explore further my earlier remarks on this phase of the probable
            international developments. In 1934 Germany had a population of 66,000,000 and was
            regarded as one of the greatest industrial countries of the world. Since then it has
            acquired, by brute force, Austria with its 6,000,000 people and Czechoslovakia with a
            population of 13,000,000, bringing the total population of what is now regarded as
            Greater Germany from 66,000,000 less than two years ago to upwards of 85,000,000. If
            Germany had succeeded in its campaign against Poland - but for the intervention of Great
            Britain and France it must have succeeded at a very early date - and if Poland had
            remained in permanent possession of that country, Germany's population would have
            increased by a further 32,000,000 to a total of 118,000,000. Without the intervention of
            Great Britain and France in the present conflict, Poland would certainly have been
            overrun just as Czechoslovakia and Austria were overrun, and then nothing could have
            saved Roumania, Hungary, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. Indeed, the whole of south-eastern
            Europe would have come under German domination. The addition of 9,000,000 people from
            Hungary, 19,000,000 from Ron mania, 6,000,000 from Bulgaria and 15,000,000 from
            Yugoslavia would, following the success of the Polish campaign had Great Britain and
            France not intervened, have increased the population of Greater Germany to about
            170,000,000. So much for potential man-power.</para>
                        <para>I am not for a moment suggesting that all of these people, many of them completely
            foreign or even of alien race to the Germans, would have made cheerful and willing
            soldiers in the German Army. I point out, however, that man-power does not consist
            solely of men of fighting age. There are among that number many men who, although not of
            fighting age, would, in the Greater Germany which I have envisaged, have been valuable
            employees in some of the great services of war. But apart from man-power, either for the
            fighting forces or for employment behind the lines in the thousand and one works
            indispensable to a great army, there is the great industrial might of the territory
            which Germany has already acquired and other lands which, no doubt, would have been
            absorbed following a successful Polish campaign. For example there is the great Skoda
            armament factory in Czechoslovakia, one of the first arsenals in the world and to-day
            one of the greatest armament-producing centres. The Germans incorporated these great
            works and many other important war industries as a gift without the loss of a single
            life.</para>
                        <para class="block">Should the German campaign in Poland succeed - and 1 repeat that but
            for the intervention of Britain and France it would undoubtedly have succeeded - the
            Greater Reich would absorb a further 32,000,000 of man-power for various uses as well as
            great industrial reinforcements to that already vast industrial might. It would then be
            not difficult to continue the expansion eastward to the oil-fields and great granaries
            of Roumania, and on to the south-eastern countries of Europe.</para>
                        <para>I am not now conjuring up something fanciful; I am speaking of something which must
            have become a reality unless we, the British Empire with our grand French allies, had
            engaged by one means or another, however great the cost, to halt this march of armed
            forces across the face of Europe. What would have been the. next phase in this great
            campaign of Hitlerism? I myself have no doubt on the point. The particular objective of
            Germany under Hitler is, as was the objective of Germany under the Kaiser in 1914, the
            British Empire. One day, sooner or later, with greatly increased mobilized forces,
            Germany would have turned westward. And it would have turned westward with a force
            which, splendid as is the fighting strength of France, and mighty as is the fighting
            defensive capacity and the industrial and financial power of Great Britain, must have
            imperilled the security of both countries.</para>
                        <para>I can see no alternative to the outcome of Nazi aggressiveness but to fight it
            to-day, and fight to a finish. It requires very little imagination to realize that if
            Great Britain were to fall into danger the position of Australia must become perilous.
            We have grown to nationhood by the grace of the British Navy. The safety of this country
            - and this will remain true for many years to come as Asia develops - depends on Great
            Britain. Australia is not to-day able to defend itself and will not be in a position to
            do so until it has a population of something like 20,000,000 or more.</para>

                            spoke very wisely to-day when he said that the day of the little nations had passed.
            Unhappily it is true that the little nations are no longer safe. Australia would not,
            and could not, be safe alone in this world. Were Hitler to succeed in Europe, the future
            of this country would be very dark indeed. I approach this subject particularly from
            this aspect because I think it is highly desirable that the people of Australia should
            not fall into the error of believing that we are on the outskirts of the conflict and
            that the war will affect only the peoples of Europe. I should like the

            vitally as it concerns the people of Great Britain. I should like them to face the
            truth, and the truth of the present situation is that should Britain and France fail in
            this war and go down, we shall go down with them. In other words, our commitment in
            regard to this war is a very far reaching and grave one.</para>

                            I should like to believe that we could play our part in this conflict merely by

            and by entering into an agreement, as we hope to do, to sell our surplus primary
            production to Great Britain, not oven at current prices, but as the right honorable

            rising prices. I should like to think that that is all this country will have to do in
            this war. In my opinion we shall be a thousand times fortunate if wc come through this
            conflict with no more sacrifices than are indicated in that suggestion.

                                Recently I have been
              living at a rather expensive hotel, and I have discussed with a great number of people
              the question of Australia's part in this war. In my conversations I have asked
              these people whether or not they considered that a man's life was worth ¬£1 a
              day. Without a single exception these people - liberals, conservatives, and radicals -
              have said that they thought that it was worth more than that. If we want volunteers,
              let us pay them at least ¬£1 a day which, in my opinion, is no more than a fair
              return for the risks which they would be called upon to take. I, and many other
              honorable members on this side, have frequently had brought under our notice
              distressing cases of returned soldiers who have been unable to receive compensation
              for disabilities on the ground that they were not due to war service. What an
              absurdity! These mcn were examined by the highest qualified medical men in Melbourne.
              They were in no way to blame if they were passed as fit. They willingly offered their
              lives for their country, and they should not now be penalized when their health has
              been shattered owing to war service. We are not justified in saying to them that their
              complaints have not been due to waT. I challenge any medical man to say definitely
              that a man could not be affected by such a terrible ordeal as the last war.

                                one of the greatest surgeons employed by the
              Great Western Railway in Great Britain, once said, "If you find symptoms for which
              you cannot account, go into your patient's history and ask him if he has ever been
              in a railway accident. If he has, you can put his complaint down to the effects of
              that accident whether it happened 20 or 30 years before." With how much greater
              justification, therefore, can we not conclude that a man's health would be
              seriously injured over the years as the result of war service? Any man who is accepted
              for active service should be accepted as healthy, and the Government should always be
              prepared to do its duty by him should his health deteriorate in later years. That is
              the law in the United States of America, in which respect that country offers an
              excellent example to the whole of the world.

                            I claim a fairly extensive knowledge of the German people who reside in Melbourne.
            For close on 30 years I was a member of the Deut st cher Turn- Verein in that city. I
            sympathize greatly with the German people. When he was Minister for Defence
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline>
                            Pearce very cowardly, in my opinion, closed
            that society's gymnasium and refused to allow those people to hold their Christmas
            treat in it. At that time the Christmas celebrations were the only thing which
            corresponded to a great joyous festival in Melbourne. It was the custom of this club,
            each Christmas, to erect a giant Christmas tree reaching almost to the roof of the
            gymnasium, and to laden the tree with presents from which every child received a gift.
            It was customary to donate the proceeds from these functions to the hospitals, but at
            this time, these people offered to devote all of the proceeds to the Red Cross. The
            members of this club included many sons of German fathers who had volunteered for active
            service in the Australian forces. What more could they do to help this country? However,
            the Government closed down that club
                            <inline font-style="italic">which</inline>

            never since been, re-opened because a later government took over the building at its own
            price. It seized this property and offered to pay ¬£7,000, n paltry sum barely
            sufficient to meet the mortgage on the building. At that time, a representative of one
            of the strongest religious denominations in Australia was prepared to offer ¬£10,000
            for the building but the Government refused to allow the sale to take place. Eventually,
            the Government advanced ¬£8,500 for the property. It robbed that club to which, I
            may say in passing, I owe in some measure my long life.

                            Tha heart of Germany was broken in the fast war by the entry of the United States of
            America into the conflict. Two million men were landed from the United States of America
            at the scene of battle with the loss of only 200: If Germany had been backed up by
            Russia, as I am afraid it will be on this occasion, it would have beaten us. Those young
            GermanAustralians who fought voluntarily for ns= in. the last war fought well for this
            country. I believe that to-day the German Government has every German in Australia
            earmarked. Consequently for any German who should now volunteer to fight in the service
            of this country and be taken prisoner, it would be a case, of the Lord help him. A true
            democracy exists among the German residents in Australia. To-day the Central Executive
            of the Social-Democratic party of Germany is carrying, on in Paris. Reports which I have
            received from that quarter reveal that the majority of Germans are very dissatisfied
            with the rule of Hitler. Just as the slave in ancient days was kept at work by the whip
            of cruelty, i*o to-day many Germans are being subjugated by the whip of pain and
            penalty. If it
                            <inline font-style="italic">he</inline>
                            true, as was reported the other
            day, that placards, " Down with Hitler ", were posted up in Berlin I admire the
            courage of the people who were responsible for such action. I hope that the report i*
            true, and, furthermore, that none responsible for it will be apprehended. Democracy will
            rise again in Germany. 1 believe that the majority of the German people are earnestly
            hoping for the re-birth of democracy in their country. The formation of an army composed
            of men who have been driven from Germany would be more than justified. In that way we
            could secure thousands of trained men at no expense whatever. All we should need to do
            would be to offer them a home. In this connexion I refer particularly to those of the
            great Jewish race, the race which gave us Christ, who to-day are suffering persecution.
            However, we do not consider it fit to offer them a home, although so many of our acres
            are unoccupied. Australia has always been looked upon with envy by land-hungry .
            nations. Despite this fact we have been foolish enough to take over control of a section
            of the Antarctic, an area one-third the size of Australia. That area to-day is certainly
            covered with ice and snow, but should minerals be found there it will prove a most
            valuable prize. Already it is the home of valuable whale fisheries. When I opposed1 in
            this chamber the proposal that Australia take over control of those regions, I was asked
            what I should do if I had my way in the matter, and I replied that I should ask the
            League of Nations to hold that territory for the benefit of the world. and thus give
            every country a chance in those regions. However, legally we acquired it, and thus gave
            another argument to the land-hungry nations against Australia. The- vast Northern
            Territory is practically unoccupied.

                            Grey
            surveyed the north-west of Australia and spoke of it favorably. With so much of our
            country unoccupied, we should not hesitate to attract persecuted Jews to settle here.
            They have done marvellous work in cultivating large tracts in Palestine. Furthermore,
            such settlers would provide an army sufficient to prevent any invader from landing on
            our shores. These people would be only too willing to enter into a bond with Australia
            in return for such a home, as did the Spanish and Portuguese Jews when they sought
            refuge in England under Cromwell. Cromwell, however, imposed very strict conditions upon
            them. No race has suffered so much persecution as the Jews. They have fought for their
            rights, as every race has done. In Czarist Russia, no Jewish girl could study at the
            universities unless she received special permission, which was signified by the wearing
            of a yellow badge. That was only a trifle compared with the other indignities inflicted
            upon the Jews. To-day, under the- Soviet Government, Jews have formed the small republic
            of Biro Bid jan, which has a population of 60,000, where they can observe their own laws
            and customs in peace. There, also, they have proved themselves to be excellent
            agriculturists.

                            In the present war, we must take every precaution to prevent exploitation on the
            part of profiteers whom the honorable member for Werriwa
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
              Lazzarini)</inline>
                            so effectively held up to our scorn and ridicule. In the days even
            before gunpowder was invented, one nation, Borne, with splendid discipline, exercised
            more control over Europe than Germany wields to-day or can ever hope to wield. In those
            days profiteering was unknown in a time of war. No profiteer was to be found among the
            inhabitants of a beleaguered city because all of the defenders knew that if their city
            fell they could only meet with death by crucifixion or slavery. Consequently, the rich
            man did his best to help his fellow-citizen no matter how lowly the latter might be. Let
            us contrast this state of affairs with our experience in our own cities in the Great
            War. Of the dead speak nothing but good. I shall not mention the name of the particular
            person to whom I refer, but during the Great War, he had a contract with the Victorian
            Government to supply iron needed for our railways. He threw in his contract and paid the
            penalty, and then immediately charged for the goods which the Government had to obtain
            at prices from 200 per cent, to 400 per cent, in excess of a fair price. Such a man in
            ancient days would have been put up against a wall and shot, or he would have been
            crucified. The honorable member for Werriwa pointed out how the great Broken Hill
            Proprietary Company Limited had distributed ¬£4,500,000 in bonus shares. As chairman
            of a committee of inquiry on one occasion, I ascertained that when a dividend of 5 per
            cent, had been paid on the total share issue it represented a return of about 50 per
            cent, on the original unwatered share list - in one year the return rose to 60 per cent,
            on the unwatered shares - and that is what the dividend should be calculated on; the
            Taxation Department should have the right to issue its assessment on that figure. It may
            be contended that if 20s. a day were paid to our soldiers we should never be able to
            balance our budget.

            it compels Australia to pay interest on the amount which the Commonwealth has borrowed.
            In reply to one question which I asked on the floor of this House, I was informed that
            in respect of every ¬£100 of interest that Australia sent to the United States of
            America it was fined ¬£69, as the result of the cursed system of exchange which
            operated between England and Australia and England and the United States of America at

                            On the 6th October, 1938, I asked certain questions upon notice with a view to
            ascertaining the cost of aeroplanes and submersibles, and I learned that the cost of one
            ironclad - upwards of ¬£10,000,000 of our money - would then have provided us with a
            certain number of submersibles and aeroplanes. The questions that I asked were as

            Primary trainer type, ¬£2,000; fighter type, ¬£9,000; bombers, from ¬£9,000

                        <para class="block">We can obtain those from America. The cost of one ironclad would ring
            Australia with aeroplanes round the whole of its coast line, and they would be far more
            effective than a battleship. I do not think that any admiral would care to approach the
            coast of Australia if he knew that there was a fleet of 500 of those aeroplanes able to
            meet him, or if there were submersibles to defend our shores against invasion. The same
            " Jackie " Fisher whom I have already mentioned - God rest him, he has passed
            along - stated that a land defended by submersibles was impregnable. I do not know that
            we want a better authority.</para>
                        <para>I should like to see the interest on loans limited to 6 per cent. Every honorable
            member of this House knows that during the last war the Commonwealth Bank did not charge
            more than 6 per cent., and so prevented the private banks from raising their rates of
            interest. In every country during war-time the banks pile up interest. That was
            prevented in the last war by the action of the Commonwealth Bank. That institution is
            not now so useful as a people's bank as it was then, because unfortunately its
            policy has been changed and been made less democratic. But this Government could say
            that interest is obtainable at the Commonwealth Bank at a rate not higher than 6 per
            cent., and that would prevent its being raised, because no bank if it were to raise"
            its rates could compete against the Commonwealth Bank. Mortgagees also should be
            protected. Take, for example, a mortgage on a property valued by good valuers at, say,
            ¬£3,000, on which ¬£2,000 is advanced; and remember that the lender of the money
            can demand two or three valuations of the property. If, unfortunately, the present war
            should go against us and our credit should go down, the value of that property would
            decrease, and upon ultimate sale it might realize only ¬£2,000. The lender could
            keep the whole of that sum. Even if it did not realize the full amount of the mortgage,
            he could follow the mortgagor up. Victoria, I believe, has prevented that. Why not allow
            that ¬£2,000 to be reduced proportionately? If the property realized only
            ¬£1,500, the lender would have to be satisfied with ¬£1,000, whilst the owner
            would receive ¬£500 to enable him to make a fresh start. Something should be done to
            ensure that there is fair play; the mortgagee or lender should suffer as well as the
            mortgagor, or borrower; the loss should not fall solely on the borrower.I urge the
            Government to bring in some measure to make provision along those lines.</para>
                        <para>I hope that I may live to see the end of this war, and that we shall be the victors.
            On this occasion, for goodness sake let it be made plain that we do not want to injure
            the people themselves! Let' us follow the splendid example that was followed in
            South Africa, when the Boers were beaten to their knees and were hopeless and helpless,
            and we gave them back their freedom and their voting power. If we conquer this German
            nation, let us show them that they are still children of the same great human family,
            fashioned, so we are told, in God's likeness.</para>
                        <para>
                            Why do we make life a curse simply on account of the cursed interest? Had I the
            power, I would induce the Government to do away with all interest during the war. Let
            the Government incur any expense it likes, because it will never pay back what it
            borrows. It has been estimated that the gold raised in Australia since it was first
            discovered would be worth, at the present value of gold, over ¬£1,200,000,000; yet,
            with the exception of a few paltry millions, it is all gone, and we now have a debt of
            ¬£1,200,000,000. I know that I shall not live to see that debt repaid, and I doubt
            whether any other honorable member will, even if his life should extend beyond mine. I
            feel on my shoulders the shadow of this terrible thing that has happened, and I cannot
            help wondering why God in
                            <inline font-style="italic">his</inline>
                            kindness does not
            imbue men with more humanity towards one another. Even some churches have been foolish
            enough to advocate war. I can only pray that God will give them sense, and that at the
            end their wisdom will be greater than it is now. Any one who studies the question cannot
            help feeling that no humanity is being shown towards certain races in Europe to-day,
            including the Germans who, under the lash of pain and punishment, are held in control by
            that beast Hitler.

                                .- I had not intended to say much, but I have been moved to do so by some of the
              observations that have been made during the course of this debate. I should first like
              to add my support to that of others who have spoken, of the attitude of the
              Government, and of the Prime Minister
                                <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.

                                in particular, in the present crisis. Without waiting for
              Parliament to assemble, the right honorable gentleman expressed very truly the
              feelings of the people of Australia. If any doubt of that had existed, it was
              dispelled upon the assembling of this Parliament when, from all sides of the House,
              there was unanimous endorsement, not only of the action which this Government took,
              but also of the endeavours of the British Government to preserve the peace of the
              world. I have heard no suggestion that this is a capitalist or trade war, or that
              Britain has entered into it with an ulterior motive. I think that it is generally
              recognized as a war for the defence of liberal principles, and for the preservation of
              political and religious freedom and the inherent rights of the humblest individual. As
              the Prime Minister has said, we march with truth by our side, and truth must prevail;
              but truth will not prevail unless accompanying it are determination, will power,
              organization, and the spirit of sacrifice that will be required of this nation in the
              days to come. In

            shoulder to shoulder, in the belief that they have truth on their side, and ideals worth
            defending. Between the clash of these two ideologies it is apparent that we are
            confronted by a dreadful war of long duration, the outcome of which nobody can foresee.</para>

                            As speakers on both sides of the House have declared it is our manifest duty to
            maintain the security of Australia, and thus assist in the general defence of the
            British Commonwealth of Nations, I submit that the defence of Australia involves
            something more than passing resolutions in Parliament or providing the necessary funds
            for armaments and munitions. I believe that in the course of this war, with the constant
            variation of successes and failures on both sides, and the attitude of certain nations
            still undefined, Australians may be called upon to defend their own shores. We should
            not lose sight of that possibility, and we should leave nothing to chance. We should bc
            prepared for any eventuality and any sacrifice. It will be necessary for us to have
            sufficient man-power ready to repel any attack upon this country. I have heard various
            speakers in this Parliament say that, if Australia were attacked, they would be willing
            to assist in defending it ; but I contend that we should prepare to defend our hearths
            and homes before the necessity is upon us. We are confronted by a combination of nations
            that have been preparing for years to meet the present emergency.

                            which is the German bible of to-day, shows

            no fighting spirit. On page 131 of his book he said -

              fact that England did not possess a national army proved nothing, for it is not the
              actual military structure of the moment that matters but rather the will and
              determination to use whatever military strength is available. England has always had
              the armament which she needed. She always fought with those weapons which were
              necessary for success. She sent mercenary troops to fight as long as mercenaries
              sufficed; but she never hesitated to draw heavily and deeply from the best blood of
              the whole nation when victory could be obtained only by such a sacrifice.</para>

            I have heard it suggested to-day that Australia should, take no military part in this
            war, that it could not afford to send men overseas, and that it would he against our
            interests to do so. The course of events may prove that statement to be true, but at
            this juncture it is too early to determine what our course of action should be. Although
            we may be kept busy in our own country, if we are in a position to render more service
            to Britain than Argentina and Mexico, which are equally willing to sell foodstuffs to
            Britain, we should be prepared to do more than those neutral countries. Many young
            Australian airmen would, no doubt, be ready to give effective help to the British

                        <para class="block">Treaty which tend to put the British Empire in the wrong. I think that
            Germany got a better deal than those countries which were ravaged during the last war.
            Hardly a home in Germany was destroyed, and scarcely a monument or building was
            interfered with, but in Prance, Belgium and Poland 1,500,000 homes were destroyed.
            Germany was said to hav¬´ been harshly treated, although its reckless ambition cost
            the world about 6,000,000 human lives. The economic problems of Germany in 1930 or 1932
            were not materially greater than those of Great Britain. There wore then 3,000,000 or
            4,000,000 unemployed in Great Britain, and there wore 6,000,000 or. 8,000,000 in
            Germany; but Germany has enjoyed a fair share of the world's trade during the last
            few years. It stood third on the list in 1936, following the United States of America,
            with internal and external trade valued at ¬£674,000,000, compared with France's
            total of ¬£478,000,000. During the last three or four years Germany has boasted that
            there have been no unemployed in that country. It is true that certain reparations were
            exacted from Germany, but, when it was found to be unable to pay the sums demanded under
            the Dawes and Young plans, a mora torium was granted, and nothing has been paid by
            Germany since about 19.30. We have no occasion to apologize for the Versailles Treaty.
            The Allies concluded a peace on terms more generous than would, have been accorded to us
            if we had been in the same position as Germany. Therefore, if the will of this country
            i.= to be organized to the utmost, we must have a. profound conviction not only in the
            2-ighteousness of our cause but also in our ability to see the war through. We have a
            very long struggle ahead. I ato convinced that there will be no profiteers at the end of
            this war, because every man who now has any substantial possessions will find that he
            will have to give almost the lot to the State for the prosecution of the war. To begin
            seriously considering at this stage what should be done with profiteers is, I think, a
            little premature. 1 have no doubt some individuals will try to take advantage of this
            situation. . That always happens in a time of war. But T am quite satisfied that the
            needs of our community awd of the- whole nation will be. such as to demand, before this
            conflict is ended, the surrender of practically all out wealth. That is my conviction.</para>
                        <para>Wc are clashing with 90,000,000 people who are just as determined as the 90,000,000
            people on our side. Any one who imagines that the people of Germany are disaffected
            against the present Nazi regime cannot have studied tha progress of events during the
            last two or three years. It is all very well' to say that we are fighting one man.
            Actually we are fighting from 60,000,000 to 30,000,00*) people imbued with the Nazi
            spirit. Even in this country there are Germans who are Nazi to the backbone, yet they
            have accepted the protection of the British flag. It is ridiculous. to suggest that we
            are fighting only a few men such as Hitler, Goering and Goebel's. Hitler has shown
            himself to be the arch demagogue of the agc and one of the greatest organizers of the
            century. He has been able to swing the German people behind him in a way that no other
            leader has been able to swing his people behind him.</para>
                        <para>I sincerely hope that we inlay not find our task too great for us, but short of a
            surrender by one side or the other I can. *ee- nothing except a long conflict ahead. T
            am- quite convinced that the democracies of Great Britain and Franco, and, of course, of
            this country, will make great sacrifices rather than surrender the institutions which
            they have enjoyed for so long. If the same determination exists on the other side a
            prolonged struggle is certain. Therefore we shall have to call upon every nerve centre,
            use every bit of organizing skill that we possess, and give every minute of our time in
            preparation for war and in actual war if we aTe to win through. it lias been suggested,
            and logically, that for the time being our policy should be "Business as usual".
            If any other policy were adopted at the moment it would lead to the disorganization of
            business and a great deal of unemployment, and would confront the Government with grave
            problems. I remind honorable members, however, that the slogan in Great Britain at the
            commencement of the last war was " Business as usual ". Unfortunately it had the
            effect of causing Great Britain to lose about twelve months in preparing for the war
            because people thought that the struggle would not last long. That was a very serious
            loss, and the British people greatly regretted, after a year or two, that they had
            adopted that slogan. Nevertheless, we must carry on our affairs in a normal way until wo
            can adjust ourselves to our changed conditions.</para>
                        <para>I sincerely trust that this Parliament will not be called together more often than
            is necessary. It must be recognized that if ministers are to prosecute their jobs as
            thoroughly as they should do they must give the great bulk of their time to
            administrative work. Like other honorable members, I appreciate the privilege of being
            able to express my views in this House but I am of the opinion that, when all is said
            and done, the serious work of waging this war will fall upon the shoulders of those
            entrusted with ministerial responsibility. Therefore, except for the occasions when it
            is imperative that Parliament should meet, ministers should be permitted to give as much
            of their time as possible to their administrative work. They should not he required to
            attend here merely to answer questions and listen to debates. Undoubtedly Parliament
            will have to assemble at reasonably frequent intervals. It is of the essence, of
            democracy that the representatives of the people shall be informed from time to time of
            what is going on, and shall be afforded an opportunity to express their views *, but to
            keep Parliament in practically continuous session, as has been suggested, would be
            detrimental to our efficiency in waging this war.</para>
                        <para>All sections of the people of this country will, I am certain, feel gratified that,
            now that the test has come, no member of this Parliament has voiced serious dissent from
            the course of action that has1 been taken. " It must follow, therefore, that if
            Parliament is satisfied - and it has shown itself to he almost unanimously satisfied -
            with the justice of our cause, we should be ready to do our utmost to assist the
            Government to prosecute the war to a successful issue. The waging of a war depends on
            something more than pious resolutions. It depends upon the Government receiving full
            assistance in all matters of detail. It may be that at a later stage we shall need to
            discuss the Government's actions in detail and there may be some difference of
            opinion; but I appeal to honorable members of the Opposition and, in fact, to all
            honorable members, not to hold fast to preconceived ideas which may need to be set aside
            when the position can be examined in the light of the circumstances of this emergency.
            The time has passed for the present, even though it may return later, for us to adhere
            too closely to party shibboleths and slogans.</para>

              consequence of that attack that Great Britain has declared war on Germany and that the

                                <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline>
                                lias declared, on
              behalf of Australia, that a state of war exists. We have to face the facts. An
              obligation rests on every citizen of Australia to see that the shores of this country
              arc adequately defended. But I think I shall be correct in saying that, despite the
              jingoistic speech just delivered by the honorable member for Richmond
                                <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony),</inline>
                                the motives that actuate various members
              in opposing Hitler vary greatly. I shall not be led away by the speeches of honorable
              members on the Government benches. We have been told that the sole motive of this war
              against Hitler is to defend democratic institutions and the freedom and liberty of the
              people. As a matter of fact the more cunning and experienced members of the
              Government, in their very cleverly worded speeches, might have led us into forming
              that opinion. But now that we have heard the speeches of the Minister for External
              Affairs
                                <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Henry Gullett)</inline>
                                and the honorable
              member for Richmond, we can see that the motives of different honorable members should
              be examined more closely. The honorable member for Richmond cited numerous passages
              from a work by Herr Hitler, but I remind him that a great deal of the responsibility
              for the strength of Hitler to-day rests with British imperialists. After the last war
              a socialist government was set up in Germany, but it did not receive any help in its
              work of reconstruction from the British financiers. Nor when that government was
              overthrown and Herr Hitler came into power in Germany were any protests made by
              British imperialists, or by the alleged freedom-loving members of the Government of
              this country, against the attacks launched by Herr Hitler upon the free institutions
              of Germany and its trade union movement. There were not concerned one bit about these
              attacks. The honorable member for Richmond referred to the violation of the Treaty of
              Versailles. Did not Britain itself connive at the violation of that treaty when it
              entered into a naval agreement with Germany in conflict with the terms of the treaty,
              and when it assisted in the re militarization of the Rhineland and the re-arming of
              Germany? According to the Minister for External Affairs, so long as the Germans were
              prepared to move east, with the probability that they would eventually come into
              conflict with the Soviet Republic, there was no need to be concerned. The honorable
              gentleman said that what the Government was afraid of was that Germany, or Herr
              Hitler, would not be satisfied with that, but would follow conquest with conquest
              until such time as the integrity of the British Empire was in danger. The Minister
              indicated quite clearly that the object of this war was not solely to preserve the
              independence of Poland or to protect the free institutions of various countries.

                            I do not agree with the honorable member for Richmond that we are fighting
            90,000,000 enemies in Germany. Many of the unfortunate people of Germany, who have had
            their civil liberties destroyed, have been dragooned into going to war because they have
            not the power to resist. According to the honorable member, we must regard every one of
            those Germans as enemies. Evidently that view is not generally shared by those in
            authority in Great Britain, because if we can believe the reports published in the press
            from day to day - and I must say here that we have need to examine such reports very
            closely indeed, in order to ascertain which are true and which are merely propaganda -
            the purpose behind the dropping of millions of pamphlets from British planes flying over
            Germany is to explain to the German populace the reason why we are at war, and thereby
            encourage them to resist the war plans of Hitler. Evidently Great Britain has more faith
            in the German people than the honorable member for Richmond has. I sincerely hope that
            Hitler will be defeated, but not for the reasons advanced by honorable members opposite.
            I regard Hitler as a man who has used his power to take away the freedom of his own
            people and to endanger the freedom of peoples in other countries. The Prime Minister
            said that he would welcome suggestions from the Opposition. His Government, which has
            never been before the people, has not an absolute majority in this chamber. At each a.
            time as this we should have in control of the Commonwealth a government which the
            majority of the people trust, but that is not the case at present, as anti-Labour
            governments have an unsavoury record for attacks upon civil liberties in the times of
            peace, and the opportunities for such attacks are immeasurably greater in time of war.
            The honorable member for Richmond quoted at some length from Hitler's
                            <inline font-style="italic">Mein Kampf,</inline>
                            but he did not make any references to attacks
            upon the workers of Germany. He may bc able to tell us whether there is any great
            difference between what has happened to the workers of Germany under Hitler, and what
            has taken place in connexion with certain sections of Australian workers.

                                <para>- I object to Hitler's policy, and would resist it with all the power at my
                disposal, because, among other things, it is a policy for the regimentation of
                labour and the compelling of men to carry out the will of the State under threats of
                severe penalties. But what is the position of men on the Australian waterfront
                to-day? Is it not a fact that before they can earn a livelihood they must obtain a
                licence to work? And if they do not carry out the will of their masters, the
                Transport Workers Act will be invoked to starve them into submission. The Labour
                party will join with the Government in doing everything possible to defend this
                country, and to bring the present conflict to a successful conclusion ; but I know
                that the Government is not imbued with any feeling of goodwill towards the workers.
                A question that, no doubt, will arise in the near future will be one as to whether
                Australia should send an expeditionary force overseas. Australia, with its huge
                territory and sparse population, cannot afford to send men out of this country to
                take part in the conflict overseas. They will be required here to defend Australia.
                But the Minister for External Affairs and the honorable member for Richmond say that
                " If circumstances require it, we are prepared to send men overseas ". They
                have not said yet that they will send them, but they are prepared to do -so.</para>

                                <para>- He said that Australia might send one division as a gesture to Great Britain.
                If we sent one division, before long there would be a cry for a second division.
                There would at least be calls for reinforcements in order to keep the original
                division at full strength. I am not prepared to support such a policy, for I believe
                that if we defend Australia, we shall do all that can reasonably be expected of us.
                The honorable member for Richmond also said that on this occasion no one bad
                described the present conflict as a trade war. The Minister for External Affairs
                said that the situation to-day was similar to that in 1914 when the then Kaiser was
                at the helm in Germany. I have a clear recollection of what the then Attorney-General
                said about that conflict being a trade war, and I also remember the statement of
                Archbishop Mannix " Stop profits, and you stop the war ". Evidently, there
                are many men in this Parliament, as well as in Britain, who want to defeat Hitler,
                not because of his policy, but because Germany is a strong rival of Britain in the
                commercial field.</para>

            they are necessary for the defence of the country. Should this Parliament be closed, and
            government be carried on by regulation, there will be no opportunity to protect such a
            right as freedom of speech. Honorable members have been supplied with copies of
            regulations giving to, the Government powers which it says are necessary for the defence
            of Australia. Among those regulations is one which reads : -

            be kept open. The honorable member for Richmond does not agree with that view, although
            he said that we must defend our democratic institutions against Hitlerism. Apparently,

                                    - Now let us deal with some of the other propositions put forward by the Leader
                of the Opposition. He said that the Government must take action for the limitation
                of profits. Government members say that they approve of that principle, but that is
                as far as they go. We recently had before this chamber certain measures which
                proposed, so it was stated by the Government spokesman, the necessary provision for
                the defence of this country, and in the consideration of that legislation
                unsuccessful endeavours were made to obtain from the Government some adequate
                machinery for the limitation of profits. Members of the Opposition support the
                absolute elimination of profits from the production of war equipment, but. we knew
                that we could not get the Government to approve of that, and so we
                                    <inline font-style="italic">asked</inline>
                                    that it be prepared to enforce some reasonable
                limitation of profits. But what happened? The Government has done absolutely nothing
                in that direction. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, which was mentioned
                by the honorable member for Werriwa

                                    is paying a dividend of 12¬Ω per cent., not on subscribed
                capital alone, but on watered capital as well. So, in the future, if that company
                continues, as I expect it to do, to pay a dividend of 12¬Ω per cent. on stock
                watered to almost double the amount of the subscribed capital, members of the
                Government will say that the profit is reasonable, and that the Government is
                watching the situation very closely.

                            The Prime Minister

                            stated that
            Great Britain would purchase, for use abroad, all of our wool surplus, and all of our
            surplus production from certain other primary industries. I want to know from the Prime
            Minister whether in any of the schemes that the Government is approving for the sale of
            primary products, plans have been incorporated for the protection of the consumer in
            this country. Those are amongst the things which it is necessary for Parliament to
            examine.

                        <para>Possibly, the best contribution that the Prime Minister could make at this juncture
            would be to have a general election.</para>
                        <para class="block">This Government has never faced an election, in order to learn the
            opinion of the electors. In my opinion the people would be prepared to return a Labour
            government, simply because they could trust Labour, whereas they cannot trust those who
            now occupy the treasury bench. Another matter of moment is the control of prices.
            Honorable members opposite are always ready when they want Labour support to pretend
            that they are willing to ensure that there shall be no exploitation or undue
            profit-making, but if we examine the past actions of the Government, wo see that it has
            no desire to prevent either. All that it desires is to close down Parliament as soon as
            possible, and then by means of regulations do anything that it believes necessary in the
            interest of those who support it. The Government hopes by such means to be able to
            stifle the voices of the Opposition.</para>
                        <para>No honorable member opposite has made any definite statement in regard to sending
            troops abroad. All that the Prime Minister said was that at the moment the Government
            was not prepared to raise an expeditionary force. At the moment! We want a more definite
            assurance in regard to this most import ant matter. I believe that I am expressing the
            opinion of the majority of the people when I say that they are prepared to make the
            maximum effort to defend t his country, but are opposed to any man being called upon to
            take up arms and leave this country for foreign battlefields.</para>

                                    - I understand that the honorable member for Bendigo
                                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rankin)</inline>
                                    has not made any contribution to this debate, but his
                interjection shows that he can be listed among the jingoists. He is another
                honorable gentleman who believes that the best way to serve Australia is to see that
                every able-bodied man is sent out of Australia to risk his life on foreign fields. I
                take the opposite view. I believe that we require our men to defend our own shores.
                I say this to the honorable gentleman: many of the workers who took part in the last
                conflict have been treated very shabbily, despite the promises that were made to
                them. The sanatoriums are full of returned soldiers who cannot get justice from this
                Government; they cannot get pensions. It is the same with our asylums. This
                Government, through the agency of the Repatriation Department, avails itself of
                every technicality to prevent these men from getting what was promised to them in
                return for their services. I say to the honorable gentleman and to the workers of
                Britain as well, that if we are to be asked to sacrifice the lives of our people in
                defeating Hitlerism, the sacrifice must not be for the maintenance of the conditions
                which exist at the moment, because they are very unsatisfactory. In spite of the
                loss of 60,000 Australian men in the last war, the conditions in this country have
                not improved for the citizens at large, but they have improved for a minute section
                of the community which is supporting this Government. Because of that the Labour
                movement should face the facts. We want Hitler defeated because he is a menace to
                the workers throughout the world. I do not share the belief of the honorable member
                for Bendigo that the present Prime Minister and the Prime Minister of Great Britain
                want the defeat of Hitler only because of his attack on the free institutions of his
                own country, and the fact that he might menace similar institutions in this country.
                I join with the honorable member for West Sydney
                                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
                  Beasley)</inline>
                                    in saying that it is very doubtful whether we have ever had in
                this country truly democratic government. We have, it is true, greater civil
                liberties than is enjoyed in most countries, but they have been won by the people
                against the efforts of the conservative element. Honorable members opposite,
                including the honorable member for Bendigo, would take an early opportunity to take
                away any liberties we exercise in this country because they believe that the workers
                exist only to slave and produce profits for the wealthy.

                judge the Government on results. We should be alert in view of what has been
                occurring in the past, and we should examine very closely every one of the
                Government's actions. We should demand that this Parliament be continuously in
                session so that there shall be no direct, attack on the civil liberties of the
                people. We should not say to the Prime Minister, " We believe that you have
                handled the situation very ably ". After all, what has the Prime Minister done?
                He has only re-echoed the policy of the Chamberlain Government. He has only followed
                step by step what the British Government was doing.</para>

                                <para>- It is not a matter of examining this particular decision. As 1 have said, I
                believe that it is necessary to oppose the spread of Hitlerism, but for reasons
                different from those held by honorable members opposite. I also believe, however,
                that whatever decisions are made involving this country in war should be the
                decisions of this Parliament, and not those of the parliament or government of any
                other country. We are the ones to make decisions which affect the lives of the
                Australian people.</para>

                        <para>I conclude by informing the Government that it can expect to receive the support of
            the Opposition when it puts forward proposals which we believe are necessary for the
            defence of the country, and we shall be the judges of whether or not they are necessary
            defence measures. That is why we want Parliament kept continuously in session. Moreover,
            the Government may expect the maximum opposition from the Labour party if, under the
            pretext of defending the country, it attempts to suppress the liberties of the people.
            In that event we shall oppose the Government by every means in our power, no matter what
            risks we may incur in this Parliament or outside it. That is my -final word to the
            Government. I am not prepared to give to the Government an open invitation. to do what
            it likes. We want to see the country defended ; we want to see the war brought to an
            early and successful conclusion, and we shall judge the Government on its deeds, rather
            than on its words.</para>

                                .- I am sure that all sane and right-thinking people will deplore the calamity
              that has overtaken the world ; this outbreak of hostilities must bring untold distress
              to millions of people in various parts of the world. I desire to pay a tribute to the
              Australian people for the calmness which lias characterized their reception of the
              news of this tragic occurrence, and I hope that their minds will remain unaffected by
              hysteria throughout the progress of the war. I believe that there is a grim resolution
              on the part of every person in this country to do whatever is possible to bring the
              conflict to a successful issue, so that those factors which disturb the peace of the
              world may be for all time removed. I pay a tribute, also, to all those who have
              exerted themselves during recent months in the cause of peace, who have worked so
              assiduously to devise a method of solving by negotiation the problems involved in this
              quarrel. Britain's contribution has been most commendable. The White Paper is a
              most convincing document. It is a grave misfortune that the world should be plunged
              into war in order to settle a dispute that might have been settled peacefully and with
              justice to all concerned. I hope that we shall not see a repetition of some of the
              things that occurred during the last war, when law-abiding Australian citizens, because
              of their racial connexions, were subjected to suspicion, injustice and ill-treatment
              of a kind quite contrary to the principles which we, as a democratic people, hold
              clear. I trust that all law-abiding citizens will be treated fairly and justly, no
              matter who their parents may have been. Only recently I visited those parts of the
              world which are now most, closely affected by the present war. I travelled through
              Poland, Germany, Russia, France, and several other European countries. In every
              country I visited I was received with the utmost courtesy, and was shown the greatest
              kindness, and it hurts me grievously now to think that many of the people whom I was
              privileged to meet at that time are to-day directly involved in this disastrous
              experience. It has been suggested that all those who are members of the great German
              nation are to be regarded as supporting the ideals of the Government which to-day
              rules that country. I do not believe that to be true. I had an opportunity to speak to
              many Germans, who deeply resented the tyrannical methods of their Government in its
              attempt to destroy the free institutions which those people loved as much as we love
              our own. They were powerless, however, in the face of ruthless coercion by the Nazi
              regime, to prevent what was going on. I am confident that, at this moment, there are
              in Germany millions of people who feel towards the present conflict very much as we
              do. Internal problems will surely arise because of the suppression of the masses in
              Germany. Although by reason of the actions of their governments these peoples find
              themselves in conflict with other nations, we should bo careful in considering these
              matters to keep in true perspective the relationship which we bear one towards
              another. 1 have had the privilege of traversing the territories now in dispute, aud I
              believe that long before now the differences that exist in relation to them should
              have been submitted to arbitration in order to determine the rights or wrongs of the
              claims made by the opposing parties. The segregation of a large section of territory
              belonging to the German nation into a " corridor " for another nation could
              have resulted only in irritation and strong provocation. Why did not those who
              formulated the Versailles Treaty seek to avoid creating a position which had in it all
              the disturbing elements that have led up to the present conflict? If those who were
              responsible for the drafting of the treaty had provided for Poland a corridor on the
              east side of East Prussia, I am sure that it would have avoided unnecessary
              irritation. I do not believe, however, that even the present circumstances provide
              justification for the German Government's resort to force and the brutal methods
              it has employed in its diplomacy. Only by a clear indian,tion of a willingness to
              deliberate as equals in this situation could there have been a satisfactory conclusion
              of the differences. The peoples of central European countries have been living under
              conditions of fear because of hatreds and bitterness born of centuries of turmoil. As
              I passed from one country to another. I saw the evidence of this in the fact that,
              even in 1935, men were stationed at the frontiers in camouflaged trenches, manning
              machine guns and other war equipment directed against neighbouring territories. Thank
              goodness we have in this country no circumstances similar to those. If we could
              through the League of Nations do something towards the removal of the fear that has
              exercised the minds of European peoples, particularly during the last quarter of a
              century, we should ultimately make a very valuable contribution to the permanent peace
              of the world. I had the privilege of being able to sit in conference with some of the
              leading representatives of the British Commonwealth and to have the advantage of the
              advice which members of the British Cabinet gave to the conference. In 1935, and again
              in 1937, it was emphasized that if the Dominions contributed to the extent of seeing
              that their own peoples were fed and clothed and the territories under their control
              were amply protected, they would be regarded as having made a magnificent contribution
              as units of the British Commonwealth. That statement was made in 1935 by
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anthony</inline>
                                Eden, then Secretary of State for Foreign
              Affairs. On the occasion of my last visit to the United Kingdom in 1937,
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline>
                                Hoare expressed substantially the same views.
              We were told as members of the Parliaments of our respective Dominions, to emphasize
              the need for the development of industries necessary to make our countries
              self-supporting in time of emergency. It was stressed that it was most essential that
              the Dominions should shoulder the responsibility of safeguarding their own people. I
              believe that that is a sensible view, and that if we can attain the highest standard
              of efficiency in. those industries that provide the essential means to enable us to
              make this continent secure, we shall have made indeed a valuable contribution towards
              the part we are expected to play during the present conflict. There are attendant
              dangers in the Pacific that make the conservation of our manhood an absolute
              necessity. We all desire that the outcome of the great struggle will be the
              suppression of those powers which seek to subvert our democratic institutions and to
              interfere with the liberties of the people. We hope that this will be done as speedily
              as practicable, so that it will be possible for all me in De rs of the human race to
              live under conditions of greater social, economic aDd national security. I join with
              other honorable members who have said that we shall do all that is possible to assist
              in the successful prosecution of war and preserve the interests of our own people. No
              person should be allowed to profit at the expense of the nation and its people in this
              time of emergency. .1 have already been warned by certain bud. ness interests in South
              Australia that in an endeavour to make undue profits some persons are accumulating
              large stocks of materials that may be essential for civil and military purposes.
              Actions of that nature must be dealt with immediately, because we cannot allow some to
              profit at the expense of others. Moreover, those who have money should make it
              available to assist in the prosecution of war. Rates of interest paid should not be
              higher than the prevailing rate. The Common wealth Bank, under the guidance of the
              Parliament, should take full control of Australia's financial requirements during
              the war to the end that effective defence may be ensured at a minimum cost. I support
              those honorable members who have said that it is remarkable how readily finance can be
              made available to prosecute a war, although, at the same time, we arc told that funds
              are not available to provide employment and a greater measure of social security to
              our people. In the future, there will be an insistent demand by those now
              unfortunately placed for a greater share in the wealth which they assist to produce. I
              recognize that our imperative obligation is to make this country secure against,
              invasion. We should respond .with those means at our. disposal and assist those who
              are seeking to overthrow powers which arc threatening the world and the existence of
              those dem orr a tic institutions upon which civilization largely depends.

                                state to-day that Australia is standing
              right behind the British Government in the prosecution of the war now in progress. lt
              is a world-wide calamity, and a crime against civilization that such a war should be
              forced upon the world. We, as British people, cannot afford to lose in the struggle,
              not only for the sake of the British Empire, but also in the interests of
              civilization. The Government must first consider the safety of Australia. That is
              absolutely essential; but if the danger in the Orient which wo- believed until quite
              recently was real he removed, and we have a definite assurance from Japan that it will
              remain neutral or come in as an ally of Britain, Australia should send a volunteer
              expeditionary force to assist Great Britain and the other dominions in the fight for
              liberty.

                                <para>- That is possible. But if the Commonwealth Government received the necessary
                assurance that that nation is not likely to be allied with Germany, we should in the
                interests of a.14 classes in Britain and in France assist to carry the burden which
                they are carrying, and not expect them to sacrifice their lives in order, to ensure
                our safety. I was glad to hear the Prime Minister say that he had urged the British
                Prime Minister to make every effort- for peace and to be generous in his proposals
                to the German people, provided that we were generous at our own expense. I agree
                with the right honorable gentleman entirely, because I believe that last September
                we received temporary security at the expense of another nation of 9,000,000 persons
                who were committed to the worst form of slavery the world has ever known. That is
                something of which we as Britons cannot be proud. The Government has taken the only
                course open to it, and if Australia is not threatened from the East we cannot wait
                until Britain is defeated or until we are attacked before making some practical
                effort. Should we do so, we could expect the same treatment as the Poles are
                receiving, and have our cities and towns bombed and non-combatants murdered as they
                are being murdered in thousands to-day. It is preferable to fight on German

            kept down to a reasonable margin, and that industries engaged in the production of
            materials of war should be controlled so that profits cannot be made at the expense of
            those who may have to serve in this great struggle. I believe that if we do not go to
            the assistance of Great Britain, we shall be betraying those gallant members of the
            Australian Imperial Force who laid down their lives in the Great War. I hope that the
            Government will adopt the policy which I have outlined, that it will stand firmly behind
            the British Government, and, if it is safe to do so, send an expeditionary force to aid
            Great Britain.

            <para>Text of Documents exchanged between the United Kingdom and German Governments from 22nd
        August, 1939, to the Outbreak of War, 3rd September, 1939.</para>
            <para>The documents contained below have been selected to illustrate the main stages of the
        critical period in the GermanPolish dispute, culminating in the outbreak of war. They cover
        the period from Tuesday, 22nd August, 1939, to Sunday, 3rd September, 1939, and consist for
        the most part of official communications exchanged between the Governments of the United
        Kingdom and the German Reich. The texts have been linked for the sake of clearness by
        consecutive narrative.</para>
            <para>The German-Polish dispute had been in the forefront of European politics since March of
        this year and for the same period it carried a direct British interest by reason of the
        guarantee given to Poland by the United Kingdom Government. This guarantee, binding the
        United Kingdom to support Poland in the event of a threat to her independence or integrity
        which she felt bound to resist, was announced on 31st March, at a time when there was reason
        to fear that the German Government was contemplating the use of force in pressing upon
        Poland demands regarding Danzig and. the Polish Corridor.</para>
            <para>
                In a preliminary agreement concluded in London on 6th April the British guarantee was
        reciprocated by corresponding assurances from the Polish Government towards Great Britain.
        This arrangement was made formal in the Anglo-Polish Agreement of Mutual Assistance signed
        in London on 25th August. In the interval, the British obligation had been affirmed on
        several occasions by spokesmen of the United Kingdom Government in the clearest terms. It
        was in recognition of this obligation and of the consequent direct British interest in
        German-Polish relations that on 22nd August, when the signature was impending of the German
        pact of non-aggression with Soviet Russia,

                <para>Your Excellency will have already heard of certain measures taken by His Majesty's
          Government and announced in the press and on the wireless this evening. These steps have,
          in the opinion of His Majesty's Government, been rendered necessary by the military
          movements which have been reported from Germany and by the fact that apparently the
          announcement of a German-Soviet Agreement is taken in some quarters in Berlin to indicate
          that intervention by Great Britain on behalf of Poland is no longer a contingency that
          need be reckoned with. No greater mistake could be made. Whatever may prove to be the
          nature of the GermanSoviet Agreement, it cannot alter Great Britain's obligation to
          Poland which His Majesty's Government have stated in public repeatedly and plainly,
          and which they are determined to fulfil. It has been alleged that if His Majesty's
          Government had made their position more clear in 1914 the great catastrophe would have
          been avoided. Whether or not there is any force in that allegation, His Majesty's
          Government has resolved that on this occasion there shall be no such tragic
          misunderstanding. If the case should arise they are resolved and prepared to employ
          without delay all the forces at their command and it is impossible to foresee the end of
          hostilities once engaged. It would be a dangerous illusion to think that if war once
          started it will come to an early end even if a success on any one of the several fronts on
          which it will be engaged should have been secured. Having thus made our position perfectly
          clear, I wish to repeat to you my conviction that war between our two peoples would be the
          greatest calamity that could occur. I am certain that it is desired neither by our people
          nor by yours and I cannot see that there is anything in the questions arising between
          Germany and Poland which could not and should not be resolved without the use of force if
          only a situation of confidence could be restored to enable discussions to be carried on in
          an atmosphere different, from that which prevails to-day. We have been and at all times
          will be ready to assist in creating conditions in which such negotiations could take place
          and in which it might be possible concurrently to discuss the wider problems affecting the
          future of international relations including matters of interest to us and to you.</para>
                <para>The difficulties in the way of any peaceful discussion in the present state* of
          tension are, however, obvious and the longer that tension is maintained the harder will it
          be for reason to prevail. These difficulties, however, might be mitigated if not removed
          provided that there could for an initial period he a truce on both sides and indeed on all
          sides to press polemics and to all incitement. If such a truce could be arranged then at
          the end of that period during which steps could be taken to examine and deal with
          complaints made by either side as to the treatment of minorities it is reasonable to hope
          that suitable conditions might have been established for direct negotiations between
          Germany and Poland upon the issues between them (with the aid of a neutral intermediary if
          both sides should think that that would be helpful). But I am bound to say that there
          would be slender hope of bringing such negotiations to successful issue unless it were
          understood beforehand that any settlement reached would, when concluded, be guaranteed by
          other Powers.</para>

                    Majesty's Government would be ready if desired
          to make such contribution as they could to the effective operation of such guarantees. At
          this moment I confess I can see no other way to avoid a catastrophe that will involve
          Europe in war. In view of the grave consequences to humanity which may follow from the
          action of their Rulers, I trust that Your Excellency will weigh with the utmost
          deliberation the considerations which T have put before you.

              prerequisites. Some of these questions held and still hold a significance both of a
              national political and a psychological character which no German Government is able to
              ignore. To these questions belong the German City of Danzig and the connected problem
              of the Corridor. Numerous statesmen, historians and men of letters even in England
              have been conscious of this at any rate up to a few years ago. I would add that all
              these territories lying in the aforesaid German sphere of interest and in particular
              those lands which returned to the Reich eighteen months ago received their cultural
              development at the hands not of the English but exclusively of the Germans, and this

          expression at the close of the last conversation to the hope that after all an
          understanding between Germany and England might yet be possible. He (the F√ºhrer) had
          therefore turned things over in his mind once more and desired to make a move as regards
          England which should be as decisive as the move as regards Russia which had led to the
          recent Agreement. Yesterday's sitting in. the House of Commons and the speeches of

          affected to conquer the world was ridiculous. The British Empire embraced 40,000,000
          square kilometres, Russia 19,000,000 square kilometres, America 9,500,000 square
          kilometres, whereas Germany embraced less than 60,000 square kilometres. It is quite clear
          who it is who desires to conquer the world. The F√ºhrer makes the following

                        <para>The problem of Danzig and the Corridor must be solved. The British Prime Minister
              had made a speech which was not in the least calculated to induce any change in the
              German attitude. At the most the result of this speech could be a bloody and
              incalculable war between Germany and England. Such a war would be bloodier than that
              of 1914 to 1918. In contrast to the last war Germany would no longer have to fight on
              two fronts. Agreement with Russia was unconditional and signified a change in the
              foreign policy of the Reich which would last a very long time. Russia and Germany
              would never again take up arms against each other. Apart from this, the Agreements
              reached with Russia would also render Germany secure economically for the longest
              possible period of war. The F√ºhrer had always wanted an Anglo-German
              understanding. War between England and Germany could at the best bring some profit to
              Germany, but none at all to England. The F√ºhrer declared that the German-Polish
              problem must be solved and will be solved. He is, however, prepared and determined
              after the solution of this problem to approach England once more with a large
              comprehensive offer. He is a man of great decisions, and in this case also he will be
              capable of being great in his action. He accepts the British Empire and is ready to
              pledge himself personally for its continued existence and to place the power of the
              German Reich at its disposal if (1) his colonial demands which are limited and can be
              negotiated by peaceful methods are fulfilled, and in this case he is prepared to fix
              the longest time limit; (2) his obligations towards</para>

                    Italy are untouched - in other words, he does not demand that England
          gives up her obligations towards France, and similarly for his own part he cannot withdraw
          from his obligations towards Italy. He also desires to stress the irrevocable
          determination of Germany never again to enter into conflict with Russia. The F√ºhrer U
          ready to conclude agreements with England, which, as baa already been emphasized, would
          not only guarantee the existence of the British Empire in all circumstances as far as
          Germany is concerned, but also if necessary an assurance to the British Empire of German
          assistance regardless of where such assistance should be necessary. The F√ºhrer would
          then also be ready to accept a reasonable limitation of armaments which corresponds to the
          new political situation and which is economically tolerable. Finally, the Fiihrer renewed
          his assurances that he is not interested in western problems and that a frontier
          modification in the west does not enter into consideration. Western fortifications which
          have been constructed at a cost of milliards were the final Reich frontier on the west. If
          the British Government would consider these ideas a blessing for, Germany and also for the
          British Empire might result. If it rejects these ideas there will be war. In no case would
          Great Britain emerge stronger - the last war proved this. The Fiihrer repeats that he is a
          man of
                    <inline font-style="italic">ad infinitum</inline>
                    decisions by which he himself is

          question he would approach the British Government with an offer.

          desire for an Anglo-norman understanding, reaffirming the intention of the United Kingdom
          Government to honour its obligations to Poland, and suggesting that direct discussions
          should be entered upon by Germany and Poland with a view to securing a guaranteed
          settlement of German-Polish differences on a basis which would safeguard Poland's
          essential interests : -

                <para>His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have received the message conveyed
          to them from the German Chancellor by His Majesty's Ambassador in Berlin and have
          considered it with the care which it demands.</para>
                <para>They note the Chancellor's expression of his desire to make friendship the basis
          of relations between Germany and the British Empire and they fully share this desire. They
          believe, with him, that if a complete and lasting understanding between the two countries
          could be established it would bring untold blessings to both peoples.</para>
                <para>The Chancellor's message deals with two groups of questions - those which are
          matters now in dispute between Germany and Poland, and those affecting the ultimate
          relations of Germany and the United Kingdom. In connexion with these last, His
          Majesty's Government observe that the German Chancellor has indicated certain
          proposals which, subject to one condition. he would be prepared to make to the British
          Government for an understanding. These proposals are, of course, stated in very general
          form and would require closer definition, but His Majesty's Government are fully
          prepared to take them with some additions, as subjects for discussion and they would be
          ready, if differences between Germany and Poland are peacefully composed, to proceed so
          soon as practicable to such discussion with a sincere desire to reach agreement.</para>
                <para>The condition which the German Chancellor lays down is that there must first be a
          settlement of differences between Germany and Poland. As to that, His Majesty's
          Government entirely agree. Everything, however, turns upon the nature of the settlement
          and the method by which it is to be reached. On these points, the importance of which
          cannot be absent from the Chancellor's mind, his message is silent, and His
          Majesty's Government feel compelled to point out that an understanding Ul) 0 11 both
          these is essentia] to achieve further progress. The German Government will be aware
          that His Majesty's Government have obligations to Poland by which they are bound and
          which they intend to honour. They could not, for any advantage offered to Great Britain,
          acquiesce in a settlement which put in jeopardy the independence of a State to whom they
          have given their guarantee.</para>
                <para>In the opinion of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom a reasonable
          solution of the differences between Germany and Poland could and should be effected by
          agreement between the two countries on lines which would include the safeguarding of
          Poland's essential interests, and they recall that in his speech of 28th April last
          the German Chancellor recognized the importance of these interests to Poland.</para>
                <para>But, as was stated by the Prime Minister in his letter to the German Chancellor of
          22nd August, His Majesty's Government consider it essential for the success of the dis
          cuss ion which would precede the agreement that it should bc understood beforehand that any
          settlement arrived at would bo guaranteed by other Powers. His Majesty's Government
          would be ready if desired to make their contribution to the effective operation of such a
          guarantee.</para>
                <para>In the view of His Majesty's Government it follows that the next step should be
          the initiation of direct discussions between the German and Polish Governments on a basis
          which would include the principles stated above, namely the safeguarding of Poland's
          essential interests and the securing of a settlement by an international guarantee.</para>
                <para>They have already received a definite assurance from the Polish Government that they
          are prepared tQ enter into discussions on this basis and, His Majesty's Government
          hope that the German Government would, for their part, also be willing to agree to this
          course.</para>
                <para>If, as His Majesty's Government propose, such discussion led to agreement, the way
          would be open to negotiation of that wider and more complete understanding between Great
          Britain and Germany which both conn tries deserve.</para>
                <para>His Majesty's Government agree with the German Chancellor that one principal
          danger in the German-Polish situation arises from reports concerning the treatment of the
          minorities. The present state of tension with its concomitant frontier incidents, report
          of m al- treatment and inflammatory propaganda is a constant danger to peace. It is
          manifestly a matter of the utmost urgency that all incidents of the kind should be
          promptly and rigidly suppressed and that unverified reports should not be allowed to
          circulate, in order that time may be afforded, without provocation on either side; for a
          full examination of the possibilities of settlement. His Majesty's Government are
          confident that both Governmentsconcerned are fully alive to theseconsiderations.</para>
                <para>His Majesty's Government have said' enough to make their own attitude plain*
          in the particular matters at issue between Germany and Poland. They trust that the German
          Chancellor will not think that, because His Majesty's Government are scrupulous
          concerning their obligations to Poland, they are not anxious to use all their influence to
          assist in the achievement of a solution which may commend itself both to Germany and to
          Poland.</para>
                <para>That such a settlement should be achieved seems to His Majesty's Government
          essential not only for reasons directly arising in regard to the settlement itself, but
          also for wider considerations of which the German Chancellor has spoken with such
          conviction.</para>
                <para>It is unnecessary in the present reply to stress the advantage of a peaceful
          settlement over a decision to solve the question at issue by force of arms. The results of
          a decision to use force have been clearly set out in the Prime Minister's letter to
          the Chancellor of 22nd August, and His Majesty's Government do not doubt that they are
          as fully recognized by the Chancellor as by themselves.</para>
                <para>On the other hand His Majesty's Government note with interest the German
          Chancellor's reference in the message now under consideration to a limitation of
          armaments, and believe that, if a peaceful settlement can be obtained, the assistance of
          the world could confidently be anticipated for practical measures to enable transition
          from preparation for war to normal activities of peaceful trade to be safely and smoothly
          effected.</para>
                <para>A just settlement of these questions between Germany and Poland may open the way to
          world peace. Failure to reach it would ruin the hopes of better understanding between
          Germany and Great Britain, would bring the two countries into conflict, and might well
          plunge the whole world into war. Such an outcome would be a calamity without parallel in
          history.</para>
                <para>The reply of the United Kingdom Government, was communicated to the French and Polish
          Governments before delivery to the German Government. The reply, however, was not made
          public because Herr Hitler had insisted that it should be kept secret until he had had an
          opportunity to consider it. The British Note was handed to Herr Hitler by the British
          Ambassador at 10.30 p.m. on 28th August. At 7.15 p.m. on Tuesday, 29 th August, Herr
          Hitler handed to the British Ambassador at Berlin the following written reply stating that
          the German Government demanded the return of Danzig and the Corridor to the Reich and the
          safeguarding of German minority rights in Poland, and accepting the British proposal that

                <para>The German Government have noted with satisfaction from the reply of the British
          Government and from oral explanations given by the British Ambassador that the British
          Government for their part are also prepared to improve the relationship between Germany
          and England and to develop and extend it in the sense of the German" suggestion.</para>
                <para>In this connexion the British Government are similarly convinced thru the removal of
          German-Polish tension. which has become unbearable, is the pre-requisite to the
          realization of this hope.</para>
                <para>Since Autumn of the past year, and on the last occasion in March, 1939, there were
          submitted to the Polish Government proposals, both oral and written, which, having regard
          to the friendship then existing with Germany and Poland, offered the possibility of a
          solution of the questions in dispute acceptable to both parties. The British Government
          are aware that the Polish Government saw fit in March last finally to reject these
          proposals. At the same time they used this rejection as a pretext for an occasion for
          taking military measures which have since been continuously intensified. Already in the
          middle of last month Poland was in effect in a state of mobilization. This was accompanied
          by numerous encroachments in the Free City of Danzig due to the instigation of Polish
          authorities ; threatening demands in the nature of ultimata, varying only in degree, were
          addressed to that city. A closing of the frontier, at first in the form of a measure of
          customs policy, but extended later in a military sense affecting also traffic and
          communications, was also imposed with the object of bringing about the political
          exhaustion and economic destruction of the German community.</para>
                <para>To this were added barbaric actions of maltreatment which cry to Heaven, and other
          kinds of persecution largely of the German national group in Poland which extended to the
          killing of many resident Germans or to their forcible removal under the most cruel
          conditions. This state of affairs is unbearable for a Great Power. It has now forced
          Germany after remaining a passive onlooker for many months in her turn to take necessary
          steps for the safeguarding of German interests. And indeed the German Government can but
          assure the British Government in the most solemn manner that a condition of affairs has
          now been reached which can no longer be accepted or observed with indifference.</para>
                <para>The demands of the German Government are in conformity with the revision of the
          Versailles Treaty in regard to this territory, which has always been recognized as being
          necessary : viz., the return of Danzig and the Corridor to Germany, the safeguarding of
          the existence of the German national group in territories remaining to Poland.</para>
                <para>The German Government note with satisfaction that the British Government further are
          in principle convinced that some solution must he found for the new situation which has
          arisen.</para>
                <para>They further feel justified in assuming that the British Government too can have no
          doubt that it is a question now of conditions for the elimination of which there no longer
          remain days, still less weeks, but perhaps only hours. For in the disorganized state of
          affairs obtaining in Poland, the possibility of incidents intervening, which it might be
          impossible for Germany to tolerate, must at any moment be reckoned with. "Whilst the
          British Government may still believe that these grave differences can be resolved by way
          of direct negotiations, the German Government unfortunately can no longer share this view
          as a matter of course. For they have made attempts to embark on such peaceful
          negotiations, but, instead of receiving any support from the Polish Government, they were
          rebuffed by the sudden introduction of measures of a military character in favour of
          developments alluded to above.</para>
                <para>The British Government attach importance to two considerations (1) that the existing
          danger of an imminent explosion should be eliminated as quickly as possible by direct
          negotiation, and that (2) the existence of the Polish State, in the form in which it would
          then continue to exist, should be adequately safeguarded in the economic and political
          sphere by means of international guarantees.</para>
                <para>On this subject the German Government makes the following declaration : - </para>

                    Though sceptical as to the prospects of
                    <inline font-style="italic">a</inline>
                    successful outcome, they are nevertheless prepared to accept the English proposal and to
          enter direct discussions. They do so, as already emphasized, solely as a result of the
          impression made upon them by Britain's statement, received from the British
          Government, that they too desire a Pact of Friendship
                    <inline font-style="italic">(Freundschaftsabkommen)</inline>
                    in accordance with the general lines indicated to the
          British Ambassador.
                </para>
                <para>The German Government desire in this way to give to the British Government and to the
          British Nation a proof of the sincerity of Germany's intentions to enter into a
          lasting friendship with Great Britain. The Government of the Reich feel, however, bound to
          point out to the British Government that in the event of a territorial rearrangement in
          Poland they would no longer be able to bind themselves to give guarantees or to
          participate in guarantees without the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics being associated
          therewith.</para>
                <para>For the rest, in making these proposals the German Government have never had any
          intention of touching Poland's vital interests or of question- ing the existence of an
          independent Polish State. The German Government accordingly in these circumstances agree
          to accept the British Government's offer of their good offices in securing the
          despatch to Berlin of a Polish emissary with full powers. They count on the arrival of the
          emissary on Wednesday, the 30th August, 1939. The German Government will immediately draw
          up proposals for a solution acceptable to themselves and will if possible place these at
          the disposal of the British Government before the arrival of the Polish negotiator.</para>
                <para>
                    It will be noted that the German reply of 29th August, referred only in general terms
          to proposals which were subsequently to be drawn up by the German Government. On receiving
          this communication from Herr Hitler, the British Ambassador drew attention to the fact
          that the German Note required the arrival in Berlin of a Polish plenipotentiary on the
          following day, namely, Wednesday, 30th August.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir
            Nevile</inline>
                    Henderson said that this requirement sounded like an ultimatum. Both
          Herr Hitler and Herr von Ribbentrop (who was also present during the discussion) assured
          the British Ambassador, however, that this requirement was only intended to stress the
          urgency of the moment when two mobilized armies were standing face to face. In reply to a
          further question, Herr Hitler also assured the British Ambassador that the Polish
          plenipotentiary would be well received in Berlin and that discussions would be conducted
          on a footing of complete equality.

                    Majesty's Government informed the German
          Government in a Note dated 28th August, 1939, of their readiness to offer their mediation
          towards direct negotiations between Germany and Poland over the problems in dispute. In so
          doing they made it abundantly clear that they too were aware of the urgent need for
          progress in view of the continuous incidents and the general European tension. In a reply
          dated the 29th August the German Government, in spite of being sceptical as to the desire
          of the Polish Government to come to an understanding, declared themselves ready in the
          interests of peace to accept the British mediation and suggestions. After considering all
          the circumstances prevailing at the time, they considered it necessary in their note to
          point out that if the danger of a catastrophe was to be avoided, then action must be taken
          readily and without delay. In this sense they declared themselves ready to receive a
          personage appointed by the Polish Government up to the evening of the 30th August, with
          the proviso that the latter was
                    <inline font-style="italic">m</inline>
                    fact empowered, not
          only to discuss, but to conduct and conclude negotiations. Further, the German Government
          pointed out that they felt able to make the basic points regarding the offer of an
          understanding available to the British Government by the time the Polish negotiator
          arrived in Berlin.
                </para>
                <para>Instead of a statement regarding the arrival of an authorized Polish personage-, The
          first answer the Government of the Reich received to their readiness for an understanding
          was the news of the Polish mobilization and only towards 12 o'clock on the night of
          the 30th August, 1939, did they receive a somewhat general assurance of British readiness
          to help towards the commencement of negotiations. Although the fact that the Polish
          negotiator expected by the Government of the Reich did not arrive removed the necessary
          condition for informing His Majesty's Government of the views of the German Government
          as regards possible bases of negotiation, since His Majesty's Government themselves
          had pleaded for direct negotiations between Germany and Poland, the German Minister for
          Foreign Affairs, Herr von Ribbentrop, gave the British Ambassador, on the occasion of the
          presentation of the last British note, precise information as to the text of the German
          proposals which would be regarded as a basis of negotiation in the event of the arrival of
          the Polish plenipotentiary.</para>
                <para>The Government of the German Reich considered themselves entitled to claim that in
          these circumstances a Polish personage would immediately be nominated at any rate
          retroactively. For the Reich Government cannot be expected for their part continually, not
          only to emphasize their willingness to start negotiations, but actually to be ready to do
          so while being from the Polish side merely put off with empty subterfuges and meaningless
          declarations. It has once more been made clear as a result of a demarche, which has
          meanwhile been made by the Polish Ambassador, that the latter himself has no plenary
          powers either to enter into any discussion or even to negotiate.</para>
                <para>The F√ºhrer and the German Government have thus waited two days in vain for the
          arrival of a Polish negotiator with plenary powers. In these circumstances the German
          Government regard their proposals as having, this time too, been to all intents and
          purposes rejected although they considered that these proposals, in the form in which they
          were made known to the British Government also were more than loyal, fair and practicable.
          The Reich Government consider it timely to inform the public of the bases for negotiation
          which were communicated to the British Ambassador by the Minister for Foreign Affairs,
          Herr von Ribbentrop. The situation existing between the German Reich and Poland is, at the
          moment, of such a kind that any further incident can lead to an explosion on the part of
          the military forces which have taken up their position on both sides.</para>

                    which the German Government regarded as

          time when the proposals were broadcast, no copy of the proposals had been communicated to
          the Polish Government, and no copy was in the possession of the British Government.

                <para>In the early morning of 1st September, 1939, Herr Hitler issued a proclamation to the
          German Army stating that Poland had refused a peaceful settlement and had appealed to
          arms. He had, therefore, decided to meet force with force. On the same morning, Herr
          Forster, leader of the Nazis in Danzig, published a proclamation to the effect that Danzig
          was now part of the German Reich. The German Reichstag met on the same day, and Herr
          Hitler asked the Reichstag Deputies to endorse Herr Forster's action. The Reichstag
          thereupon unanimously passed a law recognizing the incorporation of Danzig in the Reich.
          Meanwhile, German troops crossed the Polish frontier at a number of points during the
          morning of 1st September, and commenced general military operations against Poland.</para>

          German Foreign Minister that, unless the Chancellor's reply was received by 11 a.m. on
          the same day, the United Kingdom Government would from that hour regard itself as at war
