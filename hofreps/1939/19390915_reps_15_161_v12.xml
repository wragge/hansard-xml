It will certainly have to he altered in due course to merge in, or even to' give way to, whatever air training plan is adopted by the Government as part of Australia's war effort. Nevertheless, carrying on temporarily with this proposal will facilitate the introduction of the training plan finally decided upon, and those who enrol in the reserve will be given early consideration in respect of any substituted body. </para>

                <para>Up fill now, the only assistance to civil flying training has been the payment of bonuses to recognized aero clubs. Bonuses have been paid to clubs for each member to fake out or renew a licence, regardless of the age or the sex of the member. The Civil Air Reserve is to be substituted for the former method of assistance. </para>
                <para>At. present, in clubs and other private schools, flying training on aircraft of types approved by the Royal. Australian Air Force for <inline font-style="italic">ab-initio</inline> training,' costs the pupil £3 an hour for dual instruction and 30s. an hour solo. It is now proposed, by a payment that is to be made to approved clubs and schools, to provide flying training for those who are selected for the Civil Air Reserve, at 30s. an hour dual and 10s. an hour solo. </para>
                <para>Applicants, to be eligible for selection, must be between the ages of18 and 25 years in the ease of those who have had no previous flying experience, and between the ages of 18 and 30 years in the case of those who already hold licences. The intermediate educational 'standard, and a high physical standard, will be essential. Applicants must undertake- to complete the three years' course, and to serve, . if required, in the Royal Australian Air Force or the Royal Australian Air Force Reserve. Preference will be given to applicants with flying experience and to those who are able, if necessary, to commence continuous training immediately. </para>
                <para>Application forms may be obtained from the Civil Aviation Department, aero clubs, flying schools, and civil aviation officers in charge of air-ports. </para>
                <para>The original proposal was to enrol 1,000 in the reserve each year for a period of three years, each year's entrants continuing their training in the subsequent year. </para>
                <para>Applicants whose qualifications meet requirements will be interviewed and reported upon by honorary committees of ex-Australian Flying Corps and ex-Royal Australian Air Force members, which will be set up in all capital cities and several other civil training centres. </para>
                <para>It will be of interest to members to learn that up till this morning over 5,000 application forms have been applied for. Of the 260 that have been returned from Victoria alone  99.9  per cent, have expressed their willingness to commence continuous training in the Royal Australian Air Force, if required. This is evidence of the desire to serve which must give cause for sober pride to all of us. </para>

Naturally, a high mathematical standard of education is demanded of men engaged in air navigation. </para>

                        <para>- Since the honorable gentleman mentioned this matter on the adjournment last night I have had some inquiries made, and I find that supplies of wire netting have not been commandeered by the department, as he then suggested. The only order for wire netting that has been given in recent weeks by the department, for defence requirements, was one for 13,000 yards to Rylands Limited, a Newcastle firm.' That is a relatively small proportion of the potential output of that company, which is, I understand, many miles of wire netting each week. I recall that the price which the department was (jailed upon to pay was reasonable in comparison with the price of the corresponding article overseas ; but, should the honorable member consider that the price charged to civil buyers is unduly high, I suggest that he direct the attention of my colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs, to the matter. </para>

As he does not want to be treated as a deserter, he desires to know if there is any method by which the department will enable him to get a pass from Kalgoorlie toFremantle. in order that he may join his company ? </para>

That casein pays a duty of 20 per cent., which is the rate fixed following a recommendation by the Tariff Board last year. The Trade and Customs Department is not in possession of any information that would lead it to believe that dumping is taking place, but if the honorable member, or any one else, can provide it with conclusive evidence that dumping is taking place, he can rest assured that prompt action will be taken by the department. </para>

If so, does he consider that by 4 o'clock this afternoon he will not be able to inform the House of a matter concerning which he will be able to make a broadcast statement about three hours later ? </para>

                            <para>- The matters which I propose to broadcast to-night have engaged the attention of Cabinet on every possible opportunity during the whole of this week. The Cabinet will resume its meetings after the House rises this afternoon, and I anticipate that the discussion of this matter will be concluded, so that I may be able to make a broadcast at 7.10 o'clock to-night. At present the matter is incomplete. </para>

In those towns no public telephone is provided at the railway station, where such facilities are often badly needed. </para>

                            <para>-Under an order published in. the Gazette last Friday the wholesale and retail prices of sugar were fixed at the levels ruling on the31st August. If it is shown that those prices are being exceeded, or even that the price which prevailed on the 31st August in any centre is excessive, action will be taken in the matter. However, nothing can be done in this connexion unless details are placed before the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner or the  Deputy  Commissioners in the States. I assure the honorable member that I shall have an investigation made into the price being charged in Tasmania, and shall act, if necessary, upon the result of that inquiry. </para>

                            <para>- Is the Prime Minister aware that, the Naval Department has already set up a dictatorship in this country insofar as it has commandeered the rooms used by federal members at the Customs House, Newcastle, and has denied to these members access to correspondence and papers which they have left in those rooms? The Customs House at Newcastle is now under armed guard, and if one attempts to approach the building a revolver is shoved into his face.

                        <para>. - When the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> delivered his budget speech on the 8  th  September, he declared that ho was presenting it in very difficult circumstances.  The  budget, he said, had three distinguishing features: it was his first budget as Prime Minister and Treasurer, it was the first time in the history of Australia that a budget for £100,000,000 had been presented, and it was only a tentative budget because, very shortly, supplementary estimates would have to be brought down to meet war requirements. Some of the departments, he said, would have to budget for increased expenditure, while others would nor expend as must as had been estimated. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I regret very much that the country is involved in war, but I  am  glad that we are able to debate the budget here calmly and quietly. The people of Australia are involved in a war in the making of which they have had no say. During the last war we were told that we were fighting a war to end war, that  it  was being fought in defence of all that was noblest in man, that it was in defence of civilization itself; yet to-day, the world isa gain in chaos, and it makes one think that we are reverting to barbarism. On the 3rd September, the Prime Minister issued a declaration in which he said that, Great Britain having declared war on Germany, Australia was also at war. He has placed a heavy responsibility on the Australian people.. As sensible, levelheaded people we must face the facts. Wild statements will not help us.. On the contrary, they will only make very much worse that which is already bad. We are an intelligent, community, and somehow we shall contrive to overcome our difficulties. With my leader I deplore the fact that we have been forced into war in stead of being able to settle international difficulties by negotiation. We believe that the resistance of armed  aggression is inevitable if further attacks on free and independent people are to be averted. The Labour party has declared that it stands for the maintenance of Australia as an integral part of the British Commonwealth of Nations. Therefore, this party will do all that is possible to safeguard Australia, and, at the same time, having regard to its platform, will do its best to preserve the integrity of the British Commonwealth of Nations. The Labour party stands for the adequate defence of Australia, and for a policy of complete national and economic security. It stands for the defence of our people in all States against aggression from whatever source it may come. That is a clear declaration of policy. I regret that some honorable members who support the Government have seen fit to suggest that the Labour party does not propose to take any interest in the war, and will not assist the Government in this fight. </para>
                    <para>The defence of Australia should be placed on a scientific basis. In order to support the burden of the war we must have national planning. The defence of Australia involves three essential items - the fighting forces, the wherewithal to enable them to fight, which includes providing for the civil population, and finance. Australia is not a militaristic nation. Before the last war our people were a carefree, easy-going, sport-loving people, but in 1914 they were plunged into a war which, for the time being, altered their whole character. Now, without our consent, we are engaged in another war, and I hope that, on this occasion, steps will be taken to ensure that those who do the fighting are adequately remunerated for their services. The Government is showing too much consideration for those who occupy the higher positions. There is no justification for paying a salary of £3,500 to Lieutenant-General Squires, Inspector-General of the Australian Military Forces or for paying £4,000 a year to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harold</inline> Clapp,  chairman  of the board controlling the building of aircraft. Those salaries are outrageously in excess of the worth of the recipients, and are being paid at the expense of other persons equally capable and deserving. The members of the fighting forces do not receive the consideration to which they are entitled in the way of pay and pensions to their dependants. We all know of many cases of hardship among returned soldiers' whose health has been ruined as the result of their war service. They have been thrown on the industrial scrap-heap, and are existing on a mere pittance in the form of a war pension. Those injustices should be rectified. Those who take part in this war should be adequately paid, and proper provision should be made for their dependants. This war, unlike those of earlier days, will be all-in - total involvement, total siege. Civilians - men women and children, and the entire productive capacity of the nation - will be drawn upon. An act passed in England after the declaration of war gives the Government complete power to requisition the output of any factory, and where difficulties arise, the Government may requisition storage space also. It can, if it so desires, take over a business, lock, stock and barrel, and use it in the prosecution of the war. The British Government has experienced the difficulty of sufficiently speeding up production, and has now taken power to commandeer all necessary facilities, regardless of ownership. That power has not been taken in Australia. The Government has not taken any steps to control raw materials. We have been informed that practically all of the. raw materials in Australia are under the control of four big concerns. </para>
                    <para>The Government has permitted the private armaments firms to make profits out of the needs of the nation. One of the first steps should be the abolition of the manufacture of arms by private firms. We should abandon the tedious and cumbersome method of tendering for government supplies. The Government should immediately take control of the armaments industry, and nationalize it completely. We all remember that, when the manufacture of shells was first undertaken in Australia, the agreed-upon price was so much above what it should be that the manufacturers were able to return to the Government 7s. on each shell, showing clearly that private armaments manufacturers are necessarily in a position to exploit the Government during war time. 1 have received from, u constituent a piece of cardboard that, has been made to resemble leather, and is being used in the manufacture of women's and children's shoes. If the Government is not careful, this shoddy material will be used in the making of military boots. It is a remarkably good imitation of leather, although it is only pressed paper; but of course, as soon as it comes in contact with water, it is of no use whatever. </para>
                    <para>The wealthy patriots must not be allowed to get a bond rake-off this time. This war must be financed, differently from  the  last war. Prom the very beginning the Government must make it clear that there are to be no tax-free war loans, and that interest rates arc not to be inflated in order to induce wealthy patriots to part with their money. With little, if any,, prospect of imperial assistance, the Loan Council will be compelled to meet almost immediately to consider measures for the raising of money for war purposes. Never again must the money profiteering of the 1914-18 war period be repeated. The Government has in the Commonwealth Bank to-day a much stronger institution than was at. the disposal of the War Cabinet of the last generation, and we arc no longer bound to the gold standard. Unless the people arc again to be loaded with an intolerable war debt, all internal expenditure must, be financed by the use of the national credit on a cost basis, free of interest. The experience of the years since the depression has demonstrated the degree to which credit expansion can be used for this purpose, and if the present Commonwealth Bank Board stands in the way it must give place to a board prepared to do its part. After obtaining £50,000,000 on loan in Britain at the beginning of the last war, the Australian Government raised in seven separate internal loans* no less than £213,000,000. but so sluggish was the patriotism of those with .money to invest that by the time the last loan was raised the rate of interest, had sky-rocketed to 5 per cent., and the loans were made free of both State and Federal income tax. </para>
                    <para>These huge interest rates remained as a burden for years after the war, and were not reduced until the Labour party, rn 1933, forced the genera.] interest reduction of all government loans, Meanwhile, by a strange transaction under which the Government gave the private banks £3 in notes for each sovereign held in gold, these banks, by special arrangement with the Treasury, made advances up to 90 per cent, to investors, avid  teen  red themselves for a steady 4  per  cent, interest for as long as they held-' the bonds as security. As the result of these transactions the Commonwealth has already paid £3^0,000,000 in interest and sinking fund  (in  the war debt,  yet  it still owes approximately £500.000,000, although -the four ye.ars of war were slated to have most only SS0,p00,C00 a year.  In  addition to these payments the &lt;  Government  for years lost the whole of the income tax that should have been paid on dividends from war bonds.. Tax-free loans on this occasion must be resisted from thu outset. The maximum interest rate to be paid  on  loan money that  cannot  be obtained from the Commonwealth Bank  should  be fixed by the Federal Parliament, a.nd should not exceed 3 per cent. Workers serving in the army have their rates cut to '6s. a day, and investors in war loans should be prepared to make a similar sacrifice. The private wealth of Australia is officially estimated at nearly £4,000,000,000. anil the (rovern.ni.ent must, call upon this reservoir of financial strength. If the " patriots " are not prepared to do their best, without claiming exemption from income tax and excessive interest rates., the Government has a clear duty. tt;s policy on this aspect of the war must be defined without delay, t well remember an advertisement exhibited throughout Australia., when, an effort was being made to induce the people to unload their private wealth. A poster depicted a. soldier in action, and in large type were the words "  Lend  the way they fight;" but -the soldiers received no interest. </para>
                    <para>F claim that the Government has definitely sold out on the question  of  unemployment. This week t drew the attention of the Prime Minister to the position of the wool and basil workers in Sydney, and to the fact that 500 men would finish their employment to-day if action was not taken by the Government, to obtain wool for scouring and carbonizing purposes. I. received a letter to-day from the secretary of the Wool and Basil Workers </para>
                    <para class="block">Federation, who told tin.' that 500 men had  received  notice of termination of their employment, if, however, the Prime Minister could arrange for a supply of woo! sufficient t&lt;&gt; carry the works over next week, thesis men would be assured, of continuity of employment;, because it is hoped that by the time the forthcoming wool sale is held a sufficient supply will lie available at the scours. The Prime Minister promised to treat the matter as urgent, but I emphasize the fact that these men are finishing work  to-night.  The Government should act at once to enable the men engaged in wool washing at Botany and in Melbourne to re'tain their employment. Lt is a tragedy that "&gt;(IQ men should lose two or three weeks' work. Some temporary arrangement should be made whereby a quantity of wool could be allowed on commission to the companies concerned for scouring and c.arbonizing purposes. </para>
                    <para>The problem of employment has never been seriously grappled with by the present Government. Since 1930 no  other  subject has occupied more space in the newspapers, more time and thought, or so much attention as a useful political football by the opponents of the Labour party, as has that of unemployment, lt will be recalled that, at the 1931 federal elections, the United A'ustralia party used unemployment as its main issue. We remember the slogan : " Vote United Australia party and get a job ". At the 1934 elections apparently everybody had not. got a job, despite the slogans, because the story then was that a Minister for Employment would be appointed and all worries would disappear. At the 1937 elections unemployment was not a popular issue with the Labour party's opponents. They had failed to put all of our people back to work under decent conditions and on a living wage. The promised Minister for Employment had not materialized. So Labour's opponents wrapped unemployment up with defence and said there must be a " national effort ". To-day thousands of our people are still unemployed. Many hundreds of them have never been employed. One cannot realize, until one lias personally come in contact with such cases, what the effect of never  having  worked can have on the human mind. It means a breaking down of morale, a sapping of all the desirable attributes which go towards making a democratic citizen, useful to himself and to the community. </para>
                    <para>But this stark tragedy means nothing to the anti-Labour Government in this Parliament. It hopes that, for the present time, the expanded defence programme will absorb large numbers of the unemployed. But what of th\' future? It has no plan to meet the situation. It had no plan in the past, and it goes blindly into the future while thousands of our people are in misery. The Labour party has a comprehensive programme, designed not only to provide employment, but also to make provision for the relief of the unemployable. At the 1936 triennial conference of the Australian Labour party, held in Adelaide, it was resolved that the problem of adequately feeding, clothing and housing the unemployed, in default of the provision of remunerative employment, was primarily the duty of governments. </para>
                    <para> In July last the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> published a report indicating the  serious  effects of unemployment in my electorate. It pointed out that, of nearly 350 boys between the ages of six and eleven years, assembled in the yard of the Erskineville public school, a third were without boot i, and nearly all of them were without coats. Many of the girls were in threadbare cotton frocks and were without petticoats, whilst not one - neither boy nor girl - wore an overcoat. In Australia, which is claimed to be God's own country, it is appalling that little children should have to attend school under-nourished and under-clothed. entirely unequipped mentally or physically to benefit from their lessons. Although the girls were  more  completely clothed than the boys, it was stated that many of them were, dressed in secondhand clothing given by sympathisers. Singlets were the exception rather than the rule, and other underclothing was of the cheapest kind, and had been worn for so long that it had  lost  all its warming qualities. Similar conditions are. to be found in the schools in Alexandria, "Newtown and Botany. We are supposed to be building a glorious nation, but school children are being stunted and starved, and will have no chance in life, because this Government </para>
                    <para class="block">Las decided not to assist the unemployed to the degree that they are entitled to be helped. </para>
                    <para>The Treasurer stated that last year the expenditure on civil aviation was £736,000, and that the Government is budgeting for 1939-40 at £1,435,000, which is almost double the sum expended last year. I hope that there will be improved administration of airports during the ensuing year. It is regrettable that statements appear in newspapers such as that published in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Mommy</inline><inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of the 16th August, to the effect that four of the most efficient control officers of the Civil Aviation Department are believed to be seeking positions outside the service because of dissatisfaction with the administration and with the conditions of employment. These nien are receiving low wages, and their services will no doubt be sought after in other countries. No encouragement is given to these men to rise to high positions in the air force, because the Government is adopting a niggardly policy in one of the most important arms of the defence force. </para>
                    <para>On the same day the following paragraph appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Mommy Hamid : -</inline> lt is proposed to open and put the huge 114- ton sliding doors of the new Rose Bay hangar with a hand winch, instead, of an' electric winch, because the latter will cost an additional £200. </para>
                    <para>The doors to the hangar, which will house two flying-boats, have been built in eight sections, each of which is estimated to weigh eight tons. They arc fabricated with steel and covered with other heavy material. </para>
                    <para>It was stated yesterday that a hand winch would cost £8i50, and that an electric winch could bc obtained for £1,060. </para>
                    <para class="block">It is deplorable that the Government should revert to the old days of hand winches in order to save a few paltry pounds. </para>
                    <para>I again draw attention to the plight of the old-age pensioners. It is stated in the budget speech that invalid and old-age pensions are estimated to cost this year £16,700,000, an increase of £70S,000. "The Government claims that it is doing everything possible for the pensioners. When asked yesterday if he had been invited to attend a demonstration in the. Sydney Domain with regard to the conditions of the pensioners, the Prime Minister replied in the negative, and said that the Government had no intention of giving a.n increase to  the  pensioners. I claim that owing to the increased cost of living the present payment of £1 a week is quite insufficient. When a pensioner goes into a hospital he receives only 6s. a week, and this imposes a grave hardship.' If a male pensioner happens to have a wife, who is probably also in receipt of the pension, it means that she receives only 26s. a' week on which to maintain herself, to supply her husband with the comforts to which he is entitled during periods of illness, and to pay rent, which would bc about 17s. 6d. a week. </para>
                    <para>In presenting the 1938-89 budget, the Government stated definitely that it intended to bring about a reciprocal agreement with the Government of New Zealand for the purpose of regarding residence in New Zealand as equivalent to residence in Australia for pension purpases. I regret that the Government do not intend to fulfil the promise contained in the 193S-39 budget. </para>
                    <para>I wish now to refer to rates of pay in the Navy. The Government promised some time ago that it would look into the representations that had been made, but I find that no provision whatever has been made in the budget for an increase of pay for these men, so apparently the Government has simply been engaging in kits-flying. When the time comes for it to give effect to its  undertakings  it om ite to do so. This unfair treatment is objectionable not only to the men themselves but also to the general public who naturally expect the Government to give our naval men a fair deal. The whole subject has been a bone of contention with the naval ratings for many years. The mcn have endeavoured to secure the  re-appointment  of their welfare committees to organize on their behalf, but even that proposal has been disallowed by the Government. The review of service conditions did not provide for the reappointment of the welfare committees. I admit that what: was done was better than nothing, but it was not enough. The men definitely prefer their welfare committees to the arrangements that are now in force. Their major request, however, is that their rate of pay shall be increased, for it is totally inadequate as most of thom, are married. Although they are doing vitally important work, under our present conditions, no voice can be raised mi their behalf during the war. Militiamen receive 8s. a day- while they are in camp, and that is darwin excess of the rate being paid to the naval men.  </para>

                        (Wilmot) [12.4J .Parliament is meeting under the dark shadow of war. Although I was only young at the time, I well remember the beginning of the war in 1914. I recollect also many s)f the sentiments expressed at that time. The various slogans that were frequently uttered, such as "Eight, for King and country", "Might against right",  Help to bring in a new world ", and so on found n ready' response from the people. I agreed with many of them, and 1 am bitterly disappointed to-day to find that we are again at war. Those slogans were designed to develop a war-like spirit among our people and to encourage self sacrifice throughout the war period. Unhappily, all the sacrifices that were made have proved to bp in vain, and many of the slogans have proved to be entirely unjustified. The peace terms, for which the statesmen and politicians of the time, were responsible, unfortunately had within them the elements which have caused the present war. I therefore express the hope that when peace is again achieved it will be based upon conditions which will make for genuine concord and, if I may say so, have a Christian back. ground. Our statesmen and politicians should pay the closest attention to the requirements of justice and honour so that at the end of this war an enduring peace may be won.
                    </para>
                    <para>As a business man, I am naturally interested in the financial basis of this budget. 1 must confess that in some ways the budget, appeals me. We have been told that this is a war budget, but in actual fact very little provision is made in it foi- war purposes. The document consists largely of the usual statement of the financial activities of the Government in the last financial year, and of the estimates of revenue and expenditure for the current year. We have been told that the Estimates do not really cover war operations. In other words, this is a budget of preparation. Notwithstanding these observations by government supporters tile budget forecasts the raising of £19,000.000 by way of loan for, so we are told, defence requirements. In peace time it is, in .my opinion, absolutely wrong to meet, defence expenditure from loan sources. Such provision should be made from revenue. After war actually occurs the situation may well be altered. In those circumstances it; may become necessary to finance war operations from loan or credit, expansion so that normal expenditure may be met from revenue. </para>
                    <para>During the last year or two certain disquieting financial tendencies have become apparent. I refer, in the first place, to our increasing national debt. The national debt in the last, year, for example, has increased by £20,000,000. Throughout the period since the end of the last Avar the public debt for which the Commonwealth Government is responsible, has decreased slightly year by year, but the combined debts of Commonwealth and State governments have increased by approximately £120,000,000. I have no doubt that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> will tell us that this increase is due to State expenditure; but even if that be admitted, the responsibility is largely this to Common wealth policy, for the Commonwealth Government has refused to shoulder the responsibility for unemployment in this country, and lias left it for the States to meet. I well remember that during the election campaign before last the late Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> made a statement to the effect that the task of coping with unemployment had gone almost beyond the financial resources of the States and that it would therefore be necessary for the Commonwealth Government to co-operate with the State governments in relieving the position. In my opinion Commonwealth co-operation since that time has been meagre, for the responsibility of financing relief works has been thrown almost entirely upon the State governments. I therefore say that although the public debt for which the Commonwealth Government is responsible has not increased very greatly, it is due to the action of the Commonwealth Government iu shelving its responsibility in respect of unemployment; </para>
                    <para>In 1930-31 we were faced with a very serious adverse trade balance. Our credit in Great Britain had become practically exhausted. It seems to mc that there is a danger of our drifting into the same situation again. The budget states that our exports, including gold, gave us a surplus of only between £8,000,000 and £9,000,000 last year. 1 refer, of course, to operations between Great Britain and Australia. Bearing in mind the amount of interest that we were under obligation to pay in Great Britain our situation was most unsatisfactory. War conditions will probably rectify things this year, and may save the face of the Government by preventing a recurrence of the state of affairs which the Scullin Government had to meet when it assumed office. </para>
                    <para>Another matter which concerns me greatly and will also have. its effect upon the pockets of our people relates to taxation. The policy which the Government is applying seems designed to permit the rich to escape with only relatively light additional imposts, while obliging the poor to submit to * additional heavy taxation. This is due to the very greatly increased volume of indirect, taxation. The budget discloses that only about one-third of the total revenue of the Government is derived from direct taxation. Probably I shall be told in answer to this statement that direct taxation is very much more severe under State legislation than under Commonwealth enactments, and that if combined Commonwealth and State direct and indirect taxation were reviewed it would be found that direct, taxation practically equalled indirect taxation. Personally I think direct taxation should be very much more substantial than indirect taxation. In 1930-31 the Commonwealth revenue from customs duties was £2S,29o,073, but last year the figures jumped to the huge total of £47,632,365. an increase of £19,337,292. That is only one avenue of indirect taxation. Let us consider for a moment the sales tax. Last year the amount of sales tax collected was almost double what it was in 1931-32. </para>
                    <para>It is true that the Scullin Government was responsible for the introduction of the  sales  tax- I should like to make it, quite, clear at this stage that I am not in favour of sales taxation - but honorable members must bear in mind the state in which the Labour party found the finances of the country when it assumed office. Australia was practically bankrupt: our imports exceeded our exports by millions of pounds a year; our credit from Great Britain had ceased, and it was necessary that drastic steps should be taken to clean up the financial mess left by the previous government. One of those steps was to impose what in some cases was a prohibitive tariff, and in other cases represented a. very large increase over previous duties. That was done to enable certain Australian industries to operate on a paying basis and to correct the adverse tirade balance between Australia and Great Britain. In fact, that tariff schedule was necessary in order to preserve the solvency of this country. One effect of this was to 'bring about a huge falling-off of customs receipts, and the Government had to impose a sales tax in order partly to offset that heavy revenue loss. The tariff has subsequently been restored to its former rates, and once more imported manufactured goods are flooding the Australian market. Last -year we were once again very close to having an adverse overseas trade balance, and. if the amount of interest paid to Great Britain is taken into consideration, we actually did have an adverse 'trade balance. During last year the Government, collected nearly £60,000,000 by means of customs duties and sales, tax, and we have just passed legislation which it is estimated will increase the receipts from sales tax from £9,000.000 to £11,000,000, whilst in his budget, speech the Treasurer hinted that an even further increase might be necessary. At any rate, a few days ago a statement appeared in the press to the effect that the sales tax was being fully investigated, so it appears that when the supplementary war budget is brought. down <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> further extension of the sales tax to lines at present exempted will be announced. A great proportion of the burden of the sales tax is placed upon the ordinary citizens of the Commonwealth. Some honorable members will no doubt claim that many items are exempted from the sales tax for the benefit of the workers, but that is only partly true, and that small benefit may be even less if the range of the tax is extended as suggested. One of the biggest items of expenditure, especially among large families, is clothing. I ask honorable members how many lines of ordinary clothing are exempt from sales tax at the present time? There is only one line that I know of, and that is footwear. I challenge any honorable member to name any item of drapery used by the working people that is exempt from sale" tax. The taxation policy of this country should be so adjusted that those who are best able to pay should bc made to pay. </para>
                    <para>An aspect of indirect taxation is that taxpayers pay not only the amount of indirect taxation collected by the Government, but also tax on profits. Let me give an illustration. A business is generally run on a. percentage basis. If a business man imports £100 worth of goods into Australia and after paying customs duty, sales tax, &lt;fcc, he finds that the cost of the goods to him has risen to £150, he seeks to recover approximately half as much again on the goods from the consumer. That means he is collecting profit on the taxes paid to the Government. It is clear, therefore, that this form of taxation is very undesirable and, except insofar as it applies to luxuries and to the protection of local industries, I am opposed to it. lt is also true that direct taxation is passed on, but my experience of business is that direct taxation is not passed on to nearly the same  degree  as indirect taxation. 1. urge the Government, in reviewing the financial position and devising ways of raising revenue by taxes, to take into consideration the fact that. -the* form of -indirect taxation imposes a heavy burden upon the workers of the country, well beyond their capacity to pay. l.n my electorate there are married mcn with families working for 25s. a week and double rations, and they have to pay sales tax on almost all of the necessities of life they buy. If the intention is to extend the field of sales tax as was hinted in the Treasurer's budget, speech, then apparently the workers will have to pay sales tax on commodities which  are  at present exempt. How. can people living on sustenance- afford to carry that burden? Rather than ask the poorer people of the community - those on the lowest rungs of the social ladder - to pay more taxes, the Government should obtain the necessary revenue from people with higher incomes, lt is only right that those who hold the wealth of this country should be prepared to make some sacrifice in order to finance the war. If the workers are taxed any more they will have nothing left to them. </para>
                    <para>One other matter which .strikes me as being very important at the present time is the general question of financial policy. The policy outlined by the Treasurer in the budget speech is in keeping with the general trend of policy applied by this Government and its immediate predecessors. At the present moment sound finance is essential to the welfare of the people of Australia. After all is said and done, <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> am firmly of the opinion that there are. two factors of production which contribute to- the wealth of a country - nature and the workers, <inline font-style="italic">hi the</inline> final analysis it is the workers of a country who pay all taxation. From the last war <inline font-style="italic">we</inline> have a legacy of interest on debt amounting to £7 ,.500.000 a year. Our national debt is increasing year by year, and although I do not believe that an increasing national debt is a bad tiling, so long as there is a compensating increase of national assets, what is the position with which we are faced at the present time? </para>
                    <para class="block">If one can .visualize the cost of 'the last war in wastage of money and man-power, and in the suffering of the people, then one can appreciate what our obligations will, be during the present conflict. The war will not increase the wealth of this country; in. fact, we shall be very lucky if our total wealth does not 'decrease considerably. At the present time, the combined annual interest commitments of the States and the Commonwealth amount to £46.000,000 a year, and in some States the annual interest, commitment exceeds the direct revenue. We wonder, therefore, if the Commonwealth Government is doing its duty to the people of this land. It is its responsibility to introduce some scheme to ensure that after this war is over and we have won the victory which we arc all confident we shall win, the. workers of this country will not find that they have won the war only to live in a state of poverty, amounting almost to serfdom. I repeat that the workers produce the wealth of this country, and knowing how they suffered during and after the last war, owing to the dislocation of industry and increased prices for the necessaries of life, I earnestly appeal to the Government to give careful consideration to the financial position in order to prevent a repetition of conditions that obtained after the last war. It should take action to keep interest rates at a low level and use the credit of the nation to the best advantage, as the Parliament of Canada is reported to be doing at the present  t  i mo. When we say that the Government should tap the reservoir of social credit, we do not mean that it should print an endless supply of notes, thus causing undue inflation of the currency, with its attendant consequences, because we fully realize that a government cannot inflate the currency beyond certain limits without inflicting hardship on the people. But under existing methods of finance Australia's credit is being used solely for the profit of private finance and banking institutions. All that Labour now asks of the Government is that it give earnest consideration to the utilization of that, great reservoir of credit in the interests of the nation. Unless this is done, the: workers will be" apprehensive lest their laying standards be further 'reduced and greater demands be made upon them for thu upkeep of the nation. If the Government does not face its responsibilities, it will not he long before the workers decide that a Labour government must occupy the treasury -bench. </para>
                    <para>Any dislocation -of the export trade in apples and pears would affect Tas.manian growers more than producers in mainland States, approximately 3,000,000 bushels of apples and pears being exported annually from the island State. Following the outbreak of the war, the growers have been notified that all shipping space for fruit has been cancelled. This announcement has caused great dismay among producers. Representatives of Tasmania in this Parliament will recall that during the last war, owing to the difficulty of obtaining freight space on overseas ships, fruit was allowed to rot on the trees. Growers now fear that that experience will be repeated. Whilst I realize the extraordinary difficulties confronting the Government in. this crisis, I appeal to the Ministry to use all its influence to secure a reasonable amount of shipping space for Tasmanian fruit during the coming season. As all honorable members know, it is essential that such perishable products as fruit should be disposed of quickly, and that the market be stabilized so that approximately half of the Australian crop may be exported. If it be impossible to obtain adequate shipping  space, the only alternative is to can the fruit. Certain varieties of apples and pears are suitable for canning and will remain in a state of preservation for four or five years. They could bo used to augment food supplies for British soldiers on active service. Canning facilities are available in Tasmania, but suitable containers must be provided and the growers must be financed so that they may hold the canned product for 2 or 3 years before marketing it. I trust that the Government will give favorable consideration to my representations in this matter so that fruit-growers throughout the Commonwealth will not be penalized as they were during the last war. Honorable members will understand that the work of orchardists must be carried on uninterruptedly in order to prevent deterioration of the orchards. Unless orchards are properly cultivated and trees  pruned, future yields will be uncontrolled and the orchards will run wild. </para>
                    <para>Potato-growing is another important primary industry in Tasmania. Lately it has been given a good deal of prominence in the press, owing to the high level of prices reached in mainland markets a few months ago and "the decision of the Government to remove the ban on the importation of potatoes from New Zealand. I appreciate that that was done in the interests of consumers. It should be realized, however, that producers in Tasmania have experienced many poor seasons, and for many years were compelled to dispose of their crops below the cost of production. Therefore, it is only fair, when relatively high prices prevail owing to climatic conditions, that the growers should be allowed to recoup themselves for losses sustained in other years. It was unfair on the part of the Government to lift the embargo on New Zealand potatoes. I concede that the Australian market was not flooded with New Zealand potatoes last season, but that was due to the coincidence of a poor New Zealand, crop. I, and other representatives of the producers, have tried to obtain an assurance from the Prime Minister regarding the Government's proposals for the marketing of potatoes, but so far we have not obtained a definite answer. It is not right, that potato-growers should be kept in suspense. They do not know whether to increase their acreage or not, and so far as I can see, the Government has not taken any action to assure them that their interests will be protected. I hope that the Government will make a clear statement of its policy in this matter. </para>
                    <para>When the Minister for Supply and Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> visited Tasmania recently, he stated that he favoured 'the decentralization of the sources of defence supplies, and that the work of his department would be spread over all of the States. That must have been an attractive form of speech intended to tickle the ears of the Tasmanian people for propaganda purposes. A return prepared by the Department of Supply and Development proves the inaccuracy of the Minister's statement. It shows that expenditure on defence sup- plies during 1938-39 was allocated as follows:- New South Wales, £250,000; Victoria, £2,0S3,000; Queensland, £2,250; South Australia, £2,200; Western Australia, £2,700; and Tasmania, £300. I wonder that the Government waa able to spare even that amount for poor  little Tasmania which always receives scant consideration. I realize that the business of the Supply and Development Department cannot be distributed evenly over all States, but I regard the allocation of £300 to Tasmania as an insult to the enterprise of that State. A much larger proportion of the expenditure could have been allocated to it. I appeal to the Government to distribute as equally as possible the sources of supply of war materials during the coming year. </para>
                    <para>It is regrettable that the budget makes no provision for widows and orphans'" pensions. During my travels in Tasmania, I have come in contact with many poor people and I know of the hardships they are experiencing. In some homes I have seen girls of thirteen or fourteen years of age mothering as many as three or four little children, while their widowed mothers have hired themselves out for scrubbing and washing in order to earn money for the education and maintenance of their children. Honorable members may say that the Social Service Department of Tasmania will care for such people, but the amounts granted by that department are not sufficient for large families. I cast no reflection on the Tasmanian Government in this connexion, because it is hampered by the finance made available to it by the Commonwealth Government. Many unfortunate women have to supplement their allowances from the Social Services Department by doing washing and scrubbing work. I have no intention pf belittling these people; on the contrary I admire their determination to help in the maintenance of their families in decent conditions. It is the duty of the Commonwealth Government, even in wartime, to ensure that mothers are kept in their homes to give the care which they only can give to children at the impressionable period of their development. I do not expect the Government to provide luxuries for these people, but I do ask it to give them sufficient of the necessaries of life- to make the children happy and contented so that in future years they will feel that they belong to a country worth fighting for. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to deal briefly w ill i the subject of defence, more particularly in relation to Tasmania. At the present time, a number of our political opponents are advocating compulsory universal service, and some of them are going so far as to advocate the sending of an expeditionary force over-, seas. It would be an absolute mistake for the Government to attempt to introduce compulsory universal service. Even no«' it is embarrassed by reason of the number of men volunteering to serve in the forces in the present emergency. Undoubtedly a large section of the community is opposed to compulsory universal service. They would resent its introduction and dissension would be caused throughout Australia. </para>

                        <para>, - The committee has not, so far as I have heard the debate, challenged the Government, except by innuendo, with "any extravagance in respect of its budget. It is true that, the comment has been made that the increase of the budget is substantially due, not so much to war expenditure, as to the amount for defence which has to be borne by revenue this year, compared with previous years. After ali, expenditure can lie challenged only on the ground of extravagance or "inefficiency in respect of the services rendered, and so far as 1 have been able to gather there has been no challenge on that ground, except, as I say, by suggestion. I am sure that every member of the committee realizes that the country is growing year by year, and that that growth imposes additional demands on the Government, with the result that our budgets progressively increase, just as they do in every other country in which added demands are made from year to year. So to-day we find that we have a record budget. I am confident that the Opposition, does not suggest that there should be a reduction of social services, including pensions and repatriation, and the amounts paid to those who are in the services. There has ,Deen no other suggestion as to how money could be saved. As the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> has indicated, before the budget was brought down every attempt was made to cut out the dead wood and to sec that the minimum of expenditure was incurred, consistent with the obligations which the Government has to discharge. It cannot be said, merely because the budget is enlarged, that that enlargement is due to extravagance or mismanagement. Thus we start with the premise that we have <inline font-style="italic">u</inline> budget, to meet in respect of essential social services and obligations. The main attack appears to have been directed to the method by which we propose to finance, our obligations. In this respect, there has been a good deal of comment to the effect that indirect taxation has been increased but tha ti direct, taxation ha? been left substantially untouched. The charge is, that the Government is lending itself to the taxing of the poor and the protection of the rich. I believe that a moment's reflection will reveal how futile - if I may say so - is that allegation. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> drew attention to the amount raised hy way of direct taxation in 1931- 32, and compared it with the estimate in the budget now before the committee. May I say, first, that the honorable gentleman took as his starting point the depression years, for a reason which I suggest is obvious - so that the contrast might be the more distinct. Again, he presented to the committee only one-half of the picture. Every 'member of the committee knows that bit, by bit the States have invaded the field of direct taxation. The States have a limited field in which to tax; they have a very small field of indirect taxation. Further, if one compares the years taken, by threader of the Opposition, one finds that in 1931-32 the direct taxes imposed by the States realized £25,95S,000, whilst in 1937-38 the amount so raised was increased by nearly £14,000,000 to £39,540,000. Although these direct taxes are imposed by the States for different services, they fall on the same set of taxpayers. In order to get a true picture one must look to see what amount of direct taxation is imposed throughout the Commonwealth by both the Commonwealth and the State. Parliaments, and one must have regard to the fact that the States occupy practically three-quarters of the field of direct taxation. But the matter is not finished there. Every honorable member knows how harsh were the conditions in 1931, at the depth of the depression. The Leader of the Opposition, has chosen a year when the purchasing power- of money had increased by reason of the drop of prices in respect of both services, and commodities, and the burden was easier for those upon whom it was cast. In this year of grace, prices are rising, and I expect ' that during the years that are ahead of us there will probably be a tendency for thom to rise still further. With any increase of prices, there will be a lessened purchasing power of money, and consequently a greater burden, even if only the same amount bo collected as when prices arc low. The matter does not stop there, however. During the last three or four years the Commonwealth has increased direct taxes as compared with indirect taxes. The budget contemplates that this year the sum of £62,850,000 will be collected from indirect taxes compared with £52,020,924 collected in 1935-36. That- is an increase of a little over 20 per cent. Direct taxes are expected to yield £17,160,000 in 1939-40, compared with £11,596,382 in' .1935-36- an increase of 50 per cent. That is to say, for the same period it is expected that' the yield from indirect taxes will increase by 20 per cent., whereas the yield from direct taxes will be about 50 per cent, greater. If we compare last year with the current financial year we find that indirect taxation  is being increased by 7 per cent, and direct taxation hy 12 per cent. Therefore it cannot be suggested that this Government is seeking progressively to load the burden on the general wage-earners. Reflection will show that there are only three fields of indirect taxation - first, customs and excise; secondly, the sales tax; and thirdly, the flour tax. Honorable members will not need to be told that the substantial increase of indirect taxes derived from customs and excise is due to the increase of imports. During the years 3 931-32, the period which was chosen by the Leader of the Opposition, imports fell substantially ; but since that time there has been a marked increase of imports, with a correspondingly increased yield from customs and excise. Having regard to the real situation, the allegation that, the Government is seeking to protect the wealthy by keeping direct taxation low cannot he sustained. In order to increase further the yield from direct taxes lbs only substantial field which may be attacked is one which includes the field of middle incomes between, say, £400 and £.800 per annum. </para>

                            <para>- I am endeavouring to show the residue of the field that can be attacked by way of direct taxation. We must have regard to the total amount which is taken by both the Commonwealth and the States. The maximum rate in respect of income from property in Queensland is 16s. 2d. in the £1 . The comparable figures for Tasmania are 13s. 7d. and 14s. 9d. in the £1. In the light of these figures, it is idle to say that much more money can be extracted from person.? with the highest incomes. No doubt it is possible to get a little more; but it is not possible to get the amount which it is suggested could -be raised, and still carry on essential services. </para>

                            <para>- The figures for each State are - lt must bc remembered that in this matter the Commonwealth cannot discriminate between States; any taxes that it imposes must apply throughout, the Com mon wealth. In contemplating further imposts,, the Commonwealth Government must have regard to the effect on incomes in all of the States, and try to avoid causing undue hardship. .1 realize that these figures are unpalatable to honorable members opposite, who urge the Government to increase direct taxes and who allege that we are. taking taxes from the pockets of the poor. A study of these figures will show that the largest, available field of direct taxation is substantially the middle range of incomes, but no member of the Opposition has been prepared to urge the Government to enter that field. So much for the contention that the Government should concentrate on the man who is already carrying the burden which I have indicated. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue><para>It is also stated -by honorable members opposite that customs and excise duties bear most heavily on the wage-earners. Again, reflection will show that, although in many instances these duties are passed on, there, are substantial imposts on many luxury items, such as motor cars, petrol, the better classes of textiles, wine and spirits, and  machinery  which do not touch, or barely touch, the wage-earners. I invite members of the committee, particularly those who have declared that direct taxation can be increased, to show precisely how effect could be given to their contention. It is not sufficient to say that heavier direct taxes should be levied; the onus is on those who make that claim to show that such a field exists. It is certainly not my desire to impose taxes upon those persons in the community who are on the breadline, for I know how difficult life is for them. If the sales tax touches this class, then I say that the present Government learned from a Labour government how to obtain additional revenue by its imposition. When first imposed, the sales tax was at the rate of 6 per cent. During the intervening years, the rate has fluctuated ; it is again 6 per cent. If we have regard to the available field of direct taxation, I think that it will be found that there is little ground for the complaint that the Government is taxing the poor. I should like honorable members opposite to show what effective way is open to increase direct taxation substantially other than by a. method which will increase the burden upon the middle incomes of between, say, £400 and £800 a year. </para><para>I come to another matter, the methed of financing the programme that lies ahead of us this year. It is said that, we are not carrying enough on what is loosely called the credit structure of the country. I admit, quite definitely that money is not for the purpose of determining how people shall live ; I believe that the credit structure should be such as to permit people to live and to live properly. But it is just as idle to say, for example, that war is a reason for inflation as it is to say in time of peace that there is no reason why we should use the credit structure of the country. Credit is available for the purpose of the nation, whether it be at peace or at war. A question that arises, ho"\\ - ever is as to the limits to which the credit structure can ho used. It is easy to say in general terms that the resources of the country shall bc used within economic limits, but it is another thing to say precisely where the process shall finish. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(.Mr. Curtin)</inline> says, " Look at Germany. It has used the credit -structure with the result that there is no unemployment there, or substantially no unemployment ". That may be perfectly true, but again the Leader of the Opposition has not given the full picture. I am not prepared, and I doubt if the honorable member is prepared, to go to the lengths which are involved in the full picture. If wc did we should have to peg wages, as they have been pegged in Germany, control exchanges, ration essential supplies, and impose high taxes right down the scale. Finally, we should have to do as Germany did when. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Schacht</inline> said, " The credit structure will bear no more " ; we should have to take the responsibility of "sacking" the man who said that, because he said it, and appoint some one else in his place. I cannot understand why members of the Opposition, who represent and advocate very strongly and genuinely the interests of the workers, say that our problems may be met by the simple expedient of making more money available, since once the stage of inflation was reached, as it would necessarily be. reached unless a limit were set, the people on the breadline would be taxed because their purchasing power would be reduced. In my view that is the worst possible form of indirect taxation. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- I have not said so aud no other Minister has said so. It is very ,easy to make these statements - just as easy as it is to say that any problem can be solved by expanding credit. If the problems which confront us were capable of such easy solution as that, I could not understand any treasury or any bank resisting such a temptation. If prosperity automatically follows the expansion of credit, obviously no bank or government would resist it as the easiest possible method of attacking a problem. What I regard as a shallow approach to this problem is the Opposition's cry, " Look at what the Banking Commission said : ' The Commonwealth Bank can make lcans to the Government free of interest ' " ! No one disputes that. Any .member of the committee, if he cared to do so, could jump from the tenth floor of a building to the ground. A quite different question is: Would he do it? It is idle to point to this report and say that the Commonwealth Bank could, if it wanted to, advance money to the Government or any person free of interest. In actual fact, if one analyses again, that is precisely what is not being done in Germany. Germany pays interest on its long-term loans; Italy and Japan do likewise. I should like the members of the committee to consider the argument that unless money is advanced free of interest, the people pay twice in respect of the same work. May i take the example given by the Leader of the Opposition, who said, " If you get X pounds to establish a particular work, you have your work for the X pounds expended upon it, but you also have to pay interest on it ". He did not tell the committee that you have the use of that work while paying the interest. In the establishment of any project, you have on the one hand the capital cost plus interest until the capital is recouped, and on the other the use of the work, less depreciation. It is elementary that sound finance dictates that interest should not exceed the value of that use less depreciation. That, of course, involves a consideration of the economic value of the work. It is of no use for the Leader of the Opposition to put a proposition like  that before the committee, because the belief is created - and one has to meet it in fashion - that any financial problem oan be solved in this simple manner; I agree as to the necessity to use the credit resources of the country for national purposes. The Government does not resist that. Obviously, in the years immediately ahead, credit may have to be resorted to very substantially. As the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> showed in his budget speech, it has already been resorted to. To that, honorable members of the Opposition responded by saying : " The banks have become more pliable. At last reason is dawning upon them ". That is not the fact; but if it were, it is hard to understand why the Commonwealth Bank should be criticized for moving with the times. The fact is that, as the Treasurer indicated, the Commonwealth Bank, charged as it has been with the necessity for ensuring that there shall be sufficient liquidity of funds in the community, has been more and more assisting the financial structure of this country. I am not suggesting that it must be credited with having done this to the complete satisfaction of everybody, but what is the alternative ? Either we leave this control to appointed experts; or we substitute our judgment completely as to how the credit structure shall be built up. There is no difference of opinion in this committee on the main proposition. All of us agree that the resources of the country should be used for the purpose of its development in the best and most economical manner, but if you simply increase credit and expend the money in such a way that no new resources are employed the result will be inflation. <inline font-style="italic">mw</inline> Martens. - Who has ever suggested that that should be done? </para>

                            <para>- Precisely what limits does the honorable member propose? It is very easy for honorable members opposite to make a popular appeal by simply saying that if they were the Government they would expand the credit base. I ask them to give some indication of the limitations they would impose. Although one statement of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems has been referred to <inline font-style="italic">ad nauseam,</inline> no reference has been made to several other important statements contained in that report. The commission, it is true, states that the Commonwealth Bank can lend to the Government or others in a variety of ways, and it can even make money available to governments or to others free of any charge. No one disputes that. But can honorable members opposite point to any statement in that report in which the commission says that it is advisable to do that? They cannot. If the Commonwealth Bank makes advances to governments and that money is taken out of the past savings of the people, it has to pay interest on such money because it has been borrowed from the people. If, on the other hand, the bank advances credit not based on past savings, we are told that interest should not be paid. What is the result of charging interest? The Commonwealth Bank advances, we will say, on the credit of the country and charges interest, which, goes back into the people's bank, and through the bank to the people. I cannot understand, therefore, what is wrong, with charging interest on advances. There is the further consideration that the bank takes up considerable holdings in public loans and must have negotiable securities; that is one of the best possible methods by which the bank can ensure the liquidity of its assets. I am not one of those who believe that in the past the credit of the country has always been used to the fullest extent desirable, but it is not of much use to seek to make a popular appeal by merely saying that the easiest way to solve  our  financial difficulties is to extend the credit base.- 1 noticed, amongst other matters, that no reference was made by honorable members opposite to paragraph 506 of the commission's report, which reads - </para>

                        <para>On the other hand, the power of the Commonwealth Bank to increase the cash reserves of the trading banks ig not unlimited. The bank ig bound to pay in legal tender money whenever called upon. So long as its power to issue notes is restricted by law, its power to purchase securities or other property, and to lend or grant money to governments or others, is limited. Apart from the legal limitation, there ig a practical limit to the note issue, in that the bank has to consider how far it is in the general interests of the community to expand credit. </para>

                        <para>The increase in money may be carried to such a stage that, although prices rise, there is little or no increase in the total volume of production . . . The effect on prices of an expansion or contraction of money depends on the particular circumstances and is not easy to predict. In general terms, an increase in the supply money tends to raise prices, and a decrease tends to reduce them. </para>

                    <para>All I have to say in conclusion is that this year the Government's loan expenditure will be increased from £4,000,000 to £23,000,000, and that is not final. Indeed, it may also be said that we are not yet finished with direct taxation for this year. The actual past savings of the community are a limited amount and they will unquestionably be drawn upon, together with future savings, in this time of war. The Government, will not hesitate to . use our credit structure in order to ensure that those savings shall be used for the essential development of the country. At the same time, if will see that the profiteers are kept in their place. I realize that in this respect we have stolen much of the thunder of honorable members opposite. They must now realize that the Government is resolute in its determination to stamp out profiteering. Honorable members opposite contend that this Government is always out to assist the man with money. Consequently, they regard its promise to stamp out profiteering as eye-wash. The cold fact, however, is that on this occasion prices have been substantially stabilized and the people thereby protected from profiteering such as took place at the commencement of the last war, when there was an immediate rise of prices, particularly to the detriment of the working man. 1 again invite any honorable members opposite to state in precise terms, and not in generalizations, how, if they were the Government, they would expand credit, and what particular measures they would take to implement their purpose. 1, for one, would be very pleased to be illuminated on that point. If they are not prepared to do that, it is not exactly courageous of them to shelter behind a solitary statement in the report of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems, and to contend that according to that statement the Government is not doing its job. </para>
                    <para>In conclusion, I commend the motives which prompted the Leader of the Opposition to suggest that the Government should make a gift of foodstuffs to the value of £1,000,000 to Great Britain. That suggestion will receive the earnest consideration of the Government. However, lest it, should be suggested that if that course be not pursued by the Government, it is not as desirous as is the Opposition to help Great Britain, I point out that ultimately it is a question of making a gift of money to that amount. Our foodstuffs are going overseas as fast as the available ships can take them. It is not a matter of the supply of foodstuffs, but of freight space. In the ultimate analysis, it is a matter of money. It may be that, after consultation with the Government of Great Britain, a decision will be reached that we can assist Britain better by spending that money in another way. The foodstuffs will go in any case; it is merely a matter of finance. As far as we can see at present, Great Britain is not. in need of finance, but I compliment the Leader of the Opposition on the spirit that prompted the suggestion, and I assure him that it will receive the earnest consideration of the Government. </para>
                    <para>The Government has endeavoured to spread the burden of this budget as equitably as possible. It will not shrink from placing further burdens if practicable on those persons who are alleged to be best able to bear it, but before the war is over it will be found that the burden will be thrown on all of us, and we shall have to  bear  it. </para>

                        In justice to the Opposition, I desire to clarify one or two points which the Assistant Treasurer
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline>
                        rather succeeded in clouding. In the main 1 agree, with the honorable gentleman, who has made a very interesting contribution to this discussion, but, in my opinion, his speech failed, when he1 endeavoured to introduce political propaganda, and by implication and accusation, to misrepresent the. views of the Opposition. He invited us to state our views. I challenge the honorable gentleman to declare where the Opposition has said that credit could bo expanded without limit. He asked us to state in precise language where the limit should be, and I invite him to do the same. He has declared on behalf of the Government which has all the machinery at its disposal for making calculations and surveys of the resources of the country, whilst we have not, that the Government will utilize the credit structure of the country for the carrying on of essential services. I invite him to give a precise definition of what he considers the proper limit. The Labour party has never said that a government should use the national credit, or the credit structure, as the Assistant Minister called it, without, limitation, and I have never presumed to be able to say where the actual limit is; but when I held a. responsible position in this country, and when price levels were falling drastically, when deflation was the order of the day, when people were starving, not because of high prices, but because, due. to the fall of prices, there was no employment, we attempted n small measure of credit expansion, in order to provide employment and assist wheat-growers. Even then, however, we took the precaution of saying that we would watch price levels carefully, and would not let them rise above the price, levels of 1929. "We did not fix that, limit by chance. We fixed it because 1929 was the end of a fairly stable period of five or six years. The depression was brought about by the deflationary policy of those who restored the gold standard so that the moneys they had accumulated during the war, and invested in long-term securities at fixed rates of interest, would yield them a higher return because of a reduction of prices. The primary industries all over the world were almost destroyed because of the greed and selfishness of the
                        <inline font-style="italic">rentier</inline>
                        Class. We declared as a government - and the real test is what one would do as a government - that we would not allow any expansion of the credit structure to raise prices beyond the 1929 level. I admit at once that the power of a government successfully to use the national credit is greatly restricted unless it also has power to fix prices. The present Government is assuming that power under the National Security Act, and I am glad. I am not at all jealous that our thunder has been stolen. I do not want any thunder - I want justice for the people. I emphatically refute, however, the suggestion that the Labour party stands for unlimited expansion of credit and inflation. Moreover, we are emphatically opposed to allowing the private banks to expand credit in order to make profits, hut we do not hear a word about that from honorable members on the other side.

Every one knows that the private banks expanded credit during the last war, which was financed, to a very large extent, hy inflation of money and prices at the expense of the masses of the people. The interests that benefited most by inflation were the private banking institutions, and they were allowed to do so. We all know that, they practised inflation. The more you give them as a basis of credit the more they will inflate, and they were encouraged to do it during, the last war. We know that any one depositing £10 with a hank was able to buy a Government £100 bond, and pay the rest over a period of years. The whole process was one of inflation, and it was practised in every country, with the result that the war was fought at the expense of the masses of toilers. It was not until 1929 that the basic wage, which had for years been chasing the cost of living, finally  caught  up with it. Knowing that, our party would not stand for a policy of inflation, which is an indirect and ruthless method of reducing wages and other purchasing power.

                    <para>I desire to make clear an observation on the note issue. I do not believe that a gold reserve is of any value in restricting the expansion of the note issue. The only worth-while restriction - and there should be a restriction, because it would be dangerous not to have one - is a statutory provision limiting the amount of the note issue. Of what use is it to say that the note issue must have a 25 per cent, gold hacking, and to expect that such a provision will prevent inflation, when the bank board, if it so desired, can print, .i million pounds worth of notes, buy a million pounds of gold with them, and on that basis print another £4,000,000 worth of notes, and go on repeating thai process? The note reserve is a fetish, a superstition. Its only value as a note reserve is the psychological effect it has in inducing the people to accept notes as legal tender. I would not abolish the reserve as it has a value as a national reserve. </para>

                    <para>When the Government of which I was leader desired to ship a portion of the idle gold reserve of this country overseas, and have some use made of it, the minority in this chamber was horrified; the hill was passed by the House of Representatives but was rejected in the Senate. Yet my Government had not been out of office three months when Parliament agreed to send the whole of the gold reserve overseas, and I think that the right thing was done.. It is stupid to have gold lying idle, when it can be kept in the only place where it would be of use. When I am challenged to say whether 1 would abolish the reserve of the note issue, I say that I would not. If the nation experienced a crisis in which it could not balance payments Ky an excess pf exports over imports., and could not meet its obligations without borrowing overseas - a wrong method that was adopted for a number of years before my Government took office - it would be compelled to call upon that reserve in order to prevent default. Therefore, the reserve has a real value. I do not complain about having a reserve; but in my opinion it is not large enough. In 1927, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> was Prime Minister, I pleaded with him from the very place where I now stand to stop the flood of imports into Australia, to cease financing the in by means of overseas loans, and, instead, to build up in London a reserve of £30,000,000 or £40,000,000, so that we should have it there when, the value of our exports would not meet our imports and other charges. I little thought that it would fall to my lot to be the responsible Minister to face a crisis such as I then predicted; but many others had given similar advice that went unheeded. I mention this fact to show that the Assistant Treasurer is not justified in giving the impression to the people of this country that members of the Labour party are wild-cat financiers, since it was .a Labour Government that rescued Australia from the reckless financial dealings of the preceding Government. </para>
                    <para>This war should he prosecuted without profiteering in either goods or money. The most shameful thing done in the last war was to say to people who had money to lend on the credit of the nation that they could get practically double the rate of interest that was obtainable in time of peace, although our soldiers who had been earning 15s. or £1 a day went into the trenches for 6s. a day. That was a scandal, and I hope that it will not be repeated. Whatever methods of finance are employed - and I suppose that every method will be employed, including loans, taxation and the utilization of the credit of the nation through the Commonwealth Bank - I hope that the Government will see that those who have money to lend shall receive, at most, the normal rate of interest if they are not. patriotic enough to lond nt a lower rate when other men are called upon to make much greater sacrifices. I rose merely to make the position of the Labour party clear. </para>

                    <para class="block">This bill, which was foreshadowed in the budget speech, is designed to increase the taxable sale value upon which sales tax is payable by retailers and other persons upon the importation of goods into Australia. The bill will remove a competitive anomaly which at present exists between retailers and wholesalers, in respect of- sales tax payable upon imported goods. The general scheme of the sales tax law is designed  to require the payment of sales tax upon a wholesale selling value of all goods sold in Australia, other than goods in respect of which exemption is authorized by the law. <inline font-style="italic">A</inline> wholesale merchant who imports goods for sale by wholesale is required by the law to enter the goods at the customs free of sales tax, and is subsequently required to pay tax upon the amount for which he sells the goods to retailers for re-sale. It will be realized that exchange is taken into account by the merchant, together with other costs, in arriving at the price for which the goods are sold, and upon which tax is payable. On the other hand, however, a retail merchant who imports goods for sale by retail is required under the existing law to pay sales tax in respect of those goods at the time of entry for home consumption, upon values which arc not, in fact, expressed in terms of Australian currency. In these cases the law requires tax to be paid upon a " sale value " representing an amount which exceeds by twenty per centum the sum of- </para>

                    </list>
                    <para>With few exceptions, such as goods imported from New Zealand, the value for duty of imported goods, for the purposes of customs duty, is expressed in terms of sterling, and not in terms of Australian currency. Thus the taxable sale values for sales tax purposes, which are based on these values for duty, are not related to Australian currency. </para>
                    <para>This point was of little importance in 1930, when the sales tax law was introduced, as the rate of exchange, Australia on London, was then in the vicinity of £106. It is now £125 buying, and £125 10s. selling. This substantial increase has caused the exchange factor to assume considerable importance. It means that a wholesale merchant who pays tax on his Australian currency sale prices of imported goods is at a considerable disadvantage from a sales tax point of view, in competition with a retailer who imports comparable goods and pays sales tax on values which are based on sterling. </para>
                    <para>It may be explained that the provision in the existing law for the addition of 20 per cent. to the sum of the value for duty and the duty to ascertain the taxable sale value for sales tax purposes was not designed to cover the exchange factor. It was designed to arrive at a figure which would include other importing costs, together with a reasonable measure of profit to the importer, and which would, in general, represent the fair wholesale value of the goods if sold in Australia. It must be admitted that in respect of some classes of goods, the addition of 20 per cent. may be too low to reach a fair wholesale value, whilst in some few cases it may be a little high for that purpose. In the vast majority of cases, however, and taking the taxable field of goods as a whole, it is considered that the 20 per cent. originally decided upon does no more than cover the costs, charges and profits, exclusive of the exchange involved, which would normally form part of a fair wholesale sale price. It would, of course, be impracticable to attempt to prescribe varying percentages for all the different classes of goods affected. It is considered, from a practical point of view, that 20 per cent. is fair for general application to all cases, provided that action is now taken to require exchange to be reckoned as proposed in this hill. </para>
                    <para>It will be noted that the bill provides that the rate of exchange to be used in converting values for duty into Australian currency shall be the telegraphic transfer selling rate, as fixed by the Common wealth Bank, at the date of export of the goods from the country of export. The present telegraphic transfer selling rate, Australia on London, is £125 10s. This rate has remained constant, owing to regulation by the Commonwealth Bank Board, since the 3rd December, 1931. </para>
                    <para>It is proposed that the conversion of values for duty into Australian currency shall come into operation in respect of importations on and from the 1st October, 1939. The fixing of a definite date in this manner is necessary in order to avoid confusion amongst importers and their agents. The scheme will not necessarily be applicable to all entries of goods on and from that date, as it will definitely not apply to entries of goods which were.  in fact, imported into Australia prior to the 1st October, 1939. it may be explained that the High Court of Australia has held in the case <inline font-style="italic">Wilson</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Chambers &amp; Co. Pty. Ltd.</inline> i  .192G), reported in 38 C.L.R. 131, that goods are imported into the Commonwealth whenever they are brought into their port of destination for the purpose of being finally discharged in Australia at that port, and that the discharge of the goods from the importing vessel is not required to complete the importation. The port of final discharge of such goods may  Ih3  a coastal port at which the importing vessel does not call, and, therefore, the goods must be landed for transport by land or sea to the coastal port for final discharge. In such a case the date of the arrival of the goods at the coastal port is the date of their importation into Australia. </para>
                    <para>I commend the bill to honorable members as a measure which will result in the removal of a definite anomaly by placing retail importers on more even terms with wholesale, importers from the point of view of their liability for sales tax. It is estimated that during the current financial year, the bill will produce additional revenue amounting to £120,000. </para>

As will be seen from the following comparison, the total normal grants for 1938-39 were £2,064,000, whilst the total normal grants for this year are £2,156,000, an increase for this year of £92,000:- </para>

                </para>
                <para>The general principles upon which the recommendations of the commission are based have been explained to the House at some length in previous years, and I do not propose, therefore, to enter at this stage of the bill into a full and lengthy discussion of the principles involved in arriving at the amount now proposed. These principles are explained ' very fully in the commission's sixth report, which was recently tabled and copies of which are available to honorable members. It is necessary, however, to explain that the plan which the commission has evolved and followed in each of its' six reports is to base the grants recommended for the threeStates concerned on financial needs, as indicated by a comparison of their budgets with those of the non-claimant States. The grants recommended are calculated to bring the finances of the claimantStates up to what the commission considers to be a fair Australian standard. In. short, the commission is of the opinion that the grants should be sufficient to enable a State which is in difficulties to function at a standard not appreciably below that of other States. The States concerned, however, are required to make some effort themselves to remedy their inferior financial position. </para>
                <para>I think, perhaps, that it <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> necessary to mention that the basis adopted by the commission has evoked some criticism, to which reference has been made when submitting legislation for approval in previous years. It has been claimed by certain of the States concerned that the grants which are made to them should be based on compensation for disabilities arising from federation or the effects of federal policy. The Grants Commission has given very careful consideration to this aspect and in earlier reports has expressed the opinion that the necessity for grants to these States is in no case due to any appreciable extent to the operation of federal policy. The commission states in its present report that it is convinced of the impracticability of assessing special grants on the basis of disabilities arising from federation and the operation of federal policy. In the view of the commission - and this view is said to have been supported by many expert witnesses who appeared before the commission - the reactions of the protective tariff and other aspects of federal policy are so interwoven with the financial and economic structure of Australia asa whole that it is impossible to express in monetary terms their full effect on the finances of the individual States. Moreover, even if it were practicable correctly to assess the financial effect of federation and federal policy on the finances of the claimant States, it would at the same time be necessary to make proper allowance for the advantages which accrue to those States from federation. This factor has been given a great deal of consideration by the commission as is evident from its various reports. Any financial disability which a State suffer* by reason of federation will be reflected in the State's budgetary results, and is automatically provided for by the commission's method of assessing grants according to " financial needs ". The commission is satisfied that the only safe and practicable basis upon which these grants can be assessed is the careful analysis of the relative financial position of the States as expressed in their annual budgets. This fundamental principle was expressed by the commission in one of its earlier reports as follows: - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Special grants are justified when a State through financial stress from any cause is unable efficiently to discharge its functions as a member of the federation, and should be determined by the amount of help found necessary to make it possible for that State by reasonable effort to function at a standard not appreciably below that of other States. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>The adoption of the principle just stated has involved a careful comparison by the commission of the budgetary results of the claimant States -with those of the non-claimant .States. The accounts of all States are not compiled on a uniform basis, and it is accordingly necessary for the commission to make certain adjustments of the figures in order to place tha budgetary results on a comparable basis. Having arrived at the amount that is required to raise the claimant States to the budgetary standards of the non claimant States, the commission then proceeds to make certain adjustments which it considers necessary after a comparison of the relative severity of taxation in the several States, differences in the cost of social services, costs of administration, and other relevant factors. </para>
                <para>Last year, the commission introduced a new feature into its work. In its report for that year the commission expressed the view that, in times of prosperity, a claimant State should take action to improve its financial position which it cannot take in less prosperous years, and that it should not incur expenditure which is unjustified or uneconomic. The commission examined the finances of the claimant States from that angle and imposed certain nominal penalties with a view to drawing the attention of the claimant States to their duty in that respect. The items particularly examined were: In the case of South Australia, the failure to recover debts due to the Crown; in the case of Western Australia, the expenditure of loan moneys on unproductive projects; and in the case of Tasmania, the failure to take action to secure an improvement of the railway finances in that State. In its present report the commission expresses the belief that its criticism of last year has not been adequately met, though in certain accounts improvement is noted. In particular, the commission has mentioned the heavy loan fund expenditure on unproductive road works, notwithstanding the greatly increased Federal Aid Roads grants from the Commonwealth, the dangerous trend in railway losses, and losses on land settlement in Tasmania. After considering all these factors concerned the commission decided to make general deductions from the grants of the three States, viz. ;. - </para>
                <para class="block">
                    <graphic href="161331193909152_35_8.jpg" />
                </para>
                <para>I think honorable members will agree that so long as the Commonwealth continues to make subventions to the States based on their budgetary accounts, a duty devolves upon the commission, and finally upon this Parliament, to ensure that the interests of all federal taxpayers shall be protected to the extent that the claimant States shall be required to maintain their finances on a sound basis. For this reason the . Government endorses the procedure adopted by the commission to achieve" this objective. </para>
                <para>The calculations by the commission for the purpose of assessing the grants for the present year are based on the financial results for the year 1937-38, which is the latest year for which complete statistics are available. It has been complained that the calculations made by the commission are based on figures which are, in effect, two years old. The term commonly used in this regard is the " time lag ". As an- example, the grants proposed for the year which commenced on the 1st July, 1939, are based on the financial position of the States for the year ended on the 30th June, 1938. There are disadvantages attaching to this procedure as the conditions two years ago may not truly reflect the circumstances of the present time, but any inequality which might result from the use of figures of a previous year is not cumulative, as differences will balance out. over a term of years. </para>
                <para>It has been sometimes urged that a formula should be evolved so that the amounts of the grants could be automatically fixed for a term of years. In the view of the commission, a fixed formula could not take full account of the relative effects of changes in prices, wages, fluctuations of trade, unemployment, the effects of droughts, floods and bush-fires, and movements of population, as well as the effects of external influences on  the economy of the nation. Another factor to be borne in mind is the changing position caused by the uneven growth of Federal and State responsibilities in relation to their financial resources. The commission considers that, in view of fluctuating financial and economic conditions, financial adjustments in the form of special grants cannot be fairly assessed without a searching annual review of the finances and economic conditions of all the States. </para>
                <para>T shall now refer briefly to the variations of the grants now proposed from those recommended and paid last year. The reduction of £45,000 in South Australia's grant is due in the main to improved economic conditions in 1937-38, the year upon which the present grants are based. The total revenue and the taxation revenue of the State constituted records and a surplus was achieved for the fourth successive year. </para>
                <para>Whilst the grant recommended for Western Australia is £25,000 Lu excess of that, recommended last year, actually the normal grant now recommended is £117,000 greater than the normal grant of last year. The normal grant for last year was £614,000, but a deduction of £44,000 was made to adjust an advance made in 3 936-37, the grant actually paid being £570,000. The normal grant recommended for this year is £731,000, from which is deducted a special advance of £136,000 made in 1937-38 on account of drought. The increase of the normal grant is therefore £117,000. This increase is due to the effects of drought, which had serious repercussions on the income year 1936-37, on which the taxation assessments for 1937-38 were based. </para>
                <para>The grant recommended for Tasmania <inline font-style="italic">i±</inline> £20,000 greater than that of last year. This is caused mainly by changes in the relative financial positions of the States. </para>
                <para>There is ample evidence that the commission, which has been set up as an independent body to investigate the claims of the States for financial assistance, has discharged its duty with thoroughness and in a wholly impartial manner. The Government therefore considers that it must accept the amounts recommended by the commission as special grants as bona fide recommendations to adjust the financial needs of the claimant States. The Government lias accepted the recommendations of the Grants Commission  in  all  past  years, and it has decided to accept the commission's recommendations  in  this instance. I commend the bill to honorable members. </para>

Increased expenditure involved by measures taken just prior  to or  since the outbreak  of  the  war  is about £6,000,000,  and  there can be  no  doubt that,  in  the year that lies immediately ahead of us, further expenditure  will  be inevitable. It is also anticipated that, as a direct result  of  the war there will be substantial reductions of customs revenue. It is yet too early to say what will be the amount, but no one can doubt that it may be substantial. Tt is not unreasonable to expect a loss of £5,000,000 or more. As has. already been announced, the Government is preparing its plans on the assumption that war conditions may last for three years or more. lt  is  impossible to estimate, with any degree of accuracy, the effect, on the budget of a prolonged conflict, but it is certain  that the  proposals brought down  h few days ago will be totally inadequate to meet obligations which wo may be called upon to bear. </para>
                <para>The Government has reviewed certain tax fields for the purpose of ascertaining what it can do immediately. It is advisable, as I have indicated, that any additional tax proposals should be made known as early as possible after they have been decided upon, in order that the taxpayers will have some knowledge of their precise liabilities. Honorable members will remember that the budget contains proposals to increase income tax collections by £2,360,000, sales tax by £1,420.000, and customs and excise duties by' £2,1.30,000, making the total of additional tax collections £5,910,000. </para>
                <para>After careful consideration, the Government has decided to submit a proposal further to increase the companies tax, which the budget increased from I3.8d. in the £1 to 1.9.«d. This was estimated to produce an additional £1,360,000. A further levy of 4. 2d. is now proposed, making the total tax 2s. in the £1. It is estimated that this further increase will yield an additional £1,000,000. </para>
                <para>Another new tax proposal relates to certain profits of gold-mining which, honorable members, I am sure, will appreciate when I. have placed the facts before them, are due solely to circumstances and conditions arising out of the war. Because the price of gold has increased solely because of the outbreak of Avar, the Government believes that the increase of the price of gold represents in substance on unearned increment and should be taxable for war purposes. It was suggested that it might he possible to fix 20s. a fine ounce as the approximate amount of the increase. I think that honorable members will, however, regard as a fairer basis, a tax of 75 per cent, of the amount by which gold exceeds £9 Australian currency an ounce of fine. gold. At present profits of gold-mining are exempt from Commonwealth income tax, both as to profits in the bands of gold-mining companies and dividends in the hands of shareholders. These profits are also exempt from most State taxation except iu Western Australia and Tasmania. High prices for gold have benefited the industry for several years. The. war has caused the dollar sterling exchange to depreciate, with the result that the price of gold has risen considerably in the last ten days. For instance, in 193S-39, the average price of gold, was £9 ls. 2d. an oz.; in July, 1939, it rose to £9 £3. lid. ; in August, the price was £9 8s. 7d. The price to-day is £10 10s., an increase of nearly 30s. an oz. over the average for 1938-39. Similar legislation is contemplated in the Union of South Africa and Rhodesia, but the Government does not know whether that legislation has yet been implemented. Announcements have appeared in the newspapers that both of these governments intend to appropriate the proceeds of gold over £7 10s. sterling a fine oz. The  Union  of South Africa in .1933 taxed gold profits heavily when the. South African currency was depreciated to the level of sterling in that year. The recent exchange premium is by way of a windfall due to war, and presents a strong case for a contribution to the Commonwealth revenue upon lines somewhat similar to those which, ii; is understood, have been adopted in the Union of South Africa and Rhodesia. The Government, therefore, proposes to place a tax on all gold delivered to the Commonwealth Bank or its agents on and after to-day, the 15th September. The tax will be 75 per cent, of the amount by which the price of fine gold, as fixed by the Commonwealth Bank from time to time, exceeds £9 Australian currency. As all gold must now he delivered to the Commonwealth Bank or its agents, arrangements will be made for the tax to be collected by the Commonwealth Bank. </para>

                            <para>- The procedure is simple. All the gold must bo delivered to the Commonwealth Bank or to the bank's agents. When the actual quantity of fine gold is determined, the tax will be collected by the Commonwealth Rank. The tax will be imposed on gold produced in Papua and New Guinea, as well as on gold produced in the Commonwealth. The present production of gold is about 1,800,000 fine ounces a year. The amount of tax collected will depend upon the price of gold. If the price averages £10 10s. a fine ounce, the Government will receive about £1,500,000 for the balance of this year. The remaining 25 per cent. of the excess price over the £9 will remain with the companies and shareholders to provide an offset against a rise of mining costs, and will probably provide some additional benefit. </para>

The Government regrets that it is necessary to impose additional taxes, but in the circumstances it is unavoidable. It is with great reluctance that further burdens are imposed on companies, particularly in New South "Wales, where they are already bearing a heavy burden. </para>

                        <para>.-I should like the Minister for Trade  and  Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. John Lawson)</inline> to make a  definite pronouncement as to the Government's proposals in connexion with  the  Australian cotton-growing industry. In the act passed in 1934 which expires  in  November, provision is made for  the  payment of a bounty. The cotton-growers are anxious to know whether it is proposed to re-enact that legislation  or  whether the industry is to  be  assisted  in  some other way. For some  Weeks  I have questioned the Minister oh this matter. I raised it in the closing days of the  last  period of the session, and was given the assurance by the Minister that there was no cause for anxiety, and that the cotton growers could rest assured that he would not let them down. I was impelled to raise it, by telegrams which I had received from cotton-growers in my own electorate. I have been waiting for a long time for a definite pronouncement by  the  Minister. The subject was referred to the Tariff Board on the 13th September, 1938, and the board submitted its report on the 3rd April, 1939. The Minister on the 12th of this month replied to a question by me in the following terms: - </para>

                        <para>Important aspects of the raw cotton industry are still the subject of discussion between the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments. It is hoped that the Government's decision will be available at an early date. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">I consider that I  have  reason to  feel  anxious, particularly  as  the period  is  approaching when the cotton growers must plant their crops. Australian factories use 35,000 bales  of raw  cotton  a  year. Last year the local production was approximately 12,000 bales. There are some 3,000 growers and 2,000 seasonal workers in the industry, which was worth £400,000 to Queensland last year. It  is  a small man's industry, the average acreage being approximately 15 acres. I submit to the Minister that it is  advisable to, make an early decision which will induce cotton-growers to increase their acreage. The Government of Queensland has decided upon a developmental scheme of irrigation,, with the object, of substantially increasing the production of cotton. That Government realizes the. considerable importance of this industry, and the necessity to produce at least the whole of Australia's requirements. It now rests with the Minister to fulfil the very definite promise he made to. me in this House, that I could rest assured that he would not let the cotton-growers of Queensland down.. Surely sufficient time has elapsed since April last for the Government to have come to a decision as to whether the existing legislation shall be re-enacted or amending legislation introduced. If the Minister is not at present in a position .to make a definite statement, I ask ham to give to me the assurance that he will do so next week. </para>

Prime Minister whether the papers relating to the case referred to by the Leader of the Opposition may be made available. 1 should also like him to state whether or not the release of the person concerned was made under instructions conveyed in a telegram to the proper authorities? If such instructions were given either by telegram or by letter, would it be possible for them to be made available to the House some time next; week? I have no desire whatever that any person who might be acting detrimentally to. the welfare of this country should continue his present avocation, but I do think that n very serious precedent would be established, and one that would certainly redound to the very great danger and detriment of this country in. time of war, if any Minister of the Grown, either the Prime Minister or any other Minister, were to give instructions for the release of any person from internment before the evidence in the possession of the police and the military authorities, on which that . person had been, interned, was thoroughly examined by a competent authority ; and in that competent, authority I naturally include the Government, which, after all, over-rides all military law in this country. I further invite the Prime Minister to make next week a statement which will show how many persons have been released from internment under conditions similar to those that operated in the case to which I have referred, and, if the information may be disclosed by the competent authorities, how many of those whom it was thought advisable to re-intern have eluded re internment since instructions to that effect were given. </para>

Either he or some other Minister replied to a similar question by the honorable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nock)</inline> in different terms. This reply was that a number had been released on parole, and while they behaved themselves they would not be re-interned. The honorable gentleman has not yet answered the question as to whether some of those who were released cannot now be located. J. should be glad if he would explain the matter more fully. </para>

                        <para>.- Some weeks ago, I drew attention to anomalous situations that were arising in respect of certain provisions of the repatriation administration, particularly by reason of the rigidity of the act. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> will remember that I said that certain medical decisions were very conflicting and were rather inexplicable at times. I informed him that cases had been brought to my notice of nien who had returned from active service medically unfit, had been adjudged as having a disability either due to, or aggravated by, war service, and had been granted pensions which had subsequently been withdrawn although they were still suffering from the same disability. The Minister asked me to cite a specific case which would give a clear idea of the nature of my complaint and substantiate my contention that injustice was being done. I have had brought to my notice a case which I think comes within this category. The man in question approached the repatriation authorities for the acceptance of his disability. It was accepted upon his return to Australia, from active service, and he was given a half-rate pension as well as medical treatment. Later,  the  doctors decided that his disability  was not  to be regarded as due to  war.  There is nothing more that this  man  can do; unless he can bring fresh evidence in support of his claim, he has no possible hope of obtaining redress. The department already has in its possession all the evidence that he can supply. It would appear that there have been some remark. able misunderstandings regarding certain aspects of the case. I shall not dis close any confidences by giving details of this case, for I have not seen the file. All of the information that I now present to the House was obtained from the man himself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> E. Cragg. He enlisted in August, 1914, at Gawler, where he was examined and passed by the doctor at the recruiting station. He was drafted to Morphettville, but when he presented himself for a second medical examination, he was rejected because his teeth needed attention. Evidently he did not persevere with his enlistment at that time. Instead he went to Port Augusta, where he worked for the Commonwealth Government as a fireman. While there, he was taken ill, while still in the employ of the Commonwealth Government, and was operated on for appendicitis. After his discharge from hospital, he worked with the Broken Hill Associated Smelters at Port Pirie. There seems to be some confusion as to the cause of his first rejection. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Griffiths,</inline> the department's doctor, said that this man's rejection for active service was due to his condition arising from appendicitis, whereas it was due to his dental condition. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cragg</inline> enlisted again in January, 1917, and embarked for overseas in May of that year. During the voyage he had the misfortune to be injured in one eye as the result of a hammock stick falling down a wind chute. The accident necessitated several stitches in the wound. Even in regard to that injury, the records appear to he confused, because I understand that they assert that appendicitis developed immediately upon embarkation. The operation for appendicitis was performed in 1915, before his second enlistment. To-day <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cragg</inline> suffers from certain abdominal injuries, which have been the cause of much discomfort since his return to Australia in 1919. Almost immediately on his return he was treated in hospital. Later he was discharged as medically unfit and was sent to the Torrens Park hospital by the Medical Board, which certified that his disability was aggravated by his active service. The report states - </para>

                        and it is evident that the doctor had not forgotten the incident. Although
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Griffiths</inline>
                        said that it was difficult to connect

                        of Adelaide, for an opinion as to the advisability of an operation.

                        reported that the man suffered from an old appendicitis trouble, which was not due to war service, and drew attention to the fact that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cragg</inline>
                        weighed 15 stone. At no time was he of slight build ; when he enlisted, at the age of 32 years, his weight was 13 st. 5 lb. On the 13th May, 1921,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Griffiths</inline>
                        certified that his disability was not due to war service, and cancelled the order which he had previously given for a surgical belt.  His  report stated -

                        then endeavoured to do as the doctor suggested; he returned to work, but after two or three months he had to discontinue his employment. He went back to Gawler, where he was examined by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Lewis,</inline>
                        who reported, that he was suffering from shooting pains in the right side, which had developed in France, and that the pain occurred first with heavy lifting, and had since been getting more frequent and severe. He said that the man was normal except for a large appendicitis scar which had thickened and was tender. Mr.Cragg's case was then reported on by a specialist, who gave an adverse decision, and suggested that an increase of 4 stone in weight was the cause of his disability. Here, again, there seems to be some confusion, because when
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Corbin</inline>
                        examined,

                        in 1921, his weight was 1 st. 9 lb. above his weight at enlistment. Within twelve months it was assumed that his weight had increased by 4 stone.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Lewis</inline>
                        then returned to the case and reported -

Married persons, whose jobs demand that they live in Canberra cannot get houses. Single men and women have difficulty in obtaining board. Certain people who have to be in Canberra when Parliament is in session can obtain accommodation only at high rates and, even then, it is intimated to them that they will not be welcome as boarders for long periods because the hotels find the casual visitors more profitable.

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> asked whether the Government proposed to take any action to prevent individuals from offering their services to the French Consul for enlistment in the French Foreign Legion,, and suggested that legislation existed prohibiting such enlistments. I have not been able to find any act containing such a provision, and I doubt very much whether there is any such, prohibition. If any individuals have offered their services in this direction, I imagine that they are few. At this juncture, the Government, I think, would take no action to prevent such enlistments. </para>

                <para>In reply to the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White),</inline> I point out that in answer to a question, I said that 1 thought there were three cases of aliens who had been interned, released and re interned. That is correct. A. number of aliens were interned and released and further examined, but in these cases, it was decided on the dossiers to continue their release under conditions laid down by the defence authorities. These latter cases, perhaps, a. re responsible for the misunderstanding which apparently has arisen in the honorable member's mind. To the best of my knowledge, there is no instance of an enemy alien who was released, and whose re-internment was ordered, not having been, found and re interned. air.

                <para class="block">Minister) [4.27]. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - My only connexion with the case to which the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> has referred was that the case was brought under my notice and, knowing something about the business in question, I indicated that a prompt investigation should be made. Apparently an investigation was .made, and I gather from my colleague that the man was released and later re-interned. As to the tabling of papers with respect to any case of internment of an alien, it would seem to me, and I imagine to honorable members generally, that it would be contrary to the public interest to have individual cases made the subject of publicity, involving disclosure of 'the sources of information upon which action was taken. </para>

                        <para>- The building of motor torpedo boats, which are of a highly specialized type, is confined, in England, to a few firms whose designs are proprietary, and no firm in Australia could build these craft except by arrangement with an English firm to use its design. The only firm in Australia which at present has the necessary association with a British firm to enable construction to be immediately undertaken is the Cockatoo Docks and Engineering Company Proprietary Limited, which ha= submitted a tender for the construction of six boats; that tender is now under, consideration. In view of the necessity for construction to be completed at the earliest possible date, and having regard to the foregoing conditions, public tenders were not invited. </para>
