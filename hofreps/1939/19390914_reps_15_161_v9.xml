                    <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - I thought the Prime Minister might rise to say something on this subject, but as Leader of the Opposition I wish to express my regret for personal reasons, and quite regardless of recent political events, that the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> has retired from the position of Leader of the Country party, in which he has been able to play a very conspicuous part in the deliberations of this House and in the service of Australia. &#34;Whatever I may think about the Country party and its policies - I feel that on some occasions it is due to ourselves, and also to the country, that we should refer to our official relations - the right honorable member for Cowper has held the position which he is now vacating for more than nineteen years and I do not think I should allow the occasion to pass without saying that we have had, throughout those years, the utmost courtesy from him in cnr official relations. I feel that I can speak for my predecessors in this respect. The right honorable gentleman is terminating his period of office without leaving behind him any ill-will so far as I am concerned. I have admiration for the great work that he has done.  His  own supporters will be the best judges of the value of his services to the Country party, but I think it can be said that his work in this Parliament has been indeed notable. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - I had thought that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> was rising to ask a question. However, I take this opportunity to associate myself with his remarks. Honorable members ave well aware that my own relations with the former leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page ) have been affected of late by certain incidents to which I need not refer; but I have been in this Parliament long enough, and was in Cabinet long enough, with the right honorable gentleman to realize that he has in fact rendered very great public service to Australia, and particularly to its rural industries. I should be blinded indeed by other events if I did not recognize clearly that this is so, and if I did not say so unhesitatingly. I do not think that any man can serve Australia, particularly as the leader of a great political party, for a great number of years, without placing the public under obligations to him. These are matters which we are a little inclined to forget from time to time, but they show the creditable capacity of the country for securing self-sacrificing public service.</inline></para>

                        <para>- A constituent of mine has written me a letter concerning the increase of surcharge on airmail for overseas. My friend intimated that the increase was from 5d. to ls. 6d. a half ounce and that it represented an. advance of 260 per cent. He suggests that this looks like profiteering. In view of the declared intention of the Government, to prevent profiteering by either public companies or private persons, I ask the Postmaster-General whether he will make an inquiry into this increased surcharge. It certainly looks like profiteering. </para>

                        <para>- I refer the honorable member to a question which was answered by me on this subject in the House last week following a statement made by the Prime Minister, who pointed out that the increased surcharge was necessary because of the restricted air-mail service now operating between. Australia and England. He added that it was intended to discourage an undue increase of overseas airmail matter as larger mails obviously could not be carried in consequence of the restricted service. </para>

                        <para>- Is it a fact that the Prime Minister took some action which resulted in a telegram being received by the Second Military District, Sydney,, from Army Head-quarters, Melbourne, on the 5th September, to the effect that the Prime Minister directed that So-and-so - I have mentioned the name of the person to the Prime Minister - was to be released from internment immediately?1 Is it a fact that at the time this order was received the man&#39;s dossier had not been, called for, was still in Sydney, and had never been seen by the Prime Minister, or the Minister for Defence, and that the dossier was called for two or three days later and sent to Melbourne? Is it a fact that the Prime Minister had thus ordered the release of this man allegedly known to the military and the police  or a dangerous enemy agent, without having troubled, in advance, to see what the evidence was ? If the answer to the question, or to some parts of it, is affirmative, will the Prime Minister tell the House why the order was sent without the dossier having been seen? </para>

                        <para>- The Leader of the Opposition was good enough to mention the name of this internee to me. The position is, that after this man had been interned, I received a telegram from the company, of which he was, I think, managing director. That company is a very large concern with the nationality of a friendly power, and, as I had actually met this man once or twice and knew this big concern very well, I indicated to the Minister for Defence that inquiries should be made to see whether any mistake had been made. That was the only action I took. I gave no order. I understand an inquiry was put in hand, and that, for a time at least, the internee was released from internment, but as to what happened subsequently I cannot speak. All that I did in the matter -was to suggest an inquiry, having regard to the nationality of the firm with which the man was connected, and the possibility that a mistake had been made. Perhaps my colleague, the Minister for Defence, can throw some light on what happened subsequently. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that the Government has announced that the Australian wool clip will probably be taken over by the British Government. I fully realize the necessity for supplying the British Government&#39;s requirements to the full, but according to the press this morning an English broker is reported to have said that Japan has protested against the whole of the Australian wool clip going to Great Britain, and brokers in England have stated that arrangements would be made for a portion of the wool clip to be diverted to Japan. Does the Prime Minister regard it as <inline font-weight="bold">Ms prerogative</inline> to say that the wool shall be diverted to Japan or that of British merchants? </para>

                            <para>- That question, I suggest, is quite hypothetical. These committees are already in existence, and, so far, they have found no difficulty in arriving at a common view. If on any occasion a majority view has to be obtained, then that is a consideration that the Government will take into account. </para>

                        <para>- It is noticeable that, at the conclusion of broadcasts of war news by the Australian Broadcasting Commission&#39;s A class stations, the public is notified that the broadcasts are by the courtesy of the Associated Press. Has the Associated Press any proprietary right over the British Broadcasting Corporation broadcasts, and does the Australian Broadcasting Commission pay any fees for that courtesy? </para>

                        <para>- The Associated Press and other press organizations have definite cable rights for which they have paid. These cables are used under the censorship regulations by the British Broadcasting Corporation and their use in Australia is precluded without some arrangements being made with the press organizations concerned. Early next week a conference will take place in Melbourne of representatives of all interested parties including newspapers, the Australian Broadcasting Com miss sion, censors and the Minister for Information. The whole matter will be gone into very thoroughly in order that arrangements may be made to give the maximum cable news to the people of Australia. </para>

                            <para>. - I understand that the Minister is anxious to have the Sales Tax Bill No. 1 of this legislative series passed by this House to-day for departmental and revenue reasons, and also to ensure that there will be a legal authority to give effect to the budget statement that an extra 1 per cent tax on sales is required. In the course of the speech which I made on the budget I said that the Opposition was in agreement that increased revenue would have to be obtained, and approved of the method adopted by the Government in dealing with the sales tax field. For that reason I am disposed to allow this measure to have a rapid passage. I point out, however, that from the 1st July, 1932, until the end of the last financial year, the sales tax yielded a total of &#163;61,300,000 whereas for the same period income tax yielded &#163;67,2?4,000. In round figures income tax yielded only &#163;5,800,000 more than sales tax in the same period. It is true that the Labour party originated the sales tax. It was a form of indirect taxation instituted in order to make good the great falling off in another field of indirect taxation, namely, the yield from customs revenue. In 1930-31, the year in which sales tax was first imposed, the situation was such that the ordinary indirect taxation revenue of the Commonwealth had fallen tremendously, and, in order to make good the deficiency, a tax on sales of goods was devised. It was part of the emergency necessities of the time. There has been a great deal of criticism against the Labour party for instituting the sales tax, but in no year since then, notwithstanding the enormous improvement of the economic position of Australia, has any successive Treasurer seen his way clear to abolish the sales tax. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, it was reduced from 6 per cent. to 5 per cent. which was the rate operating from 1933 until 1936. It was then further reduced to 4 per cent., but subsequently the Government restored the rate to 5 per cent., and now it is proposed that it should be 6 per cent. For the portion of the year 1930-31 in which sales tax was in operation the yield was less than &#163;3,500,000. In the next full year it was &#163;8,400,000. It. remained at that figure, with all the varying changes of the rate, until last year when it was &#163;9,300,000. It can be said therefore that the rate of tax was so fixed by the Treasurers to yield an amount of approximately &#163;9,000,000 each year. The Government did not care what the rate was so long as that amount was collected. It is estimated that, for the current financial year, the tax will return &#163;11,120,000.I can acquiesce in the declaration that increased revenue is necessary. I cannot see any part of the tax field open to the Commonwealth in which we may expect a reduction. On the contrary, we may expect increased burdens in practically all directions. I am not surprised, therefore, that the Government proposes to increase the sales tax by 1 per cent., and, with this addition, the tax should provide a greater yield than in any previous year since it was instituted. </para>

                            <para>.- I agree that it is necessary to increase taxation in order to finance the country through this period of emergency. I am disappointed, however, that the Government is proposing once again to increase the sales tax. This tax, though perhaps easy to collect from the point of view of the department, is a costly and irksome tax for the business community, and with this proposed increase it will become even more irksome. Last week-end, when I saw that it was proposed to increase the sales tax, I asked the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> whether it would not be advisable to substitute a turnover tax for the sales tax. It would be an easy tax to collect, and I believe that the business community would support the innovation. I hope that the Prime Minister will, in the near future, be able to inform us how much it would be possible to collect by means of a turnover tax. The Government should give serious consideration to my suggestion before further increasing the sales tax. </para>

                        <para>.- The budget now before the committee is notable in two directions - it is a wartime budget, and it is the first Commonwealth budget to touch the &#163;100,000,000 mark. As a matter of fact, the budget is for &#163;102,000,000. As the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> pointed out, the budget was introduced in a time of grave crisis in the history of this country, as it is in the history of all countries that hold their freedom sacred. We can understand the difficulties experienced by the Treasurer in introducing such a budget, and honorable members experience a similar difficulty in addressing themselves to it, seeing that it will have to be readjusted almost immediately to meet the altered conditions. Exactly what lies ahead, none can say at the moment. We pray for a short war, and an early peace which will bring honour all round, but we cannot afford to take any risks, and thus must, continue our preparations to meet any contingency that may arise. It seems to me that if ever there was a time for the formation of a national government - a government which would be truly representative of all sections of the people - that time is now; but the Labour party, which may be said to represent approximately one-half of the people of this country, has decided to stand aloof, preferring to act as a sort of watchdog over the Government led by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> as if it should be watched over and spurred on in this time of national crisis. To me, the attitude of the Labour party is indefensible. Failing a national government in the widest sense of the term, we must look to the two government parties for a coalition. Such a combination would, no doubt, be thoroughly national in its outlook, and all of its endeavours would be directed to placing this country on a sound defence footing. It is true that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> has indicated that he will give general support to any action taken by the Government in this crisis. I point out, however, that whole-hearted support is necessary, and that would be given if the Labour party were to share in the government of the country at this critical time. At such a time as the present, it is not watchdogs that are needed but men who are prepared to sink political and personal outlook and unite in meeting the onslaughts of what we may describe as &#34; the mad dog of Europe &#34;. In the first week of the war, emergency legislation - the Trading with the Enemy Act and the National Security Act - was brought down for the purpose of prosecuting the war to the best of our ability. That legislation has its counterpart in the United Kingdom, and is based on similar legislation which was found necessary during the last great war, although improvement has been effected in the light of the experience of that conflict and the knowledge since gained. It is hard to find any reason for opposition to it, unless it be merely for the sake of opposing it. I say this, not with bitterness but with regret: we cannot afford to display any bitterness. For that reason, we suggest that the Opposition would play a better role at this period if it were to leave to the people outside the function of a watchdog, and accept the responsibility of taking an active part in framing legislation. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Under the proposals brought down in the budget, taxation is to be increased by approximately &#163;6,000,000. The total estimated revenue is &#163;101,940,000, but according to the Treasurer that will hardly meet the nation&#39;s needs. For this year alone, the estimated defence expenditure is &#163;33,000,000. That is an enormous sum to have to raise. One awaits with a certain degree of interest the further Estimates which, I understand, will be brought down by the Treasurer next week. </para>
                    <para>In the matter of defence, one does not desire at this time to be unduly critical of the Defence Department. The Minister in charge of that department has a very big task to perform, and it is generally recognized throughout the country that he is discharging his responsibilities remarkably well. Although one realizes that the department is working at top pressure, one must refer to the dissatisfaction that exists in various parts of Australia by reason of the undue delay in supplying uniforms to the Militia. There are in Sydney militiamen who enlisted eight months ago and are still without complete uniforms. I should like to know the reason for this undue delay. Surely, there are manufacturers in Australia who are prepared and able to supply the necessary outfits. It would appear that it is not so much men as material and equipment that are needed, because it is gratifying to know that thousands of men are rushing to join the forces. There must be the necessary organization to deal with those who are joining up. The Government should get a move on, and put all hands to the task of providing this urgently-needed equipment. The organization of men is well advanced, largely due to the fact that in the latter months of last year a splendid recruiting campaign was inaugurated by the right honorable the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> to whom full marks must be given for the excellent national work that he did on that occasion. One hears a good deal of talk about the necessity to conscript both wealth and man-power. I do not believe that there is any necessity to do either of those things. Every man of fighting age should be properly trained, and that cannot be done at once. There is no need to conscript, because the manhood of Australia is rushing to join the forces in thousands, severely taxing the capacity of the defence authorities to provide an adequate number of instructors. Wealth is in the same category; there will be no shrinking from the patriotic duty with which the country is confronted. As for profiteers to whom reference has been made during the course of the debate, they are not representative of the people as  a  whole. Wherever found, they should be rooted out and treated according to their deserts. The Government has lost no time in passing legislation to prevent profiteering of  all kinds, and on that, account is to be commended. The steps that have already been taken will have a salutary effect. When we are asking the taxpayers to shoulder heavier burdens than have ever been shouldered before, wc must see that they are not exploited by unpatriotic speculators in whatever field these may operate. The attitude adopted by the various chambers of commerce and chambers of manufactures throughout Australia is appreciated. They are observing the slogan &#34; Carry on &#34; impressed upon them in the message given to the nation by the Prime Minister. All sorts of business dislocation and other difficulties are inevitable, but until we know exactly where wc stand, and can make whatever re-adjustments are needed, it is necessary for business enterprises to be conducted without the dismissal of employees and with the minimum of inconvenience and hardship to our citizens. 1 wish to express my admiration of the attitude adopted by our chambers of commerce and chambers of manufactures, as well as other public and private bodies throughout Australia, because of this appeal. </para>
                    <para>Sales taxation is referred to in the budget and I take this opportunity to make one or two observations in connexion with it. The Treasurer stated that only one-third of the commodities of Australia are at present subjected to this impost. Previous governments have given a great deal of consideration to the sales tax, and in the course of the years, h great many of the foodstuffs and health supplies of this country have .been exempt from the tax. These two items constitute a very large proportion of the goods now exempt from the tax. Previous governments have, in my opinion, adopted the correct attitude in this regard. I suggest that, the Government should hesitate before it re-imposes the sales tax on any of the foodstuffs or health supplies at present exempt from it. </para>
                    <para>Recently the  president  of the Associated Chamber of Manufactures, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holden,</inline> stated that the Government could count on the loyal support and co-operation of every manufacturer in this country without, regard to the subject of profit-making. It is a fine thing that manufacturers generally are offering their services to the </para>
                    <para class="block">Government in various ways in order to help it in its conduct of public affairs. It was the habit of some honorable members opposite, not long ago, to throw gibes at manufacturers whose establishments had been selected by the Ministry for Supply and Development as the location of defence annexes, but I am glad to notice that we do not hear those gibes now, for credit is being given where credit is due. Nothing has been more gratifying or more astonishing than -the rapidity of the development of our manufacturing industries since the last war. This has led. to a considerable increase of employment and has greatly expanded the market for our primary products, which have been sold at enhanced prices compared with those that would have ruled in other circumstances. This development is also of great importance in contributing to Australia&#39;s self-containment in this crisis. To-day something in the neighbourhood of 550,000 persons are being employed in our secondary industries. With the further expansion that the war will make necessary - for wo shall have to depend upon ourselves  more  than ever before - we may expect this figure to rise considerably in the near future. When the war is happily over, be it long or short, I believe that we shall see a big revival of industry with a consequent substantial increase of the number of people coming to Australia. This, in its turn, will involve big investments of capital, particularly in manufacturing industries, and it will help to spread the burden of taxation. We are fighting to-day, not only for ourselves, but also for posterity. We are fighting in order that we may hand on unimpaired to those who come after us the blessing of freedom, liberty and all that is associated with our free and democratic institutions. </para>
                    <para>It would be quite impossible for the people of this generation to meet all the expenses of the war. For this reason we should do everything possible to make the country well worth living in. If that is done, we shall attract to our shores many thousands of desirable people after the war ends, who will become taxpayers and help to share the burdens of government. In the meantime we must do our best to provide the amount of revenue which the Government finds it necessary to raise. The proposed increase by 10 per cent, of the tax on incomes from personal exertion and property has become necessary. The proposal to increase the rate of company tax to ls. 7.8d. in the &#163;1, an increase of 6d. is also necessary. This will mean a considerable diminution of the profits of many companies and in some cases it will undoubtedly press very heavily on the shareholders, but it is a case of &#34; Needs must when the devil drives &#34;, and without doubt a m&#39;ad devil is driving in Europe to-day. It is also proposed to subject to company tax the dividends received by absentee holding companies from companies operating in Australia. The Government considers it is not unreasonable that these companies should contribute to the cost of defending and developing Australia. The reason is a sound enough one, but I should like to have some more information as to the incidence of the tax. No doubt the Assistant Treasurer will be able to furnish this. The proposal seems to me to savour of double taxation, which has lately been engaging the attention of a special committee set up by the League of Nations. </para>

                            <para>- It is an international subject of the first importance. I remind the Assistant Treasurer that double taxation has been a source of much trouble in Australia for many years past, and I suppose it will continue to trouble us so long as we have Commonwealth and State governments operating in the same fields of taxation. We should not forget, however, that these absentee holding companies are probably being taxed up to the hilt already in the United Kingdom. A different position arises in respect of such companies domiciled in the United States of America or in some other countries. The Assistant Treasurer should furnish us with more specific information concerning who would be called upon to pay this tax, for it is a matter of very great importance to our business community. Questions that arise are: Who would pay the tax? Will the absentee in England, for instance, pay this company rate of tax from the dividends derived from his </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para class="block">Australian companies? Will the tax be paid by the companies - and by them I mean the shareholders in Australia? I have no doubt, in view of the Assistant Treasurer&#39;s interjection, that he will give the necessary information on these questions to honorable members. </para>
                    <para>It is not necessary to traverse the Treasurer&#39;s speech in detail, nor is it desirable to do so, in&#39; view of the more or less tentative character of the budget. In general, I think the budget can be taken as representing a very fair attempt to meet a very difficult and, in some ways, a problematical situation. </para>
                    <para>There is one matter, however, to which I finally wish to refer. It relates to aliens. During the last year, some thousands of aliens have arrived in this country. For the most part they are refugees from the wrath of Hitler, and their feelings may be gauged from the desire they have expressed to enlist in our fighting forces. We have been told that every possible precaution has been taken, and that a number of persons - how many we do not know - have already been placed where they can do no harm. We cannot afford to take risks, but at the same time we do not wish to be guilty of harsh treatment generally in respect of aliens, most of whom, after all, are people of good types and, no doubt, will in time become excellent citizens of Australia, which is, no doubt, the freest country on earth. Let us keep it free! Let there be no mistake about -where -Australia stands in relation to the war ! The Prime Minister has correctly expressed the views of the Australian people and has stated the position clearly by telling us that when Britain is at war Australia is at war. We have accepted that position by ourselves declaring war on Germany. That attitude indicates, without any doubt, the feeling of our people. The Prime Minister has given a splendid lead to the nation. The fight will be stern and relentless, but at whatever cost we must win it. To that end we must be prepared for sacrifices.

                        <para>.- It is deplorable that within the comparatively short span of 25 years the world is again in the throes of another war. This grave world condition imposes additional financial burdens upon the Commonwealth and State Governments, and upon the people of Australia generally. Bearing that in mind we realize that this is simply a tentative budget and that we can expect some sharp variations of it before the end of the financial year. This is a period, unfortunately, during which hardships will be suffered by many sections of the people, particularly by those who have no margins- - I mean people who are on the bread line and are either in intermittent work or altogether unemployed. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>In consequence of the world position I take it that we have &#39;before us a budget that is very different from the budget that would have been presented had the war not occurred. &#34;We were told that the war that broke out on the 4th August, 1914, was a war to end war. Millions of people firmly believed that so much sacrifice, so much valour, and so much grief could not fail to purchase peace for the world, but we have been sadly disillusioned. The last great war cost the world 7,000,000 lives, and they were not the lives of the aged and infirm but of the very flower of our manhood. The financial cost of the last war has been variously estimated at between &#163;40,000,000,000 and &#163;70,000,000,000. The cost to Australia of the last war was 60,000 dead, 166,000 wounded and approximately &#163;881,000,000. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that we were all struck with horror when we learned that another war had occurred. Many statesmen, actuated by the very best of motives, believed that the last war would teach an aggressor nation that it could not take by force what other nations were not willing to give. They also believed that in future international arbitration would be applied to settle the differences between nations just as our law courts are used to settle differences between individuals. A further gesture of idealism resulted in the establishment of the League of Nations. The league was, however, crippled in its infancy because President Wilson, of the United </para>
                    <para class="block">States of America, its chief protagonist, was prevented by the American realists from affiliating his people with the league. Ever since then the league, while express sing a fine idealism, has lacked jurisdiction over aggressor nations. Unfortunately it stands to-day to the discredit of 20th century civilization that a dictatorship nation has resorted again to force and thrown the world into the vortex of war. Germany, by its invasion of Poland, has precipitated the world into another titanic struggle, the result of which it is difficult to foresee. England and France were in honour bound to fulfil their pledges to Poland. We, in Australia, are part of the British Commonwealth of Nations. I believe that it is in the best interests of Australia that we should remain within this Commonwealth. But participation in the privileges of partnership in the British Commonwealth of Nations entails responsibilities. The Labour party stands for the honoring of those responsibilities in the manner consistent with its platform. I therefore wholeheartedly support the declaration of my leader - </para>

                    <para>Some criticism was offered by the honorable member for Watson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jennings)</inline> of the Labour party for not taking portfolios in a national government, but I would say to the honorable gentleman that the Leader of the Opposition clearly stated that federal Labour would co-operate in every legitimate effort for the defence of Australia, and in the doing of our part in accordance with the platform of the Australian&#39; Labour party. It was not necessary for the Government to hand out portfolios and emoluments of office to induce the Opposition to do its part. I would remind the honorable member that in Great Britain the Labour Opposition clearly set out its attitude, and stated definitely that it did not intend to take portfolios in the National Government. I do not think one member of the Government would rise in his place and criticize &#39; the attitude of the Labour party in the British Parliament. </para>

                    <para>I am not unmindful of the difficult position in which the Government finds itself. Its responsibilities have greatly increased, and it has many pressing problems with which to deal. One of the most important will be the marketing of Australia&#39;s primary products. In view of the contemplated sale of those products to the United Kingdom, it is well that we should be conversant with the events that occurred in the past when similar sales were effected, and, while I do not wish to make it appear that I would take any unfair advantage of the purchase by the British Government of foodstuffs, raw materials or primary products at the present time, the Government should realize that we owe a debt to a large section of the primary producers in Australia, who in the last war sold their products to Britain at prices much below world market prices; furthermore that many thousands of primary producers have, for the last couple of -years, been producing at a loss. .1 urge the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> to take into consideration the bad times that those primary producers have had in the last two or three years when deciding on prices that should be paid in this crisis for their exportable products. I want the Government to give an assurance, before completing agreements with the British Government, that it will give due consideration to the cost of production and the losses already incurred by many sections of primary producers in selling at prices below the cost of production. They cannot go on producing at a loss. The proposed price for wheat announced by the Prime Minister, 3s. 4d. f.o.r. at ports for wheat for the United Kingdom, would mean an average price of 2s. yd. a bushel at country sidings which would be inadequate and below the cost of production. The Royal Commission on. the Wheat, Flour and Bread Industries submitted a report on the 13th March, 1935, in which it found that the then cost of production of wheat was 3s. 6d. a bushel f.o.r. ports. The royal commission said . that that was a fair average. I would remind the Government, however, that the cost of production has substantially increased since 1935. It is well to bear in mind what the wheat prices are in many of the </para>

In Poland there is a guaranteed price equivalent to 4s. 10 1/2 d. a bushel sterling or 6s. Australian. In Roumania there is a guaranteed minimum price of 3s. 3d. sterling or 4s. Id. Australian. In Yugoslavia it is 5s. Id. sterling or 6s. 6d. Australian. None of those prices are prices which are ruling as the result of this war. However, as I said at the outset, I realize the difficulties that confront the Government and all I ask is that the Government take all of these factors into consideration and give an assurance that no injustice will be done to the Australian producers. </para>

                    <para>It is well, also, that we should keep in mind that during the last war the British Government contracted to purchase the Australian wool clip from 1916-17 until 1919-20 at ls. <inline font-style="italic">3id.</inline> per lb. The wool was sold in London at 6s. and an arrangement was made between the Governments of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth that half of the profits on wool sold for purposes other than military were to go to Australia. Out of those sales Great Britain&#39;s profit was &#163;35,000,000. In addition it got its naval and military wool requirements at quarter value. I am not saying that we should not assist; do not misunderstand me: I believe that we should assist and that we should all make sacrifices, but we should remember the splendid spirit displayed by the primary producers during the last war in making goods available through government management at prices which were very much lower than world parity. </para>
                    <para>According to the budget statement of the 16th September, 1920, the payment made for Australian wool under the imperial contract amounted to &#163;159,000,000. Had Australia received 6s. per lb. Australia&#39;s wool cheque would have been approximately $735,000,000 instead of &#163;159,000,000 - a difference to Australia of over &#163;500,000,000, or more than our total war debt. </para>

Thompson, Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade, said that the Government contracts for the purchase of Australian wheat from 1916-17 to 1919- 20 amounted to 5,000,000 tons. The contracts were delivered full subject to the crude allowance of 58,000 tons for loss and damage. The cost a bushel averaged 5s. 2d. f.o.b. in Australia.

                    <para class="block">It was pointed out in this article that millions of pounds were made out of Australian meat that was shipped overseas. I am not critical of concessions being made. As I said previously it is the duty of everyone to make sacrifices, and when the Australian wheat-growers were getting 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.b. they wore satisfied ; but wheat-growers of other countries were getting 9s. 3d. a bushel. That article has enabled us to keep in true perspective the part played and the sacrifices made by the primary producers during the last war, and it gives us some idea of what is a reasonable price to pay them for their products now that new agreements are being entered into by the Government. It is well that the Government should profit by its experiences during the last war, as well as in the immediate past. </para>
                    <para>In regard to cheese, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> R. Roberts, the British Food Controller, stated that the British Government was losing101/2d. per lb. on home-produced cheese, but that the loss would be met by the profit? on imported cheese. Our butter averaged 1s. 6d. per lb. while, according to the Australian press of the 15th November, 1919, Australian butter was bringing from 7s. 6d. to 10s. per lb. in London. It will be seen that for all of our primary products we received far less than any other country in the world. Our primary producers sacrificed millions of pounds during the last war. When determining what is a fair price in agreements entered into between the Commonwealth Government and the British Government that fact should not be overlooked. During the last war Australia was also able to play its part in supplying the British Government with electrolytic copper. Although Great Britain was purchasing electrolytic copper in the United States of America for &#163;163 a ton it paid to Australian producers only &#163;108 a ton. In times of crisis such sacrifices are willingly made by Australian producers to help the British Government because, as I have said, although we have not a surplus of man-power we have a surplus of foodstuffs and raw materials. I firmly believe that the British Government has no desire to drive an unreasonably hard bargain with the Australian Government in regard to the sale of primary products. Before coming to a decision with regard to prices the Government should, however, confer with representatives of all primary industries, and obtain their points of view in regard to them. </para>

                            <para>- Those were the total amounts paid to agents for the period mentioned. When it is establishing the Australian Wheat Board the Government should see that agents&#39; costs are cut to the minimum and that the board undertakes a large amount of the work previously done by many of these agents who during the last war received colossal sums for their services. For instance, John Darling and Sons received in agents&#39; fees &#163;74,000 in 1915-16, &#163;78,000 in 1916-17, and &#163;23,000 in 1917-18; and Dreyfus and Company during the same years received &#163;40,000, &#163;57,000, and &#163;16,000 respectively. </para>

Whenever the Labour party has endeavoured to establish a compulsory Commonwealth wheat pool it has always been up against firms like John Darling and Sons, Dreyfus and Company, James Bell and Company, and Dalgety and Company, who offer no serious objection to pools established by a conservative government because they believe that such a government will wink its eye at their actions. For too long have these firms battened on the wheat producers of Australia.

                            <para>- That is so ; the Bruce Page Government sold the Line for &#163;1,900,000, of which &#163;500,000 has never been recovered. The Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers gave employment to a large number of Australian seamen ; its boats were victualled in Australia ; repairs were carried out here ; and as some of the ships were built at Cockatoo Island Dockyard opportunities were provided for the employment and training of a large number of Australian artisans. A Labour government purchased fifteen vessels for &#163;2,000,000 in 1916 ; by 1921 profits enabled the management to write the capital value down to nil, whilst having in hand a. profit amounting to &#163;1,699,000. In addition to those fifteen vessels, the Government secured several seized enemy ships and placed them in commission. The operations of the whole fleet for the five years 1916-21 resulted in a profit of &#163;4,826,000. Shortly after the Line was established, its boats were carrying Australian wheat to London at &#163;7 10s. a ton when British owners were charging &#163;13 a ton and more. For verification of those figures I refer honorable members to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the 10th July, 1923, page 868. The Line claimed that the reduction of freight charges saved Australia over &#163;2,000,000 a year from 1923 until it was disposed of, besides having prevented increases of rates before that year, particularly during the war period. Time and again London ship-owners cabled the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers seeking an agreement to increase freight charges, but on each occasion the request was refused and freights were kept down to a reasonable level.

Subsequently, however, pressure was brought to bear upon him, with the result that he disposed of the Line, making the extraordinarily bad bargain to which I have referred. Since the sale of the Line, the primary producers have from time to time complained about excessive freight charges imposed by the Conference Lines for the carriage of goods between Australia and Great Britain. A couple of years ago, the primary producers contended that the wheat-growers were being robbed of millions of pounds a year owing to excessive freight charges.

                    <para class="block">The primary producers were entirely in the hands of the rapacious shipping companies. They found that governments seemed quite impotent to give them the redress to which they were entitled. I emphasize the wonderful part played by the Labour party&#39;s Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers during the last war, when it was operated in the interests of the primary producers of this country, bringing about reduced freights, and affording cargo space which otherwise would not have been available. Because control subsequently passed to a government which was opposed to State ownership of public utilities, the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers was sold shortly after it began to show a slight loss. That government overlooked the wonderful part played by the Line during the last war, and during the immediate post-war years. What would have happened if our Australian railways had been sold to private enterprise, merely because they began to operate at a loss? There would not now be one railway under government control, and the primary producers would either have no rail facilities at all, or these facilities would be provided at much higher rates than exist to-day. </para>
                    <para>In dealing with this budget, the Government should bear in mind a number of factors. One is that for some time unemployment has been increasing in this country, and another is the fact that defence expenditure will not take the place of normal expenditure from loans on works which are now being carried out by the States and affording widespread employment - such works as road construction, water conservation and irrigation, sewerage, and so on. It would be a bad thing for Australia if there were a steep diminution of the loan money that is arranged by the Commonwealth Government for the States to carry out these essential works. For a number of years the State governments have had to curtail their loan activities owing to the attitude adopted by the Loan Council. During the four financial years from 1935-36 to 1938-39, they asked the Loan Council for &#163;101,500,000 for public works, but received only &#163;78,000,000. By receiving &#163;23,000,000 &#39; less than they asked for. there had to be some curtailment of their long-range programme for the expansion and development of the respective States. </para>
                    <para>A perusal of the budget reveals that the revenue from direct taxation in the years 1931-32 and 1937-38 was approximately the same. Income tax last year yielded about the same amount as it did in 1931-32, but indirect taxation increased by &#163;2-6,000,000. That means that total taxation has increased by &#163;26,000,000.&#39; In view of the exigencies of the financial position, and the grave situation- that confronts Australia to-day, we do not offer any opposition to the increasing of the sales tax, but that does not mean that we connive at the Government&#39;s policy of placing the burden of taxation upon the masses of the people instead of upon the wealthy sections of the community. On one occasion, when speaking on the obligation of rich citizens to pay more in connexion with defence, the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Henry Gullett),</inline> now Minister for External Affairs, said that it was for the rich man more than any other that the last war was fought, because he had so much at stake, and the rich man should contribute more heavily towards the cost of the war. At that time, the honorable member was sitting on the back benches of this House, and was free to express his own opinion on questions such as that. He then made many speeches that will go down in history. To-day, he is a member of the Government and I hope that he will use his influence to see that the rich people of Australia pay a much larger share of the cost of this war than they did towards the cost of the last war. During the last war, many people grew fabulously rich at the expense of the taxpayers of this country, and then the Government went to them, cap in hand, to ask them to invest their spare money in government loans, for which they received rates of interest ranging up to 6 per cent. Those people made no sacrifice comparable to the sacrifice made by the masses of the working people of Australia, who now find that, as the result of this huge increase of indirect taxation by &#163;26,000,000, the prices of their every-day commodities have gone up, whilst the basic wage is still the same with a reduced purchasing power. There is always a lag in the increase of wages by comparison with the increase of prices, and it is here that we aTe ou.it to impress upon the Government that we shall keep constant guard against the profiteering that is sure to go on in this war as it did in the last. The responsibility to check profiteering rests with the Government, but the Opposition will give every assistance to place on the statute-book whatever legislation is necessary to bring to book unscrupulous individuals who seek to grow wealthy at the expense of the people generally at a time when so much sacrifice and suffering is prevalent among millions of people throughout the world. </para>
                    <para>Whilst Australia must, of necessity, finance its war obligations, at the same time it must not overlook its social and economic obligations to the people; it must constantly endeavour to minimize the hardships imposed upon the masses. The Federal Government should use to a much greater degree the credit resources of the nation in financing reproductive public works and certain defence works. There is no doubt that now that war has broken out, many thousands of people throughout Australia, who have no margin of savings to act as a buffer, will find themselves thrown on the unemployment market, and it will be a cold and cheerless world with no one prepared to help them. It is the responsibility of the Government, in co-operation with the State governments, to see that money is found to employ these people. We . cannot overlook the fact that, active as the State governments have been during the last five years in carrying out works programmes and so creating employment, with the whittling down of loan money in accordance with the announcement by the Prime Minister at the recent Premiers Conference, they will be unable to continue their essential works at the previous years&#39; volume. To-day, there are 150,000 people out of work and unless something is done, that number will be increased to 200,000 within the next few months. I therefore appeal to the Government to see that this matter is not overlooked. </para>

                        <para>. - No man at this stage can foresee the scope or the duration of the war. We all hope that it will be confined to its present limits, but the interests of three great Powers of the world may involve the intervention of any one of them, or all of them, before we go very far. In such circumstances, Australia&#39;s position will be affected both in the military and in the economic sense. All honorable members will agree that there is no charity in international affairs to-day, and that the impelling motive is self-interest, whetted by opportunity. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I believe that all honorable members will agree that local security is still the first principle of war, and that that will aPply to Australia in this conflict just as in any other circumstances. Australia&#39;s first duty is to Australia - to place it in a position whereby it need not fear attack, and might be able to inform the United Kingdom that during this conflict Australia would not require any military help from Great Britain. Australia&#39;s second duty is to have on tap armed forces capable of intervening in any of the theatres of war which might extend from Egypt to Hong Kong, according to the way in which the conflict happens to develop. Australia&#39;s third duty is to maintain supplies of foodstuffs and munitions to Great Britain and our Allies in any theatre of war in which they happen to be needed. I speak of intervention. May I point out that intervention of Italy against us might require the presence in Egypt, Palestine or the Bed Sea area of troops supplied by the Commonwealth. Should Russia happen to come into the war against us, it might be necessary for the Commonwealth to undertake some action to defend the north-west frontier of India, and also to guard against a thrust towards the oilfields of Iran, on which the British Navy is vitally dependent for supplies. Such a thrust might have such vital consequences and European conditions might be such that it would be necessary for us to intervene in that area. In addition, we have one inescapable responsibility, that is, the security of Singapore. This is not the first occasion upon which I have raised this matter. When I entered Parliament five years ago, I raised it with the then Minister for Defence. The reply sent to me, which was distinguished by a large amount of blue sealing wax on the outside, and no common-sense inside, would be illuminating if published to-day. We also have some responsibility for the safety of the British and French Pacific possessions which lie in our neighbourhood, particularly as the French nation is involved in the same conflict as we are. </para>
                    <para>Many problems confront the Government in regard to civil defence, which is a matter for Commonwealth initiative, but for State action. An assurance by the Government on this point would be helpful. I do not know the degree to which organization for civil defence in States other than my own has been carried, but I am fairly familiar with what has been done in South Australia, and I take this opportunity to pay a high tribute to the officer who was seconded from the State Government service to organize this work. A huge range of activities is involved in civil defence. It is not merely a matter of air raid precautions. Fire fighting, evacuation of congested areas or areas threatened with attack, casualty services, power, light, police and transport all come under the heading of civil defence. Economic organization is imperative for local supplies, and to maintain a stream of foodstuffs and munitions to the United Kingdom and the allies. Australia should become an arsenal, a universal military provider to the British possessions east of Suez. I was interested to hear the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> on this point. We are not unmindful of the history of the last war as it affected the export industries. So far as my party is concerned, we are determined to give a fair deal, and to get a fair deal for the primary producers during the period of this war. The whole of the organization for the storing, handling and marketing of primary produce overseas was the work of the gentleman whose place I now occupy. Wool, wheat, dairy produce, fruit, wine - all of these industries owe him a debt which cannot easily be measured in cash. </para>
                    <para>I am of the opinion that Australia should have under arms a considerable force of men. We must accept the position with which we are faced. I believe that if we were to put men through a period of compulsory training for six months in batches of about 100,000 we should achieve two things: We should have a considerable force to guard us against aggression during the war, and this would be achieved with less economic disturbance than would be occasioned by the plan proposed by the Government. The proposal to train batches of Militia for periods of sixteen days at a time to which reference has  been made by the Minister is not likely to give the best results. It would be very disturbing to industry, and it is doubtful whether the results achieved would be commensurate with the cost. Moreover, I am afraid that a high proportion of those supposed to be undergoing training are, in fact, engaged in some form of guard duty, and that the amount of actual military training they receive is small indeed. </para>

                            <para>- If the scheme I have suggested were adopted it would enable us to intervene in any theatre of war that was considered necessary. The very existence of such a force, demonstrating as it would the determination of the people of this country to prepare for the worst, would, I believe, be very helpful in restricting the area of hostilities in certain quarters not so very remote from us. To my mind, there has been a most regrettable air of unreality about the proceedings of this House since Parliament met last week. No one would think, judging from the proceedings of this Parliament, that Australia is engaged in what may yet be a life and death struggle. No one can foresee the course or duration of the war. Time lost by the Government now can never be made up. We have been given no intimation, so far, of any definite military plan for the defence of Australia. This is regrettable, and I hope it will not be long before this defect is remedied. A comprehensive policy for security at home, and for intervention abroad, if necessary, is urgently needed. We must have a government that is prepared resolutely and ruthlessly to carry out such a policy. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, I say ruthlessly. War is ruthless. Those who are not prepared to enter it on those terms had better keep out. For home defence a policy of universal military training is essential; there should be no equivocation in regard to that. It is a great pity that this policy was not adopted in the immediate past. If it had, many of the difficulties now confronting us might not have arisen. For overseas operations we should maintain the voluntary principle of service. I am still attached to the military forces, and I am quite prepared to go to any part of the world on service whenever it is considered necessary that our citizens should be sent. I ask for no special consideration, and I do not think that any other honorable member of this House would, in the circumstances, do less than I am prepared to do. In the meantime, we can only hope that we shall shortly have a more definite pronouncement in regard to the defence proposals of the Government than we have had up to the present. </para>

                        <para>.- This committee is called upon to consider the budget very shortly after the commencement of a war which, as we all know, may yet develop into the most serious struggle in which the British Empire has been engaged for 100 years. The budget was prepared in anticipation of peace, and it is necessarily unrelated, to a great degree, to the conditions which now obtain. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> made that much clear when he said that we could expect supplementary taxation proposals to be brought down in the near future. I propose to await those war-time taxation proposals before offering criticism, but I make the general observation that I hope that there will be a proper spread of taxation; that the principle will be maintained that those who have most shall be called upon to pay the most. I also hope that a fair balance will be maintained between direct and indirect taxation. I listened to both the Leader and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition pointing out that indirect taxation has increased tremendously during the last eight or nine years in relation to direct taxation. That is a matter for regret. There has, unfortunately, been a steep and continuous increase of indirect taxation, which is borne substantially by the masses of people, while scarcely any increase has taken place in direct taxation levied by this Parliament. We know, of course, that during the same period there has been a steep and continuous rise in the direct taxation imposed by the other six governments. I hope that a proper balance will also be preserved between  expenditure out of revenue and from loan for war purposes. We have to decide in what proportion we shall pay for the war now, and the proportion that posterity should pay. The opinion is held by many Australians that it is possible, through the instrumentality of the Commonwealth Bank, to draw to a much greater degree than is done now on what is called the national credit. I heartily subscribe to that doctrine in principle, but I do not believe that it can be applied to the degree that the Opposition, and many members of the public, appear to think possible. I do not believe that there is an unlimited supply to be drawn upon. </para>

                            <para>- That is a pertinent question, but I do not think that we, as laymen, are qualified to answer it any more than laymen would be qualified to answer a question involving some abstruse scientific principle. I believe that, generally, members of the Opposition feel that there is a much more substantial well of untapped wealth to be drawn upon from this source than my colleagues or I believe there is. I have explained my view in reply to the pertinent interjection of the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward).</inline> I repeat, that I would not associate myself with those who believe that it is impossible to draw anything from this source of national credit. I feel that the Government should have at its disposal, and should use, the advice of those who, by their life training, are best competent to advise on this subject, and that, upon such advice being given, the Government should act. </para>

                    <para>I pass the general financial subject by repeating my attitude towards it: I think that the war-time taxation proposals of the Government should be introduced at as early a date as possible, and that there should be as equitable a spread of taxation as is possible between the various sections of the community. Concurrently, there should be certain proposals which will have as their intention the spread over a reasonable period of time of the general cost of the conflict in which we are engaged. </para>
                    <para>The point must be very noticeable to all honorable members who are participating in parliamentary proceedings on the commencement of a most serious war, that very little information has been placed before the Parliament with respect to the immediate military proposals of the Government. We hear of financial proposals, of proposals for dealing with certain aspects relating to the protection of civil property, of very necessary proposals to ensure price control and to prevent profiteering, and of proposals for the storage and disposal of primary products, but we hear very little of the immediate military proposals of the Government, confronted though this country is with the very real possibility of having to fight at home for the defence of its own land. There is too great a tendency on the part of the people of this country, and I think that they are encouraged by the attitude of the Government, to believe that we have no immediate necessity to make great military preparations against the possibility of having to defend our country within its own borders. I believe that the changes of relations that take place between the various nations of the world, the sudden, unforeseen, and unpredictable relations that we have seen in the last few weeks, should bring vividly before us a realization of the fact that there could be overnight a change of relations between this country and certain other foreign countries which might confront us with the almost immediate necessity to defend our own country. To that end, the people of Australia are entitled to hear from the Government something more than financial proposals, something more than proposals which have to do with the protection of property and the disposal of products. We should expect to hear of some real and effective proposals for the military defence of our country. </para>
                    <para>I consider that the greatest obligation of citizenship of any man is the obligation to be trained, prepared and ready to fight to defend his land within its own borders. To that end, the Government should lose no time whatever in re-proclaiming compulsory military service in Australia.I am amazed to find, in this, the second week of war, that Australia is drivelling along with a small volunteer force, and apparently is not intending to re-proclaim that system of compulsory universal training which, on the occasion of the last great war, provided us with some assurance that we had within our own borders a body of partially-trained and equipped men who could immediately be put into the. field to defend our own country. I am quite aware of the difficulties which the heads of the military services have raised with regard to the training of the men who would be called up under a system of compulsory universal military training. Whilst I would not dispute that there are severe complications associated with the introduction of compulsory universal military training, I say that war is war, and that we cannot be fobbed off with any story from the military experts to the effect that trained men are not available to train our manhood. If we were confronted next week with au attack by an enemy country whose shores are lapped by the same ocean as laps the shores of this country - and it is not beyond the bounds of possibility, because these things develop and break between nations so quickly - we would not tolerate for one moment the story that it was impossible to put men in training because trained men were not available to train them. There are in this country thousands of experienced ex-soldiers who are quite capable of giving preliminary, elementary training in warfare, and of instilling discipline into bodies of men, which is the very first step in preparing them for actual warfare. I believe that if this Government were as earnest as it should be, it would lose no time whatever in taking the formal step of re-proclaiming compulsory universal military service for the home defence of this country, and that then it would not tolerate any advice given to it by its experts to the effect that it is impossible to find men capable of training Australian manhood for the defence of their&#39; own land. I am not one of those who believe that compulsion should be applied in connexion with the raising of troops for overseas service which might at any time be sent from Australia. I really believe that the mind of the Australian people was sufficiently clarified on this issue during the last war for one to be able to say with reasonable assurance and accuracy that there could not be found to-day one man occupying an important place in the public life of Australia who would advocate compulsory military service for Australians abroad. In my opinion, that is an accurate statement of the position. I think that it is a crystallization of the public mind, brought about by the conscription referendum campaigns of the last war. For my part, I accept that willingly as being a proper policy for this country. On the other hand, I believe that the ultimate fate of Australia may well be decided without one shot being fired within the borders of this country. A land, 3,000,000 square miles in area, with so sparse a population as we have - a mere <inline font-style="italic">7,000,000</inline> people - is entirely incapable of the utmost efforts of its manhood and its resources which would be necessary ultimately to ensure its own protection against attack by a powerful and populous military aggressor. That drives me to the conclusion that, irrespective of any necessity with which we may be confronted immediately to defend our own country, our fate could well be sealed by the defeat of Great Britain abroad. To that end, if the time should arise when we were able to feel, by a clarification of the relations between the various nations - which is not apparent to-day - that it would be safe for this country to permit some of its own sons to participate in the defence of the British Empire abroad, we should be willing to permit men to volunteer for that service. Those who volunteered should be facilitated to go abroad to fight for the defence of the British Empire, with which I am positive is wrapped up the ultimate fate of this country. In case there should be any misapprehension of my attitude, I may say that in existing circumstances I do not regard it as safe to permit any man to leave this country to fight, overseas. </para>

During the last war we saw the progressive involvement of nation after nation. That will probably prove to be the course of events in the present war, and it is that belief which brings me to the conclusion that eventually there probably will be such a clarification of international relations as will permit us to decide whether or not it is safe for Australians to go abroad to fight for the defence of their Empire, and in doing so, for the defence of their own country. I hope that, in the plans for the defence of this nation, there will be the closest, the most continuous, and the most harmonious co-operation between the seven governments of Australia. Contemplating the matter of defence, which is the most vital and intimate issue to-day, we are immediately confronted with the complications that are associated with inefficient government action, just as we ave confronted with the complications of our federal system when any important and vital issue arises. When we examine those things which should be done to place this country in a real state of defence, we immediately realize that no one government has within itself either the power or the opportunity to make all decisions; we realize that Australia is probably singled out as the country which, above all others in the world, is saddled with the most inefficient system of government that we could possibly have, a system under which this nation is governed by a set of seven parliaments and seven governments, no single one of which has the sovereign right to deal even with this vital matter of defence. . Among the many issues involved in what I am now saying is the most vital one of transport. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think any such thing. There are constitutional obstacles which inevitably establish an inherent inefficiency in the Government of Australia by reason of the federal system with which we are saddled. I hope that the exigencies of war which we have to face may have at least one good result in causing our people to realize that Australia cannot afford to continue the intolerably inefficient system of government bequeathed to us by those who contrived this thing which we call the Commonwealth Constitution. I hope that we shall emerge from the terrors and dangers of war with a more efficient system of government than we have to-day. This is not a criticism levelled at this Government or any one of the State governments. It is a criticism of our federal system. </para>

                    <para>As I propose to take the opportunity afforded by the detailed discussion of the Estimates under departmental headings to deal with certain items affecting the departments, I shall not refer to those matters at the moment. </para>
                    <para>I must, however, touch one issue upon which I have tried, without success, to elicit some information from the Prime Minister, by questions which I have asked to-day and also in the previous sessional period. It has relation to the financial difficulty which confronts the people engaged in our land industries. We are at the commencement of a war in which I feel sure the material side will loom much more largely than it has in any previous war. This war will inevitably be more costly in money than any previous war. Already the Government of the United Kingdom, anticipating very severe destruction of civil property and very heavy loss of civil life, has announced its intention of assuming obligations to pay compensation in respect of civilians killed in air raids, and also to pay pensions to civilians and dependants of civilians who suffer in consequence of air raids. This, of course, will be in addition to obligations that must inevitably be incurred in respect of members of the various arms of the forces. For this reason, I say that the money cost of this war, and the obligations that will follow in its aftermath, will be of such staggering proportions as to be impossible of comparison to any previous expenditure of money. That being so, I consider that it will be unlikely that the prevailing money system will emerge at the conclusion of the war in the form in which we know it to-day. That, I believe, is a reasonable conclusion. I have no doubt that people who lend money will be thinking similar thoughts. The value of money will probably be altered seriously during the progress of the expenditure on this war. People who customarily lend money on fixed security for a fixed term at a fixed rate of interest will without doubt be asking themselves whether their money will continue to have its present value. Progressive doubts must arise in their minds concerning the future. Consequently, I believe there will be a progressive contraction in the lending of money, by either public institutions or private persons, for fixed periods, particularly on mortgage. I should suspect that, having these thoughts in mind, those connected with our banking and financial institutions, would probably prefer to embark upon a policy of making their overdraft advances for investment of a more liquid character, compared with the more fixed and frozen investments to which they have been accustomed, particularly in respect of land. This is likely to have a very serious affect upon those engaged in our farming and pastoral industries, who lean heavily upon borrowed money in order to maintain their operations. These people may, in the not distant future, be confronted with very serious difficulties in securing loans for a fixed period of years on fixed conditions. On this account, I consider that- it will be very necessary for the Government to proceed, without delay, with a bona fide proposal that was introduced by the Government of which I was a member for the establishment of a Government mortgage bank, as a branch of the Commonwealth Bank, for the purpose of making loans for a period of years at reasonable rates of interest. That proposal still appears on the notice-paper. I have endeavoured to obtain an assurance from the Prime Minister that the Government intends to proceed with the proposal. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Gwydir <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> is apparently trying to indicate, by interjection, some criticism of this proposal. I shall not engage in controversy with him at the moment. I have not heard of any proposal yet submitted to this, or any other, Parliament which has been above criticism. Although this proposal is one to which I was a party in its earlier stages, I do not pretend to say it is above criticism. I shall say, however, that the principle embodied in it, which provides for the establishment by the Government of the nation of some institution to lend money to those whose avocations necessitate them leaning upon borrowed money, is sound. I am prepared to debate that issue, but I am also prepared to be influenced by the opinions of honorable members of this committee upon it. I should be the last one in the world to say that the proposal is perfect, but its merits should be considered. I consider that its underlying and fundamental principle is sound and that immediate necessity exists for embodying it in legislation. I therefore hope that the Prime Minister will not permit Parliament to go into recess on this occasion without taking some steps to bring into being a government financial institution for the purpose I have indicated. The difficulties to which I have referred will, during the next few years, strike at the very roots of the security of the tenure of their land by our primary producers, the particular section of the community which I was sent to this Parliament to represent. It is futile for us to discuss the prices to be paid year after year for the products of the land, the methods of transport, disposal and storage of their products that should be adopted, and which we have been discussing of late, unless we first assure the security of these people in the tenure of these properties. We must ensure that the sources of money that have been available to our primary producers for generations to enable them to carry on their work, shall not be allowed to dry up. These matters should be seen in their proper perspective. I trust that the Government will deal promptly with this issue. </para>
                    <para>I conclude by expressing the hope that the Government will not delay long in proposing to this Parliament some immediate measures for the defence of our country which are commensurate with the needs of the situation. </para>

                    <para>It is possible that honorable members will not gather the purport of the two separate customs tariff proposals, numbered 9 and 10 respectively, and I shall therefore explain. Proposal No. 9 amends a previous tariff proposal at present awaiting discussion. The earlier tariff proposal contained increases of the general tariff duties made by the previous Government consequent upon the lifting of the trade diversion restrictions in order to safeguard capital investment incurred as a direct result of those restrictions. At that time it was made clear that these increased duties would be subject to review by the Tariff Board. The amendments now included in proposal No. 9 are made as the result of the board&#39;s recommendations. Proposal No. 10 covers other subjects upon which the Tariff Board has submitted reports. </para>
                    <para>Explanatory statements have been circulated for the convenience of the committee, and, whilst these contain the essence of the amendments, I feel it is incumbent upon me to offer some explanation, however brief, of some of the major amendments contained in the schedules. Taking first proposals No. 9, which amend the tariff proposals that followed the lifting of the trade diversion  restrictions, probably the most important item is refrigerators. In this case the Tariff Board recommended a reversion to the ad valorem foreign rate of 75 per cent. on refrigerators and assembled parts. In view of the large amount of capital invested and the extensive employment given in this industry and the fact that importations from foreign sources are showing a tendency to increase, the Government has decided to maintain the present fixed rates with an alternative ad valorem rate of 75 per cent. The net effect of the Government&#39;s proposals on refrigerators is a reduction of 10 per cent. ad valorem under the British preferential tariff on unassembled parts. </para>
                    <para>A slight increase is proposed of the general tariff on gears for motor vehicles. In the light of the board&#39;s report on this  subject the Government takes the view that the capital investments made under cover of the trade diversion policy should be fully protected. </para>
                    <para>Increases are proposed on the large kinds of engine-driven lawnmowers, irrespective of origin and in the foreign rates on the smaller kinds. Cheap foreign lawnmowers of the hand type have offered some competition to Australian manufacturers, and the Government has decided, on the recommendation of the Tariff Board, to increase the foreign rates. </para>
                    <para>Of the other items in the schedule, increases are proposed on brake and transmission linings from Canadian and foreign sources and shock absorbers, whilst the duties are reduced on fractional horse-power motors, electrolytic condensers, motor car door locks, eoi&#93; springs, and on lawnmowers of types other than those to which I have already referred. The tariff position with respect to electric fans remains practically unchanged. </para>
                    <para>I now come to Customs Tariff Proposals No. 10, the larger of the two. Reductions of duties are proposed on wool tops, woollen yarns and woollen piece goods. This question was the subject of intensive study by the Tariff Board. In its report the board has definitely indicated that the woollen manufacturing industry should be able to function with much lower protection than at present, and that under the duties now proposed imported cloths will still land at costs higher than Australian manufacturers&#39; selling prices of comparable materials. The industry should therefore be able to compete under the lower duties. </para>
                    <para>Other branches of the textile field are covered in this schedule. The recent establishment of mills for the spinning of cotton condenser and cotton  co con ada  yarns for use in towel manufacture has resulted in a recommendation by the Tariff Board for the imposition of protective duties on those yarns. Correspondingly, an increase is made of the duties on towels, partly to offset the higher duties on condenser yarns which are used largely in coloured towels and partly with a view to enabling Australian towel manufacturers to secure a greater share of the market for white towels. </para>
                    <para>The duties on yarns for the manufacture of cordage and twines are practically unaltered, but there is a reduction of the British preferential tariff rates on cotton yarns n.e.i. which are used principally in knitting and weaving. </para>
                    <para>There has been a revival of flax production in Australia due largely to the interest displayed by local spinners of flax yarn. The Tariff Board has therefore recommended a widening of the range of flax yarns and threads that are subject to protective duties. Slight reductions are made, however, of the jute yarns duties. </para>
                    <para>Some lines new to Australian secondary industry are granted tariff protection. They are. water bore casings, tap wrenches and certain types of stocks. Water bore casings are now being produced at Newcastle, whilst tap wrenches and stocks are made at Maryborough, Victoria. Protective duties are now imposed on tractor tyres and tubes and on tractor wheels and wheel centres whether imported with tractors or separately. </para>
                    <para>Other lines included in the tariff proposals include petrol pumps on which there is virtually no duty alteration, whilst reductions of duty, most of them small, are made on internal combustion engines, exceeding 50 horse-power, belting, and cordage. Two items which call for special mention are glucose and cornflour. The Tariff Board has stated quite frankly that the high measure of protection granted on these products has been used by local manufacturers to support unjustifiably high levels of costs and selling prices. Accordingly, the duties on importations have been reduced. </para>
                    <para>In conclusion, I feel that I have tabled a schedule of duties which will preserve a reasonable balance in industry. On the one hand, provision has been made for increased duties to new industries and to industries which  aTe  going through their teething stage. On the other, protection has been reduced in the ease of some long-established industries which supply practically the whole of the local market and on others which are taking undue advantage of the tariff. I regard it as a maxim that industries which have been assisted by high tariffs in their early years of production should have acquired a standard of efficiency over the years to allow them to function successfully under  much lower protection when fully established. About industries which are taking undue advantage of the tariff, I say, emphatically, that this Government will not countenance a state of affairs which permits of one industry, under cover of tariff protection, loading up the costs of dependent industry or living costs generally </para>
                    <para class="block">It is proposed to give the committee an early opportunity to discuss these tariff proposals item by item, and in the meantime I shall table the various reports of the Tariff Board for the information of honorable members. </para>

                        <para>. -  This budget, which provides for the expenditure of more than &#163;100,000,000, is an historic document. The principal item of expenditure will be for the defence of this country-&#163;34,000,000 as against &#163;14,000,000 last year, a tremendous increase - but the Labour party is in full accord with the Government in expending that amount of money in order to protect Australia. Unfortunately, the situation is such that that amount of &#163;34,000,000 must be merely the first instalment of what it will be necessary for us to expend before this year is finished on our defence. The Labour party have no objection to that expenditure, because it realizes that it is necessary for whatever government that is in power in days such as these to have adequate re sources upon which to draw to meet the circumstances. The Labour party&#39;s objection is against the method the Government is adopting for the raising of the additional revenue that is needed to cope with the situation. </para>

                            <para>- If the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> refers to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> he will find that practically all of the defence legislation put through Parliament by the Fisher Labour Government was opposed. The Opposition tried to make out, for instance, that it was useless for the Labour Government to make provision for an Australian navy. It derided the projected navy as a mosquito fleet. The honorable member for Deakin endeavoured by inference to make the people believe that because the Fisher Government took certain action during the last war the Labour party in those days was vastly different from the Labour party to-day. I say definitely that throughout the years there has been no change in Labour&#39;s policy. When the widow of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrew</inline> Fisher arrived in Australia a few weeks ago the Tory press, in a desire to gain cheap anti-Labour propaganda, endeavoured to get her to say that the Labour party has changed since the days when her late husband had led it with such distinction. <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Fisher,</inline> however, replied that the party to-day is the same as when her husband led it, except, perhaps, that it has progressed with the times. Labour has no apologies to  make for its defence policy. Notwithstanding the fact that during the last elections our friends -opposite were successful in hoodwinking the people into the belief that Labour&#39;s defence policy was a policy of isolation, it is becoming more and more apparent each day that the Government is adopting it as its own. Labour&#39;s defence policy has been accepted and endorsed by the people of Australia, and when the next appeal is made to the people they will unhesitatingly endorse it. </para>

                    <para>We have no objection to the Government&#39;s proposals to raise sufficient funds to prosecute Australia&#39;s share in this war; but we have very strong objections to the method by which the money is to be raised. In order to help to finance our war commitments, certain increases of taxes are proposed; but once again we find that the heaviest burdens are to be placed upon the shoulders of those least able to bear it. Income tax, which is paid by a large section of the community, is to be increased by 10 per cent., and sales tax, which everybody, rich and poor alike, has to pay, is increased by 1 per cent. But what of the wealthy land-owners? Despite the fact that during the last 5 or 6 years this Government and its immediate predecessors have remitted to&#34; their wealthy supporters land tax amounting to many millions of pounds, no attempt is now being made to exact from these people their just contributions to the national revenues. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> and the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> submitted tables showing that land tax representing a huge amount of money has been remitted to a very small number of people. Land tax is a direct tax which is imposed on the least number of people. Having regard to the exemption of unimproved land to the value of &#163;5,000, it will be seen that very few small farmers and shop-keepers are called upon to pay it. Land tax is collected mainly from the owners of big city properties such as banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions. It is to them that the Government should now turn in seeking to enlarge its revenues. As they have the most at stake they should be compelled to contribute very generously to wards the defence of their country when it is in danger. </para>
                    <para>It is estimated that invalid and old-age pensions will cost an additional &#163;708,000 this year. I believe that if the Government did justice to the aged and infirm people in the community it would have to double that amount. Every member of this Parliament is approached almost daily by unfortunate people seeking pensions. It is high time that the provisions of the Invalid and Old-Age Pensions Act were liberalized. It should be the right of any person whose state of -health renders him unemployable to secure an invalid pension. As the act now stands, an invalid pension is not granted unless the applicant can prove that he is permanently and totally incapacitated. In other words, before a person is entitled to draw the invalid pension he must be as helpless as a child. Provision should be made foi&#39; all those who are incapable of earning their living regardless of the cost. In the same way the conditions governing the granting of war and service pensions should be liberalized. During the last sittings of this Parliament the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> endeavoured to have discussed, on the day set aside for private business, a motion to deal with anomalies under the Repatriation Act. Unfortunately, because of the end of the session rush of business at the time he was prevented from doing so. The matter was later discussed during the debate on the Supply Bill, and on that occasion I had an opportunity to voice my own opinion and to give a concrete illustration of how, as the result of the way in which the act was being administered and of the methods adopted by the medical referees, returned soldiers, or widows of deceased returned soldiers, have been unable to secure pensions to which they are entitled. I have before me a long letter from a returned soldiers&#39; organization in Queensland compla ining most bitterly about the way in which returned soldier applicants for pensions are treated. It states that, in many instances, claims have been flatly refused, and difficulties have been placed in the way of applicants in their endeavour to prove their eligibility for pensions. I hope that the Government will take this matter up ai the earliest possible date, aud see if something cannot be done towards liberalizing the provisions of the act. I am sure that the returned soldiers&#39; organizations in every State will be able to provide concrete examples of the rejection of worthy applications. I honestly believe that since this Government came into power, there has been a tendency to refuse or cancel invalid and old-age pensions at every possible opportunity; because every pension which is refused or cancelled means a saving to the revenue. There are many ways in which the necessary money could be provided to give these unfortunate people the pensions to which they are justly entitled. </para>
                    <para>In his budget speech, the Treasurer stated that unemployment had decreased considerably during the last few years, but he also said that unemployment had increased during the last twelve months at least, from 8.5 per cent, to 9.4 per cent. These figures are probably correct so far as trade union returns are concerned, but I believe I am right in saying that the percentage of unemployed in Australia today . is twice as high, because trade union figures cover only porion of the unemployed. I feel sure that there are many honorable members in this chamber who can bear me out when I say that there are several trade unions which do not supply the Commonwealth Statistician with any employment figures whatsoever. No doubt, those unions show a greater percentage of unemployed in their membership than others, because they include seasonal workers. I repeat that the proporion of unemployment in Australia is actually much higher than the percentage given by the Treasurer. Unfortunately, the unemployment problem is increasing every day. During this week some honorable members have dealt with the position of certain industries such as wool, hides, and various others, the condition of which is such that many employees are being dismissed. I had brought under my notice one such case yesterday. I received very little satisfaction from the Prime Minister when I brought the matter up in this chamber, and although I know that the right honorable gentleman was not able to give a direct answer to my question, the in for- ma tion which he did give was not at all encouraging. It is also a fact that the unemployment figures given by the Treasurer did not take into account the many thousands of youths- 50,000 or 60,000 leave school every year - who are unable to secure employment. Many of them have never had a day&#39;s work in their lives. Why were not these people included in the figures submitted by the Treasurer? If the Government is sincere and really desires to do its duty to the people of  Australia, it should do something to assist the unfortunate unemployed and the workers generally, because, after all, if the security of the Commonwealth were threatened to-morrow, it would be to these people that the Government would look for assistance. If this Government does not provide the unemployed with jobs, how can it expect to call upon them to give their services in the defence of the country? There are many ways in which the Government could obtain the finance necessary to assist the unemployed, but I do not intend to go into the financial aspect of this question because it has been thoroughly discussed in this chamber on various occasions, even during this debate. Finding the finance is the Government&#39;s&#39; job, but I submit that, if money can be found for defence purposes, then it should be found either to put these men into full time employment, or at least to provide them with the wherewithal to live, instead of allowing them to be dependent on charity as they are to-day. </para>
                    <para>I should like to say a few words with respect to the position of the waterside workers. Some months ago several honorable members on this side of the chamber, including myself, brought forward a complaint regarding the treatment meted out to waterside workers in various ports of Australia. I appreciate, and the waterside workers appreciate, the action that the Government took in having an inquiry made into the conditions on the waterfront. I had an opportunity to take a fairly prominent part in the investigations carried out at Brisbane, and I have before me the report of the present Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. John Lawson)</inline> who as Parliamentary Secretary was deputed to make the inquiries. I shall deal only with one or two clauses - of that report, and 1 am pleased to see that the right honorable the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> is present because the investigation was taken up by his department. The right honorable gentleman was good enough to let me have a copy of the report. The Transport Workers Act has been a burn. ing question ever since it. was brought into force  on the  Australian waterfront. 1 have said in the past, and I say again, that it is one of the most iniquitous statutes ever foisted upon the people of Australia. Notwithstanding that, the waterside workers have loyally carried out their duties under very trying circumstances. In Brisbane there is what is known as a licensing system and also a disc system. Only men who possess waterfront discs are permitted to go into the pick-up shed in order to secure work. They complained about that, but I notice that although the Minister for Trade and Customs has dealt with the matter in his report, he has made no specific recommendation. My own opinion is that the licensing system is being utilized by the Shipowners Joint Council in Brisbane contrary  to  the best interests of men engaged on the waterfront. Although there is only work for 1,400 nien at the port of Brisbane, 3,279 licences have been issued. Only 1,400 men possess discs, and the other unfortunate people holding only licences, are expected by the shipowners to be available whenever there  is  a surplus of work. The time has arrived when this system of issuing licences and discs should be abolished. The men have to pay ls. for their licences, and, though the shipowners will not admit it, they are led to believe that if they get a licence they will be given work. But that is not the  case.  Many of those who hold licences have  never  obtained a job at all. At the port  of  Brisbane, there are still 270 federation men who have been refused discs, and I have been closely associated with them for many years. The majority of them 1 know personally. They are conscientious, loyal, and good citizens, men who always did their work to the satisfaction of the shipowners before the unfortunate strike of 1928. Not one of those men has ever been able to get a disc. On the other hand, I know that men who had never previously worked on the wharf received discs three days after getting their licences. Some of them have been in the country only eight or nine months and can scarcely speak a word of English. That is a disgraceful state of affairs. Iu some instances, men have paid the last ls. they possessed for a licence in the hope of get ing a few hours&#39; work. Then they have stood outside for hours and hours hoping to get a call, but no work is ever offered to them. By far too many licences have boon issued for the Port of Brisbane There is work for only 1,400 men, but no fewer than 3,279 licences have been issued. </para>

The Government would have nothing to regret. The men would appreciate even the suspension of the act, if the Government cannot see its way to repeal it altogether. The issue of licences should be stopped, and work given to the men on their merits.

I hope that the Attorney-General will make a note of what I have said in this regard, and also in regard to the recommendations of the Minister for Trade and Customs in regard to waterside conditions. </para>

                            <para>.- I desire first to protest against the failure of the Commonwealth to co-operate with the States in giving assistance to the wheat-growing industry. Never in the history of wheat-growing has the price of wheat been so low as it is at the present time. A couple of weeks ago, the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> held his first meeting with the representatives of the States in Melbourne. The right honorable gentleman then advanced an entirely new proposal. For the first time in the history of Commonwealth assistance to the wheat industry, he insisted that the States should provide &#163;1,500,000 whilst the Commonwealth provided &#163;2,000,000. The States are in the anomalous position that whilst they have wide powers under their constitutions, the Commonwealth holds the purse strings; therefore, they have no real power, but have to come cap in hand to the Commonwealth and under the Financial Agreement accept what the Commonwealth Treasurer cares to offer, or go without. The States have been in a particularly precarious position, because the bulk of the revenue of Australia is obtained by the Commonwealth through customs and excise collections. </para>

                            <para>- At the time, it suited him to agree, because Western Australia was to receive a little more than it otherwise would have been able to obtain. The Minister for Civil Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fairbairn)</inline> is aware that the amount was fixed, and that it would remain static no matter how the population might increase. It was a sort of confidence trick. This shows that the present Commonwealth Government is not prepared to help any business in this country except big business. The position of the wheat-growing industry represents the greatest single&#39; industrial problem in Australia to-day. The price received by the growers is about 75 per cent. below the cost of production. The price at the siding to-day is about1s. 8d. in Western Australia, and about 2s. 2d. in New South Wales. The Premier of Victoria stood up for his rights, and was not prepared to place an insupportable burden on his State. It is to his eternal credit that he did so. The Commonwealth, holding the purse strings, was in the position of the wealthy pampered boy who, in a game of cricket on the village green, owns the stumps, the bat and the balls with which the game is played. Becoming offended, he pulls up the stumps, walks away from the cricket field, and refuses to play. The Prime Minister, in my opinion, displayed detachment from the real problem which faces this country. Five years ago, 70,000 persons were engaged in the wheat-growing industry. To-day, the number is 60,000. The industry in Western Australia has lost from 2,000 to 3,000 persons who had devoted their lives to felling trees and making the land productive, living in almost abject poverty, with very little nourishment to sustain them. The life of a well-kept Australian aboriginal in an Australian mission is one of luxury compared with theirs. I make bold to say that no man outside the growers in the eastern States who have large areas of land that are worked on the share system can possibly make a living out of the industry.

                    <para class="block">Britain at war, no problem other than that of unemployment is equal to this. With an adequate return, the wheat-growing industry would largely increase the -volume of employment among those who are now unable to obtain it. We ask the people to go into and open up the back country. How can we expect them to stay there without social amenities and with no possible chance of making a decent living unless we assist them in their hour of need? This is the most critical period in the history of the industry. If Germany can see fit to pay 12s. a bushel, and France and Italy 9s. a bushel, and the United States of America and Canada can assist their growers, why should the Commonwealth throw the Australian grower .to the wolves, and say, as a member of the Country party said before the tea adjournment, &#34; So far as I am concerned in this war - and that is the only thing that he can see - I believe in conscription and compulsory universal training &#34;. He would force into the military camps these very people who are prevented from making a living on the lands of this country. Wo have not sufficient self-respect to stand up for our rights as our predecessors did on several occasions. For years, with the exception of the year 1937-38, this industry has been completely eclipsed. What are the proposals of the Prime Minister? He said to the Premiers in Melbourne, <inline font-style="italic">&#34;I</inline> am prepared to find &#163;2,000,000 to assist the industry&#34;. Vet. it was proposed to expend &#163;20,000,000 - next month the amount will he raised to &#163;30,000,000, and in the following month to &#163;40,000,000- for the prosecution of a war that may never touch these shores, and let the greatest exporting industry, with the exception of wool, and om.&#39; of the only three which export, go down because we are tied to some fetish of the Prime Minister&#39;s. We found fault with the former Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> but the? is the first gentleman holding that office who has refused wholeheartedly to assist an industry when it is at the lowest ebb in its history. I shall place the facts before the farmers of Western Australia. </para>
                    <para>Why is it that this Parliament is coming into disfavour all over Australia? It arises from the fact that the social needs of the people are not being considered. News arrived to-day of the defeat in his late electorate of Irwin, Western Australia, of an ex-minister who stood in the Country party interest - a good man in his way - by a man who was branded as an Independent. I find no fault with that particular ex-minister. Such a result ought to be regarded as a warning. We have to recognize that since the early days of federation no social services have been granted to the people of this country. A minister was specially appointed to deal with national insurance, but nothing on those lines has been or is being done. I am not blaming the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Frederick Stewart)</inline> ; he is hogtied and will never be able to do anything. It is all very well for him to write to the press and say &#34; When I get to Canberra I shall have something to say in Cabinet&#34;. What he has had to say in Cabinet I do not know, but outside he is as dumb as an oyster; he could not be otherwise. Sixteen of the supposedly backward countries of the world to-day provide national insurance for the benefit of their old people. </para>

That provision has now been raised to &#163;40,000,000; yet we cannot have national insurance to help the industrial soldiers of this country, who are consequently obliged to go on the dole. </para>

                        <para>The wheat-growers of Australia are entitled to a fair deal. They will not be satisfied by being told merely that their wheat has been sold to Great Britain. On the previous occasion during the last war it was disposed of in that way, at about half the price ruling in other parts of the world. The farmers desire to know the price that they will receive for their wheat, but the Government says to them, in effect, &#34; Open your mouth and shut your eyes and see what we shall send you &#34;. The Government proposes to cut the price to the farmers down to 3s. 4d. a bushel at ports. If. that be a fair price, why did the party opposite impose the flour tax on the workers on the basis of the price of 5s. 2d. a bushel at Williamstown?, The Prime Minister said, &#34;We will sell our goods to Great Britain, but we must make sure that we do not put on too high a price &#34;. I. am now given to understand that the wheat of the farmers has been sold for 3s. 4d. a bushel, or Yd. a bushel less than the cost of production. </para>

                        <para>In Great Britain thousands of tons of wheat are being bought from Rumania, and wheat is also&#34; being purchased from Winnipeg at 3s. 91/2d. a bushel, which is barely a payable price. In Chicago the price is 5s. l1/2d. a bushel. I desire to know why the Prime Minister has adopted such a cheese-paring policy as to fix the price to the Australian farmers at 3s. 4d. a bushel. Surely Australia should not be thrown to the wolves because this country is at war. Such action is not likely to increase the patriotism of the people. We have no desire to exploit the British public, as is shown by the fact that, under our tariff, preferential rates are granted to Great Britain ; but we contend that it is a poor rule that does not work both ways. </para>
                        <para>I make no apology for referring to an injustice that has been done to Western Australia. Care should be taken that the people are not exploited by the big men for whom the present Government stands, and to whom it must go for the funds needed for its election campaigns. We should also see that the workers, whether in the factories, in the mines or on the farms, are not exploited. A compulsory wheat pool is now to be established. As long ago as 1930, the Labour party propounded a policy for the setting up of a compulsory wheat pool, but its proposals were rejected, the Country party claiming that it would be necessary to obtain agreement amongst all of the States with regard to the matter. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parker</inline> Moloney called representatives of the farmers together in Canberra in 1930, the Labour Government&#39;s proposals were not put into operation because they did not suit the wheat buyers, who rig the market to get a rake-off. There is no representative of the Wheat-growers Union on the Wheat Board. Who are the members? The  chairman  is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Olive</inline> Macpherson, who is appointed by the Government. He is a director of the National Bank of Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> G. Darling is a wheat buyer and the head of the National Union, which is the spearhead of the United Australia party. He is also one of the heads of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited. Louis Dreyfus and Company are also traders in wheat. Then there is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> S. Teasdale. </para>

When &#34; big business &#34; says to this Government . &#34; March &#34;, the Government marches, and when it says &#34; Halt &#34;, the Government halts. 1 hope that the Country party will join with the Labour party in protesting to the Prime Minister against the injustice of the deal that the wheat-growers of this country are receiving. I do not wish to issue a threat, but the Country party is prepared to sit down on this issue because each is asking, &#34; Whose turn will it be next to be taken into the Ministry ? &#34; I am reminded of a story that I once heard. A fellow married a very fine-looking woman.. Some time afterwards her sister came to live in the home. She also was a fine-looking woman, but much younger. The two were much alike. This man&#39;s friend said to him on one occasion : &#34; I do not know how you can discriminate between the two &#34;. The man replied : &#34; I do not try &#34;. Personally I find it difficult to discriminate between the United Australia party and the&#39; Country party. </para>

                        <para>I wish now to deal with the banana industry of Western Australia, which has also been most, shabbily treated by this Government. After many trials and experiments, extending from 1918 to 192&#38;, during which many failures were experienced, the banana industry has been established in Western Australia. Along the banks of the Gascoyne River, near Carnarvon, where it empties into Shark Bay, a distance of about 700 miles north of Perth, we now have 50 families engaged in growing bananas. That country has only an 8-in. rainfall, and the industry requires to be thoroughly well organized on scientific lines to have any assurance of success. For many years the people of Western Australia depended upon bananas imported from Java, for it was too costly and unsatisfactory to bring bananas from Queensland or New South Wales. The bananas of Java are grown principally by native labour on a wage of 71/2d. a day. Admittedly the soil and climate of Java are admirably suited for the production of this fruit. Even now more than half of the bananas required in Western Australia are being obtained from Java, and are competing on most unequal conditions with the local product. However, the people of Western Australia are now also able to enjoy bananas grown in their own State. In 1937-38, we produced 26.500 cases of bananas and imported 31,000 centals from Java. As Java take goods from Australia valued at only one-sixth of the value of the goods we import from that country, the people of Western Australia decided that, as the competition from Java was fierce, it was desirable that they should reduce the imports from that country. Western Australia is the only State which has had to pay duty on bananas. The large quantities of this fruit grown in Queensland and New South Wales are sufficient to supply the needs of the eastern States. In order to ascertain the exact position in regard to the payment of duty on bananas I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Commerce, upon notice, on 31st May the following questions :  - </para>

                        <para class="block">Those figures show clearly the unfair position in which Western Australia finds itself. I have no doubt that the &#163;2 mentioned relates merely to an experimental shipment imported for some reason or other. In the last twelve years the people of Western Australia have paid &#163;136,303 in customs duties on bananas. We, therefore, thought it was a fair thing to take steps to expand our industry so that imports of bananas would be unnecessary. For that reason I asked that the money now being paid in customs duty should be earmarked to enable the Western Australian industry to be developed on the most scientific lines possible. Moreover, our people desired their fruit to be grown by white labour under Australian conditions. It was impossible for the Government of Western Australia to finance fully the industry, and as even under the existing conditions it was leading to the development of country thai could scarcely be used for any other purpose, we thought it a fair thing to invite the Commonwealth Government to grant the concession which I have indicated. </para>
                        <para>We desire to establish another group of 60 planters with their families in the Gascoyne area. This would result in providing employment for probably 1,000 people. The locality not only has a rainfall of only about eight inches but it also has other disadvantages. Rain falls so irregularly that sometimes drought conditions exist for long periods. That <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> industry has been established at all, is a high testimony to the characteristic pertinacity of the people of the inland. The Gascoyne River has a. watershed that is probably as extensive as that of the Darling River, but the rainstorms that feed the river occur hundreds of miles away, and the water rapidly sinks  through the river bed into subterranean courses. On an average the rain floods the river over its banks and round the town of Carnarvon only once a year. The banana growers there have, consequently, found it necessary to erect windmills. Recently petrol and oil-driven pumps have been installed to lift water from the river bed for irrigation purposes. Another difficulty that the growers have had to combat is the high winds that prevail in that latitude for a great part of the year. To overcome this adversity the planters have erected brush fences to a height of twelve feet or so around their plantations. </para>
                        <para>I &#39; requested the Commonwealth Government to make available the whole of the customs duty collected in respect of bananas imported into &#34;Western Australia but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise,</inline> the State Minister for Agriculture, was more modest and asked for only 25 per cent, of it. The reply made by the Minister for Commerce was not only foolish, it was also inaccurate in that it stated that the Commonwealth Government had received no official information in respect of this industry, nor any request from Western Australia for assistance. I have on many occasions referred to the matter in this Parliament. Fortunately, I can furnish other evidence that requests have been made from the State Government for assistance. There is on the departmental file a long letter from the Western Australian Minister for Agriculture to the present Minister for Supply and Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> under date the  4th  January,  1938.  This makes a definite request for assistance. I shall not read it all, but I direct the attention of honorable members to the following paragraphs : - </para>
                        <quote>
                            <para>The State government has endeavoured to provide relief to the growers in assisting them to establish this industry by way of concessions in haulage and handling costs, spending money in locating subterranean water channels in the river bed, provision of suitable trucks for transport from the goods shed to the jetty, and by advances to growers from the Treasury to assist them in financing their activities. Transport has been and will be a very difficult problem in forwarding this crop to the market of Perth, and the State government has spent over &#163;5,000 per annum in recent years in making a  traffic kab le  road to the nearest point of the railway to enable the settlers to have an outlet when boats are infrequent. </para>
                            <para>In making a request to the Treasurer of the Commonwealth for an annual grant of some of the money collected by way of duty, this Government feels that the money would be allocated to this industry in the interests of the whole of the Commonwealth. I would point out that the production of the Carnarvon fruit has meant no diminution of the amount imported, as the lowering of the price of the commodity has resulted in a much greater consumption within the State of this important fruit. I would earnestly ask your Government to give consideration to granting annually a sum to enable growers to make adequate provision for water supplies in the river bed and on the banks of the river, and for financing units suitable for lifting the water to the level of the cultivated areas. This could be done on a grant of a specific sum or, say, 25 per cent, of the amount collected, to be distributed &#39; amongst the growers or by the payment of a bounty on production in a way similar to the assistance given to many other  primary industries. It might be that an arrangement could be made to distribute the money on the basis of a formula as has been the case with amounts distributed in the eastern States. </para>
                            <para>As the State government has advanced several thousands from the Treasury .on loan and in other directions to assist this industry in the western State, federal assistance would not only be a splendid gesture of confidence but a contribution to the lasting success in the establishment of a primary product which is at present imported to the extent of 30,000 centals per annum. </para>

                            <para>.- This budget may truly be called the preliminary. We are accustomed to supplement aries, but we have been informed by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> that we may, on this occasion, look for another substantial war budget in the near future, and that it will provide for further heavy increases of taxation in order to provide money for the defence of Australia. It would be futile, therefore, to  spend  much  time dealing with the tax proposals of this budget. Obviously, these measures are necessary, as will also be the supplementary taxation measures to be introduced later. I was very pleased that the Treasurer, when submitting his figures to us, did not attempt to mislead us or the people at large. He did not tell us that it would be possible to obtain from some well of gold, or the printing of notes, the money that was needed for defence purposes. He made it quite clear that, whatever the war cost, it would have to be paid for now or at some future time. Posterity, he said, could be expected to meet some of the cost, for governments were justified in spreading over a period of years the repayments of expense* incurred in providing public services, defence and otherwise. </para>

                        <para>The main and vital  factor dealt with in this budget is defence. The people of Australia are beginning to realize that the wheels of our defence machinery are moving too slowly. I have no doubt whatever as to the sincerity, capacity or energy of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Street).</inline> I believe that the Defence Department desires to do everything possible to ensure the safety of this country. But, the wheel* seem to be clogged. There is a public demand that defence activities should be speeded up. We must all realize, as the result of the recruiting effort last year, when 70,000 men volunteered, that our people have indicated their willingness to provide adequate man-power; Thousands more are prepared to join the colours and enter upon a course of training. But the Government did not take any action to encourage their enthusiasm ; they were told that their services were not required. That was an unfortunate mistake, seeing that we then anticipated what has since transpired. One of the first obligations of any government is the defence of its territory and people. No stone should be left unturned to that end, and in this crisis what has to be done should be done quickly for no one can foresee how soon we shall need these men. It has been said frequently in this House that to send untrained men to meet trained soldiers is to commit murder. </para>
                        <para class="block">Yet how many men have we got in camp ? Lieutenant-General Squires, the expert who was brought here to advise us, said that a standing army should be established as soon as possible. It has not been done. </para>

                                <para>- I am pleased to have that hint from the Minister. When men volunteered, and many even offered to provide their own horses and go into training, the Defence Department replied that it had not sufficient men to train them. But throughout Australia large numbers of returned soldiers were, and still are, prepared to go into camp, and take a. refresher course to modernize their present knowledge, and then tak, on the job of training men in country districts. Their offers were refused. These are the things we regret. Some of the enthusiasm that existed at the time of the recruiting campaign has died, and! if. will need to be revived. Even now, if the Government would only announce that it is prepared to take all healthy volunteers and arrange for their training and supply the uniform and equipment, there would be a speedy response from the men of Australia. </para>

                        <para>About twelve months ago I referred to offers made by men in country districts to form mechanized units. These men are used to tractors and used to horses, and could be trained for this work much more rapidly, and probably would show greater efficiency, than .many of the youths from in and around the cities and suburbs. Yet, because . of the cost of supplying the necessary military equipment, their offers too were refused, notwithstanding that returned soldiers of high standing had offered to accept the responsibility of supervising their training and caring for the plant provided. The Government should not miss any chance to obtain the services of such men. I have here the plan of a fine pavilion which a pastoral and agricultural society is prepared to erect in a country town where 90 young men offered to join the Militia, but were refused because more than the required number had then enrolled. The committee controlling the local showground is prepared to extend its pavilion to 127 feet by 100 feet, to provide kitchen and special rooms in which military equipment could be locked, and also to allow the Defence Department the use of fourteen acres of land adjacent to the rifle range, for all except about two days each year when it will require the property for the annua&#93; show - provided that the department will take a lease of the property for ten years at &#163;120 per annum. The department replied that premises at present rented in that town are sufficient for the requirements of the existing troop of 35, and this is the town in which the offer of 90 volunteers was refused. I regard that as sheer lack of vision and business capacity by the Defence Department. </para>

                        <para>I have not yet seen any suggestion that action is being taken to organize protection against fire caused by air raids in country districts. In 1926 a fire which was started by a spark from a train. burned property worth &#163;500,000 in one day in the western district of New South Wales. Two lives were lost and two other persons were so severely burned that they had to remain in hospital for months. Were an enemy aeroplane to come from a ship in the Pacific Ocean in December and drop phosphorus in the wheat areas, as members of the Industrial Workers of the World are reported to have done some years ago, the countryside could be swept by fire. It would be worth while for the Defence Department to take precautionary measures for the control of fires caused in this way. </para>

The sympathy &#39; of the Government with rural industries has not been made particularly evident. It is not long since the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> speaking in one of the capital cities, said that the farmers of Australia would find a friend in the Government. He said that he believed that the man on the land should not have a lower standard of living than the man who worked in the factory, and that, his Government intended to put the wheat industry on a stable basis. He promised a stabilized price for wheat so that the wheat-growers would not have to come each year and seek Government assistance. </para>

                                <para>- I shall show in what way he did so. The offer of the Prime Minister was that the Commonwealth Government would provide up to &#163;2,000,000 per annum on condition that the States provided a further &#163;1,500,000 each year so that up to &#163;3, 500,000 would be available to assist the industry. That was equivalent to approximately6d.a bushel on 140,000,000 bushels, or about 5d. a bushel on the anticipated crop for the coming season. There was however, a string attached to the offer for the right honorable gentleman said that when the price of wheat exceeded a certain amount - I think it was 3s. 6d. a bushel - half of the surplus was to be retained by the Government as a set off against the contributions  made. I am iu favour of an equalization scheme based on a period of ten years, but when we study the figures for the last ten years, we realize what the offer of the Prime Minister really amounts  to.  The last nine years have  been  the worst in the history of the wheat industry in Australia, for the average price at Williamstown for export wheat has been 3s. 3d. a bushel. Had the Flour Tax Act been in operation for that period, the average return for those nine years would have been 3s. 7d. a bushel at ports. That price would have given an average of 3s. a bushel to the farmers. The aggregate cheque would have been &#163;247,000,000, while the proposal of  the  Prime Minister, if spread over a similar period on the basis of similar yields and prices, and with the flour tax  in  operation, would have given to the farmers &#163;237,000,000, namely &#163;10,000,000  less. </para>

The figures of yields and prices which I have cited have been taken from the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Year Book.</inline> Although most farmers and I personally desire a stabilization scheme, there is an obligation on the Government to accept some of the risk. The proposal of the Prime Minister meant that the Commonwealth would accept no risk, but would throw it all on the farmers. However, the position which existed at the time of the conference does not exist to-day. With, the declaration of war; the Government has determined, wisely, I think, that it- will - be necessary for the whole of the Australian wheat crop to be taken over and marketed through a compulsory wheat pool.  </para>

                                <para>- The second indication  of  the Government&#39;s sympathy with  rural  industries being casual is shown in connexion with the sales tax on flour. In June last, I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Commerce what amount per bushel of wheat the sales  tax  on flour represented, and what the  total  would be when added to the market price of wheat. The answers supplied  were  2s. Id. and 4s. 7fd. at port. Honorable members know that representatives of all the States and of the Commonwealth agreed that the home-consumption price for wheat should be 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r. at Williamstown, Victoria. Every State agreed that the flour tax should represent the difference be&#39;twee&#39;n  the  market price of wheat and 5s. 2d.  f.o.r.  Williamstown. But during the whole  of  the period in which the tax has been  in  operation that tax has been very  much  short of what it should have been  and  could have been without raising the price agreed upon for city and suburban bread, viz., 6d. a loaf delivered  and  5&#163;d. over the counter. The answer  supplied  by the Department of Commerce through the honorable member for  Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Frederick Stewart)</inline> was that  the tax and the market price of wheat on the same day represented 4s.  7fd. on  rails Williamstown instead of 5s. 2d. - a discrepancy of 6id. a bushel.  The&#34;  result is that the fund for providing the bounty has received about &#163;1 a  ton  - &#163;650,000 for the year - less than  the  farmers were promised when the flour tax was imposed. While the validity of  the  flour tax was under challenge in the High Court this matter was not raised because no one knew the position, but,  now that  the High Court has upheld the tax,  the  Government, if it has real sympathy  with  the wheat-growers, should speedily remove all defects. </para>

                        <para>Let me now deal with the tariff  of  4$d. a gallon on diesel oil as imposed by  this  budget. If there be one obligation  on  the government of an exporting country it is not to place needless burdens  on  those  who grow the products the sale of which provides overseas credits and maintains our solvency. Where diesel oil is used on tractors on farms the fuel should be exempt from excise. I do not claim exemption for the huge diesel trucks which use our roads - not even for the vehicles which carry the wool and wheat to the railways. The users of petrol-driven vehicles have to pay substantially for the construction and maintenance of highways and I see no reason why the users of diesel vehicles who use the roads should not also contribute. But I point out that in New Zealand even petrol used in the process of primary production is exempt from tax. It would be too difficult for the Government to exempt the petrol used on farms, because there would be no means of deciding whether or not the fuel was being used in farm machinery or the farmer&#39;s motor car. That difficulty, however, does not arise where diesel tractors are concerned because the fuel is only used in their tractors. There is no tariff on power kerosene and diesel fuel for tractors should also be free of the impost. </para>
                        <para>My next point concerns the vaccine, produced by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, which is used by farmers and graziers for the protection of stock, from enter toxaemia and other diseases. Until recently pasture protection boards were treated as wholesale distributors of this vaccine, but when some of them were prepared for cash to supply stockowners at wholesale rates, involving a rebate of 221/2 per cent., those boards, as the result of a protest from other distributors who were losing business, commission and profits, were threatened with a discontinuance of supplies unless they discontinued the practice. I ask the Government to take action to show real sympathy and ensure that the Pasture Protection Boards are! unhindered in this effort to assist in the reduction of costs of production. Surely the Government should be interested in any attempt to reduce production costs in industries which are definitely selling at a loss. </para>
                        <para>I now approach &#38; matter to which L have made reference before, but persistency often gets results. The Commonwealth Government owns 51 per cent. of the shares in the Commonwealth Oil </para>
                        <para class="block">Refineries, and surely a majority shareholder can dictate policy. A. primary producers&#39; co-operative buying organization had an arrangement with a company which imported petrol and power kerosene by which they were treated as wholesale distributors. For cash this company took full truck lots of power kerosene for its members at a saving of &#163;25 a truckload. What happened then? The major oil companies told the company that was providing these supplies through its Sydney organization that unless it discontinued it would be subjected to competition with cut prices on petrol. The result can well be imagined by honorable members. </para>

                                <para>- Within the last four months. I have correspondence from the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Perkins)</inline> saying that the matter had been investigated. I have also interviewed the Comptroller-General of Customs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Abbott,</inline> who is one of the directors of the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited. All we ask is that this organization which is paying cash should be supplied at wholesale rates so that the farmers can get their power kerosene at the lowest price possible provided the company is prepared to pay cash on delivery. There seems, however, to be more interest in securing the commission for distributors than in enabling the primary producers to reduce their costs. Here is an opportunity for the Government to do a real service at no financial cost to itself. </para>

                        <para>For two years we have been awaiting the institution of the proposed long-term mortgage section of the Commonwealth Bank. I urge again that the Government do all that is possible to expedite the inauguration so that it may commence to function. I realize that with scarcity of finance and as the result of the Government&#39;s difficulties in the present situation, it will not be possible for a mortgage bank to be 100 per cent. efficient for the time being, but let us get it established. Once the mortgage bank starts operations it will be some competition with the private banks. If it can lend on the security of land for long terms at reasonable rates it will give the graziers and farmers security  and they will know that they will not be called upon at short notice to meet overdrafts or mortgages. Furthermore, the lower rates of interest that would be charged by such a bank should have an influence on the rates charged by the other institutions. </para>

Let me give one instance : There has been a wise effort among primary producers to conserve ensilage. I know of one case where the luxuriant pasture was gathered and placed in pits for storage. For every truckload a gallon of petrol was used. Twelve truckloads were carted a day with the result that the farmer had to pay 7s.6d. a day in petrol duty. </para>

                                <para>- It has failed. The land tax is a tax upon capital, one class of capital. It is not a tax upon the factory machinery, which is the factory man&#39;s capital, but it is a tax on the land in the country, which is the primary producers&#39; capital. Moreover, the land tax applies regardless of whether or not there is a mortgage on property. It does not. matter whether the property is mortgaged up to 90 per cent. of its value, which is probably far in excess of the unimproved capital value. If the value of the property is more than &#163;5,000, it is taxed, and, in some instances, the tax represents over 2d. per lb., nearly 25 per cent. of the value of the wool produced. The Government would be unwise if it added to the land tax, because in the country the tax is added to the cost of production and in the city it is passed on in overhead charges in the costs of manufacture. </para>

                        <para>The matter with which I finally wish to deal concerns the sale of Australian products in mass as the result of the war. The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> has already reminded honorable members that during the last war Australian wheat was sold at 4s. 9d. on rail and 5s. 2d. including all expenses on ships to the British Government which was then paying 9s. 3d. a bushel in other countries. The Australian producers do not ask for more than a fair deal, but they do submit that one section of the community should not be called upon to provide charity even to Great Britain. If Australia as a whole wants to send a present of &#163;1,000,000 worth of goods to Britain as the result of a vote by this Parliament that is all right because all will share. But if a particular product is commandeered in that way, and disposed of to Great Britain at half of the price Great Britain would have to pay other countries for that commodity, the producers of that particular commodity, and they alone, are asked to subsidize Great Britain. The authorities appointed to handle the disposal of these products should do their utmost to secure for the producers a fair and reasonable deal. It should be provided that the price of the commodity be reviewed from time to time according to fluctuations in world prices or alternatively provision should be made for an annual review of the prices. Such conditions could be embodied in all of these agreements, even though they may be for the whole of the period of the war and six months after. Another condition which could be provided, similar to that which operated in connexion with wool in 1914, would be that half of the profit made in the disposal of products left on hand after the war should be rebated to the producers. I suggest, furthermore, that should Great Britain sell to Japan or any other country any wool taken under the proposed arrangement during the period of the war, half of the profit on such sales should be rebated to the producers. </para>
                        <para>I support the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> in urging that special care should be exercised in determining commissions and handling charges. However, the figures submitted by the honorable member were not quite fair. He said that in the last war a certain firm had been paid &#163;74,000 commission, and another &#163;147,000. That statement was misleading, because those amounts represent, not merely commissions, but also all the costs incurred by agents, such as wages for lumpers, coverage, protection against weather and mice, insurance charges and also stacking and handling costs. I have had some, experience in the handling of wheat in South Australia. At that time the handling or agency charge was Id. a bushel with free storage for twelve months. To-day, at the silos in New South &#34;Wales, in addition to railage, there is a handling charge of lid. a bushel, and as from the 1st April the storage charge has been &#163;d. a month. On wheat in storage for six months, these charges would amount to 4&#163;d. a bushel, which is a heavy impost with the price of wheat at ls. 6d. a bushel. Another point in the marketing of these commodities arises in. respect of the fluctuation of the value of currencies. At the present rate of exchange, &#163;100 Australian is equivalent to only &#163;80 in London, whilst &#163;100 in London is equivalent to &#163;125 here. Should this war last as long as the last one, a grave danger exists that the returns to the producers of these commodities will decrease as our rate of currency fluctuates adversely in relation to sterling. These are matters in which steps should be taken to protect our producers as far as possible in all the arrangements made for the disposal of our products. </para>
                        <para>In conclusion, I desire to express my satisfaction that it is the intention of this Government to give effect to the decision of its predecessor to remove the surcharge on interstate telegrams as soon as possible. </para>

                            <para>.- Before addressing myself generally to the budget, I propose to offer a few comments on the attitude adopted in this discussion by honorable members of the alleged Country party, which in my view could be better likened to a gang of mercenaries who are prepared to sell their support to the highest bidder. Since he has been a member of this Parliament, the honorable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nock)</inline> to my knowledge has not previously made a speech which could be described as critical of the Government. It is only since the Government has ousted the Country party from the Ministry, and the honorable member himself has lost his fee as one of the Government Whips, that he has become a stern critic of the Government. What is it that the honorable member asks for on behalf pf the particular interests whose case he has just presented?  His  new leader, the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron),</inline> spoke this afternoon about the unreality of discussions in this Parliament. He said that, judging by debates here, one would be led to believe that this country was not engaged in a war. I point out, however, that the honorable gentleman has been absent from debates in this chamber continuously for the last 48 hours. He was elsewhere with his colleagues wrangling over the leadership of the Country party, and disputing as to who of their number should be asked to accept office in the proposed coalition government. To-night the honorable member for Riverina, on the pretext of assisting the wheat-growers, asks the Government to do certain things. No doubt  in his own mind, the honorable member&#39;s requests seem very moderate. He asks that no tax be levied on diesel oil used by the primary producers. He wants power kerosene supplied to them at wholesale prices. Then he asks that land tax be abolished. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member also asks that handling costs in the marketing of primary products be considerably reduced. I point out that the very interests on whose behalf he has spoken to-night were responsible for the abolition of awards enjoyed by workers employed in the rural industries of New South Wales. Now he asks the Government to do all of these things for this section of the community. Perhaps he thinks he is not asking for very much. He asks for a guaranteed price for wheat, and at the same time suggests that the flour tax should be increased in order to raise the revenue necessary to enable the Government to provide that price. Furthermore, he suggests that the Government should establish a mortgage bank. This champion of private enterprise, who on all previous occasions has opposed any suggestion that the Government should embark on anything savouring of government interference with, private enterprise; now, when the private banks desire to unload some doubtful mortgages, declares that the Commonwealth Bank must lie asked to come to the assistance of the growers. He asks that a mort gage bank be established, but does not. suggest that it should be given a monopoly of mortgage business.  His  proposal is that this bank should take over only the bad mortgages, that it should carry the more risky and doubtful mortgages, and, in addition, that it -should do so at reduced rates of interest. If the honorable gentleman is sincere in his desire to assist the wheat-growers, he must realize the necessity for some improvement of the present financial system. With the exception that he has suggested the establishment of a mortgage bank, he has made no proposal in that direction. No scheme of assistance to wheat-growers will be of any use unless some action be taken to relieve them of their burden of debt. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> admitted that (here was a growing opinion in this country in favour of a change in the monetary system. The great majority of our people are resolved to defend this country against aggression, but, at the same time, many will be greatly disappointed when they learn that this Government proposes to finance this war in the same way as the last war was financed. Every honorable member knows that Australia has been in difficulties ever since the last war principally because of the burdens which were placed on the people under that system. Consequently, in recent years there has been a growing demand for financial reform in this country. Whilst admitting that fact, however, the Prime Minister attempted to dismiss the subject by ridiculing any suggestion that any other system would give better service to the people. He said - </para>

                            <para>I have been increasingly conscious of late of the growth of a tendency in the minds of many people which may be put in this way - &#39; there is a hidden spring of wealth somewhere. It is called the credit of the community. All you have to do is to tap it. </para>

                        <para>Honorable members who have spoken in this debate in support of the Government have admitted that the Commonwealth Bank can come to the assistance of the Government to-day by- releasing credit. Some of them have said that there is a limit to that accommodation. I agree with them on that point. But in my opinion the limit is not reached until our complete resources of man-power, materials and equipment are being fully utilized. But let us see what the Minister for Supply and Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> had to say on this matter a little while ago when he was Treasurer. . It is remarkable that whilst honorable members opposite now declare that there is no limit to the amount of money available for defence in the present war, they have always contended that sufficient money could not bp found to give effect to proposals made by the Opposition for the extension of social services. The Minister for Supply and Development is reported under the heading &#34; Money Will be Found in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of the 87th October, 1938, as follows: - </para>

Let me state too, just as definitely and unequivocally that the Commonwealth Bank Board does riot stand in the way of raising money for defence and would be swept out of the way if it attempted to do so. When I have been asked how much money is available for defence, I have consistently said that it is not the proper approach to the position. The proper statement of the case is: what is it necessary to do to ensure the security of Australia? And I have always replied that whatever money is necessary for . this purpose, will be found promptly and without question. I repeat as I have stated publicly before, that since I have been Federal Treasurer the Defence Department has in effect written its own ticket in matters of finance. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para>In view of the contention of honorable members opposite that the accommodation which can be made available to the Government through the Commonwealth Bank is strictly limited, how was the ex-Treasurer able to give an undertaking last year to the people of this country that if the Commonwealth Bank Board were to stand in the way of raising money for defence, the Government would sweep the board out of existence, and compel it to make available all of the money which the Government required for that purpose? Let us see exactly how the last war was financed under the system which honorable members opposite have championed in this debate. Let us examine the so-called orthodox method of finance. The Treasury - loaned cash to the private banks at certain rates of interest. The banks lent that money to customers at increased rates of interest and the customers lent it back to the Treasury for war purposes at still higher rates of interest. That is exactly how the last war was financed, and it will be the method by which this war will be financed. Because of the control which the Commonwealth Bank Board exercises over financial policy in Australia the development of this country has -been retarded. During the last five years the State governments have been refused financial accommodation to the extent of &#163;23,000,000 which they wanted for necessary State works&#39;. They were told that there was no money available. In my opinion, there should be only one limit to the capacity of governments to carry out defence or developmental works. The only limiting factors should be man power, materials, and equipment. How can it be said that the Government is adequately providing for the defence of the country when, in New South Wales alone, there are 70,000 unemployed men who are, through no fault of their own, taking no part at all in the national effort? Honorable members opposite say that because of the burden of our defence programme all other activities must be stopped. I believe, however, that so long as the carrying out of our defence programme does not entail the transfer of labour now engaged elsewhere, but only the absorption of unemployed men and materials, it&#39; will not impose any additional burden on the community, provided the operations are financed in a proper way. How should we approach this question? The best way is to remember that financial arrangements have no other purpose than to facilitate the employment of men, equipment, and materials upon useful enterprises. The day has gone by when a government &#39;was justified in saying that though a certain public work was desirable it could not be carried out because there was no money. All we should ask ourselves is whether there is sufficient man-power available, and whether we have the material and equipment to do the job. Provided those things are available, the Commonwealth Bank should provide the necessary financial accommodation, whether the work be for defence or development. On the subject of finance, the Prime Minister made this statement -  </para>

                            <para>Consequently, what any central bank has to do in any country is to adjust its credit policy to what it believes to be the economic circumstances of the moment, always keeping in mind the position of the trading banks, the position of the credit facilities in the community, the degree to which there may be unemployment over what might be described as an irreducible minimum, and the extent to which prices are moving up or down. </para>

                        <para class="block">It is rather significant that he should have placed the needs of the trading  banks first. The Prime Minister is a word-spinner, and I should like to know just what he meant by the expression &#34; irreducible minimum &#34;. I should say that the irreducible minimum is when every man physically able to work is fully employed. Only those persons should be unemployed who, because of infirmity or for some other reason, are unable to work. We have not reached that stage yet. I would also point out to the Prime Minister that the Commonwealth Bank was not in the first place intended to be a central bank. Because the private banks had been levying toll on the community, and it was necessary to provide some protection for the people, a Labour government instituted the Commonwealth Bank, which was to be a people&#39;s bank designed eventually to supplant them in every phase of banking operations. But this Government, or to be correct, previous governments of a similar political colour, stepped in and, by an amendment of the Commonwealth Bank Act, turned the Common wealth Bank into a central bank, whose function was to prop up the private banks. The Prime Minister went on - </para>

                            <para>The position of course is that exactly the same kind of limitation exists upon the power of the Commonwealth Bank to inject credit into the financial structure as exists in relation to its power to print notes and make them legal tender. When the point of prudence is passed, then prices and costs are increased, and the value of money in circulation is diminished. </para>

                        <para class="block">As a matter of fact, credit infusions cause prices to rise only when they are continued beyond the point when every able-bodied man is fully employed. Then if there are further injections of credit, prices rise because of increased competition for the available manpower and resources; but if credit injections are used only to bring about the employment of idle man-power and the use of idle resources, they do not have the effect of increasing prices.

                            <para>Australia is spending &#163;30,000,000 per annum on all phases of defence out of a national income of not less than &#163;750,000,000, that is 4 per cent. Can the country do this and at the same time proceed with a major measure of social reform like national insurance! To throw some light on this matter, it is necessary to get behind the veil of money which seems to obscure our vision so often on economic problems. There is a world of difference between the problem of defence and the problem of national insurance. In defence we have to embark upon a big enterprise involving the use of labour and resources to build factories, make am munitions, build ships, and so on. It is a matter of diverting men and resources from the normal developmental activities to the more pressing needs of national defence. With national insurance, the problem is one of organizing on a different basis our medical and health services and our provision for old age. As national insurance will not draw upon the labour and resources required for defence, it can hardly be argued on this ground that we cannot afford both. </para>

                                <para>- I voted against the scheme proposed by the Government because it was placing the burden of old-age and invalid pensions on the workers instead of on the community as a whole. I said that the Labour party believed in social legislation to ensure that those who are unable to provide for themselves should be provided for out of general revenue, so that through the taxes, the wealthy sections of the community would contribute towards the cost. The statement I have just quoted was not made by a member of the Labour party, but by Professor Copland, who has been appointed Economic Advisor to the Government. I ask the Government whether it proposes to be guided in regard to social services by what Professor Copland stated in that article? Does the Government propose to accept his assurance that there is no reason why it cannot go on with its defence programme and its social service programme at one and the same time? In his budget speech, the Prime Minister said that the history of war was a history of credit expansion, whilst post-war history had always been a record of economic crisis and suffering. I admit that that has been our experience in the past, but how hopeless is the future of our people if we have nothing to look forward to but a repetition of that, experience in the future. The honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> has assured us that this war is going to cost even more than did the last one. If tha Government intends to finance this war in the same way as it did the last, one, we can imagine what will happen when it finishes. We know what the , workers have suffered as the result of conditions brought about by the last war. It appears that the workers must always lose whether their country wins &#171; war or loses it. If we win, those who are fortunate enough to be alive at the end of the war, will be compelled to live in poverty and degradation in order that the country may go on paying toll to the super-patriots who lent their money during the war at high rates of interest. On the other hand, if we lose the war, the people may lose a measure of civil liberty, but beyond that what have they to lose? The honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> said the other night that we must prepare&#39; for a. long war; that we should not be misled by suggestions that the German people would revolt a gains! Hitler; that, they all were  behind Hitler, because he had given them work. I disagree with the honorable member. I believe that the German people will revolt against Hitler if an opportunity presents itself, because he has destroyed their civil liberties, but the honorable member effectively destroyed his own argument that the unemployed workers should rush to defend our free institutions against, the attack of the enemy, when one &#39; of the liberties that they are asked to defend is the freedom to slowly starve to death on an insufficient food ration. In New South Wales there are at present 70,000 persons unemployed, 48,000 of whom have, been certified as able-bodied. What has been done by this Government and other governments of the same political complexion to assist these unfortunate men? All they have done has been to offer a mere pittance in the form of food relief or the. dole. </para>

                                <para>- I can speak more  definitely concerning New South Wales, but I know that similar conditions prevail  through  out the Commonwealth. Moreover, in the metropolitan area of Sydney during the financial year 193S-39 no fewer than 3,470 eviction orders were issued. Notwithstanding this state of affairs, honorable members opposite say that in view of the international situation we must put everything aside in order to ensure the safety of the Empire. The honorable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nock)</inline> complained because the Commonwealth Government had declined an offer by an agricultural society in ;i country town, to lease its property to the Commonwealth Government for a period of years at a. rental of &#163;125 per annum as a training centre. ! should like to know whether that society ever offered the pavilion on the property which it, does not use for 363 days a year free of cost to house the unemployed. Had any attempt been made by the unfortunate homeless  to use it as a shelter, they would have been prosecuted for trespassing. T&#60;&#62; show the deplorable conditions  which  exist in the Commonwealth, I may stale that of 1,550 houses which were &#187; inspected tit Erskineville, S82 were without a bath. These disabilities, according <inline font-style="italic">u&#62;</inline> smile honorable members opposite,  cannot  be removed because sufficient funds are not available, but. thy workers who are expected to submit to. such conditions are the first, who will be called upon to risk their lives in the. defence of their country. A conference of health inspectors in New South Wales declared that the houses available at rents allowed by arbitration and industrial courts are, for the most part, unfit for human habitation. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of the 22nd March, 1937, stated that the over-crowding and slum conditions in that year were worse than they were in 1913, and that in many instances two or more persons were occupying single rooms in which all the cooking was done on a gas ring. In 1919 the problem of providing adequate housing for the people was considered, and a royal commission appointed by the Commonwealth Government recommended the Government of the day to proceed at once with a housing scheme.  Some  years later the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page),</inline> who was then the Commonwealth Treasurer, undertook to provide &#163;20,000,000 to give effect to the finding of the royal commission; but the Government did not make the money available. I do not suggest, however, that this Government has not done anything with respect to housing. I direct the attention of honorable members to the lavish manner in which public money has been expended to provide accommodation for the Duke and Duchess of Kent who, until recently, proposed to reside in the Australian Capital Territory. Since the Commonwealth acquired the homestead at Yarralumla som&#39;e years ago and decided to convert it into a residence for the Governor-General, approximately &#163;100,000 has been expended on the house and grounds. When honorable members on this side of  the chamber have informed the Government of the slum conditions which exist at the Causeway and Molonglo, and have asked that reasonable accommodation be provided for those who are compelled to live there, they have been informed that no funds are available. I have been advised that &#163;3,233 has been expended on panelling with polished Queensland maple, the entrance hall and three rooms at Yarralumla. When the expensive panelling had been placed in position the Duchess of Kent advised the Government that she preferred the rooms to be white. The Government then directed that all the expensive polished Queensland maple should be enamelled white, thus incurring additional and unnecessary expense. I&#39; am not blaming these people because they are not responsible. I blame the Government, the members of which are probably looking for favours from the Royal couple before whose feet they will fall. We have also read in the newspapers that &#163;50 a pair is being paid for sheets for the Royal household. This extravagance is not confined to the Duke and Duchess, because unnecessary expenditure is being incurred on residences to be occupied by numerous under st rappers, including  deputy  secretaries,  deputy deputy  secretaries and other supernumeraries too numerous to mention. In this&#39; orgy of spending, one of these offsides to the present Governor-General took advantage of the opportunity to refurnish the premises which he occupies and purchased curtains at fifteen guineas a pair. This expenditure was incurred, not on the residence of the Governor-General designate, but in the cottage occupied by one who was to be a member of his staff. Also an expert home furn is her has been brought from Melbourne from time to time to advise how the Governor-&#39;General&#39;s residence should be furnished. One of the recommendations for which the Government had to pay a high price was that flower boxes should surround the building and should be planted with yellow flowers so that the reflection from them in the light of the setting sun would tone in with the yellow curtains. A new telephone system of eight exchange lines and 43 extensions with ivory-coloured receivers has been installed. All this is being done while the Government says most definitely that there is no money available to provide homes for hundreds of workers in the Australian Capital Territory. I have never visited Yarralumla, but I should imagine that the accommodation available there before the alterations were commenced should have been suitable for any one occupying the position of Governor-General. While the Government is wasting money in this direction, it is interesting to note what is happening .in regard to schools and hospitals.

It has already fallen once.  The crumbling wall is typical of the dilapidated conditions of the school. The only equipment possessed by one of the teachers is a wobbly, wire-bound chair. This was lent to the school by a nearby resident of Happy Valley. She has no table and no press for her belongings and papers.  Her  portable weatherboard class-room has not been painted and several windows are broken. In wet weather, deep puddles form in a moat-like ditch around this room. In wet weather, pupils and teachers alike lunch together in the class-rooms. Borers infest the wood-work of the main two rooms. Last year an inspector thought one part looked particularly rotten.

Tuberculosis kills more people between  the  ages of 15 and 45 years than any other complaint.

Positions available for adult workers in that case will become fewer each year. The inquiries of the Employment Council in the last eighteen months showed that many hundreds of youths were discharged from employment on reaching 21 ... . The Government was aware that in many manufacturing firms boys were employed until they had reached the age of 20 or 21 years, when their services were dispensed with, and they were replaced by younger lads. This was also true of retail and mercantile firms. </para>

                        <para>That is the position with respect to youth employment in this country to-day. There is no need for any further inquiry. If the Government wants to act, it has sufficient data available to it; but the fact is, that it is merely pretending that it is going to deal with these problems. The honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> in particular, and other Government members, have said that the Government would like to do all of these things, but that there is no money available to enable them to be done. As I stated earlier, it is my opinion that the Government, by utilizing the powers of the Commonwealth Bank, could make the necessary money available. I am not alone in holding that opinion. The Commonwealth Bank Board itself has made certain recommendations to the Government in the matter of the expansion of credit. Its views are to be found in the following paragraph, which was published on the 7th July, 1939:- </para>

When there is not general unemployment loans by the central bank can be no help for defence or any other purpose. They cannot cause any new production. They can only compete with existing money for the resources which are already being used ...... We shall have more defence works but so much less consumption goods or ordinary capital goods Our standard of living will be lowered just as if the money were being raised by taxation. But if it were raised by taxation it is probable that the loss would be borne by those best able to afford it ..... . The business of the central bank is to regulate the supply of money, to increase it when it is short and reduce it when it is excessive and when it is tending to cause over-competition for the resources available in men and equipment. Increasing the supply can be done by making direct loans to the Government. </para>

                <para class="block">That was the position that faced <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nash.</inline></para>
                <para>The Commonwealth Government some little time ago floated, in London, a loan of &#163;6,000,000. The rate of interest was 4 per cent., and the price of issue &#163;98 10s. The Prime Minister, in apologizing for the adverse terms, said that the Government had gone on the market at a difficult period, and that, in the circumstances, the terms received were very favorable. The cash and conversion loan floated during the year amounted in all to . &#163;71,600,000, representing &#163;67,600,000 for conversion and &#163;4,000,000 cash. In this instance, &#163;5,650,000 was subscribed, by the Commonwealth Bank, exclusive of the amount which the bank already held in the existing loan and which it converted. Therefore, it was due entirely to the intervention of the Commonwealth Bank that this loan could be said by the Government to have been successfully floated. If the bank can at all times come to the assistance of the country when loans are under subscribed, it can do the same when the Government needs finance for the purpose of carrying out defence and developmental works. The reason why this Government does not wish to use the hank for the. benefit of the people is that it desires to protect the interests of the private banks. </para>
                <para>The loan expenditure in 1938-39 amounted to &#163;4,000,000, and for 1939-40 it is estimated at &#163;23,000,000. This is only a preliminary estimate, and we do not know what the expenditure may be before the year has passed. The Prime Minister has attempted to make the people believe that the financial position is not so serious as it might appear to be. He said that we must take into account the favorable position of the sinking fund. In 1938-39, the sinking fund payments amounted to &#163;11,000,000, and it is estimated that in 1939-40 they will total &#163;11,672,000. But the net result of all of these financial operations of the Government, in which it claims to have been successful, is that the national debt has been increased by &#163;20,000,000 making the total to-day nearly &#163;1,300,000,000. Should the war last for the period anticipated by the&#39; Government, it is hard to visualize what burden of debt this country may have to carry. I warn the Labour party that, when the war is over, there is one thing that the present Government, if it is still in office, will insist upon. It will say, &#34; We must honour our obligations &#34;. The most important obligation, in the view of the Government, will be the meeting of interest payments in respect of debt commitments. When these burdens became too great some years ago, the Premiers plan was adopted and under it the people were asked to manage with loss wages, food, and clothing and poorer living conditions, so that budgets might be balanced and the interest bill paid. The same argument was applied to invalid and old-age pensions and repatriation benefits. I predict that, after this war, unless a vital alteration of the economic structure occurs, we shall still see workers in Britain, Germany and Australia, who have lost arms and legs, out of employment and unable to get pensions from the Government, because they will be told that their countries cannot afford to pay them. Yet the Prime Minister declared that the result of the Government&#39;s financial operations could be described as a great triumph! If members of the Ministry, and particularly members of the Country party, consider that my criticism of the private banks is not based on facts and logic, I suggest that they look up the speeches of the ex-leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir</inline></para>

It is said that we are all in this war, but I pointed out in an earlier speech that we are not all in it for the same reasons. Some honorable gentlemen opposite, although they talk about the need for defending the free institutions and liberties of the people, would take away those liberties at the first opportunity. They want to see Hitler defeated because Germany has again become a power in the commercial world and a rival of British imperialism. But the Labour party desires to see Hitler defeated because of what he has done to take away the liberties of the German people, and because of what he would do to destroy the civil rights of the people of other countries. If this Parliament desires the war to be carried to a successful conclusion, and to do the right thing by the people, it must alter the present financial proposals, and provide, not for &#34;sane, orthodox finance&#34;, but for the defence requirements of the nation to be met without increasing the present debt burden. </para>

                        <para>.- We have listened to a very informative discourse from the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> on national finance. The exhaustive manner in which he has dealt with the subject has left very little for me to say on certain points with which I had intended to deal. Any attempt by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> or any other person of prominence in Australia to substantiate the view that orthodox financial methods must be maintained is bound to fail. We cannot get away from the fact that the present system of finance has outlived its usefulness. It must be replaced by a more humane system which is capable of meeting existing conditions. In this connexion I direct attention to the following pertinent remarks made on this subject very many years ago by Abraham Lincoln, when he was  President  of the United States of America: - </para>

                        <para>Money is the creature of law, and the creation of the original issue of money should be maintained as an exclusive monopoly of national government. Government, possessing the power to create and issue currency and credit as money and enjoying the right to withdraw both currency and credit from circulation by taxation and otherwise, need not, and should not, borrow capital at interest as the means of financing governmental work and public enterprise. The government should create, issue, and circulate all the currency and credit needed to satisfy the spending power of the government and the buying power of consumers. The privilege of creating and issuing money is not only the supreme prerogative of government, but it is the government&#39;s greatest creative opportunity. By the adoption of these principles, the long-felt want for a uniform medium will be satisfied. The taxpayers will be saved immense sums in interest, discounts and exchanges. The financing oi all public enterprise, the maintenance of stable government and ordered progress, and the conduct of the treasury will become matters  of  practical administration. The people can, and will, be furnished with a currency as safe as their own government. Money will cease to master and become the servant of humanity. Democracy will rise superior to the money power. </para>

                    <para>There was a time, not so very long ago, when it was almost heresy for any person to make a pronouncement of that sort, but there is agr eat movement,, not only in Australia but also throughout the civilized world, to bring the people to realize that the system of finance which we now call orthodox has, in fact, resulted from the usurping of powers that should belong to the GroWn. The system must be changed if the people are truly to inherit the earth and enjoy the fruits thereof. I do not. intend, at this stage of the debate, to make an exhaustive examination of this vital subject, although it is of supreme significance. The Prime Minister has told us. and through us the people of Australia, in effect, that our present system of finance, must not be adjusted to meet the exigencies of this situation but rather that the people must be bent to meet the exigencies of what are known as orthodox methods of finance. I do not. object to people making profits in certain directions, nor do I object to their prosperity, but the profits must not all go to one class and the prosperity must not be one-sided. We have lived under a (me-sided economy for too long, and conditions must be altered. 1 wish now to make some reference to the proposals of the Government respecting wheat. We are not yet clear as to the real nature of the policy that is to be put into operation. In fact, all we know at present is that an Australian Wheat Board has been appointed to control not only the wheat crop for the coming season, but also our existing stocks of wheat, and to provide for the marketing of it. When 1 read the report on this subject in the newspapers this morning, I was amazed beyond words at the personnel of the board selected by the Government to put, its plan into operation. T am appalled, also, that the Government should show so little respect for the real wheat-growers as to appoint to this board men who have, for many years, been associated with the interests that have exploited the wheat-growers. Obviously it is the intention of the Government to put this board in complete control.- No member of the Government, apparently, is to have any say in the matter whatsoever. The wheat control scheme that was in operation from 1915 until after the end of the last war, while not perfect by any means, had at least some elements of democracy in itv&#39;&#39; Bui; this one has none. The federal body at that time consisted of the State Ministers of Agriculture with the Prime Minister as  chairman,  and it was undoubtedly responsible to the various parliaments. The Prime Minister and also the Ministers of Agriculture were directly answerable to their respective parliaments, which consequently had some opportunity to express an opinion on the policy of the board. The personnel of the board which the Commonwealth has just appointed is such as to make it clear that the Government has &#39;actually handed over the control of our wheat industry to men who for many years past have exploited the farmers. These men will now be able to do what they like, and they will be answerable to no one but themselves. The  chairman  of the Board, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Olive</inline> McPherson, who is the nominee of the Commonwealth Government, was the  chairman  of the Closer Settlement Commission of </para>
                    <para class="block">Victoria, and we may therefore expect a repetition of the experiences of the Victorian people in connexion with that board. The Victorian Government, whenever it was faced with criticism concerning closer settlement, sheltered itself behind the  chairman  of the board and said that the Government, having given tha board full authority, could hot interfere. All complaints were met with that answer. I fear that that is likely to happen in connexion with the wheat industry, .but I sincerely hope that the members of this Parliament will insist that it will be avoided. The interest of the Government in this debate is remarkable: the only representative of the Government party in the chamber is the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> at the table. Not one member of the Country party is sufficiently interested in this matter of vital importance to the wheat-growers of Australia to be present while I am speaking. In addition to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McPherson,</inline> there is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> G. Darling, of John Darling and Son, a firm which has been dealing in wheat for many years, and has become wealthy largely because of its association with the wheat industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Darling</inline> is also associated with the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, and is a director of the National Bank of Australia. He is, or was until recently,  chairman  of the National Union - that estimable body which provides the sinews of war for the party which is in control of the Commonwealth to-day. There is also a representative of the firm of Louis Dreyfus and Company, a foreign company which has been trading in this country for many years-. Another member is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> 0. Tilt, a representative of the Victorian Wheat-growers Corporation, which has not, so far as T know, the support of the majority of the wheat-growers of that State. I speak subject to correction, but T believe that that body received only about 45.000 bushels into its voluntary pool last, year, and has recently merged into what amounts tn practically an ordinary wheat trading concern. Another  member is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> S. Teesdale, of Western Australia - an estimable person, hut to my personal knowledge he has not th&#60;&#34; confidence of the Wheat-growers Union of Western Australia, which is the industrial body that is representative of most of the wheat-growers of that State. We come next to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walker,</inline> of the Lindley Walker Wheat Company Limited, which has been in the wheat business for many years. I have no special knowledge of that firm, but I take it that its representative is not unlike the other gentlemen whom I have mentioned. Another member is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> Hamblin, of the New South Wales Farmers and Graziers Cooperative Company Limited. I know nothing of him, or the association to which he belongs. Other members are <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Field</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clarke.</inline> I know <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Field.</inline> Of all the men on the board, he is, in my opinion, the only one who might be regarded as representative of the growers&#39; organizations. The appointment of this board is the most appalling act of the Government in regard to the primary industries of this country. I do not complain of the ability of these men to handle and sell wheat, but when it comes to framing a policy and fixing prices, I say it is imperative that there shall be a greater representation of growers on the board. </para>

                    <para>In those days there was a fairly effective organization and a fairly efficient administration; but as the control was largely of an experimental nature in this country, mistakes were made. The experience then gained in the conduct of pools in the various States should enable us on this occasion to establish a much more efficient scheme. There is also the  question of freights. As honorable members know, freight was at a premium during the period of the last war. The enemy&#39;s submarine campaign had taken heavy toll of shipping. Australia being far removed from the markets of Europe, we were at a great disadvantage in the marketing of wheat and other primary products. The people on the American continent had a great advantage in that they were able to market their wheat and other products much more easily than we could. The distance was less and the convoy system, when it was eventually introduced, was fairly effective. It is gratifying to look back and remember that at that time we had a Prime Minister in the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> who, whatever his shortcomings, was not lacking in courage or initiative. When he saw the position regarding freights and the difficulty of securing ships, he seized the opportunity to establish our own fleet of merchant vessels, which eventually numbered 54&#39;. If it had not been for his action, this country would have suffered very greatly. Huge stocks would have accumulated and gone to waste because of the difficulty of storing. The unfortunate part is that a subsequent government foolishly disposed of these ships - almost gave them away - at bargain prices. If we had them today, they would be an immense advantage because when the submarine campaign begins . to take its toll, we shall feel repercussions in Australia. </para>
                    <para>I am concerned that the wheat-growers shall receive a fair deal. One honorable member referred to-night to the fact that Britain buys much of its requirements in other than dominion markets. Nevertheless, in time of stress we are expected, and are prepared, to make sacrifices in the Empire&#39;s cause. I believe however, that we have not received <inline font-style="italic">quid pro . quo</inline> in respect of the trade preferences that we have given to British manufacturers. We have placed tariffs against foreign goods, American motor vehicles, for example, and, as the result, the British manufacturers have been able to send their goods here and receive more than payable prices. The sweeping away of the small preference of 3d. a bushel on Australian wheat in the United Kingdom market when the Ottawa. Agreement and the Anglo-American Trade Agreement were reviewed, showed ingratitude on the part of Great Britain. I hope, therefore, that in the formulation of policy this Government or the boards which have been set up, if they are to be given full power, will remember these facts, and will ensure that business methods are used in spite of the fact that we are at war. I do not know whether it is official, but it has been suggested in the press, that wheat-growers will receive as a first advance ls. a bushel. That would &#39; be a miserable pittance and quite useless to the farmers. In view of world conditions, the minimum advance should be 2s. 6d. a bushel. The wheat-growers are still looking to their representatives . in this Parliament to obtain what they have been asking for, that is a guaranteed minimum price of 3s. lOd. a bushel f.o.r. No one can say that wheat can bc profitably grown for less than that. I do not wish to join issue with some honorable members of the Opposition who have complained about the &#34; avaricious ness &#34; of the primary producers, beyond saying that such a charge is baseless. The primary producers are long suffering and in the main they have had a raw deal from the rest of the community. The whole of that argument has been traversed on many occasions previously when we have been discussing the question of wheat bounties, and I do not intend to go over the ground again. I do suggest, however, that if honorable members of the Opposition go into the country districts and have heart-to-heart talks with the farmers they will be disillusioned and will not again talk about the prosperity of those people. The royal commission which inquired into the wheat industry some years ago reported that the industry was in debt to the amount of about &#163;150,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- I doubt the correctness of that statement, but from my personal knowledge of the wheat industry I can say that the position of the farmers to-day is infinitely worse than it was when that royal commission sat. If the wheat industry is worth anything to the country, and if we desire to maintain it as an exporting industry in order to help in the service of overseas debts, it is about time that the Government gave up talking about being unable to find a few million pounds with which to put this industry on its feet. I support the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-style="italic">(Ma:</inline> Curtin) that we should make a gesture by a gift of foodstuffs to the people of Great Britain. It is an&#34; excellent idea and &#163;1,000,000 will be neither here nor there in the vast amount of money that this Government will have to expend and find- for found it will be, as the previous speaker said - in the course of this war. I see no better way -of early displaying our sympathy with Great Britain. </para>

                    <para>Coming back to the question of actual armed participation in this conflict, I am in agreement with honorable members who have indicated that the best contribution that we can make is to put Australia in the position of being able to defend itself in eventualities which may quite likely occur in this part of the world. I do not think that, for a long time, at any rate, there will be any call foi- fighting men to go to the other side of the world in order to join in the conflict in which the Empire is engaged. In that respect I have a great deal in common with the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> and with the sentiments which be expressed in his magnificent speech last night. I abhor war. War achieves nothing and solves no problem, but rather aggravates the problems which it sets out to solve. Eventually the combatants in the present war must meet around the conference table in an endeavour to negotiate peace. I hope that such an opportunity will present itself very soon, and that we shall be able to conclude  a peace honorable to the British people. </para>
                    <para>Although I represent an electorate which is mainly agricultural, I realize that I have a responsibility to every section of the community. I remind the Government of its responsibility to the unemployed. To-day unemployment is just as rampant in country districts as it is in the cities. It is accompanied by the same evils wherever it prevails. It is nothing short of a crime that in a young country like Australia, which possesses an abundance of everything necessary to provide a high standard of living, we should admit failure to solve this problem. No problem confronts this country to-day which is not capable of a solution, provided that it is tackled determinedly. </para>

                            <para>- It can be solved by any government which possesses the courage and the will to do it. Those who have studied this matter realize that finance is the root of the difficulty. That aspect was admirably explained by the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward).</inline> So long as we subscribe to the idea that the present system of finance is sacrosanct, we shall fail to solve the problem of unemployment. We shall solve it, however, if we realize that humanity is more important than finance. All of us approve of the Government&#39;s intention to prevent profiteering. We trust that it will prove its sincerity by taking the most effective and stringent measures to carry out its promise in that respect. If it does so, it can rest assured of the co-operation of all sections, not only of this Parliament, but also of the community. Human nature being what it is, we realize that in a time of crisis like the present, there are people who accept every opportunity to exploit their fellows. I plead with the Government to do something on behalf of the unemployed youth of this country. I know of many young men who, owing to the depression, have never had a real chance to establish themselves as useful citizens. Our manhood is being undermined because of the inability of many to obtain employment and earn a competence for themselves. Here again we realize the necessity for monetary reform. I admit that the Government has not been entirely unconscious of its duty to our unemployed youths, but the assistance which it has so far provided has been totally inadequate. No doubt we shall have a similar experience in this war to that in 1914-18. In a time of war a job is always available for any man who can carry a gun. Unfortunately, however, in a time of peace the same men are not given any opportunity to become useful citizens. </para>

                    <para>I commend the Government for its promotion of our secondary industries. Unlike some of my colleagues who represent country electorates, I have no fault to find with the Government&#39;s policy of developing our secondary industries as much as possible, provided always that such industries are established on a reasonably economic basis, and are able to maintain themselves without placing any undue burden on the community. However, the Government has failed to provide for the production of fuel oil from coal and shale. I was informed recently on good authority that only limited reserves of oil are available in Australia, and that should imports of petrol and fuel oil be interrupted the wheels of industry would be stopped within a very short time. That is a serious danger. The Government cannot say that it has not been warned in this respect. During the short period I have been a member of this Parliament, I have heard the matter discussed repeatedly, and have, myself, raised it on several occasions. I trust that the stress of present circumstances will induce the Government to encourage the production of fuel oil in this country. </para>
                    <para>The Government has also failed to give as much encouragement as it might have given to the ship-building industry. Earlier in my speech I referred to the shortage of ships for the transport of our produce overseas. Here again, we have lost a glorious opportunity to develop an essential secondary industry. Ship-building could have been established on a firm basis many years ago. Had that been done, it would probably be one of our exporting industries to-day. I recall that an attempt was made to establish the industry immediately after the last war, when a number of very good vessels were launched in this country. However, that industry has been allowed to &#39;languish, with the result that now a considerable time would be required to re-establish it. Nevertheless, we should go ahead in that direction. We cannot call ourselves a self-contained nation until we build our own ships. There is nothing to prevent us from doing so. We have the essential basic industries and also sufficient skilled workmen. Our iron and steel industry is unrivalled in any other part of the world. I have always regretted that that industry was not nationalized. I say that after having given the matter serious thought. In particular, armaments and munitions should be manufactured in State factories, or, if in private factories, they should be made at cost. No profits should be allowed. </para>

                    is stated to be the representative of the small growers. He is their only representative, and he may be a bona fide one for all I know, but he is a stranger to me. This committee will have control of Australia&#39;s greatest industry, and my complaint is that it is overloaded with the representatives of commercial interests. I make my protest now against the constitution of the committee. I am informed that the small growers produce more than half of the total wool clip of Australia. The gentlemen who are alleged to be representing the growers are the very men who let the growers down in the past, particularly with regard to the trade diversion policy. The small growers do not know whether they can trust them. In Victoria, there are organizations of wheat-growers and wool-growers, and there are similar bodies in Western Australia and probably in the other States. The committee has been simply presented to us by the Government without any consultation with the growers&#39; organizations.

                <para>So far as we can judge, it appears to be the policy of the Government, in financing these marketing projects, as well as in financing the prosecution of the war, to adhere in general to orthodox methods of finance. I hope that it will, at any rate, come part of the way with those of us who maintain that it should take steps to raise money at the lowest possible rate of interest. At the present time, treasury-bills to the value of about &#163;80,000,000 are in circulation in Australia. It is possible to raise money in this way much cheaper than it can be raised by straight-out loans. The system of raising money by treasury-bills is particularly appropriate when it comes to financing the marketing of primary produce, because the bills can be liquidated as the proceeds of sales come to hand. If there is an open market for the bills, the money will probably be raised at an extremely low rate of interest. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps it was arranged that it should be a failure.I am in agreement with those who say we should make the fullest use of the Commonwealth Bank, an institution which is backed by the resources of the entire country. Those who say that they do not understand what is meant by the national credit do not want to understand. The national credit is the foundation upon which the private banks are based to-day. They are using the national credit, and charging their customers interest for it. During the last war, the Bank of England very soon discovered that it was not equal to the task of providing in the orthodox way all the finance necessary, and an act was passed giving it authority to issue &#163;400,000,000. The same procedure was followed there as in this country. Although this was free money, created against the national credit, it was lent at interest by the bank, even to the British Government itself, for the prosecution of the war. Let us see what we can do with the Commonwealth Bank. Let us do something to remove this intolerable load of interest. The story that we can raise money in only two ways - by borrowing and by taxing the people - is just a fairy tale. We can never develop or defend this country properly so long as we try to &#34; carry out that idea. I trust that even this Government, conservative though it may be, will explore the possibilities of this proposal and bring it into operation for the benefit of the people. I shall conclude by reading a poem entitled <inline font-style="italic">Lament of the Commonwealth Bank.</inline> It. is as follows :  - </para>

                    <para>My members are most emphatic that some action should be taken or at least an inquiry made into unjust treatment  of  a Digger in our district by the Commonwealth Government through the rifle range administration. </para>
                    <para>Victor Treveton, No. 7,316, 5th Field Engineers, enlisted for active service in the Great War, 1914-18, and sailed from Australia on the 1st April, 1916. He returned after the armistice, got married and now has a wife and four children and resides in Halifax, northern Queensland.He has again enlisted in the local Militia and has been in training for some time now. Note particularly that he has given some of the best  years  of his life for the protection of the Empire and he again unselfish!}&#39; offers for service to Australia and the Empire. </para>
                    <para>This man has carried on as a labourer since the armistice and eventually acquired a few head of cows and conducts a small dairying business . . . </para>
                    <para>The Halifax rifle range has a fair area of grazing lands on it and these areas are leased to people for grazing purposes. Trenton has about 40 head of cattle earning his living by dairying. He needs grazing areas and tendered for the rifle range paddock - one other person tendered, so I am told - one Ten to, an Italian cane-farmer. I am also led to believe that the rental offered by Ten to was no greater than that offered by Trenton. </para>
                    <para>Ten to is a cane-farmer, cuts 2,000 tons of cane per year, owns a horse paddock and also three (3) horses. He keeps his horses in his  own  horse paddock (freehold lands). His farm consists of an area of about 128 acres freehold and 33 acres special lease and he  its  considered a wealthy man - Why should he not be wealthy too! He remained in Australia while Trenton fought for it. He still intends  to  remain in Australia while Trenton helps to win the next war. Ten to is not in the  local  Militia - that is by the way. The fact remains that Ten to was given a lease  of  the rifle range paddock whilst Trenton, a returned soldier, trying his best to maintain a wife  and  family - actually struggling - is ignored. Tento does not even use the paddock. The  gate  is  off and  it is open. That is a fact. </para>
                    <para>It is evident on the information supplied  to  us that the Commonwealth Government has preferred an Italian (naturalized) to an Australianborn returned soldier, and, moreover instead of helping the returned soldier, as  it  promised to do, is specially going around  to  victimize one. There must be some sound reasons why  a  soldier could not get this lease. The British community in this district are asking the sub-branch questions and pertinent  ones  at that. Why are we tolerating such treatment? Why is a returned soldier specially held  out  from the privilege of something that  he  helped to win for the nation? </para>
                    <para>Promises galore were made when young Trenton - a boy of sixteen - enlisted and we all know the oath he took, and the crime of it all we now know how the Commonwealth Military authorities appreciate his young  life&#39;s services. The result of this, treatment is going to eventually create a deep impression on the people of this district.. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>We do most earnestly desire that you take this matter up with the authorities.  Treveton&#39;s  stock can starve (so can his wife and kids apparently) and an area that the lessee does not wish to use is wasting. It points clearly to us that forces are at work to wreck Treveton </para>
                <para>I am appealing to all quarters in. this matter until satisfaction and justice has Deen reached . . . </para>
                <para class="block">I have no knowledge of the facts, other than is conveyed by that letter, but I contend that an inquiry is warranted. If the rent offered by this young man was the same as that offered by the Italian, preference should be given to the Australian. The Government has always claimed to have adhered to the policy of preference to returned soldiers&#39;. Surely Trenton is entitled to preference over a man who is not a native of this country but is only a naturalized subject, and is not an ex-soldier either of his native country or of Australia. I sincerely trust that some action will be taken to clear the matter up. </para>

                    <para>.- I enter a further emphatic protest against the attitude of the Government towards primary industries generally, and specifically towards the wheat industry. Honorable members who sit on this side of the House, particularly those who represent country districts, appeal to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> to assist the wheat industry. We want to give the Government all the support that we can in promoting the welfare of this country. The wheat industry has never in its history been in a worse position than that in which it is now placed. The wheat-growers are to-day living under conditions which are far from being as good as are those made possible by the basic wage, and in many cases they are definitely insolvent. Fully appreciating the fact that the country is at war, the Opposition claims that the industry should not be sacrificed because of the present difficulties of the nation. The Prime Minister states that under the Commonwealth pool the first payment to the growers shall be ls. a bushel, but, as the cost of production is nearly 4s. a bushel, I submit that the first payment should be at least 2s. a bushel. Australia cannot afford to sacrifice such an important industry. A similar position arises with regard to meat, wool, fruit, wine and all dairy products. If the marketing of these products is to be. administered through pools, the Opposition claims that the pools should be set up after consultation with the representatives of the growers engaged in those industries. We have been told that the existing boards are dominated by commercial  interests and are not <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> representative as they should be of the primary producers. The boards should have a predominance of representatives of the growers. The honorable member for Wimmera has indicated the lessons, to be learned as the result of the operation of pools during the last war, and I hope that the .benefit of those lessons will not be lost. Even if the wheat farmers received 4s. a bushel for the next five years, the industry would not become solvent. Its debts now amount to &#163;140,000,000, and, if the price of wheat increased, the benefit of it should go, not to the commercial interests, but to the producers themselves to enable them to meet their obligations. </para>

                    <para>.- I again bring under the notice of the Government the interpretation placed by the Public Service Board upon subsection 9 of section 84 of the Public Service Act.

                <para class="block">I brought this matter up in June last on behalf of many men employed in the Public Service - mostly linemen in the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department. The Parliament carried an amendment to the act. for the special purpose of providing a degree of security for returned soldiers who had certain periods of service of a casual nature in government departments. On reading the debate on the amending legislation, and the assurance given by Ministers in both branches of the lexis.lature when the bill was introduced, I find that it was made to appear that provided these returned soldiers had been engaged continuously as casual workers for two years they would be entitled to permanent employment. This did not involve the raising of their status, because the bill provided that they should have permanent appointments in positions similar to those they had been occupying; consequently no great expenditure on the part of the Government was involved. After the bill had been passed, the Public Service Board decided that these permanent appointments could be made only as desired by the board. The position is that these men have not been appointed unless positions have been specially created by the board. The provision of the act might bear the interpretation that the board is putting on it, but. I am quite sure, after reading the speeches of Government spokesmen and of other honorable members on the issue when it was before this Parliament, that tha.t was not the real intention. It was desired that these men should be given a position of security provided they had the two qualifications of two years of casual employment in the Public Service, and a satisfactory report by their chief officer as to their work. When I brought this matter up last June, I was assured by the Prime Minister that it would be investigated. Later I raised it on the motion for the adjournment of the House, and spoke upon it at some length. After a lapse of four months I asked a question on the subject yesterday. To-day T received a reply from the Prime Minister to the following effect : - </para>

Owing, however, to the pressure of other business, it has riot been possible for the Government to deal with it finally. It is, however, being kept under notice and will be considered at the first available opportunity. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> did an excellent job in that connexion. If 200 of these men could be appointed to permanent positions in one department, it should be possible to provide positions for all who need them in other departments. We are not asking that the status of the men should be increased, but merely that the real intentions of the provisions of the law shall be applied to them. The Government says that its attention is being occupied by more serious matters. I wonder what it will think if a time comes when it has to ask more men to enlist for the war while so many of the men who served in the last war are still unprovided for. The Government has not fulfilled its promises to these men, and it should do so. We are asking not only for the fulfilment of our own desire, but also that the act, which was amended nearly two years ago, shall be put into force. I hope the Prime Minister&#39;s attention will again be directed to this subject. </para>
