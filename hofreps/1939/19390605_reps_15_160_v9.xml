                        <para>- Messages were received this morning, in the first instance from Cocos Island by cable, indicating that the authorities there were in wireless touch with the <inline font-style="italic">Guba</inline> but that, on 'account of the inability of the flying boat to  obtain a cross bearing to any vessel in the neighbourhood, it had experienced considerable difficulty at that stage in locating Cocos Island with a view to making a landing there. Subsequent reports indicated that the <inline font-style="italic">Guba</inline> was cruising in the neighbourhood, but was unable to locate Cocos Island. At about lunchtime I received a message from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Percival,</inline> on the <inline font-style="italic">Guba,</inline> indicating that they had. decided to proceed east in the direction of Batavia. Just as I entered the House this afternoon I was handed a further message which had just been received from the <inline font-style="italic">Guba,</inline> stating that it is now flying on a course towards Soenda Strait, between Java and Sumatra, in conditions which, at the . position of the aircraft, were overcast, with considerable haze. This procedure is in accordance with the decision to proceed to Batavia rather than to use surplus fuel in an endeavour to reach Cocos Island, under existing conditions. I may say that the tone and terms of that message, like those of the message previously received from the <inline font-style="italic">Guba,</inline> do not indicate that any gravedoubt was felt regarding its ability to reach Batavia, and it would appear to have been assumed that the condition of the fuel supplies was satisfactory for the purpose. I can only say that we all sincerely hope that this is so. </para>

                    <para>When the matter first came before me, and thereappeared to be some real doubt of the <inline font-style="italic">Gubabeing</inline> able to make a safe landing at Batavia, having regard to the condition of its fuel supplies, I immediately had a communication sent to. the British Government representative' at Batavia, requesting that arrangementsbe made at once with the Government authorities there to send out a ship, if necessary, in the direction in which the <inline font-style="italic">Guba</inline> was travelling. I think it proper to assure 'honorable members that no delay was permitted to occur in taking such steps as might be necessary. I, of course, hope that they will prove to be unnecessary. </para>

                    </talk.start>
                    <quote>
                        <para>In view of the increased telephonic business and wireless communications between Tasmania and the mainland during the last ten years, will the Postmaster-General take immediate steps toincrease the lineage between Tasmania and the mainland, which has not been improved for twenty years? </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>On the 30th May, he asked a similar question regarding a breakdown of the service between the mainland and Tasmania, because of the failure of a line which had been in use for upward of twenty years. It is obviously incorrect to state that the line has been in use for upwards of twenty years, because there was no telephone communication between Tasmania and the mainland twenty years ago. Moreover, the statements of the honorable member in regard to delays to telephone business are at variance with the facts. The records which are regularly taken of the business transactions between Tasmania and the mainland indicate that, during the busy hours of the day, say from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., the average delay rarely exceeds five minutes. During the late evening hours, say, between 9 p.m. and 11 p.m., when concession rates operate, the. delay to business frequently reaches an average of 45 minutes, but this condition applies to all important circuits, and is unavoidable, in view of the cheap tariffs which apply. While the existing telephone channels, that is, two between Melbourne and Hobart, three between Melbourne and Laun  ces  ton, and one between Melbourne, King Island and Burnie, reasonably meet present-day requirements, careful consideration has been given to proposals for augmenting the present facilities, and an order has already been placed for the provision of additional channels of communication in the existing cable. The question of supplementing the submarine cable service by a radio link, which will be suitable for both telegraphic and telephonic purposes, is being exhaustively studied, and it is hoped to make these facilities available in the near future. </para>

It was also stated in the report, that a considerable number of resignations had been received by officers commanding those units, because of the lack of uniforms and other equipment? </para>

                                <para>- I have not seen- the report. I again direct attention to the memorandum which I circulated to honorable members recently regarding clothing for the military forces. In that communication, emphasis was laid on the fact that normally a recruit does not get a uniform until he has been in the force for three months. In accordance with a decision made in February, it was decided to issue uniforms as quickly as possible. I have nothing to add to the circulated statement, which sets out the position very fully. I know nothing about the alleged retirements. </para>

                                <para>- In view of the fact that it is not usual to issue military clothing to recruits until they have been in the forces for three months, will the Minister for Defence consider the issuing of warmer clothing to men going into camp during the present cold season other than the ordinary dungaree suits which are conducive to the contraction of pneumonia. It is a fact that recently, when the 4th Battalion in New South Wales was sent into camp without uniforms, citizens of Burwood contributed funds with which uniforms for this battalion were purchased, and that sales tax was charged on those uniforms? </para>

The council has invoked such influence as I may. have in this Parliament to relieve the situation. In view of the position there described, will the Prime Minister, who must know that similar conditions prevail widely throughout Australia, reconsider the decision of the Government to adjourn Parliament at the end of this week? Will he afford the House an opportunity to consider and discuss ways and means to relieve the position of the workless and the destitute during the winter months? </para>

Furthermore, the retail price of the Italian hats in question range from 35s. to £2 2s. each. Information in the possession of the department does not indicate that a charge of dumping of these hats would be sustained. However, I shall make further inquiries into the matter. </para>

                    <para>.- This bill to authorize, a census of man-power is complementary to the measure recently passed by this House to make provision for a survey of material-power. Notwithstanding our abhorrence of anything in the nature of militarism, recent events have forced on us the conclusion that we must take steps to prepare for the possibility of Australia being attacked. </para>

                        <para>- There is no crisis at the moment, and none is anticipated; bat happenings during the last two or three years, and particularly the fate which has befallen a number of small nations, make it incumbent upon us to prepare for our own defence. The object of these two bills is to make these preparations. The first step that has been taken is to take stock of what we have in the way 'of materials and man-power. The stocktaking of materials is provided for in the Supply and Development Bill. The aim of the bill now before the chamber is that ive may be able to acquire such knowledge as would enable each man to be fitted into the niche which he would most usefully fill in defence of the Commonwealth. The army in the field has to be supported by an army in the workshops and the aim of this measure is to ensure that our technicians will be in the workshops, not footslogging in the infantry. When the last war rook place it found Australia unprepared, but it did not matter much then, because we were safe at home. But when the next call comes to Australia, it may be a call to defend our own homes, and, although we do not fear that that is imminent, we know the liability to it. . We realize that the call, when.it does come, will come quickly- that there will be very little warning - and it is, therefore, our first duty to be prepared. Australia has no intention of embarking on any crusade and I think that none of us has ambitions to seu Australia militarized on the European model. The object of these two bills is to provide for our own protection. Objection, much of it unreal, has been made to answering the questions which are to be asked. The questions are set out in the schedule. If honorable members peruse them they will see that they are perfectly harmless- and are of the character which we are accustomed to answer in the census which is held every ten years. The questions relate to these matters: - Age last birthday; country of birth of self and parents; nationality; dependent relatives; general health; name, business address and business of present employer; grade of occupation; unemployment. A particular question concerns craft or occupation, and the person answering the question- naire  must state his craft or individual occupation on which he is engaged and any other skilled craft or occupation in which he has special skill or training. Obviously, the purpose of these questions is to enable those in charge of preparations for defence of the country to know where our man-power lies, where tradesmen can be found in order for them to be  allotted  to their allocated places. There is nothing inquisitorial in the census to which objection can be taken. It is of the type of the ordinary census. It will bc remembered that during the last war a census was taken embracing questions somewhat like these and, in addition, questions relating to property. I do not know that anybody raised serious objection to answering the questions then, or that anybody was damaged by answering them, and I believe that there is no good and honest reason to object to answering questions contained in the schedule to this bill. The leaders of the Labour party are encouraging the people to resist, even to the extent of going to gaol, rather than answer these questions. </para>

                        <para>- I do not flatter the honorable gentlemen who are interjecting by thinking that they are Labour leaders. The policy of the Labour party on defence was declared as late as last October by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> and that policy had as its first plank a survey precisely of the character which the Government comprehends in the Supply and Development Bill and this bill. The policy of Labour on defence was declared by the Leader of the Opposition, somewhat after the style of the  late <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Woodrow</inline> Wilson, in a series of points. The honorable gentleman took thirteen points and he was careful  to state that he declared the Labour party's attitude in order to make it clear at a lime when the defence of the country was absorbing the attention of the seven Australian parliaments. The first plank of his platform was the establishment of a survey precisely similar to that proposed by this Government. It would be better to read from the precise report in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra. Times</inline> newspaper of the 19th October, 1938. It was an account of an interview with the Leader of the Opposition. </para>

                <para class="block">That fact stands out from the many declarations that it has made. As soon as any government attempts to do something useful and effective the Labour opposition throws every obstacle in the way. Its policy is opposition and hindrance, and contains nothing of value that will contribute to the defence of this country. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition said that he intended to oppose the measure because it is a means to provide for industrial conscription. I am surprised that he should object on that ground, because industrial conscription is the ultimate objective of the Labour party. For years provision has been made- in that party's platform for the nationalization of production, distribution and exchange, which is industrial conscription such as operates in Soviet Russia and, in a somewhat modified form, in Germany, where it is supported1 by the National Socialist party. In these circumstances it is easy to realize that this Government is unsympathetic towards industrial conscription or, in fact, State socialism of any kind; but it believes that in an emergency provision must be made to utilize the services of the man-power of the nation and its resources in order to ensure the safety of the nation. The members of the Opposition intend to oppose this measure because they contend that it is a step towards conscription, but I cannot see any possible reason for that contention. " The conscription to which honorable members opposite refer must mean conscription for service overseas. </para>

For the last 30 years Commonwealth law has provided that the Governor-General may, in time of war, call upon all male persons between the ages of 18 and 60 years to serve in the defence forces of the Commonwealth, and :no government, labour or otherwise, has' ever attempted to amend the law in that -respect. Therefore, the only tag which the Opposition is trying to fix upon :this Government is that of conscription for!. service abroad. I deny that any such proposal has ever been made by the Government. On the contrary, the Minister in charge of the bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Street)</inline> and responsible party leaders have declared in the clearest possible terms that they are opposed to compulsory service outside Australia. The late Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> made such a declaration, in most unmistakable terms. </para>

                        <para>- He has made a similar declaration. In introducing the bill the Minister for Defence made it clear that the Government did not propose at any time to introduce compulsory service abroad. After such a clear declaration of policy, no government would be guilty of such a complete <inline font-style="italic">volte face</inline> as honorable members of the Opposition ascribe to it. Public opinion of Australia is almost unanimously opposed to compulsory service overseas. Whilst I believe that if Australia were attacked the government of the day should be in a position immediately to introduce the conscription of men, materials and money in order to assist in the defence of the country - every one would support such a policy - I hold that no man should at any time, or under any consideration, be compelled to serve outside Australia against his will. Of course, service in the navy is voluntary, and when a man joins the navy he knows that he is liable to serve wherever his ship may be ordered. Should this country be attacked conscription would be introduced immediately, whatever government was in power, and there would be no place for any Labour leader who urged resistance in that respect. The first to object would be the workers themselves, because they are as patriotic as any other citizens. </para>

                        <para>- A census of our resources would be incomplete without a. record of our monetary resources. We should know where the money lies. Later, I propose to move an amendment to provide that a census of the wealth resources of the country be taken, to which there should not be any objection, particularly as a census is being taken solely for making the necessary provision for the defence of the country. I challenge the Opposition to give any valid reason why any Australian should refuse to defend this country should it be attacked. If this country were attacked any Australian, worthy of the rights of citizenship should be willing to place himself in service at the place to which he may be ordered by the persons in proper authority. Any man who claims the right to say that, in the event of this country being attacked, he would please himself whether he would join in its defence, is not a worthy Australian citizen and should be denied the rights of citizenship. I say further that, once it is conceded that it is the duty of every man to take part in the defence of this country, it follows that in order that he may he given a part in which he will be of most use, we must know in what direction he can be most usefully employed. I support the bill. </para>

                    <para>.- On the face of it this bill seems, to the uninitiated, to be one of the most harmless looking pieces of legislation ever brought down in this Parliament; but after an examination of the motives that led to its introduction Ave find it to be one which we must oppose with all the resources at our command. Before discussing the bill itself I should like to .refer briefly to the statement of the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> that the Leader of the Labour party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> as recently as October last, suggested in this House that a survey should be undertaken in order to place the defences' of  this country on a sound footing. Such a reference by an honorable member who is opposed to the party to which I belong suggests that the Government, lacking sufficient initiative to bring down a bill for this purpose, followed the hint given by the Leader of the Opposition on that occasion. If that be so it is regrettable that the bill thrown down to us now is evidence that the Government by no means grasped what was in the mind of my leader when he suggested that a national survey should be made. What was suggested was that among other things, a survey of the wealth of this country should be made for use in time of emergency. We have seen other instances of the failure of governments of the same political colour as that of the present Government to grasp the import of suggestions made by the Opposition. For instance, in 1932 the NationalistCountry party Government of Queensland seized upon child endowment, which has been a plank of the Labour party's platform for many years, as an election cry; but because of its complete misunderstanding of Labour's policy .in connexion with this matter, it was politically annihilated. Now, this Government has seized upon a, suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition, and because it does not sufficiently comprehend what he had in mind, it is courting political annihilation. </para>

                        <para>- I am pleased to have that assurance from the honorable gentleman. I feel sure that, when the list is made available, we shall find that it has been so cleverly compiled as to provide even further protection for the friends of the Government. I oppose this measure not because I am hostile to the taking of a survey to ascertain the resources of this country, but because it is evident that the sole purpose of this bill is to ascertain something by means of which the workers of Australia can be readily conscripted in the event of an emergency. A true survey would include not only man-power but also resources of both primary and secondary industries and of wealth. All that this bill provides for, however, is a survey of manpower. Is it any wonder that we on this side are suspicious when we hear a speech such as that delivered by the Minister for Defence in which he admitted that this bill might be regarded in some quarters as the first step in the direction of industrial conscription ? We know that men of the generation to which the honorable gentleman belongs had to face a situation similar to that which confronts us to-day, and I, as a representative of the present generation, cannot allow this occasion to pass without declaring emphatically that the young men of to-day will not be prepared to give their lives, possibly, just to make the world a better place for vested interests. We refuse to sacrifice our homes, property and all that we hold dear. We know very well what would be the outcome of a world conflict, and we are not blind to what has taken place in Europe. We are not prepared to leave Australia's shores, although I say without hesitation that, should war come into this country, we would fight to the best of our ability to defend it. My reading of the Defence Act convinces me that, by repealing section  49,  the Government could, to-morrow if it so desired, conscript the man-power of Australia for service overseas. </para>

                        <para>- It has frequently been stated on the hustings, over the &lt;air and in this Parliament that, living as we do under the British flag, we enjoy freedom and privileges that are not given to people in some other countries. But this measure, which, as I have said, is a step in the direction of the conscription of man-power, is an attempt to break down that freedom. If it is carried it will not be long before other forms of compulsion will creep into our national life. Our democratic rights will be filched from us slowly, but none the less surely. This Government is drifting towards fascism. This measure is one which we would expect to see enacted in a totalitarian State. </para>

                <para>The bill provides for the compulsory registration of men between the ages of IS and 65 years, and the Defence Act makes provision for the enlistment, in a time of emergency, of men between 18 and 00 years. The' present state of world unrest is the direct result of control by international armaments ring. Following the passage of this bill, the next step towards conscription will be the introduction of compulsory military training, which, we know, is favoured by the Government. It hoped that Australian workers and their sons would not enlist in sufficient numbers in the voluntary militia. It has been disappointed; the total enlistments now exceed the 'original quota. But how could this Government hope to introduce a compulsory training scheme when it is unable to equip members of the volunteer militia with uniforms, rifles and ammunition? </para>

                        <para>- It is correct. Recently, representations were made to the Government on behalf of militia recruits in Cairns, who complained bitterly about the lack of equipment. Can the Minister say how many rounds of 303 ammunition there are in the Cairns district? I believe that if a return were called for it would be found that there was not more than one round per man. Yet the Government talks of compulsory military training! That will come, however, as sure as this bill will go through Parliament, and subsequently there will be conscription by this " roundthecorner " method. </para>

                <para>The bill also provides that youths must register within 30 days of attaining the age of eighteen years, and that youths between the ages of 18 and 21 must notify any change of address. That is another indication of what is in the mind of "the Government. The majority of youths between those age limits are as yet unskilled; they are learning their trades or professions. It is the most important period of their lives. Why is this particular section of the community singled out? If a national register is to be compiled, it. should provide for notification to be made by all men whose names appear on it. These are the things-that make the Opposition suspicious of this measure. </para>
                <para>The bill makes provision for the appointment of a board to consist of a representative of the Defence Department, who will be chairman,' a representative of the Depart men of .Supply and Development, and the Commonwealth Statistician. It enacts further that there shall be an executive officer of the board. Who is this executive' officer? What, will be his duties? Will he be a member of the Commonwealth Public Service? We know from experience of this Government and its predecessors, that when a position such as this' is created its occupant is usually selected before the legislation is introduced to Parliament. Apparently this board will be constituted on the lines of a board of directors, similar to directorates of which several Government supporters are members. The bill also empowers the board to demand additional information from any person who registers. Not satisfied with the information asked for in the bill itself, the board is to be authorized to make any other inquiries it thinks fit. To my mind, the whole thing savours of fascism, or worse; it is like the Spanish Inquisition brought up to date. The bill empowers the Government to pry:into the private affairs of all men between the ages of  18  and  65  years. </para>

                        <para>- This is not a census, this is" a sectional thing. A census is something that applies to every man, woman and child. This is an inquisition into the private affairs of certain sections of the community, and those only. The Prime Minister says that he has faith in the people of Australia. He has appealed to their sporting spirit to cooperate with him in these trying times. He says that we must have freedom  of speech - that our free institutions must not be challenged, yet he brings down a measure providing for compulsory registration. Is he afraid that the people will not support him ? If he knew anything of the sacrifices the workers had made in the years from  19.14  to  1918,  he should have no fear of the response of the- people when they are appealed to in the proper way. Australians enlisted in' their hundreds of thousands when Australia was in danger, and they are just' as ready to respond again, but they will not be driven. I can see what is behind this measure. This is an example of fascist rule, towards which the present Government has been tending ever since the last elections. Apparently it is not prepared to' trust the people. The workers have never let Australia down. That was demonstrated on Gallipoli and in Prance. They are always prepared to assist in any movement for the protection of Australia, In contrast with this, however, "we have a record of vested interests which, time and time again, have let Australia down. During the last war,- when the workers were dying overseas to . make the world safe for democracy, the wealthy interests were reaping a harvest from the war loans and profits. During the economic depression the same people, or people of the same class, opposed every proposal for a reduction of interest rates. One does not need to be a wonderful prophet to foretell that this national register will prove to be but the first step towards compelling the workers to" sacrifice their lives, if need be, in defence of the factories and investments of the wealthy classes, The workers will not be asked to make that sacrifice; they are to be compelled. A true survey of Australia's resources would necessarily include a register of wealth, but the Government is apparently frightened that, if a survey of wealth were made, the people would wake up to the fact that they are being exploited. Why could not the Government introduce a voluntary register? The system of voluntary military training has proved successful, and has been endorsed by the people. Of course, it is obvious that information sought under this measure is wanted for an ulterior purpose. The Minister is to have power to divulge the information obtained through the register, another indication of the drift of this Government towards fascism. The Minister is also to have power to say whether or not persons shall be prosecuted. Clause  24  is simply reprinted from the Crimes Act. It creates no new offences. It is very similar to the Queensland criminal code.  But clause  26  may well be described as the straw that breaks the camel's back. This </para>

                <para class="block">Government is always telling us to tune in to Great Britain, but clause 26 provides that a man charged with an offence is not to be regarded as innocent until he is proved guilty, which is the British way, and the onus is on him to prove himself innocent. That is the negation of British justice. Section 27 provides for the making of regulations, but we, who are now considering this bill, have no knowledge of what may be contained in those regulations. We hope that the Minister will give us an opportunity to discuss them. </para>
                <para>I am opposed to this measure because it is not democratic. If there is to a census, or a complete record, let us have it by all means; not a half-baked proposal of this kind which is sectional in its application. , It does not apply to the whole of the community, and no register of wealth is to be made. The Supply and Development Bill, which has just passed through this House, made no provision for a register of wealth, but merely provided for attaching defence annexes to private factories. It was simply a hand-out to private enterprise. </para>

                        <para>.- I agree with the honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan)</inline> that this measure is not exactly what it might appear to be. It has been described as the first step towards industrial conscription; I prefer to regard it as the second step towards that end, because the Government took the first step when it introduced the Supply and Development Bill. The Labour party objects very strongly to this bill. We believe it to be part of the Government's plan to establish industrial conscription, and regard it as the forerunner to military conscription. We also strongly object to it because it contains no provision to take a census of wealth. I am not very greatly influenced by the alleged authorities which were quoted by the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> with respect to the Government's intention, because we have too often heard leaders of the Government give assurances in certain directions and subsequently seen them adopt a contrary policy. I have been reliably informed, for instance, that the honorable member for Perth himself supported conscription a few years ago. If he believed in such a policy then and supported it, it is quite obvious that he is not to be relied upon when he suddenly appears as an opponent, of conscription. I should like the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Street)  to explain why the Government became aware so suddenly of the necessity for altering its policy in this matter. When Cabinet met early this year in Hobart, it favoured the establishment of a voluntary register, and official statements were issued setting out reasons why the Government was against a compulsory register. However, for some reason unknown to the general public,  it  suddenly decided: to reverse its policy, and establish a compulsory register of national resources. Will the Minister inform the House why the Government altered its policy so suddenly in this regard? The voluntary register had not been given a trial, and in view of Cabinet's decision at its meeting  in February last in Hobart, I should like to know why, without any test whatever, it deserted that proposal. It is well known that several Ministers have always been conscriptionists, and it would appear that, when they were able to exercise greater influence following the reconstruction of Cabinet, they decided upon a compulsory register. The late Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons,</inline> was originally a strong supporter of the proposal for. a voluntary register. I point out this fact in order to show how little we can rely upon the words of leaders of governments when they are dealing with so important a matter as this. Giving his reasons for a compulsory register after he was converted to that proposal, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> said that it was required for the following purposes : - </para>

                    <para>Analysing that statement closely, it is evident that something more is desired by this Government than a census of the national resources and man-power in order that we may be enabled effectively to organize our defence. I should like the' Minister to explain just what is meant by the words of the late Prime Minister which I have just read - " That persons in factories, annexes and essential industries remain at their work, and that the additional members required are allotted from non-essential industries  and general production". . To what  spheres are these additional men to be' allotted? Why should we need to release them  if it  be not for military service? Tho Minister might also explain exactly in what circumstances the Government will consider it necessary to apply the provisions of this measure. It is true that many statements, such as those quoted by the honorable member for Perth, have been made' regarding the attitude of the Government on this matter. The late Prime Minister was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> Melbourne, on the 20th October^ 1937, during the election campaign in that year, as saying - </para>

                    <para>Will the Minister explain whether or not the Government has altered its policy in this respect? Has it decided that the voluntary system is useless? Has it deserted the voluntary system? If it is determined to continue with the voluntary system what is the necessity for this measure? If it is not the intention of the Government to use the information which it secures through this register for the purpose of imposing conscription, what is the use of it? What is the use of obtaining information compulsorily unless the Government intends to take what will then be the logical step of using such information for the purpose of compelling men to render service as workers or as soldiers? In his second-reading speech the Minister said - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para>Is the emergency to which he refers to apply only when this country is faced with invasion, or will it be an emergency of the kind which has occurred so frequently in recent weeks? We know that this legislation has been introduced on the pretext that happenings on the other side of the world have given rise, according to the Government, to an emergency. Exactly in what circumstances will the Government declare that an emergency has arisen in order to provide itself with an excuse to impose industrial conscription, and conscription for military service  overseas? It is useless for honorable members opposite to deny that the Government intends to impose conscription for overseas military service. The most important thing, unfortunately, is that the Government has power to impose conscription for military service overseas without making any appeal at all for the approval of the people. It can take such action by virtue of a majority in this Houseby amending existing legislation. If the Government is sincere in its declarations on this matter and if it does not intend to introduce conscription for military service overseas, I should like to know why I and other honorable members have failed in questions directed to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> to secure information regarding its powers in this direction under the Constitution, despite the fact that the Prime Minister is alleged to be one of the best constitutional " brains " in the community. No member of the Government has been prepared to assert that a safeguard now exists in the Constitution against any attempt to impose conscription for military service overseas. If this Government were sincere in this matter it would immediately give to the people an opportunity to place this safeguard definitely in the Constitution. The honorable member for Perth said that all honorable members were aware that the majority of the people of Australia is opposed to conscription tor overseas military service. That is true. In my constituency, for instance, the majority is opposed to it, but I am not so certain that a majority of the members of this Government is opposed to such a policy. Therein lies the real danger. Although the majority of the people is opposed to such a policy and might elect representatives to this Parliament to uphold that view on such an issue, nothing in the Constitution compels any Government to enact only that legislation which has been approved by the people at the ballot-box. We known that governments are prone to depart from policies on which they are elected. Honorable members may be elected to this Parliament as anticonscriptionists, but a government which they support might, on the plea that unforeseen circumstances have arisen, declare that it has no alternative but to impose conscription for overseas military service. In such circumstances all of the declarations made by honorable gentlemen opposite are of no avail, if they fail to place this issue directly before the people and undertake to give effect to the people's verdict. Let us examine the position as it exists at the moment. The honorable member for Kennedy said thai there should be no objection to the organization of industry on a basis that would enable us to implement the most effective defence plan possible. Where the defence of Australia is concerned there can be no real argument against any effective plan for the protection of our shores, but has this Government ever displayed any ability in providing such a plan? It says that it must have a. register of all of our skilled employees, and also a plan to allocate them to spheres where their services can best be utilized; yet to-day 29,000 unemployed skilled Australians are registered for employment at the Government's own munition factories. </para>

                            <para>- So long as the Government allows any skilled artisan to remain unemployed it is not giving effect to any plan for the adequate defences of this country. Only to-day an honorable member brought under the notice of the Government the fact that many hundreds of our skilled workers are leaving Australia to take jobs in another dominion simply because anti-Labour governments here are not prepared to provide them with opportunities to earn a. livelihood. When the Government speaks of an emergency, does it not consider that an emergency has arisen in the life of an individual member of the community when he cannot secure employment in order to provide the necessaries of life for those dependent upon him. It is to the discredit of the Government that the only time that we can expect the labour power of the country to be fully utilized is when Australia is said to be in danger of attack.

                    <para class="block">Australia, it would take steps to develop the continent, for the country's best defence will be provided by industries so developed as to enable them to maintain a much greater population. If the Government were in earnest about the defence of Australia, it would take a census of wealth, but there is no suggestion that it be undertaken. Only those who have their labour to sell, and possess no other assets, are to he called upon to train, principally in their own time, in order to become an effective unit in the country's defence. Should war come ho will be called upon to risk his life,  and  should he come through the war unharmed he will be expected to return to industry, when, out of the wealth which he assists to produce, he will be called upon to pay for the war in which he risked his all. Australia is still staggering under the burden of the cost of the last war. If the Government genuinely believed in equality of sacrifice, it would call upon the wealthy  people  in our midst to make their contribution. In his second-reading speech, the Minister said that provision for defence was in the nature of an insurance policy for Australia. An insurance policy for whom ? If the matter were determined according to present-day insurance practice, the workers would not have to pay high premiums in order to obtain policies to cover their meagre possessions; but the wealthy people in the community, who own the country's industries and control its financial institutions, would have to pay enormous premiums for their assets in the country to be guaranteed. </para>

                            <para>- Let us examine the Minister's statement. The cost to Australia of the Great War already totals £540,000,000, exclusive of the cost of war service homes. Interest and sinking fund represent approximately £345,000,000, whilst the annual interest burden, which the people are still called upon to pay, is about £9,350,000. A great deal of .the expenditure on. war was paid out of revenue, but that does not necessarily mean that the sacrifice was equitably shared, for in the final analysis the cost of every war is borne by those who constitute, in a financial sense, the lower strata of society. The workers pay the whole cost of every war. Although interest and sinking fund payments in respect of internal war loans total £29S,000,000 to date, there is still <inline font-style="italic">£179,000,000</inline> owing. According to the latest figures supplied by the Commonwealth Statistician, every child born of Australian parents enters the world bearing a debt for war purposes alone of approximately £39. In view of the fact that the community generally is still paying for the last war, how can the Minister claim that that influential section which supports his party has paid the cost? The big financial interests have no true patriotism; they respond to the country's call only if their own financial interests will be served thereby. Unless they can be shown that war loans represent a good and secure investment, with regular payments of interest guaranteed by the Government, their response is poor, notwithstanding that the money may be wanted for the country's defence. Many of the loans which have been floated since 1 932 have been under-subscribed, notwithstanding that an examination of the advertisements in respect of many of them would show that the Commonwealth Treasurer pointed out that the money asked for was necessary for the development of the country's defences. Let us see how the wealthy people of Australia responded to those appeals : - </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member's interjection supports my contention that those who have money to lend, and would be the greatest losers in the event of Australia 'being successfully invaded, subscribe to defence loans only when the terms of such loans are attractive as a financial investment. They do not contribute out of any sense of real patriotism. Even if there were no interest at all on such loans - and, in my  opinion,  defence loans should be free of interest - these wealthy gentlemen, who are regarded by the Government as patriotic and public-spirited citizens, should still have made their contributions and caused the loans to bc over-subscribed. The reason that the loans were under-subscribed is that they did not offer a sufficient 'financial inducement to these people. The only way to get them to assist in the defence of the country is to offer th&amp;m high interest rates. In an emergency, when the call on the wealth of the country is greater than in normal times, these wealthy interests take advantage of the situation. A study of happenings in Australia during the last war will show that the greater the difficulties of the country, and, therefore, the greater its need for the support of its wealthy citizens, the higher were the rates of interest demanded, by them. </para>

There is no limit on the inquiries that the military police will be able to make into the private affairs of members of the community, because we find that clause 20 reads - _ For the purpose of any inquiries or observations necessary for the proper carrying out of this act or the regulations, all persons shall, when required by the Commonwealth Statistician or by any officer authorized in that behalf in writing by the Commonwealth Statistician, answer questions and produce documents within such time as the Commonwealth Statistician or the authorized officer thinks fit. </para>

                    </continue><para class="block">Power is to be given for the delegation of authority by the Commonwealth Statistician who could, and no doubt would, delegate it to military officers. We know what happened during the last war when we had our War Census Act and our War Precautions Act. Decent citizens were disturbed at all hours of the day and night and their possessions were turned over because the government's officers were seeking evidence - its nature was never disclosed - in the hope that they would be able to procure the conviction of decent persons for the mere reason that their political beliefs were opposed to those of the government of the day. Who is to know that this Government will not use its powers to the full? The  chairman  of the National Register Board no doubt will be a military officer and as such he would not be concerned about the opinions of the elected representatives of the people in Parliament. That board may delegate its powers to certain military gentlemen. We know exactly to what the unfortunate citizens would then be subjected. </para><para>The Minister said by way of interjection to the honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan)</inline> that it was not the intention of the Government to introduce conscription or to use this measure for that purpose.

                        </para>
                    </quote><para class="block">The Minister told the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini),</inline> " That is only to bridge over the gap from IS to 21 years, when they would ordinarily become enrolled and information concerning the change of address would become available to the Department." The Minister also said " This register will not be for the purpose of getting information in order to introduce conscription; it is designed to assist in organizing industry". I wish the Minister could indicate to honorable members in what trade or calling he considers that a youth of eighteen could be skilled. Why, most youths of that age are only starting to learn a trade and do not become skilled until they are much older. If the bill were only for the purpose of organizing industry, there would be no need to begin the registration of men at the tender agc of eighteen. But it is " not. The eighteen-year-olds constitute the first class to be called up in a conscript army. The people and honorable members themselves, therefore, should have no hesitation in concluding what is behind the introduction of this measure. The Minister will have great, difficulty in explaining, if this bill is only for the purpose of organizing industry, why it is necessary to have a check on the youths of from 18 to 21 years of age, because  he must admit that few of them would possess any skill in their trades or occupations. How can the Government expect to succeed with a measure, the purpose of which is industrial and military conscription? In spite of their protestations about not supporting the policy of conscription, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> and his colleagues recognize that a great section of the community is suspicious of this Government. Experience of its inept handling of problems gives the community every right to mistrust the Administration. If the Government believes that the workers would not voluntarily supply information to be placed on a national register, how does it expect to obtain it compulsorily against the opposition of the general community? Cbe Minister for Defence cannot point to any speech made by any member of his party in the last election campaign in which an indication was given to the general public that the Government intended to introduce such a measure as this. The Government talks about maintaining respect for democratic institutions. How can there be respect for alleged democratic institutions, when a party elected on a particular policy departs from it immediately it takes control of the treasury bench? This Government has no mandate for this bill. Such a proposal was never placed before the electors or approved by them, and, in my opinion, the true democrats outside this Parliament will be doing1 more to uphold the principle of democracy by preventing this Government from achieving its purpose under this measure than by meekly submitting to it. The workers have effective ways to prevent the Government from imposing its will upon them. The Australian people will not weakly yield to enforcement of the Government's militaristic policy. The Government can drive them to the machines, tie them to the machines if it likes, but it cannot make them use the skill which they possess in operating those machines. The workers of this country would be ready if the occasion arose, voluntarily to defend the country against an invasion-, yet this Government thinks it necessary to introduce compulsion under this measure. I heard on one occasion an eminent gentleman say that if ever the occasion arose when men would not voluntarily defend their country it would be because the time had arrived when the country was no longer worth defending. When the workers are needed to defend this country, they will refuse to allow the continuance of exploitation of themselves and their dependants. Does the Government imagine that they are content to become trained and skilled in the use of arms and use them only when a small, influential coterie in the community demands that they be used? The workers are prepared to defend this country, but do not imagine that they will allow the continuance of the state of affairs that has existed h\ recent years. The workers are not unreasonable when they demand that, whether it be war-time or peace-time, they have the right to live as human beings. They want those who are by reason of age or infirmity, unable to take employment to be provided with sufficient income to enable them to live on a like standard with the rest of the community,. But what is the attitude of this Government with respect to these questions? ThePrime Minister has definitely refused even to .consider an increase of the rate of invalid and old-age pensions; he did not say that that was because of any financial difficulties confronting the Government. In reply to a question which I asked, he said that the Government would not even consider an increase of the rate of pension. The right honorable gentleman told the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> that he was not prepared to do anything to assist the unemployed. Yet he appealed to the people'ssporting spirit. The people of this country, he said, had an inherent sportingspirit and because of that he appealed tothem. We do not want weak, sentimental appeals from a supine Prime Minister. What the workers want, and will demand when they are strong enough to do so, issocial justice. Why should the children of the workers have inflicted on them such  misery and degradation as exists in Australia to-day? What has this Government done in the way of national planning toend that? The people in New South Wales are pleading with the State and the Commonwealth Governments for funds toenable the heating of schools so that children may receive their education in comfort; an appeal came from Melbourne for a few thousands of pounds for the supply of milk to needy children, but the Commonwealth Government said that it had no funds available for that purpose. </para><continue><talk.start>

This Government has appealed for the co-operation of the general community, but unless it can prove that it is prepared to give to the people something more than has been their lot for many years, it cannot expect that co-operation. This Government has lost the confidence and support of the people. Every by-election that has been decided in recent months has been lost by the Government, and with a few more by-elections we should have a .change of government. It has lost seats which were formerly strongholds of the United Australia party, proving conclusively that the Government's policy is not approved by the people. The Government sent the Prime Minister to Wilmot. </para>

                            <para>- As a member of the Labour party, I am convinced that this Government is out to impose industrial and military conscription on the people and that this measure is as much a part of its plan as was the last measure passed by this chamber. The Government uses high-sounding titles. The last hill was entitled " A bill to establish a department of Supply and Development ". This bill is " A hill for an act for the establishment of a national register ". They are complementary measures and are part and parcel of the Government's policy to inflict conscription on the people. I 'hope that the Opposition will not be carried away by the weak arguments of the Government supporters, who say " Oh, yes, but members of the Labour party have expressed themselves as approving of some form of national survey". The Labour party has a definite policy with respect to the marshalling of the resources of this country, but not only for the building up of war machines ; it believes that the whole of the resources of the country should be marshalled and organized to end want, misery and degradation. Labour hopes to organize the community in peace as well as in what the Minister describes as times of national emergency. But what does the Government propose? It says " Yes, we shall have national planning ". What does that mean but to give to those who control private industries additional opportunities to exploit the general community, and give to the workers nothing more than the right to serve when the master says that they must serve. </para>

Several amendments are essential, because the schedule is not sufficiently comprehensive to enable the Government to obtain fill the information it may require. If provision be not now made for all that may bc required the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of any additions to the questions in the schedule because the scope of the census should not be extended merely at the will of the executive. </para>

                            <para>- There is still opportunity to amend the hill in that respect. Surely the honorable member for East Sydney will not suggest that political considerations were of any consequence during the Great War, because men of all classes willingly volunteered for service in the interests of the nation. If we should ever have to fight for our existence, and retention of the privileges which we now enjoy, all sections should shoulder the responsibility. Any man who is not prepared to fight for his country does not deserve the liberty which he enjoys. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.']</inline> I remind the honorable member for East Sydney, who referred to the fact that a number of loans raised recently for defence purposes were under-subscribed, that in 1915 I suggested that contributions to war loans should be compulsory, that the rate of interest should be low and that subscriptions to the loan .should be on the basis of income. During the world war a grave mistake was made, both in Australia and in Great Britain, by neglecting to provide for compulsory subscription to war loans. I and many others' mortgaged our homes to raise money for investment in war loans, whilst others who refused to contribute received 10 per cent., 15 per cent., and even 20 per cent, on other investments. When a final adjustment was made under a conversion loan, those who had contributed to war loans had to accept a reduction of interest, whilst those who had not subscribed one penny in that way were allowed to retain the huge profits made from other investments. I intend to support the amendment which the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> has foreshadowed - that a wealth census also shall be taken. If the Government should oppose such an amendment it will rightly be charged with introducing the bill with the sole object of securing particulars of Australia's man-power, regardless of the wealth resources of the nation. Every preparation must be made for the protection of this country, because should Great Britain be involved in war, Australia will have to defend itself. The honorable member for Perth cited a statement made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> and published in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times,</inline> in which he outlined the defence policy of the Labour party. Strangely enough, it embodies exactly what the Government proposes to ' do under this bill. On the 7th. December, the Leader of the Opposition also said - </para>

                    <para class="block">The strongest opposition to this measure is coming, not from the members of the Labour party in this chamber, but from the trade union movement. It is difficult to understand why the Opposition should be opposed to the Government obtaining information that will 'be of vital interest to Australia in an emergency. The honorable member for Perth quoted a statement made by the Leader of the Opposition recommending the policy contained in this hill. The paragraph I quoted is to the same effect. Why then does the Labour party oppose the measure? The Government should introduce universal military training. Should this country be invaded, the Government would, under the present system, be compelled to send untrained men into the firing line, whereas if universal military training were in force a comparatively large number of trained men would be available for active service.. It would be criminal to ask un trained men to attempt to resist an invading army of trained soldiers. I know from experience that universal training is strongly favoured by many young men. My own sons, and others with whom I have conversed, said that they enjoyed it, and were sorry when it was suspended. Under such a system all classes share the responsibility and it tends to create a fraternal feeling among the lads. I am afraid that propaganda is being used against this measure merely to embarrass the Government, and not because of what the bill contains. I support the bill, and hope that it will meet with the approval of a majority of honorable members. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not agree with the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> that propaganda is being used against this measure merely in order to embarrass the Government. Surely the ' honorable member is aware that the members of the Labour party, and those whom they represent, are always anxious to do their utmost to ensure the effective defence of Australia, but they are opposed to compulsion. Having perused the bill very carefully, I cannot understand why it has been introduced, particularly as Australia does not appear to be in any danger. As the information supplied to this House, and the news from abroad, do not suggest that there is any possibility of this country being attacked, it is difficult to understand why the Government should insist on the passage of a bill providing for the compulsory registration of Australia's manhood. The Minister denied that registration is for economic purposes. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but the workers sent me to this Parliament. The bill is undemocratic. During the Great "War, when Great Britain required assistance, hundreds of thousands of Australians volunteered for service overseas and fought in Turkey, France, Palestine, and other countries. If there was no need for conscription then, compulsion cannot be justified to-day. Boys of eighteen years of age are to be compelled to register, not with the object of placing them in industry, but in order that they may be compelled to assist in the defence of this country. This Government has no plan for the absorption in industry of our unemployed youths; but it is quite prepared to conscript them for national service in a time of emergency. I have no doubt that the bill now before the House marks the first step towards the introduction of compulsory military training for all youths between the ages of IS and 21 years. </para>

                            <para>- That is not so. In a speech at Deloraine during the Wilmot by-election campaign the Premier of Tasmania said that he supported the defence, policy laid down by the conference of representatives of the Australian Labour party at Canberra. My reply to the honorable member for Barker is that the electors of Wilmot returned a Labour candidate. Under this bill, the Government proposes to keep a check on the movement of youths from one State to another and from one town to another, but it is not prepared to do anything to find jobs for them. I compliment the honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan)</inline> upon having pointed out passages in the Minister's second-reading speech which prove beyond reasonable doubt that the sole purpose of this bill is to conscript the unskilled workers of this country. I stand firmly behind those unfortunate* young men in this country who, through economic circumstances, have been robbed of an opportunity to learn a trade, and I shall do everything in my power to give them a fair measure of the good things of this life. I shall go out into the highways and the byways and tell the unskilled workers that in the opinion of the Government they are only fit for cannon fodder, and that they alone will have to bear arms for the defence of their country. What of the sons of the wealthy classes in this community? Will they have to shoulder a rifle and defend their country against an aggressor? Not at all; they will be classed as skilled persons or placed in the category of the professional men. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. I have always opposed the ideals of the totalitarian States; I believe in democracy and the freedom of the workers. Even the Prime Minister has said thai; he believes that every man should have the right to say whether or not he should share in the defence of this country. The right honorable gentleman said that if the people are opposed to the compulsory registration of the man-power of this country his Government may as well "give up the ghost ". I remind the right honorable gentleman that the ghost of conscription is walking. The method of conscripting the workers which the Government is endeavouring to foist upon the people today is no different from that which the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> when war-time Prime Minister of Australia, endeavoured to foist upon the people in  1916.  It will meet the same fate. If the Government is anxious to provide adequately for the defence of this country it should endeavour under a five years' plan to raise a standing army of  50,000  trained men. The Minister shakes his head. What is wrong with that suggestion? I know very well that he will ask who is to pay for it. Why should not the wealthy people in the community pay for the protection which such a standing army alone could afford? That suggestion does not meet with the approval of the Government, because the cost of a standing army would mean the imposition of additional taxes on the wealthy friends of the Government, who live in the luxurious suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne. The Government is not prepared to conscript the wealth of this country for defence purposes, because its very existence in office depends upon the support of wealthy people. We should have a highly-trained and mechanized army of between  50,000  and  60,000  men. </para>

                            <para>- I am endeavouring to submit a method of providing for the defence of this country. Honorable members opposite, with tongue in cheek, lave said that they support the system of voluntary ' enlistment, but, at the same time, they raise no objection to this national register of man-power. They have also said that no government has a constitutional right to compel Australian citizens to serve outside of this country. It has often been stated by the Minister that the Navy is our first line of defence. Is it denied that the men of the Navy will be the first to be sent outside Australia in the event of the outbreak of war in which the Empire is involved? The mothers of this country should be told that if they bring sons into the world who through no fault of their own are denied an opportunity to acquire skill in a trade, the Government will regard these young men merely as cannon fodder. Is it fair that certain people classed as being employed in key industries should escape liability for service in the event of an emergency, whilst unskilled workers are to be conscripted? What is wrong with the present militia system ? Although the response to the recent appeal for volunteers has been very generous, I understand that the system is to be abandoned because of pressure 'brought upon the Government by its wealthy supporters. </para>

I submitted to' the House some time ago a plan for the employment of workless youths, and was told by the responsible Minister of the day that the employment of youths was the responsibility not of the Commonwealth, but of the States. </para>

                            <para>- That shows the state of mind to which these unfortunate youths are reduced. There is nothing in this bill to provide for the absorption of boys in industrial enterprises. When the history of this country is written no one shall be able to say that I helped to fasten conscription upon our youths. The former Prime Minister, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons,</inline> in a broadcast speech only a few days prior to his death, said that foreign capital was available for investment in this country. I understand that foreign capitalists have told the Commonwealth Government that conscription of the man-power of this country must be introduced in order to protect their substantial investments here in a time of emergency. If that is true, we should be much better off if foreign capital were kept out of Australia. This country should be able to finance its defence requirements through the Commonwealth Bank. When a Labour government is in office that, will be done. All necessary developmental works and defence measures will be (financed through the Commonwealth Bank, and a Labour Government will see that Australia's youths have equality of opportunity for employment in this great country. </para>

                    <para>The Minister has said that conscription of private wealth is not necessary for defence purposes. The Premier of Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ogilvie,</inline> has said that he would not support the proposed compulsory registration of the man-power of Australia unless plans were also made for the registration of our wealth resources. That is Labour's policy. We believe that the wealthy people of this country - the idle rich who ride in their costly limousines to such luxurious places of entertainment as, say, the 40 Club - must be made to disgorge their wealth in the interests of the defence of Australia. If the Government is sincere in its expressed desire for equality of sacrifice, provision must be made for compulsory registration of the nation's private wealth. Why should anybody be ashamed to have his wealth resources registered by the Government in case of national emergency? </para>

                            <para>- There may be something in what the honorable member for East Sydney has said. It is well known that the principal subscribers to defence loans are wealthy people, who invest in order to secure a high rate of interest. If the interest return is not good enough, they withhold applications, with the result that the government of the day is obliged to increase the rate of interest. This bill should include provision for the compulsory utilization of wealth, as well as man-power, in a time of emergency. People who subscribe to defence loans continue to draw their interest sometimes for an indefinite period after .the time of emergency has passed. For instance, interest is still being paid on loans raised over twenty years ago in connexion with the Great War, whereas the Commonwealth's liability in respect of the worker who enlisted ceased, in many cases, when the soldier gave his life for his country. If the Government wishes to conscript the man-power of this country for use in time of war, it should also say to its wealthy supporters, who contribute to its election funds, "You must be willing to give your wealth in a national emergency, at a reasonable rate of interest for the period only of the war ". There can be no adequate compensation for the loss of a life&gt; because human life cannot be assessed in terms of money. </para>

                    <para>The bill contains simple but wellconcealed provisions by virtue of which the Government will be able to maintain its hold over the people of Australia. We have been, told that the Government wishes to take the unemployed from the street corners and make men of them. To do that, it is not necessary to conscript them. When the need arises, the  nien of this country will offer their services freely, as they did during the Great War, and they will do all that may be required of them. Compulsion is abhorrent to all true Australians. One could imagine that this measure had been conceived in the military cockpits of totalitarian states. Clearly, it has been inspired by those arch-traitors of democracy in England, who are working hand in hand with Hitler and the other dictators. International armaments manufacturers and financiers, who sponsor legislation such as this, have by their scientific methods of plunder extracted millions of pounds from the working classes of all countries. The plan for conscription provided for in this measure has been adopted by totalitarian states in Europe and elsewhere. Many months ago the Government allowed the people to become alarmed at the prospect of an early world war, clearly with the intention to introduce conscription, notwithstanding that it is unable to provide uniforms and equipment for militia recruits obtained under the voluntary system. The Government should take over all essential clothing factories and thus make sure that sufficient equipment is made available to men who have voluntarily offered their services for the defence of Australia. But the Minister is not courageous enough to do that. Under this bill, my boy and other Australian lads must be registered when they attain the age of eighteen years. It is all very well for Government supporters to claim that by opposing this measure, the Labour party is adopting obstruction tactics for the purpose of hindering the Ministry in carrying out its defence programme. I assure the Minister that that is not the* case. The questionnaire to be submitted to the people is iniquitous. It requires the person registering to state his mother's name, his father's name, where he was born, and so on. A man might be unable to furnish the name of his father, but he could make a good soldier. Such a question is an insult to Australian citizens. The Assistant Minister for Supply and Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> is regarded as the big man of the future in the Cabinet. Apparently, he is the man who is going to blast the workers into submission. I submit that all the information which will be sought under this bill in connexion with unemployment could be obtained from the State governments. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. The taxpayers of Australia will be called upon to foot the colossal bill which this Government is incurring in the name of defence. The Ministers are holding on to office as long as possible by claiming that the country is in danger and so fostering a psychology of fear. If what I am saying is not true and if real danger exists, I challenge the Minister to assume immediate control of all essential industries. I would support legislation to that end. By introducing legislation such as this in order to put shackles on the workers, the Government shows itself in its true colours. The truth is that the country is becoming too democratic for this reactionary Tory Government, which sees the possibility of grave industrial upheaval unless the workers be suppressed. The workers in all countries are demanding peace. That this is the view of the great majority of Australian people was evidenced by the huge attendance at a peace gathering held in. Melbourne about a week ago, at which the Prime Minister was present. But in spite of this, the Commonwealth Government is preparing for war. </para>

Walking the streets of the city of Melbourne are scores and scores of college-educated boya with leaving certificates, who are unable to find work. Let the Government provide those boys with jobs ;ind give them something to fight for, and there will be no need to compel them to defend their country.

                            <para>- Of course they should. They should remain at school until they are placed in industry. I do not understand how the Government can expect to get away with this measure, which will bring about its downfall yet. The workers, the trade unions, and private citizens by the thousand have asked me to do everything in my power to oppose the introduction of conscription. They do not want their 'boys to be placed under the control of the swashbuckling military officers, to whom they will he handed over if this Government has its way. God forbid that my son should ever be left to the mercy of some of the military officers in the barracks at Hobart! If honorable members want to know why I am opposed to conscription, I shall tell them a story of what I know of some of those men. </para>

                            <para>- Surely I shall be permitted to state my objections to the introduction of compulsory military service. The Government evidently proposes to take these youths for training at an age when they require the greatest care and attention from their parents. It is at that age that youths become either good citizens or useless, and they will not be helped to become good citizens if they are left at the mercy of the military machine. We know that there would be grave danger of their suffering moral and spiritual injury. Whenever compulsory military training has been introduced, moral standards have deteriorated. The bill provides that if youths do not register they will be fined. The Government proposes to make little criminals of them under a new military code. I have travelled widely in Australia, and have spoken to thousands of men on this subject of the defence of Australia, and never once has a man said to me that it would be necessary to compel him to defend his country. I have asked them whether I could quote them as saying that, and they told me that I could. I have discussed this matter with some of the most radical men in the labour movement, and without exception they have all stated that they were ready to defend Australia under a system of voluntary enlistment, but that they will not support conscription. Members of the Government accuse the Opposition, of being opposed to the adequate defence of Australia, hut that is untrue. We favour adequate defence measures, but we are opposed to this bill because we know it to be a thinly disguised attempt to introduce compulsory military training. I have been authorized by the workers to use every means in my power to oppose this measure, and to appose compulsory training. All those who are opposed to the totalitarian system of government, with its brutal destruction of individual liberty, must necessarily be opposed to this measure. This proposal is directly opposed to the interests of the workers. It is a blow at their most cherished liberties. It is a proposal to hand the people over to the military caste. Under the guise of a simple, inoffensive hill for a national register, the Government is seeking to pave the way for the introduction of conscription. The workers will not be deceived, however. They recognize it for what it is - an attempt to impose totalitarian government upon Australia, and to rivet the shackles of conscription on the wrists of the workers. I oppose the bill. </para>

                <para>I shall take the first two of those propositions together. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Street),</inline> in introducing the bill, quoted from a speech made by himself last December, in which he referred to a speech delivered by the late Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lyons)</inline> some time prior to that date as manifesting the snail-like celerity with which this Government is dealing with this extraordinary " time of emergency." He said - </para>

                <para>I have taken leave to say before that we have lived in a curious succession of emergencies for many months past. Even the last elections were conducted in an atmosphere of emergency. These fireworks seem to have been operated by somewhat dampened powder, and government crackers are now quoted at about two a penny in the matter of emergencies. If I may be allowed just a passing reference to the question of emergencies with which we are still dealing in this bill, I note that we are so far restored to normal that the Government is liable to switch off at a moment's notice to, say, a fight for office, or the reconstruction of the remnants of national insurance, or the Sydney General Post Office contract, or margarine versus butter, or matters of that kind which are dull in the emergency market. My first point is that from, and including, the last elections the evidence is that the attempts of the Government to create and foster war hysteria are a record of failure and futility. I should not be permitted, I am sure, to go into details of history to justify that statement, but I may properly refer to them in general terms. As far back as the last general elections, on. an appeal to the people of the Commonwealth for the election of a Senate on the ground claimed by the Government that we were living in a time of great international unrest and that stable government was required, the overwhelming vote of the people was against the Government. In all of the by-elections since held the vote has gone against the Government, and, in addition, in the 1937 election the then Minister for Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Archdale</inline> Parkhill, the head and front of the militarist propaganda, was himself defeated, together with a number of other members in another place who were active in imperialist propaganda. These facts to an individual in normal times would not, perhaps, have been peculiarly significant. There has been a general progress on the part of the Opposition and the Labour party, hut I should not claim, in normal times, that it was significantly great. </para>

                        <para>- As claimed by the Government, certainly the times are not normal ; they have been made abnormal by this Government. And having regard to the fact that the appeal has been in each of these cases to the patriotism of the people on the basis of a national emergency, and to the fact which was well stated by the honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahoney),</inline> and which, I think, will be acknowledged by all - that in an emergency the people of Australia may 'be absolutely relied upon to come to the service of this country - we can only rightly conclude that the people have not believed the Government. They have rejected its advice. They have turned it down on this question of international danger. There is no evidence anywhere that the country has accepted the judgment of the Government that there is a call for drastic militarist propaganda and action such as is involved in this bill. The dispassionate observer, therefore, must accept as true that the Government has no mandate for the continuation of intense militarist propaganda, and, further, that the electorate is unimpressed by every effort that the Government has made up to this time in that direction. Referring to his speech in December last, the Minister said - </para>

That act of chivalry on the part of the Minister is entirely worthy of himself and of the Government, and I am sure a vote of thanks will be duly accorded him by the representatives of ladies' organizations with which he is in great favour. The fact that the Minister declared there is to be no compulsion put upon the ladies to organize is a pretty broad hint that compulsion is to be put upon the men. That is the natural inference which we draw from the fact that no compulsion is to be put upon the ladies.

                    <para>Mi-. BRENNAN.- I am sure that he is one of the vast army who  Will  read my remarks if they have been unfortunate not to be present to hear them. But this afternoon - and in some degree this applies also to the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> - the honorable member for Swan said that so far from favouring conscription for overseas military service, he would be favorable to having a law passed to prevent it.  He probably meant an amendment of the Constitution, because there is an existing law which prevents conscription for overseas service. The honorable member for Perth is also opposed to it. So are they all, " who, you all know, are honorable men ", opposed to conscription for service overseas. I was so interested in the psychological development of the honorable member for Swan that I asked him politely, " Since when has this change taken place?"  His  response was a display of petulance which, however, in characteristic style, I heartily forgive. I repeat the question: Since when have these gentlemen ceased to be compulsionists for overseas service? There may be something in the fact that both the honorable member for Perth and the honorable member for Swan come from Western Australia, for that State was a hotbed of conscription during the war. It remained conscriptionist to the last. The honorable member for Perth, who, on the warfront of home service, spoke eloquently and persuasively in favour of conscription, now declares that, in no circumstances, would he favour compulsory service for overseas. I have great respect for these honorable gentlemen, but, in the light of history, I cannot accept their word with regard to conscription for overseas service. My experience has been too bitter. We greybeards, or baldheads, as the case may be, have been through too much ; we remember, but we do not trust. That is my answer to the honorable member for Swan. I think that these gentlemen are like the character in <inline font-style="italic">Hamlet</inline> of whom it was said, " the lady protests too much, methinks ". </para>

                            <para>- The Minister may . think that I am wrong, but I remember the conferenceto which I am referring. 1 do not remember any conference between the Commonwealth and the States at which a firm basis for cooperation between them for the purpose of  defence, was ever established, but I do remember a conference at which the right honorable member for Cowper submitted a thoughtful scheme of works and development which received but scant courtesy at the hands of those present. My recollection of it is that the representatives of each State made a bold bid for as much money as they could get for public works to provide work for the unemployed. On that occasion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stevens,</inline> the Premier of New South Wales, propounded the new doctrine that, by means of a fiduciary issue, money should bo raised to meet the necessities of the unemployed. </para>

The address of the Minister - and this applies to most of the speeches by honorable gentlemen supporting the Government - contained frequent references to manpower and war material. For example, the Minister said - </para>

                        <para>The object of setting up an organization to register the man-power of the nation is to ensure that, as far as possible, every man shall be allocated to the task for which his training and avocation best fit him, so that the utmost value in service will be available to the nation to meet an emergency. </para>

                    <para>What strikes me about this debate is the curious attitude of the Minister at the table - whoever he may be - how objectively he refers to the "masses of mankind ". For instance, the Minister for Defence spoke of mankind as cattle apart, or material apart. He looks at mankind all the time from the outside. When he speaks of organizing man-power he does not say ".We shall organize ourselves", or that "I, this Minister, and you, the members of this Parliament, and all of us human beings shall do certain things ". Instead, looking at the mass of mankind. - the cattle which are to be operated upon - and regarding mankind objectively, he says "We must organize this man-power, and this material, for the defence of the country." But when it comes to saying in whose defence they are to be organized, he finds that that is a vastly different thing. We find that the organizing of man-power - these cattle and this material - is entirely designed for the protection and maintenance of the material goods possessed almost exclusively by those gentlemen who speak so glibly about " the defence of this country " when they mean the defence of themselves and their possessions. The masses are to he organized in their interests. They see things from the point of view of a bullock-driver in charge of a team of bullocks. When they say that men shall be allocated to the task for which they are best suited, they say, in effect : " We shall put Ginger in the lead, and Baldy in the pole near the load, and Rough-neck in the middle ". The Minister is the picturesque gentleman who wields the whip with the long handle and the impressive lash for the purpose of organizing the man-power and the material in the load in the interests of this country, "which country we are," as the oath taken toy every juryman puts it. At one stage during the Minister's speech, the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> asked : " Is this an economic or a defence measure ? " The Minister replied guardedly - if I do not quote him exactly he will be able to correct me - " This is a measure which could be employed for the purpose of social betterment or uplift." He did not claim that the main purpose of the bill was the betterment and uplift of the people, the improvement of their social conditions, and their rescue from the mire, but he suggested that in more sympathetic hands it might be so used. </para>

About the third point - " industrial matters " - the honorable member for Perth gave us a little enlightenment when he asked, " What is it but an inquiry as to the men we have and the niche into which we can put them " ? I wonder could political impertinence proceed further than an inquiry as to the niche in which men are to be put. Has the honorable member ever read John Stuart Mill's essay on " Liberty " ? Does he not know the fundamental principles of the human night? Does he know nothing as a lawyer of the basis of British jurisprudence? This is supposed to be a. democracy. The European democracies are endeavouring  to present a combined front against the fascist countries. I assure my honorable friends opposite that my friends in the Opposition know perfectly  well that the dividing line between democracy and fascism as understood by honorable gentlemen opposite is fine. Indeed, they are prepared to step over to the fascist ranks at the slightest hint of opportunities. </para>

                            <para>- I do not accept the honorable member for Barker as a democrat. Neither do I accept Britain and France as democracies. I accept them as capitalist, imperialist countries, whose governments are out of sympathy with the interests of the working class for whom I stand in this Parliament. I am not in the least interested in this Parliament to uphold the interests of capitalist imperialism in any part of the world. I am concerned to protect 60,000 electors and their young families, members of the working class, in the electorate which I represent. In this bill we find no single measure of social uplift, no relief of unemployment, uo intelligent inquiry, indeed, no inquiry as to how men may be best placed. </para>

There is no mention of reproductive or necessary work, nothing of that kind, no employment of the man-power and resources of Australia for the advancement and development of the rising generation, no scheme for the uplift of womanhood. There is only regimentation for the purpose of war against an unknown and an unthreatening enemy, and, incidentally, no time, no money for the creation of better relations with nations, neighbour nations, for example, but all time and all money for war mongering. </para>

                    <para>Finally, my fourth point is that this is unnecessary re-duplication for no purpose which is worth achieving. So far as it represents a census, so far as it represents useful information for the purposes I have mentioned, we already have a Census and Statistics Department employing capable officers and machinery, but the Minister tells us that a further 'band of officers is to he employed in conjunction with that department. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The Census Department is an intelligent compiler of useful information. At any rate, a new department and new employees are to  be  set up. There may  be  some consolation in that 30 or 40 jobs are created for the tens of thousands of people who  aYe  out of work and looking for jobs, but that will  be a  partial and, I fear, futile attempt to deal with the big problem. When these departments are scrapped and these attenuated emergencies have been finally thrown aside and cast into the bin as damaged electoral goods, what is to become of the thousands of people who are now employed in making munitions, in compiling registers, in the abortive national insurance, in the Department of Supply and Development? When all this hysteria has died down will it again  be  the sad fate of a Labour government to inherit the consequences of the misdeeds of its predecessor, and so earn the displeasure of the electors,  as  it -did before in similar circumstances. Because I do not believe that this bill contains any germ of usefulness for the people whom I represent, because Government policy is guided  by  war hysteria and because I feel that this House is wasting time instead of pressing on to do something of real benefit for a disappointed and disillusioned people, because the rising generation is clamouring for employment and opportunity and the adult generation  -  29,000 people in the munitions works alone  - is  struggling to keep its employment or secure other work, and because this Government has neglected opportunities and is serving only personal ambition, I am opposed to the bill. </para>

                        <para>. - I did not intend to intervene in this debate, and I have done so only because of the extraordinary charges made by the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> in particular against the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Street),</inline> but generally against supporters of the Government. The honorable member, placing himself on  a  pedestal, charged the Minister and the Government with  hysteria. He charged us with the faking up of a sham emergency for some reasons unknown to him or unknown to us. I need only remind the honorable gentleman, and honorable members of the House as a whole, that this hysteria with which the honorable member charged us, this state of emergency which we declare, prevails to-day in almost every civilized country. I put it to the honorable gentleman and to. members of the Opposition that the attitude of the honorable member is his alone. "When the honorable gentleman declares that there is no danger to this country at present he not only is alone in this House and in this country, but also is practically alone in all the world. </para>

                            <para>- Well, let us take some of these countries which we know are great peace-loving countries. Let us first consider the United States of America. There 130,000,000 people are in possession of a land the size of Australia. They are safe, one would say, if any people of the world are safe. But what is taking place? They are arming on a scale in peace time that they have never practised before. Why? Because either they read the sign of the. conditions of the world to-day correctly, or the honorable gentleman alone reads them correctly. Why should they bo proceeding to spend hundreds of millions of pounds sterling on purely defensive measures if there be no menace abroad? With their 130,000,000 of people, their great industries, their prodigious engineering works, their infinite man-power are they not incomparably safer than ourselves with our mere 7,000,000 people scattered thinly over the same area? Surely there is something more than hysteria in the policy of this Government with regard to preparedness for war. I tell the honorable member that there is in this bill something more than hysteria, something more than faking up and exploitation of the " cattle " « of this country, as the honorable member for Batman was pleased to term the multitude. Next let us consider France, because, despite the assertions of the honorable member for Batman that France is a capitalist and imperialist state and not a democracy, I venture to say that it is the grandest democracy in the world. </para>

                            <para>- We all know who they are. Let us also consider Holland. Is Holland belligerent? Is it anxious to provoke war? No. If there be one peace-loving nation it is Holland. Yet it is arming up to the last penny that it can afford ; and what of the other countries right through Europe, those little countries like Poland and Roumania ? Is the menace that they believe they are under, the shadow that they believe they live under,, imagination and war mongering? Surely there is something more in it than that. Surely, in spite of what the honorable member for Batman said, there is, as every body knows, a real danger to the people of all of the smaller countries to-day. I believe, the Government believes and its supporters believe that there is a real and near danger for Australia. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Batman made a singularly bad choice when he described the Minister for Defence as a bullock-driver anxious to assemble and drive a team of bullocks. I hope I shall not embarrass the Minister. Everybody knows his war record. Since the war I doubt if any man in this country has given more time and capacity to the development of the militia forces than he. The honorable member for Batman made a singularly bad choice in his somewhat uncharitable - to put it mildly - attack on the Minister. It was unworthy of the honorable gentleman at his best, although it is quite fitting of him at his worst. </para>
                    <para>What would be the position of Australia in the event of a European war? Should Australia be raided or invaded - I do not think that the possibility of invasion is  very great - we should probably lose our United Kingdom markets almost immediately, and there would be an immediate prostration of practically every rural industry in this country. </para>

                            <para>- Fully 50 per cent, of our total production and 95 per cent, of our export of butter goes to the United Kingdom, and 95 pei cent, of our export of frozen and chilled beef, and mutton and lamb is also disposed of in that market. If war should occur, ships might not be available to carry our primary produce to overseas markets, and our rural industries would be in a hopeless position. The excess production over the Australian market would be very heavy, which would mean an immediate fall of prices, and, in fact, the total collapse of prices within Australia. The purchasing power of the people would bc severely restricted, and manufacturing industries would lose at least 50 per cent, of their customers. Moreover, unless we were extraordinarily fortunate, 50 per cent, of our people would be thrown out of employment. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member may say " Ah ", but I am stating the truth. What is the objective of honorable members opposite who say that this country is not menaced? Why are we making determined attempts to defend Australia? It is not to win a war on Australia's shores. Our objective is to build up the defence of this nation, within our financial power and capacity, so that we will appear unattractive to a potential aggressor. A potential enemy always  measures another nation, not by its navy or by its air force, but by its effective man-power. That is the recognized standard by which Australia, would be tested. If we want peace  - such as the honorable member for Batman and the rest of us pray for - our immediate duty is to demonstrate our fighting capacity. This is the first step towards that end. We are indicating to the world that we are moving towards the defence of this country, and surely our first step is to take stock of- our defensive, capacity. " In endeavouring to do so, we should not engage in recreation or in dreaming, but should measure the strength of the forces at our command, and determine how they can be made available in the event of an emergency. If men are to be called to service, we must necessarily have a stocktaking so that we can decide who shall be employed in the manufacture of munitions, in conducting transport, and in all other classes of work other than fighting. To attempt to do that when danger was upon us would result in utter confusion, and it would he impossible to provide that measure of defence to which Australia is entitled. That is all that the Govern ment is endeavouring to do. </para>

                        <para>. - lt would be very interesting to know whether the views of the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> on the international situation and a national register are those of the Labour party. Despite the applause which came from the Opposition while the honorable member was speaking, I do not think that that honorable member expressed the considered views of his colleagues. It was not said that the Government was attempting to create a war hysteria immediately prior to the Munich conference, or when the Germans occupied Czechoslovakia on the 10th March or the Italians marched into Albania a month ago. No one can contend that the European  situation is normal, and that there is no- need to prepare for the defence of Australia. The Leader of .the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> holds an opinion totally different from that of the honorable member for Batman because, on many occasions during the last two years, he has stated very plainly that it is absolutely essential that every preparation must be made for the defence of this country. In explaining the defence policy of the Labour party, the Leader of the Opposition said - ' 1 now present a programme as being Labour's conception of Australia's defence needs and which it will implement as a government. Survey of man-power and woman-power resources (industrial and primary), is essential that the number of men and women able to carry out all forms of work be known. The Labour party believes in organization, not disorganization. It would be fatal to have all the best men called up for active service, leaving industry at a standstill. There should lie an allotment of man-power and woman[lower between services and industry. </para>

                            <para>- Those remarks were made by the Leader of the Opposition only four or five months ago. The Government is endeavouring to do what the Leader of the Opposition proposed. I thought that almost every one believed that we should have an inventory of the man-power resources of this country. Great Britain, Germany and Italy have had similar registers in operation for some time, and it is obvious that we cannot plan the defence of Australia unless we know exactly how many persons we have available, and the work which they are capable of performing. This proposal is not new to the Labour party because, in 1915, when a Labour government was in office, it introduced a bill in which provision was made to take a census almost identical with that now proposed. The policy enunciated by the Leader of the Opposition is similar in most respects to that proposed by the Lyons Government, which is now being sponsored by this Government. There should not be any need to argue as to the necessity for a register of our manpower, because the principle as approved by practically all sections of the community. There may be room for. discussion as to the method by which such an inventory should be obtained, but an effort should be made to secure the greatest goodwill and the maximum of unanimity as to the policy to be adopted. That is why the previous Government originally proposed a voluntary, instead of a compulsory, register such as that now proposed. It was thought that a voluntary register, although not so complete, would be more expeditious. Suggestions were made by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons,</inline> the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> and the then Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> how a voluntary' register would enable us to get this information. An attempt was made to compile a voluntary register, but it was found that the complete co-operation which was looked for and was necessary in the community was not forthcoming. As nothing but a complete register would be of any value, it became necessary to provide for the compilation of a compulsory register. </para>

                            <para>- About a year ago, when an attempt was made to secure the co-operation of the great trade unions of this country for this purpose, the Leader of the Opposition said that in his opinion the method proposed was a good way to approach the matter. We all remember how the trade union leaders refused to co-operate with the Government on that occasion. An attempt was also made to secure the fullest degree of co-operation of employers, but it was found that, owing to the lack of complete co-operation, the whole field could not be covered. That being so, it seems to me that the bill now before the House presents the only possible means of obtaining this very necessary inventory of the man-power of the Commonwealth. I am sure that no patriotic or sane person in Australia believes that such an inventory should not be compiled. </para>

                            <para>- I do not agree with the honorable member. In these circumstances I believe that we should make arrangements for the taking of a  compulsory  register. If the principle  is agreed to, then we must do one of two things; we must either do what is proposed in this bill, that is, take a special partial census of the people of Australia between the ages of  18  and  65  years to enable us to know exactly what they are doing, or we must have a complete census of the whole of the people of Australia, including in the questionnaire the questions which appear in the schedule to the billnow before the House. This bill represents, in my view, an attempt to implement the decision of a previous government to compile the information necessary in a way that will he most satisfactory to the people generally. It represents an attempt to secure the goodwill of every section . and class of the people ofth is country. The bona fides of the Government are shown by the inclusion in the bill of a schedule which indicates the details that will he required, and by the undertaking given by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Street)</inline> that he will accept an amendment to the bill to provide that the terms of the document to be submitted to the people may he altered only by the consent of the Parliament. Could any faireror better attempt be made to secure the goodwill and trust of the people of Australia than is represented by the hill now before the House? Although the Leader of the Opposition agrees that the compiling of this register is inevitable and necessary, individual members of his party do not hold that view. </para>

The taking of a partial census of the, people such as is envisaged in this bill is absolutely necessary in the public interest in order to determine the manpower resources of this country. As I have said, if the bill is thrown out, there is no alternative but to take a complete census of the people to include the questions contained in the schedule to this bill. The Government has power under the Census and Statistics Act  1905-1938  to take a. complete census of all citizens and to put any questions it wishes to the people.

It. has been suggested that the mere fact that provision has been made in the bill to ensure the return of census cards must necessarily mean the preliminary to conscription. I give that  the  lie direct. In regard to the general question of conscription for war purposes or for service overseas, a very definite undertaking for the life of this Parliament was given by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons,</inline> a former Prime Minister, the Leader of the United Australia  party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> and myself, as Leader of the Country party, that no Australian shall be conscripted for overseas service. </para>

                    <para>If there is much objection to the bill in its present form by certain sections of the people - and in my opinion every measure for the defence of this country should have the backing of all sections of the community - I suggest that the only alternative left open to the Government is to take a complete census of the people. All that would be required to do this without delay would be to advance the normal time for the taking of a census by a year. This course is worthy of consideration because it would result in the saving of approximately £150,000. It seems to me that the questions proposed in the schedule to this bill could be printed on a form of a different colour from that on which the general questions- are asked, so that the information' obtained on these particulars could be immediately collated by the census office. Even if this course meant a delay of six months in the compilation of the information, it would be worth while if it had the virtue of overcoming objections which might be raised to the present proposal. This matter should be determined irrespective of party politics. I see no objection to the alteration of the year for the holding of the census because it will be remembered that, for reasons of economy, the taking of the last census was deferred from 1931 to 1933. In my opinion, we should coinpile this national register immediately. My only reason for suggesting a wider census of the people is that by that means we  may be able to get unanimity of opinion and overcome any objections to the method proposed in this bill. I urge the House to pass the bill as it stands. </para>

                        <para>. - I have listened very attentively to speeches for and against this measure, and I have been struck by the complete lack of reasonable argument against it. I cite to honorable members some of the irrelevancies which the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> had to introduce into his speech in order to make even a reasonable contribution in opposition to the measure. The honorable gentleman touched upon the fiduciary issue, the desirability of authorizing <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to record <inline font-style="italic">"Laughter"</inline> at suitable passages of honorable members' speeches in . order to indicate that some statements are not meant to be taken seriously. He talked about ladies who protest too much, and. then went on to give us a long dissertation about bullocks and bullockdrivers. I suggest that when a parliamentarian of the experience of the honorable member for Batman has to resort to such extraneous matters in the debate on a bill for the compilation of a national register, there is very little real argument against it. After condemning the measure the honorable member said that its adoption would lead to useless duplication of information which is collected under the Census and Statistics </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Act and our electoral procedure. He also declared that it would lead to all sorts of evils. </para>
                    <para>Opposition members originally objected that the bill would pave the way to conscription for service overseas. "When they found that that argument would not stand examination, that existing laws effectively prevented conscription of manpower for service overseas without the consent of the people, they changed their ground and urged that this measure was the forerunner of industrial conscription. This term " industrial conscription " has been heard very often in this House during the debate. I should like from honorable members who used it some explanation of its meaning. In my opinion it is only one of the many catch-cries which are coined to appeal to an unthinking public. There is really no such thing as industrial conscription. But if these words can be construed to mean what honorable members opposite have in mind when they speak of conscription in industry, I suggest that we have, at the present time in labour organizations, a milch more rigid form of industrial conscription than that which will be brought about by the carrying of this measure. </para>
                    <para>I congratulate the Government on the introduction of the bill. I have long advocated the principles contained in it. I was opposed to the system of voluntary registration. World conditions being what they are, there is ample evidence of a fear among the people of all countries that their man-power will be called upon to resist aggression. We should be absolutely stupid if we followed the lead set by honorable members opposite and allowed the tabulation of information relating to our man-power and resources to be left until a time of emergency was upon us. There is no ulterior motive behind the bill, as has been suggested by the Opposition. .Should an emergency arise . we should be able, without delay, to put the right men into key positions in the defence of this country. I am supporting this measure because I believe that all the necessary information should be tabulated so that* in a national crisis, it may be used without delay. Listening to speeches -made by honorable members opposite, one would be inclined to think that only the working people of this country were to be circularized and listed under this legislation. I point out that supporters of the Government throughout Australia - obviously from evidence produced at elections they ari in greater numbers than supporters of the Opposition - would also be required to fill in the proposed form. Therefore, the bill does not single out any particular section of the community. Many of the working class - those who support honorable members opposite - have for very many years advocated a measure such as this. This evening we had evidence that even the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> has been in favour of it. </para>

                            <para>- My statement is based on evidence which has been produced in this House. According to a quotation read by an honorable member this evening, the Leader of the Opposition has, in the not distant past, advocated something on the lines of what is provided for in this bill. I can see nothing wrong with the information which is to be sought by the questionnaire provided in this bill, and apparently honorable members opposite can see nothing wrong with it, either.  Evidence of that is to be found in the fact that their only argument now is that the bill will lead to something else. Apparently they are not afraid of the legislation itself, but of what it may lead to, and I have shown that it cannot lead to anything which will not be subject to decision by this Parliament. Until something further is suggested, honorable members opposite should cease to talk about this bogy of industrial conscription, whatever that may mean. </para>

In the Great War there were many instances of people who enlisted for service being given jobs for which they were entirely unfitted, and sometimes there was a considerable delay before others better equipped for the work  were  appointed in their places. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> apparently misconstrues my words. The men to whom I referred were apparently selected at random by senior officers who thought that they looked as if they could do certain work. They might even have been selected in alphabetical order, but they kept the jobs until in some haphazard fashion it was found that it was not being done satisfactorily, and then the senior officers set about finding others more suitable to do it. In that way valuable time was wasted. The compilation of a register such as that provided for in this bill would eliminate the possibility of such inefficiency and waste of time. Australia cannot afford to wait until an emergency arises before all the necessary knowledge is tabulated. The honorable member for. Batman said that the people of Australia could bc relied upon to come to the defence of the country willingly in time of emergency. I ask honorable members to note that statement particularly. Apparently r.he honorable gentleman believes that should Australia be attacked, all citizens of the Commonwealth should place their resources at the disposal of the nation. That is what is advocated by honorable members on this side, but whereas our desire is to utilize all citizens in the most efficient manner in time of emergency, the honorable member for Batman and other members of the Opposition would wait until a crisis arose before taking any action. Surely honorable members will agree that that is not the right procedure. Arguments against this bill are being advanced by honorable members opposite merely because they are in opposition, whose duty it is generally believed is to oppose. Their arguments haveconvinced me that in their hearts they know that the bill is a sound one. I would go further than the provisions of this bill, and, as has been advocated from Opposition benches, I would make a very complete census of wealth, productivity, transport, and other resources. I know that many of these things are at present being investigated, and that much valuable information has been gathered. I would, however, include in this bill provision for the collection of all information needed for the defence of this country. </para>

I was struck by a. statement in that article that soon after the conclusion of the last war the German authorities set about tabulating all the information envisaged by this bill, and most of that suggested by other honorable members in the course of the debate. All of that vital information is now in the official records of the German Government. </para>

                            <para>- Not for a moment. But I suggest to the honorable member foi- West Sydney that when there are aggressive nations in the world, Australia cannot afford to sit back and say " We are not going to fight. Please d«i not come near us ". That was tried by Abyssinia, China and other countries, and the result is known to all of us. As a good Australian, I want this country to be in such a position that any nation which might contemplate invasion would realize that having had all our resources tabulated for defence purposes, our successful invasion  would  be fraught with extreme danger to the invader.. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline></para>

                        <para>. - I oppose this bill. Very little good will be done by obtaining the particulars which the Government desires. A few minutes ago the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Henry Gullett)</inline> spoke of planning for national security and the necessity for tabulating man-power in order to learn how it might be applied to industry. Honorable members on this side believe that if the Government is anxious to secure information for this purpose, it should be anxious also to conserve Australia's man-power; but such is not the case. No greater condemnation of the Government has been offered than the departure from this country during the last few months of hundreds of skilled artisans, who have gone to New Zealand to seek permanent employment. They are representative of the best of our manhood. If man-power is necessary for defence, the Government should provide employment, instead of which it is discouraging men who are asking for work. When the Government decided to carry out new defence works, hundreds of applications for employment on government works were made to me and to other honorable members; but the Government tells  us that there is no employment offering. If the country is to be defended, it should be made worth defending by ensuring economic security for its citizens after they reach the agc of eighteen years. Many of them now live in economic terror. Men with families know not what to-morrow holds in store for them. A different state of affairs exists in other parts of the world. Canada is carrying out a policy of training artisans for skilled occupations, so that there is no necessity for its young men to seek work in other countries. The direct opposite is the case in Australia. The Government is encouraging the entry of foreign migrants, many of whom cannot even speak English. A businessman told me only last week that when he advertised for an employee the first fourteen applicants for the position were foreigners who had arrived recently. He was astounded at the number of applicants who called on him during the day. It is appalling that men should be brought to the country believing that there are plenty of opportunities for employment, while some of the flower of our manhood are being forced to leave. Any scheme of economic planning should be designed to protect and  benefit  the very people who are leaving our shores. If the Government would only guard the welfare of its people, there would be little fear of their failing to do their duty should an emergency occur. I do not think that, the need will arise in the near future. Much of the alarm that exists has been caused by the Government. Some honorable members have described this measure as a forerunner of conscription. To support this contention, we may refer to what ha3 been done in the past, both in Australia and in other parts of the world. A census of man-power taken in Great Britain recently was followed immediately by conscription. We are told, that conscription was brought about, not so much for the safety of Great Britain itself, as to meet the demands of countries with which it had made treaties. The War Census Bill was introduced in Australia in July, 1915, during the Great War. The opposition to that measure was similar to that which is offered to the present bill. Parliament was told that the War Census Bill was not in any way a forerunner of conscription, but twelve months later the government of the day tried to enforce conscription. The measure was introduced by the then Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> who is again Attorney-General in this Parliament. In his second-reading speech in 1915, he said, amongst other things, " The bill does not contemplate conscription." Those words would appear to be reassuring to Parliament and to the country. He added - </para>

                        Chapman, member for Eden Monaro, said that he had no fear that conscription would be introduced under the measure, but many other members expressed the opinion that it would be a forerunner of conscription. It was definitely pointed out that otherwise it would have no value, because men could not bc allotted to any particular sphere of activity under a voluntary system. Opinion expressed outside Parliament supported that view. It was stated in the press and elsewhere that the bill would lead to both industrial and military conscription. Because honorable members were dubious about supporting the bill,

                    <para>In view of these statements one would have naturally expected that no attempt would be made to force conscription upon the people of this country. We know, however, what happened pursuant to the compilation of the register ,in 1915. Indeed, the speech made by the Minister in opening this debate reminds one of the speech made by his colleague, the Attorney-General, on that occasion. In fact, the two speeches are almost identical except that the Minister's speech includes current topics. </para>

                    <para>The Minister pointed out that such was not the Government's intention, and he proceeded to show how this legislation would be applied in order that every one might be allotted tasks in which his services could best be utilized. Under the War Census Act 1915 similar information was obtained, and tabulated in respect of age groups, single and married men, occupations and so on. It is proposed to tabulate this information in a similar way. What could be the object of the Government in asking for this information if it did not intend to introduce conscription? It could only be applied in connexion with a compulsory service scheme. In view of what happened subsequent to the enactment of the War Census Act in 1915 honorable members to-day are justified in  refusing to accept the word of the Govern* ment as to the purposes for which it requires this information. Denials similar to those , now being expressed by the Minister were given in 1915. The then Attorney-General denied in the plainest language that the Government intended to introduce conscription ; yet only twelve months later he was the leader of a government which endeavoured to force conscription on the people by way of referendum. In view of these facts, one must be wary of any assurances given by the present Government in this respect. Such assurances could not be accepted in 1915, and they cannot be accepted with any greater confidence now. It is significant that national registration was the prelude to the introduction of conscription recently in Great Britain. Our fears in this direction are also justified by the noncommittal attitude adopted by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> who has declined, in answer to numerous questions, to say whether the Government is for or against conscription. The right honorable gentleman has merely replied that a statement will be made on this matter at the appropriate time. Consequently, we are justified in regarding this measure as an instalment of conscription. It is the intention of the Government first, to obtain all of the information it requires, and then to go ahead with the introduction of conscription. I point out that when the attempt to introduce conscription failed " in 1916 the information obtained under the "War Census Act 1915 was never used. As the cost of compiling that register wa3 £150,000, I question the estimate of £40,000 which the Minister has given in respect of this register. I reiterate that this information can be of no value whatever unless the Government intends to introduce conscription. Therefore, it is not an urgent measure. The Government, however, persists in regarding it as such whilst it neglects its responsibility to deal with questions of vital importance to the national and economic welfare of our people. It is a frivolous measure born of war hysteria, and, therefore, futile. Any expense incurred in the compilation of this register will be wasted, because the register might never be used. Certainly it will never be used if the Government does not intend to introduce conscription. This bill represents the introduction of a vicious principle, and 1" say unhesitatingly that the people will not accept it. It provides for heavy penalties, ranging up to imprisonment for six months or a fine of £50, for failure to lodge returns. It is hardly necessary to manufacture additional crimes, because the liberty of our people has already been too greatly restricted. They should not be called upon to make these returns. An important omission from the bill is its failure to provide for a register of wealth, although in 1915 such information was collected. </para>

                    <para class="block">That summarizes the view which this Government takes of this measure. It regards the manhood of this country as war material. It is, indeed, unfortunate that the Government is actuated by hysteria and prefers to deal  with measures of .this kind, whilst neglecting to implement economic and social reforms for the advancement and betterment of the people. If it attended to its duty, it would be more concerned about giving to the people conditions worth fighting for, which would remove all doubt as to whether or not they would be prepared to defend their country. The Government's defence policy is one of sham, show and expense. Daily the people are faced with new economic worries. The Government has much to say concerning what it describes as the major matter of defence, yet only a few months ago we were informed in the press that sufficient text-books were not available for distribution among the members of the militia forces. If this report be true, it is a serious reflection on the Government's sincerity and ability. I do not know whether such books must be imported. </para>

                            <para>- At any rate, it is a disgrace to the Government if they were not available when required. Surely we have military experts here capable of compiling these text-books! In conclusion, I repeat that the Government has failed in its duty to establish any planned economy for the social welfare of our people. It has forced many of our skilled artisans to find employment in other countries. That fact is sufficient to condemn any government. Yet we are told that the Government has inaugurated a plan for the technical training of our youth. Again I point out, by way of warning, that the happenings consequent upon the passage of the "War Census Act in 1915 compel us to view this measure with the greatest apprehension. We must not be satisfied to acceptmerely what the Government says it intends to do, because we shall probably find that another measure will be introduced to impose conscription, as was done in 1916. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline></para>

                        <para>. - Honorable members on this side of the House are opposed to any measure that can be interpreted as likely to lead towards conscription for military purposes and service overseas. The history of the past struggles  in  relation to conscription should be sufficiently well known for honorable members to realize the determination of the Opposition to oppose any measure designed to impose conscription  On  the manhood of Australia. Government supporters may claim that the bill has no such intention. Indeed, Ministers have given certain undertakings in that connexion, and their supporters have contended that those undertakings ought to be accepted by us without question. We must, however, be guided by past happenings, and in this connexion I remind the House that similar declarations were given  in  1915. With all the eloquence at their command, Government supporters of the day denied that the legislation to provide for a war census was the forerunner of conscription. The honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> who was Attorney-General in the Government of the day, declared emphatically that the Government was entirely free from any desire to impose conscription upon the people ; yet, within twelve months of that time, the right honorable gentleman used all the powers that he possessed in an endeavour to force conscription upon Australia. Government supporters should therefore realize that the Opposition believes that its fears are well founded and its attitude to this measure justified. Because we on this side cannot accept the declarations of Government supporters as to the purpose of this measure, we must exercise all the powers that we possess to oppose any measure which is designed to impose, or is capable , of imposing, conscription on the people of this country. In so doing, we are only faithfully discharging what we believe to be our duty. </para>

                    <para>In his opening remarks, the Minister declared that the late Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> had said that certain things were necessary. Those things he enumerated as follows: first, the organization "of man-power and of women's voluntary efforts; secondly, the regulation and control of primary production in an emergency ; thirdly, industrial mobilization of secondary industries in an  emergency; and fourthly, Commonwealth and State co-operation in peace and war. Under those four headings, the right honorable gentleman declared the purpose of the Government and its intention to proceed along the lines indicated. From the stand-point of the Government, that apparently meets their policy, but the Opposition believes that even this declaration lacks one important essential. There is no suggestion that those who enjoy the wealth of this country arc to be' called upon to mobilize their resources in the interests of the nation, or to make any sacrifice for its defence. Labour believes that the wealth of this country arises from the application of man-power to industries, both primary and secondary, including the development of the country's mineral resources. These efforts have resulted in the production of enormous wealth, making possible to a few great comforts and a very high standard of living. In this regard the Labour party is continually striving to bring the standard of the masses more into harmony with that of the wealthier sections of the community, and thus remove the wide disparity in the living conditions of the people. It believes, however, that whenever efforts are directed towards calling upon those people who have done well out of Australia to make some sacrifice, there are influences always at work to prevent such efforts from being successful. If we are to decide .between one man's life and another man's wealth, there can be no question that a man's life is of more value than is all the wealth in the country. Honorable members know that in all ages, whenever wars have been waged, the sacrifice has .been made chiefly by the poorer people. They are called upon to make sacrifices far beyond what ought to be expected of them, whilst others in the community not only make no sacrifice, but even become richer and more prosperous because of war and conflict among the nations of the world. Wo believe that the position should he reversed, and that the first to make sacrifices should be those who have made most out of the country. There is, however, a tendency to regard their possessions as sacrosanct; no one is supposed to interfere in their affairs, or to inquire as to their wealth, their investments, or their income. These things are said to be the individual's own concern, and not matters for the nation to probe into.

                            <para>- But only to h very limited extent. There should be much wider powers of inquiry into these matters of wealth, if our defence programme is to be complete. If the Government desires to make a gesture to the working class its first move must be in the direction I have indicated. Otherwise the people must view with suspicion, doubt and, in fact, opposition, the Government's proposals because they will have at the back of their minds the feeling that the old story will be repeated if a war occurs and that the workers will be the greatest sufferers. We have only to survey the result of the last war to realize that the workers sacrifice all and gain little or nothing in times of conflict. To illustrate my argument, I need only cite the mandates which Australia administers as the result of the peace settlement. Those mandates have been of great value to shipping magnates and the investors in plantations and gold-dredging, but to the workers they have not been worth a snap of the fingers. It is well for the Government and its supporters to appreciate the fact that these things are paramount in the minds of the people, not only the rank and file, but also large circles of people outside their ranks, who, nowadays, are looking at these problems that confront us from the point of view that I have taken. In his second-reading speech the Minister for Defence recalled that he had previously set out, under four headings, the wider steps necessary to implement the declaration by the late Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> of the Government's intention to press on with the completion of plans for all phases of national activity in an emergency.The Labour party's view is that the Minis'ter for Defence omitted the most important step of all when he made no mention of a census of wealth. Consequently, the attitude of the Opposition, particularly that of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> whose references to this matter have been quoted in this debate, is altered. </para>

The Minister went on to refer to other matters which may establish doubt in the minds of many people.

                        <para>The Commerce Department has made considerable progress on the planning necessary for the regulation and control of primary production in emergency. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">I do not know what that means. How much planning has been done? In the last fortnight, the newspapers have reported meetings of farmers in New South Wales to discuss an attempt to boycott financial interests which are fore-, closing on their properties, thus depriving them of their life savings. It looks to me, therefore, that any planning that has been undertaken by the Commerce Department has not led towards putting primary production in a position to meet the demands that an emergency would create. Again I must express my dissatisfaction. It appears to me that the problems of primary production have arisen from a shortage .all along of the financial resources needed to make this country able to meet an emergency. All of this tends to support the view of the Opposition that the Government has not yet laid down a policy of action which would provide for all the needs' that an emergency would create. The solution of the problem lies in a direction other than that ' in which the Government is moving. The " wider steps necessary " are not so much those enumerated by the Minister for Defence as steps in the direction of financial reform. I may not discuss the monetary system on this bill, but it is difficult to divorce it from this important subject. Dictatorship countries seem to be able to proceed to build roads and ships, and to grow all kinds of primary products by handling the monetary system in such a way as to have the work done first and the financing problems are apparently worked out later. </para>

When Herr Hitler decides to build a road from one end of Germany to the other, the work is undertaken without demur or delay and agencies to provide employment and all necessaries for the German subjects are set in motion. But if we in Australia propose a public work, the construction of a road, for instance, all action is paralyzed until we solve the problem of financing it. The state of affairs in these countries contrasts strongly with that in Australia, because, whereas, in Germany and Italy works that are necessary are provided for, it is reported in the Sydney press that -financial stringency in New South Wales may shortly bring relief works and many other governmental activities in that State to a stand-still. -The authority for that statement is a Minister in the Government of New South Wales. We cannot, therefore, prepare for an emergency if we are facing a financial deadlock. It would seem that we are merely fooling ourselves' by putting such legislation as this on the statute-book. There is ground for suspicion that the Government, instead of dealing with actualities, is either merely tinkering at the problem or requires the register of man-power for a purpose quite apart from the purposes  enunciated in the Minister's second-reading speech. As the discussion proceeds, the Minister may he able to give us more details of what is being done. He may be able to satisfy me that the credit resources of this country will be so marshalled as to ensure that the maximum production of primary industries will be maintained and that we shall he able to store sufficient products to tide us over au emergency. But he -has yet to explain why the farmers in parts of New South "Wales are fighting to remain on their holdings and are talking about boycotting those who are trying to dispossess them. </para>

I am referring to a subsequent conference at which the Premiers were ironed out, and became more susceptible to the wishes of the Commonwealth, Government than previously. I do not know the reason, but probably they received more loan moneys. </para>

Any member of this Parliament should be able to get at least some of the information made available at that gathering. Humble as my standing is in this Parliament, I represent as many, constituents as the honorable member for Barker, and I am entitled to possess more information than I have received. The Government asks us to agree to measures introduced in consequence of alleged states of emergency and crises, and, in effect, to accept all that it proposes without the necessary information on the subject. As we proceed I believe that the honorable member for Barker, now that he is outside the Cabinet, will not feel inclined to accept all that is said from the treasury  benches. </para>

                            <para>-  I agree, therefore, with the honorable member. If the Premiers were given information such as this report suggests, why was it not supplied to this Parliament? That is one instance in which we are entitled to doubt the real meaning of the bill. We are entitled to ask whether a state of emergency now exists, and if there is any justification for panic in regard to world  affairs. We are entitled to complain that we have not been given any more information than has been supplied to the general public. The Premiers were apparently told more than we have been told. The conference then proceeded to deal with other subjects. The late Prime Minister said, " The first considerations would be financial considerations which would necessitate the best possible use of the money available for works ". At that conference the financial aspect must have been prominently in the mind of the late Prime Minister, and he must have been questioned by the Premiers. We have not been given any information on that point either. In reading the report, we find many references which the Minister never touched upon when introducing this bill. In addressing the conference at great length, he spoke of State works and their defence value, and improvements to proposed works as contributions to the Government's defence scheme. He went on to stress the need to deal with " the scope of certain precautionary measures " which, he said, included briefly - </para>

I understand that it has now agreed . to submit an amendment in that respect. We do not believe in handing blank cheques even to governments. The honorable member for Barker says that it is customary to use the words " and for other purposes " in acts of Parliament. Well, past customs are not fit ting in very well with present circumstances. An opposition would not be worth its name if it passed ambiguous phrases without endeavouring to ascertain what is actually proposed. When the Minister replies to the second-reading debate, he should give more information concerning the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, the National Council, alleged co-ordination of Commonwealth and State activities, and what is meant by " other special measures as necessary". That information was not given by the Minister in his second-reading speech. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, buthonorable members have insufficient time to compare such reports with the bills that are brought before the House. It is, of course, good ministerial work not to say too much in moving the second reading of a bill because if too much information is given more will be demanded. All men who have had Ministerial experience realize that. Nevertheless, we are warranted in asking the Minister what actually happened at the Premiers Conference, how far the suggestions made are likely to be implemented, and what authority the National Council is to have. Is it to be a national council in name only, or is it to have authority to give effect to the resolutions agreed upon ? The honorable gentleman also said " On the adoption of the precautionary stage and on the adoption of the war stage, the Commonwealth Government proposes to advise each State Government of the action that is being taken, and to request it to co-operate with the appropriate Commonwealth department or defence service, &amp;c." I hope that in his reply to the second-reading  debate, the Minister will enlighten the House more fully on the matters contained in this report. The report goes on to deal with the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth War Book</inline> which, it is said, was supplied to each Premier. I have made inquiries about this book, but no honorable member has been able yet to tell me anything about it. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable gentleman is at a loss to understand why the Opposition feels  aB  it does in re.gan to this hill. He says, in effect, " I believe that the purpose of the bill is to take a census of man-power and to do certain other things." When we question him as to what is meant by " other things " he seems to think that such curiosity is not justified. We have to examine the report of this conference of Commonwealth and State representatives in order to learn what is behind .this bill. The report contains vague and nebulous references which give rise to suspicion. I draw the Minister's attention to this so that h° may be able to appreciate why the Opposition regards as unconvincing the meagre details regarding this preparation for war that were contained in his secondleading speech. The honorable gentleman has indicated that the report of The conference was the basis upon which this bill was drafted. It was resolved by the conference that the national defence plans should be on the basis of preparations for a major war. That is an uncomfortable thought. It seems to us that much more was said at the conference  than  has been said in this Parliament, and, consequently, we are led to believe that behind this man-power proposal is something of which we have been told nothing. Taking as a guide what happened in 1915, when a proposal similar to that now before the House was debated by the Parliament, we are justified in our caution and our resolve that similar happenings shall not follow the passage of this bill. </para>

                    <para>I come now to the contention that  a  census of man-power is necessary " in order that men possessing technical qualifications shall be directed into their right sphere ". Reference has been made to the fact that during the last war many skilled men were employed in directions in which no advantage could be taken of their particular qualifications. I should say that this compulsory questionnaire will be of no more value than any inquiries made during the last war to ascertain particulars of the skill of the volunteers. All that could be done then was to inquire of volunteers what particular qualifications they had in certain directions. This bill will achieve nothing more than that. Every man between certain ages will be called upon to declare his occupation. We shall have to rely upon the honesty of the men concerned for the correctness or otherwise of the information collated. If T agree to fill in a form in the schedule to this bill, and I have any particular skill, I shall declare it. But there will be nothing to show that the information I shall give will be accurate. If, during the last war, I had volunteered and had been required by my commanding officer to state what skill I had, I would have declared it, and then been allotted to certain duties. If men were allotted to duties in which .their skill was wasted, such errors must have been due to false declarations or to incompetence on the part of their supervising officers. </para>

                            <para>- If I were detailed to the cook house, and were capable of  carrying  out the duties of cook, I should consider myself doing probably the most important job of all. A man's capacity to do a job or otherwise can .be tested by trying him out. If I were engaged in industry and were picking out men to do certain jobs, the responsibility would be upon me to test their capabilities for the work they were to perform. If a man declares his fitness to carry out certain work, his immediate superior can determine in a very short time whether or not his declaration is correct. This bill does no more than call upon certain persons to declare their skill. </para>

                            <para>- On the face of it, that seems to be a logical answer. I am inclined to look at the provision from another viewpoint, because I remember that youths to be called up under the British compulsory training system are between those age limits. It seems to me that this clause will enable a very close tab to be kept on these people in another way. Apparently, apart from the purposes of a national register, the people between these age limits are to be watched very closely. </para>

                            <para>- The electoral registration machinery does not require particulars as to ages of persons enrolled, yet under this legislation, youths between the age3 of 18 and 21 years will be registered. However, the Minister has declared that there is no sinister reason for this, and that the bill merely provides for registration in the ordinary way. It is claimed by the Government that the questionnaire set out in the schedule to the bill will provide the information necessary to ensure that, in a national emergency, people will be allocated to jobs for which they are best fitted. Persons being registered are required to state their country of birth. That, I suppose, is a reasonable question, but I fail to see what the country of  birth of a man's father and mother has to do with his ability to do certain work in time of emergency. </para>

Another part of the questionnaire refers to dependent relatives. I again ask, what have dependent relatives to do with a man's ability to do a particular job of work? Similarly, what has the number of children to do with the registration of a man for national service in the workshops? </para>

                            <para>- That is true, and if that is to be regarded as sufficient grounds for conscientious objection to service, then apparently it is a way out. The next part of the schedule deals with employers. If the Government desires to know what work a. man is best fitted to do, surely there is no reason for inquiries with regard to his employers. The Government does not ask people who invest their wealth in bonds, securities or normal business investments, where their money is. It is regarded as a sacred right of capitalists to invest their money wherever they please. </para>

                    <para>. - I bring to the notice of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Street)</inline> a statement which I have received from a reliable source with reference to the conditions at Enoggera camp during the recent training exercises there of the 15th/26th . Battalion, and I hope that the Minister will have immediate inquiries made in the interests of the members of the militia forces. I feel keenly on this matter, because I was one of those who, in Queensland, did all they could to stimulate recruiting so as to bring the number of militia up from 35,000 to 70,000. I cannot say, of my own knowledge, that the statements in this communication which I have received from a person holding a high position in Queensland are true, but they are sufficiently grave to warrant an inquiry. The following is an extract from it: - </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>Monday, the 8th May, dinner time brought about its first disillusionment when dry bread, a slice of corn beef and tea was the menu, and when pleas of the men were heard, butter (a very dear item, we were told) was brought on. The food for the rest of the camp was not that which a young soldier would sit down and enjoy in peace time. </para>
                    <para>The meat seemed to have had all the goodness boiled out of it. and, with the exception of turnip and cabbage on a very few occasions, greens were noticed by their absence. </para>
                    <para>The general opinions of the men were that better meals would be obtained in gaol. The hygienic surroundings of the camp did not im press most of these healthy young men. Thecans of water for washing plates, cups and utensils were all thickly coated with grease when, several hundred men had washed their plates in them; it was impossible to have the utensils thoroughly cleansed. The conditions of the meals were such that a number of men bought their own food, which saved them from the sickness which a number of unfortunate men have to suffer in the form of dysentery. This disease first started on Sunday, the 14th May, and about 60 men were taken to base hospital and a steady stream of men was at the Resident Medical Officer's tent every day until the last camp. Out of twenty odd men in the hand, seven turned out to play the guard on. On Wednesday, the 17th, every mess orderly, permanent, was also stricken. Headquarterswing men were transferred to other companies' huts to make room for the sick men. A continuous stream of men was constantly going to the latrines, which certainly would be the breeding place of any malignant disease. Such places as the latrines, showers and washing facilities should be renewed without further delay. The mess tables were wiped with a rag which failed to take the grease off. A fire was situated close to the mess hall, from which soot, &amp;c, kept blowing in on our  meals while we were eating. This camp, which may have been successful, was a dismal failure. in the eyes of men and not until proper organization of feeding and cleaning arrangements is made will they succeed. The abovementioned facts are what I found at the camp, and can be vouched for by many in the 15th/20th Battalion. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That statement is borne out by several other members of the same battalion, and by sergeants of the Army Medical Corps. I attach no blame to the Minister, but if the charges are true, those responsible for such conditions should be taken to task. </para>

                    <para>.- Of late I have repeatedly asked in this House for information regarding the salary and expenses paid to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ernest</inline> Fisk, managing director of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. The Commonwealth Government holds a controlling interest in this company. Under an agreement dated the 28th March, 1922, the Commonwealth paid £375,000 15s. for a controlling interest in the company, this representing a payment pf 15s. a share on 500,001 shares, out of a total of 1,000,000 shares. The only condition on which the Government permitted private enterprise to carry on the business of wireless communication,  which should have been a  public  utility like telephones and telegraphs, was that the Government itself should have a controlling interest in the enterprise. It was believed by the Parliament of the day that it would exercise control over the activities of the company, and, with that idea, two members of the board were nominated by the Government, the right honorable William Morris Hughes, who is still on the board, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> Strahan, secretary to the Prime Minister's Department, who was appointed at a later date. Although I asked my first question on the 19th May, the reply was not received until just recently. I do not blame the Prime Minister for that, because I know that the company was bluffing him as long as it could. Notwithstanding the fact that the Commonwealth holds more than half the shares, the company stated that at a meeting of directors, it would be decided whether or not information regarding (the salary and expenses paid to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ernest</inline> Fisk would be made known to this Parliament. The meeting of the board was held on the 29th May, and the reply furnished to me by the Prime Minister stated - </para>

                    <para>The company is incorporated in the State of New South Wales, and the Companies Act of 1936 of that State, though it provides that accounts of public companies have to contain certain particulars, including the total amount paid to the directors as remuneration for their services, expressly excludes from this provision the remuneration paid to a managing director of a company. I am, however, able to say that the amount paid to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ernest</inline> Fisk has been communicated confidentially to me, and that, in my opinion, having regard <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the nature of the business of the company, and the work done by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ernest</inline> Fisk, it is not unreasonable. </para>

                <para class="block">No mention is made of expenses in that reply. It is in the interests of the Prime Minister himself that the total amount paid to this officer should be revealed to this Parliament. This is more than a public company, because the Commonwealth has a controlling interest in it. We should never have allowed wireless to become the preserve of a company. I am not suggesting that that point is relevant to this matter, but I mention it because this gentleman is continually booming himself in the press. This company has undertaken the manufacture of receiving sets, although, I feel sure, it was never contemplated by the Government of the day that the company should operate in that sphere. Furthermore, it has been due to representations made by this company and others that a high import duty has been placed upon wireless valves which makes it impossible to import a wireless set from any country, although it may be much more modern than any set made by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. Whilst I do not make any imputation against the Prime Minister, I suggest that there is something sinister in the general attitude of this company towards this Parliament. When I was Postmaster-General I tried to secure information of this kind from the company, and I was treated more cavalierly than has  been the case on this occasion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson,</inline> also, when he was Postmaster-General before myself, attempted to get this information, and was treated iti ' similar fashion. In fact, the attitude of the company towards Ministers became a joke in the Public Service. The salary of each public servant is published in the Estimates; but, apparently, that gentleman is immune from any such disclosure. It it any wonder that he does himself pretty well? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Strahan,</inline> if he knows, cannot give us this information, whilst the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> is as dumb as an oyster on the matter. Is it not possible to force this company to disclose to the Auditor-General what this man receives? The Auditor-General's report dealing with this matter simply reveals that, according ito a public statement issued by the company - that, I point out, it is obliged to issue in order to be listed on the stock exchange - the Commonwealth Government has put so much money into the company, but apart from this gentleman's share of dividends it is impossible to say what he receives. I am sure that his salary is twice that paid to the Director of Posts and Telegraphs, although the latter is charged with a far greater responsibility. Recently this gentleman returned from a trip to the Old Country by the Orient liner <inline font-style="italic">Orcades.,</inline> on which he took one of two special suites for which accommodation he must have paid at least  £1,000.  The Government has a right to know whether such expense was met by his company. The Prime Minister should stand up to this gentleman, and direct the Government's representatives on the board, whose hands, I am aware, are now tied in the matter, to make known to the Government how much this man is drawing, not only in salary but also by way of the princely expenses which, i am sure, he allows himself. </para>

The Defence Department hasadmitted in correspondence with theunion that it has not one officercapable of distinguishing between military work and civilian work until over one-half of the manufacturing operation has been completed. Any inspection carried out by the inspecting officers has been one-sided. Thedepartment sends its officer to inspect thework. Having no specialized knowledgeof the industry, he makes inquiries from the men at the factory, who inform him that they are satisfied with their conditions, .and that they are entitled to dothe work they are doing. On this assurance being given, the officer is apparentlysatisfied that all is in order. The department has consistently refused the union's request to be allowed to send a representative to attend during inspections. The union has offered the department the services of a fully qualified' journeyman felt hatter to carry out the inspection free of charge. Thedepartment will not attempt to bring this firm into line with al! other firms, by insisting on the observance of award rates .and conditions. It continues to send along inspecting officers who have no knowledge of what to look for, and who are, therefore, unable to detect any breaches of the award. That,, no doubt, is what the department desires. </para>

                <para>The answer furnished was, " Ten ". That answer is incorrect; evidently it is intended to protect this firm. The Department -of Defence stands convicted on. its own admission, because this firm employs only three journeymen felt hatters and has never had more than three in its employ. These are the only men who are entitled to work on the skilled branches of the trade. This answer calls for a departmental inquiry, for the  Minister  must now be convinced that the charges laid by the union are correct. He should investigate this deliberate lie. </para>

The union requests the Minister to inquire of any manufacture of felt hats whether it would be possible for three journeymen felt hatters, doing all of the skilled work of the trade, to do 83 dozen, or 1,000 hats a week. The Felt Hatters Union claims that its statement can be substantiated at an inquiry.

                    <para>The matter referred to by the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Sheehan)</inline> has been under my notice on several occasions during the last six months. I have suggested to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Devereaux,</inline> secretary of the Felt Hatters Union, who, I imagine, supplied the honorable member with the material for his remarks, that the remedy is in his own hands if only he will take the firm to court. He will not do so, however. Nor will he give to me any reason for not doing so. As the firm has not been cited, obviously the union's representative is not allowed to inspect its works. I have had minute investigations of the activities of this firm, and the result in. every instance has convinced me that it is obeying the award. I have discussed this matter with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Devereaux,</inline> and with the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> who has interested himself in it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Devereaux</inline> has endeavoured to raise the technicality that certain men are not journeymen. He has also told me that it is impossible for any firm to compete with the prices quoted by Hatcraft Proprietary Limited, and pay award rates. For two or three contracts the tender of Hatcraft Proprietary Limited was the lowest, but for the last contract that firm was not the lowest tenderer; it secured a portion of that contract only because the lowest tenderer could not do the whole of the work. Other tenderers quoted prices which were so close to that of Hatcraft Proprietary Limited as to leave no appreciable difference between them. If this firm has done nothing else, it has succeeded in bringing down the prices of these defence requirements. I regret the somewhat intemperate language used by the honorable member in describing officers of my department. I am sure that on reflection he will realize that those officers make their investigations impartially, and have nothing to gain by allowing awards to be flouted. The industrial officers are as keen to see awards complied with as is the honorable gentleman. I have investigated this complaint so often that I am of the opinion that no useful purpose would be served by conducting a further investigation. As I have said, the remedy lies in the hands of the union, but it will not take the matter to court. </para>

                        <para>- Representations have been made by Associated Motor Transport, of New South Wales, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> Kemp, of Ocean House, Sydney, with a view to securing Commonwealth assistance in connexion with the granting of a Crown coal lease in the Burragorang Valley, New South Wales. These interests intimated that it was intended, if the lease were granted to produce oil from coal, and it is understood that the low temperature carbonization process would be employed for that purpose. As mining, except within the territories controlled by tile Commonwealth, is a State function, the Premier of New South Wales was approached  in this matter. The Premier stated that 'the main products to be derived from the lease would be coal, or coke which would displace coal, and as the policy of his Government was not to grant further Crown leases to mine for coal, the application made by Associated Motor Transport could not be approved. This information was conveyed to the interests mentioned and they were told that the Commonwealth Hydrogenation Committee, a body comprising technical experts of the Commonwealth and the States, reported in 1937, " that there is little hope of the low temperature carbonization process proving of real practical value in the provision of Australia's requirements of oil on a large scale unless a huge market for ' semicoke the prime product,- can be found." </para>

                        <para>In the opinion of your committee the production of oil from coal by. low temperature carbonization is unattractive. The quantities of petrol likely to be derived by this process are small, while without greater density of population no sufficient market can be found for the prime product of the process - smokeless fuel - to admit of large-scale operations. </para>
