                    <para>
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Langdon</inline>
                        Bonython, as he was generally known, was 91 years of age at the time of his death, and had been a foremost figure in the public life of the Commonwealth for many years. In the early days of federation he was a member of the House of Representatives, having been elected to represent South Australia at the general elections of 1901. Upon the division of that State into electorates, he was elected to represent the division of Barker at the general elections of 1903.  His  association with the Commonwealth Parliament ceased in 1906, when he retired upon the expiration of the second Parliament.
                    </para>
                    <para>Valuable service was rendered by the deceased honorable gentleman in the Commonwealth sphere as one of fourteen trustees appointed under the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act of 1916, and as a commissioner appointed under the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act of 1917. In 1922 he was appointed a member of the commission to make arrangements for the representation of Australia at the British Empire Exhibition of 1924. He was also chairman of the </para>

                    <para>In the business world the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Langdon</inline> Bonython was eminently successful as a newspaper proprietor. He was associated with many public organizations in South Australia, and was particularly interested in matters appertaining to the scientific and educational activities of that State.  His  public benefactions in the cause of education included gifts of £50,000 for the erection of a Great Hall at the University of Adelaide, £20,000 for the endowment of a Chairof Law, and £20,000 to the School of Mines.  His  gift of £100,000 for the completion of the parliamentary buildings in Adelaide was a magnificent example of the public spirit that he displayed throughouta long and an honorable career. </para>

                        Bonython was honoured by  His  Majesty the King on three occasions, the order of Knight Commander of St. Michael and St. George having been conferred on him in 1919.

                    <para>I may add, in recognition of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Langdon</inline> Bonython's distinguished service to Australia, that the Commonwealth Government accorded him a state funeral. </para>
                    <para>I had not the advantage of a very intimate acquaintance with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Langdon</inline> Bonython, but I can remember meeting him for the first time 27 years ago when I was a schoolboy, and again, after a very long interval of time, only during the last twelve months. I was profoundly struck by the fact that the long period of time which had- elapsed between  those  two meetings had left his mental powers and the strength of his personal character unimpaired. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Langdon</inline> Bonython was a very striking man. He was a man of great power of mind, of great vigour, and I believe of great ' patriotism. He made a mark in Australia. Undoubtedly he made a special  mark  in  South Australia,  and there is great satisfaction to all of us in the realization of the fact that men of this high type, men of this great calibre, can be produced in Australia, and can render such notable service to this country. </para>

                    <para>As has been recounted to the House, the services of the late honorable gentleman to Australia were many and varied. Apart from his membership of this Parliament, he displayed very considerable public zeal, and the very great personal qualities that he possessed, associated with the fact that he was in a position to give effect to many of his wishes, enabled him to play a very great part in the cultural life, particularly of South Australia, and, I believe also, to a very great degree, of the Commonwealth. I am very glad that among his many activities he was able to be associated with the control of the Commonwealth Literary Fund. That was evidence of his willingness to serve, in a humble way, in a matter which has contributed greatly to the best interests of Australia. I had not an opportunity to meet <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Langdon</inline> Bonython, but I have had the privilege of meeting his distinguished son, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lavington</inline> Bonython, while he was Lord Mayor of Adelaide. I feel that the Bonython family can be admired as representing in Australia a type of which we can indeed well be proud. I sincerely associate myself with the expressions . of regret that the Prime Minister has voiced at the decease of the late honorable gentleman. </para>

I personally had the opportunity to know the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Langdon</inline> Bonython moderately well, and as a South Australian I know the great part that he played in many of the activities of that State - some of which were known to the general public but many of which never became known - designed for the benefit and welfare of the State. He was a man who had distinguished himself in journalism and in business. He had also played a prominent part in the politics of his own State, and in addition was one of the original members of this House of Representatives. I believe that I can say that, above all, he was a man who not only loved his fellow men but also endeavoured, to the utmost of his capacity, to serve them. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - On meeting the House once more after a short recess, I want to take the opportunity to inform honorable members officially and briefly of several matters of outstanding importance which have engaged the attention of the Government during recent months. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>First, let me speak of affairs abroad. It is not my intention to speak at length on this matter because my colleague, the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Henry Gullett),</inline> will address himself to it to-morrow, but I think I should refer to the entirely unexpected circumstance that, two and  a  half months after the outbreak of war, we are still, so to speak, waiting for it to commence, and that in the meantime a great deal of discussion is occurring, both in belligerent and in neutral countries,- on the possibilities of peace and the terms upon which that, peace could he obtained. </para>
                <para>Speaking for myself, I have little doubt that these two remarkable circumstances are closely associated. Until the last two months the rulers of Germany have had an almost simple time, speaking internationally. They have absorbed one country after another by relatively bloodless victories, but at the beginning of September they found themselves at war with two great Powers, over whom no bloodless victory could be achieved - over whom, indeed, no ultimate victory at all could be achieved. This fact of paramount importance has given Germany pause; it has made the German Government hesitant to put everything to the touch. It has for the time being induced in the minds of Germany's rulers a feeling that  a  war of nerves is better than a war of guns, and that by waiting, by keeping Great Britain and France in suspense, by encouraging easy talk of peace, Germany may divide its enemies before conquering them. </para>
                <para>Great as their mental gifts undoubtedly are, the German people have never been characterised by a capacity for understanding the psychology of the British people or of the French people. The proverbial patience and tenacity of the British, and the flaming spirit and patriotism of the French, are not to be destroyed or set aside by German threats or German propaganda. This war was not lightly entered upon by us. The cause for which we entered it will not be lightly abandoned. </para>
                <para>Little faith as I have in too much talking at this time, it might be useful if, in a few sentences, I said something to honorable members about our war aims. In my opinion we have two. The first and paramount and urgent aim is victory, not for the glory, of victory, not for the humiliation of the German people, not for the spoils, but victory for all that it means to the future peace and happiness of simple men and women the world over. No patched-up peace, no mere formula of compromise, can give to the world any assurance of a peace that will endure. Our people have a hatred of war, but they have a greater hatred of the evil spirit which has animated German policy and which has racked the world. I do not believe that you can compromise about the vital things in civilization, about peace and justice and freedom and the sane settlement of disputes. Either you have them or you do not have them. And there are no people more interested in securing them than the people of small and weak nations, and the small and weak people of every nation. Our cause is that there shall be justice and a quiet living for the weak as well as for the strong. It is a great and humane cause. It has been the dynamic force in our domestic political growth for centuries; from now on it must animate our international affairs, and give direction to the policies of nations. </para>
                <para>Our second aim is that after victory there shall be a better Europe and a better world in which there will be security for peoples of independent race and tradition, a revival of the peaceful associations of trade and commerce, an abandonment of the mad and threatening competition of armaments which has been forced upon us in the last five years, and a prosperity in which we will want Germany to share as a great nation. In a. word, and I think it is something we should constantly keep before our eyes, the freedom and equity for which we are fighting will be freedom and equity for the Germans as well as for ourselves. We arc not out to make a " slave state " of Germany. We would be not only inhuman but also mad to attempt it. But we are out to establish that the barbarous German philosophy which makes slaves of others - the simple plan, </para>
                <para>That they should take who have the power, </para>
                <para>And they should keep who can- - must be completely destroyed in order that Germany may not make slaves of others. </para>
                <para>I turn now to our war affairs at home. Of outstanding importance is the effect which wartime experience has had upon the organization of government itself. It has become increasingly clear to me, as the head of the Government, that the machinery which was appropriate in time of peace is not only inappropriate, but also inefficient, in time of war. With vastly increased military forces, with the foreshadowing of enormous development in our air service, with the putting of the major portion of our national effort into warlike preparations, it became clear that no one Minister for Defence could possibly cope with the whole administrative responsibility. The Defence Department is therefore being divided. For the duration of the war there will be a Minister for the Army, a Minister for the Navy and a Minister for Air, together with the Minister for Supply and Development. </para>
                <para>The activities of each of these departments will be co-ordinated by a Minister for Defence Co-ordination. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Street</inline> has been sworn as Minister for the Army, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Stewart as Minister for the Navy and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fairbairn</inline> as Minister for Air, while I have been sworn as Minister for Defence Co-ordination. </para>
                <para>
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline>
                    Stewart will, in addition to retaining his existing appointments, continue to act as Minister for Supply and Development during the absence of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey. Mr. Street</inline>
                    will act as Minister for the Navy during the same period, while
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holt</inline>
                    will act as Minister for Air and Minister for Civil Aviation until the return of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fairbairn</inline>
                    from Canada.
                </para>
                <para>The War Cabinet will consist of myself, the Attorney-General, the Minisiter for Supply and Development, the Minister for the Army, the Minister for External Affairs and Information, the Minister for the Interior (including Works), the Minister for the Navy and the Minister for Air, with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spender,</inline> who is now Acting Treasurer, co-opted from time to time on Treasury matters. </para>
                <para>It will be seen from this arrangement that each service Minister will have the fullest participation in policy by reason of his membership of the War Cabinet. </para>
                <para>As Minister for Defence Co-ordination, it is not my intention to create any bottleneck in administration. On the contrary, I expect to be able to produce greater promptness of decision by obtaining direct access, not only to the service Ministers,but also to the heads of the services themselves. My function will be confined to matters ofpolicy and coordination, the actual administration of each arm being for the appropriate Minister. </para>
                <para>I take this opportunity to tell the public, as I do not need to tell honorable members, that this drastic re-arrangement is in no sense a reflection upon my colleague, the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Street).</inline> As Minister for Defence he has for many months, in circumstances of unprecedented pressure and difficulty, devoted himself unsparingly to the interests of our country, No man could have done more; most men would have done less. The best tribute I can pay to my colleague's labours is implicit in the fact that from now on there will be three Ministers busily employed in doing what he has been doing alone for some time past. </para>
                <para>At the same time as these service re-arrangements have been made, attention has been directed to the economic side of our activities, and upon that I want to say something of an explanatory kind to the House. Little as the superficial observer may realize it, the economic side of war has a significance and a complexity as great as those of the fighting services. In Australia it has been necessary to give instant and close attention to the problems of maintaining a vast volume of supplies, principally for Great Britain; of obtaining and maintaining a steady flow of shipping; of regulating our overseas trade, and our overseas finance ; of controlling our internal finance so that our resources may be used to the best advantage; of minimizing the shock to business and the price level which is almost inevitably associated with war; and to devising machinery and marshalling resources for the purpose of stabilizing as far as possible the position of those great industries upon which our economic life depends, and which would, without prompt government action, be more or less powerless to resist the impact of war. </para>
                <para>Behind all these, I have my mind clearly fixed upon the importance of planning economically for peace. At present we have in various departments, committees and individuals who are doing a great deal of valuable work and valuable thinking. In the Commerce Department we have boards controlling' primary products, together with specially constituted wartime boards controlling shipping, wheat, wool, barley, and so on. In the Treasury we have an Advisory Committee onCapital Issues, a Taxation Advisory Committee, an Advisory Committee on Financial and Economic Policy, and a number of wartime regulations relating to monetary control and overseas export control. In the Trade and Customs Department we have the Economic Warfare Advisory Committee and the organization of the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner, to say nothing of the many activities which arc associated with the control of export and import trade. In the Supply Department such matters as industrial organi- zation, oil and seaborne trade have appropriate consultants and officers, while the activities of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and the Development Branch are being vigourously pursued. </para>
                <para>But all these things need co-ordination and direction if we are to achieve the best results. It would be in my opinion a cardinal error to assume that, if this war lasts for three years, we shall at the end of it revert to just the same economic structure and life as we had last year. When it is realized that on the war hypothesis I have stated, we shall have behind us three years of intense experience of financial control, of trade control, of price control, of bulk selling and of bulk buying, it will be at once seen that nobody can foretell what changes of a permanent kind in the relations between government and business may be produced by the present struggle. The Government is not hostile to change, but it desires that whatever change comes about should be for the good of the Australian people and should enable the development of our country to proceed soundly and rapidly when the war is over. </para>
                <para>All this means that we must bring about the most effective co-ordination of all these wartime economic activities, so as to give them a common direction and a common purpose, and so as to ensure that when we move out into peace we shall move out in a predetermined direction, and with a proper capacity to take the fullest advantage of our war experience. </para>
                <para>To bring about this co-ordination and control, I have established, side by side with the War Cabinet, another subcabinet to he called the " Economic Cabinet ", of which, in addition to myself, the Minister for Supply and Development, the Minister for Commerce, the Postmaster-General, the Minister for Trade and Customs, the Acting Treasurer and the Assistant Minister for Commerce will be members. Regular meetings of this cabinet body, the head-quarters of which will be at Canberra, will of themselves ensure a measure of co-operative effort, but it will still be necessary to have attached to the Economic Cabinet, as its secretary and as Director of Economic Co-ordination, a man of the highest possible qualifications and the ripest experience in business administration. I am not yet in a position to announce the name of the proposed appointee, though I anticipate doing so next week, but. steps are being taken to secure the services of a gentleman whose personal standing and authority will be such as to enable him to contribute very powerfully to the marshalling of our economic efforts. Here again, while announcing far-reaching changes, I desire to pay a tribute to the work that has already been done, not only since the war but also before the war, in the various departments whose executive heads and officers get little publicity and many easy criticisms, but without whose work the magnificent results already achieved would have been impossible. </para>
                <para>My final task is to say something in a fairly summary form about one or two of the major decisions that have been arrived at by the War Cabinet. These decisions I may say have already raised our anticipated war expenditure for this financial year to a total of approximately £60,000,000. </para>
                <para>I notice that my friend the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> has, quite properly, made the comment that the volume of expenditure means little unless the expenditure has been wise and well directed. I agree. In substance, of course, the matters upon which this money is to be expended are those recommended to us by our expert advisers, and I am able to assure the House that they are all calculated to produce a maximum of war effort on the part of Australia. But in point of detail, I realize that in a time of war and of rapidly expanding schemes, waste is always possible. All that we can do is to provide the very best ways and means for eliminating, or preventing, it. With this end in view, we have drawn freely upon the business community for advice and assistance. It has been given to us most generously. I do not desire in this statement to mention names, but I could, in fact, mention dozens of men of undoubted knowledge and standing who have placed their services at our disposal, and have powerfully reinforced us on the business side. In addition to this, a Treasury Finance Committee has been established in connexion with our defence undertakings, and I am able to tell the House that, as the result of this and the activities of the various business consultants, it is anticipated that we shall get as near as it is humanly possible to get to that desirable state in which we shall get a pound's worth of real defence for every twenty shillings of defence expenditure. </para>
                <para>The two decisions of the War Cabinet which I desire to mention are those relating to military training and our participation in  air  warfare. In relation to the first, we have decided to keep our Militia Forces at an adequately trained strength of not less than 75,000 men, and for this purpose compulsory military training will be reintroduced in January next. Whilst all parties, I think, agree that service abroad must maintain its voluntary character, there is, I 'believe, a growing recognition of the fact that military training for the defence of Australia should be a normal part of our civic life, and that if it is to be just and democratic, it should be made compulsory. </para>
                <para>I once more emphasize that there is no question of conscription for overseas service. We are definitely pledged against it. But for very many years the law of this country ha3 been such as to impose upon all citizens of certain age classes the liability to serve in Australia in time of war. One has only to imagine a state of affairs in which Australia was being attacked on its own shores and in its own countryside in order to realize how unjust it would be to perpetuate the system under which our defence in these circumstances would rest only upon those who had voluntarily undergone the necessary training and preparation. In order to maintain the Militia Forces at their appropriate strength, it is not necessary to go beyond calling up the trainees of one-age class. The class selected consists of those who attain the age of 21 years during the current financial year. A3 time goes on, and each year another group of men enters this class, the obligation to train will attach to it, so that in the course of a few years the men of 21, 22 and 23 years, and so on, will have received a substantial measure of military training, and on the man-power side our defences will have become so strong that any enemy will hesitate to attack us. </para>
                <para>The second decision relates to the Air Force. Some time ago I announced on behalf of the Government that we were proposing to send to England an Air Expeditionary Force consisting of six squadrons, fully manned with flying and ground personnel. This decision was, I believe, enthusiastically received by the Australian people and by the Government of Great Britain. Subsequently, however, the British Government evolved a vast Empire air training proposal which was designed, by co-operation between Great Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, to train such large numbers of air pilots, observers and gunners as to make our ultimate personal superiority to Germany in the air not only substantial, but also overwhelming. We at once indicated our willingness to participate in this scheme to the fullest practicable degree, and the Minister for Air <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fairbairn)</inline> is now in Canada discussing its principles and details. Quite plainly, our participation in this much more ambitious scheme was bound to affect our capacity for sending away, as a special body, an Air Expeditionary Force as originally contemplated, which would have been almost equal in total personnel to the present strength of the Royal Australian Air Force. </para>
                <para>After the closest consultation with the British Government, and, I may say, in full conformity with its wishes, we decided, first, that we should complete the manning in England of a squadron of nine Sunderland flying boats, which were either delivered or on the point of delivery to us in England, and that this squadron, as an Australian squadron, should be in a position to take part in active service by the end of this year ; and, secondly, that we should, subject to the completion of our own air defences, concentrate our resources and energies upon the Empire air training scheme. These decisions were and are, I believe, not only sensible, but also inevitable. I cannot at this stage tell honorable members of the numbers which are envisaged by the Empire scheme; but I can say that, whereas our original Air Expeditionary Force proposal involved the sending, in addition to between 2,000 and 3,000 of ground personnel, of about 550 flying personnel, the pilots, observers, and gunners to be trained under the new proposals will number, not hundreds, hut thousands. The development of such a force means that we shall need every experienced flyer and every competent instructor whom we can find ; it means the building or acquisition of hundreds of training aircraft; it will mean the bringing to Australia of many aircraft of various types for elementary or advanced training. All this will add greatly to our own security in the air. It will, on the personnel side, tend almost to make us a first-class air power. But these results cannot be achieved without an intense concentration of effort. Such a concentration would not have been possible if we had been required to devote ourselves for months to come to the training of the special force originally announced. </para>
                <para>I should like to add one observation on this question of the Empire air scheme. It is this: The Government, correctly interpreting, as it believes, the wishes of (Lie Australian people, will, as far as possible, preserve the Australian character and identity of any air force which goes abroad. It is true that in the early stages we could not hope to provide anything more than a trifling fraction of the number of senior officers who will be required for the air armada which will be procured by the Empire scheme, but, as time goes on, this position will correct itself. In the meantime, all that I need to say is that the tradition established by the Australian forces in the last war as Australian forces is fully valued by us, and that the same objective will be aimed at in respect of the air forces to which I have referred. </para>
                <para>I have not gone into detail in this sitatement, because my colleague the Minis.ter for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Street)</inline> will deal more fully with service matters; my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Frederick Stewart),</inline> who represents the Department of Commerce in this House, will make a full statement on matters affecting our primary industries: the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. John "Lawson)</inline> will make a statement in relation to price control. There will be a statement by the Acting Minister for Supply and Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Frederick Stewart)</inline> on the activities of the Supply Department, while the M Minister  for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Henry Gullett),</inline> as I have already said, will tell 11$ something about external affairs. </para>
                <para>I had a chat with the leaders of the oi her parties in the House about the procedure to he followed, and we thought that it would give the fullest opportunity to members to offer their views on the various matters that are the subject of the statements if at the end of each statement the motion " That the paper be printed " be moved and the adjournment then given until the following day. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - The Commonwealth Government has considered the position of the wheat industry, and has decided its policy in regard to financial assistance in respect of the season 1939-40, having regard to the policy previously announced by the Government and the changes necessitated by war conditions. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>In August last, the Commonwealth Government submitted to the States a permanent scheme of stabilization. That scheme provided for the joint provision by the Commonwealth and the States of an annual sum not exceeding £3,500,000 per annum, in addition to the flour tax, with the object of raising the average market realization for wheat to 3s. 4d. a bushel f.o.r. ports. The plan then proposed included provision for control of production and for the imposition of an export tax to operate when wheat prices rose above a prescribed figure. That plan was agreed to by most of the States, but had to be deferred because the Premier of Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dunstan,</inline> was not prepared to co-operate in putting it into effect. </para>
                    <para>Following upon the postponement of the comprehensive scheme of stabilization, the Commonwealth Government indicated that, in respect of the 1939-40 harvest, it would provide such sum, not exceeding £2,000,000, as would be necessary to raise the average market realization for wheat to 3s. id. f.o.r, shipping ports. This sum would, of course, be additional to the flour tax collections, estimated to be about £3,500,000 for the year referred to. Soon after that declaration of policy, war broke out, and, in presenting the budget to Parliament on the 8th September, 1939, 1 stated that the offer already made might be regarded as still standing, but that we must be prepared entirely to reconsider the situation of wheat in the light of the circumstances disclosed by war conditions. </para>
                    <para>The war has not relieved the marketing difficulties of the wheat industry, but has intensified them by increasing the shipping problems. In order to cope with the increased difficulties, and prevent the occurrence of chaotic marketing conditions, the Commonwealth Government established the Australian Wheat Board, acquired all old wheat, and has disposed of it in the form of grain and flour. The incoming harvest must now be handled. Acting upon the recommendation of the Wheat Board, the Government will acquire the harvest, and will be responsible for financing wheat-growers pending the disposal of the wheat on their behalf by the Wheat Board. Because of the inadequacy of normal marketing machinery and finance, colossal financial responsibility is now imposed on the Commonwealth Government which, after most  carefully  considering the extent of these responsibilities, lias decided upon the following action : Arrangements have been made with the Commonwealth Bank to make available to the Australian Wheat Board the necessary finance to enable advances to be made to growers, pending the sale of their wheat, on the following basis, namely, -2s. 9d. a bushel for bagged wheat, and 2$. 7d. a bushel for bulk wheat, less the freight from rail siding or other delivery point to the oversea port, these advances are equivalent to approximately 3s. for bagged wheat and 2s. lOd. for bulk wheat f.o.b. ports. Of these advances, the sum of ls. 9d. a bushel for bagged wheat and ls. 7d. a bushel for bulk wheat, less freight from siding or other delivery point to the port, will be paid upon the delivery of the  wheat to the agents of the Wheat Board. The balance of ls. a bushel will be paid during April, 1940. </para>
                    <para>The total finance involved in these advances, and other costs associated with the marketing of the crop, will exceed £20,000,000. This outlay by the Commonwealth Bank, guaranteed by the Commonwealth Government, will be recouped by moneys representing market realizations and by the proceeds of flour tax collections, while, as honorable members know, in certain circumstances the Commonwealth Government has agreed to provide such additional amount, not exceeding £2,000,000, as is found to be necessary to raise the average realization for marketed wheat to 3s. 4d. a bushel f.o.r. shipping ports. </para>
                    <para>These are, of course, not the maximum liabilities being assumed by the Commonwealth Government. In point of fact, the uncertainty relating to the remunerative disposal of the harvest may well involve the Government to a much greater degree. </para>
                    <para>It is clear that considerable difficulty will be experienced in disposing of the harvest. The Government realizes that it will be necessary for it to carry the financial responsibility of unsold stocks perhaps for a considerable period. The greatest care will, of course, be taken in the storage of the wheat, and the Government hopes that ultimately the market returns will recoup the advances now being made.

                        <para>- It is not correct to say that the Commonwealth Government or the Loan Council has in any way been responsible for the restriction of expenditure on governmental or semi governmental activities. At the last meeting of the Loan Council, notwithstanding the fact that defence expenditure had increased enormously, the governmental and semi-governmental borrowing programme was not interfered with at all. I am aware that some institutions of a semi-governmental character have had difficulty in obtaining finance, but that was due not to any action of the Commonwealth Government, but to the fact that the market did not find the investments attractive. The Commonwealth Bank has been giving temporary advances to some organizations of this kind, and the Commonwealth Government is making available £2,000,000, in addition to the defence expenditure, to relieve unemployment during the next six months. I have reason to believe that the money will become available at the beginning of next week. </para>

It is not possible yet to publish the full terms of the ultimate wool agreement, because, in some respects, they are not yet completed. The central features of the agreement have been concluded, notably the price and matters allied to it, and I understand that a statement on that is being circulated this afternoon, but in some respects we are still awaiting a decision on certain of the ancillary matters which are important.

                        <para>- Can the Minister for the Army inform the House as to the method adopted by the Defence Department in seeking the supply of commodities to the various military camps? Is it a fact that tender forms are given to certain business people adjacent to the camps, and that large co-operative societies in the districts which depression has affected most have never been supplied with those forms? If this system has been adopted, does the Minister not think that it would be more equitable to all concerned if tenders were invited through the press, and everybody allowed to tender? </para>

The financial poliCy involved in having this private loan, am i postponing the public loan until next  year,  will, in my opinion, tend to increase rather than diminish the liquidity of the banks.

                        <para>- In connexion with the abandonment of the proposal to despatch an air expeditionary force from Australia, can the Prime Minister say whether the fact that air mechanics were to be paid only 5s. Australian currency on home service, and 6s. abroad, whereas in the last war they were paid 8s. sterling for service overseas, had anything to do with the abandonment of the proposal? Will the Prime Minister table any relative documents or cablegrams that have passed between the Commonwealth Government and the British Government regarding the matter? </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - At the outbreak of war, the Government decided to establish an authority to control prices. As a preliminary step a prices order under my authority was gazetted on the 8th September fixing the price of certain goods at the level ruling on the 31st August. The Government then established a Price Fixing Branch of the Trade and Customs Department, and appointed a Commonwealth Prices Commissioner to fix maximum prices of declared goods and services. In cooperation with the State governments,  deputy  prices commissioners were appointed in each State and in the internal territories of the Commonwealth, and steps were taken to establish the necessary administrative -machinery to deal expeditiously with the control of prices, and to limit any rise of prices to justifiable increases of costs. The same machinery is being used for the control of prices in the external territories, and as soon as some slight amendments to the regulations have been effected, the Administrators in those territories will have certain power delegated to them. The machinery in the States has been developed and is now in complete working order. Under the National Security (Prices) Regulations it is my function to declare goods and services, the maximum prices of which are then fixed by the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner. Up to the present I have declared 160' major commodities and services, and the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner has fixed maximum prices of these commodities and services either at the pre-war level or at a new level determined by unavoidable increases of costs. These increases of costs are due to circumstances largely beyond the control of the Commonwealth. The following are important: - </para>

                    <para>The last two causes are to a large degree under the control of the Commonwealth, but they are incidental to war conditions. The budget contained some necessary increases of sales tax, but the major influence under our control is the very satisfactory rise of export prices, which were unduly depressed at the outbreak of war. Export prices have in fact risen by about17½ per cent. since the war commenced, and while this has brought much-needed relief to primary producers, it has resulted in some cases in a higher level of prices for materials used in Australian industries. It is the objective of the Government in these  cases to give exporters remunerative prices for domestic supplies, but to avoid the unnecessary increase of local costs that would inevitably follow if domestic prices were allowed to rise to the levels possible under the influence of an artificial and temporary demand created by war conditions. </para>
                    <para>It is important to control any increases of cost of a basic service like transport within Australia because of the effects upon costs of production. On the <inline font-style="italic">2nd</inline> October, 1939, the interstate shipping companies announced an increase of freight rates by 20 per cent, on account of war risk insurance and other matters. Action was immediately taken to gazette regulations for the control of all services. Under these regulations a declaration was gazetted making " every service of transporting passengers or goods or both by sea from any place in Australia to any other place in Australia " subject to price control. Thereupon the Prices Commissioner fixed the maximum freight rates at 10 per cent, above those ruling at the 31st August, 1939. Following this, he conducted a comprehensive investigation into costs and earnings of the interstate shipping companies, and the matter is to come up for review at the end of the month when further information upon war risk insurance will be available. </para>
                    <para>The Government is determined to protect Australian consumers against profiteering and to deal severely with any offenders, to permit industry to operate as freely as possible under the supervision of the price-fixing authority, and to absorb gradually into the Australian price structure those increases of ' cost which are unavoidable on account of overseas conditions. It is folly to imagine that a country like Australia, with a large import and export trade, could avoid some rise of prices. We cannot insulate our economic system completely from the fundamental changes of economic conditions imposed by a war which has created new and strange demands <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the economies of belligerents and neutrals alike. One example will suffice to indicate how swiftly the prices of an essential commodity may rise under war conditions. To-day the landed cost of cornsacks and woolpacks into Australia is nearly double what it was before the war. In this commodity, as in any other imported commodities, price control is designed to limit the rise of price to the landed cost of the goods plus normal margins for handling and distribution. The result is that cornsacks and woolpacks are selling at substantially below replacement cost to-day. </para>
                    <para>To provide for an orderly adjustment the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner has fixed the maximum prices of most declared goods in accordance with principles enunciated in a general averaging order - Prices Regulation Order No. 2 - published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> on the 5 th October. Under this order traders are allowed automatically to adjust the basic price of goods - normally the price ruling on the 31st August, 1939 - in accordance with unavoidable increases of average cost. Average cost is ascertained by aggregating the cost of old stock and new stock and dividing the sum by the total quantity of stock. On a rising market this effectively controls prices and prevents profiteering by stopping prices from rising rapidly to replacement cost. At the same time it enables the trader to finance the purchase of more costly new stock. Traders are compelled to keep records in order to justify any price increases they may make, and the Prices Commissioner exercises a strict supervision over such increases. He also closely reviews the profit margins and basic prices, and if he considers that they are inequitable he makes appropriate variations. These principles are applicable also to non-declared goods ; and in cases where increases of prices have been imposed in excess of the maximum prices permissible under the averaging order, I have promptly declared the goods, and the Prices Commissioner has subjected them either to the averaging order or to specific price determinations. In this manner it has been possible to spread the influence of price control throughout the whole range of nondeclared goods, and I am happy to be able to say that it is becoming the practice for traders handling such goods to approach the Prices Commissioner before raising their prices. The following examples will illustrate the efficient manner in which the averaging order has been working and the beneficialresults which have accrued :  - </para>

This, however, was checked by the declaration  of  the products, and the pegging  of  the prices  to  those 'rulingat the 31st August,1939. It was realized, however, thatbecause  of  the extent  to  which imported materials  are  used some increase of prices was inevitable. A preliminary investigation was made, and as the result the Commissioner varied the basic price and subjected the products to averaging. In the meantime, a thorough investigation has been carried out in order to check the fairness of any increase made under the averaging order. </para>

                    <para>In cases to which the general averaging order cannot be applied, it is necessary to fix specific maximum prices. This has been done for certain shipments of imported timber. It was also necessary to fix a specific maximum price for sugar in certain areas. In these areas increases which could not be justified by increased costs were made, and the Commissioner issued a prices order fixing the maximum price at that ruling on the 31st August. </para>
                    <para>Through the central office of the Price Fixing Branch of the Customs Department and through the State offices, numerous complaints concerning increases of prices have been investigated over a wide range of commodities. In some cases where traders have failed to observe the conditions stipulated in the Prices Orders, action has been taken to institute legal proceedings against offenders. In general, however, the business community has observed the conditions stipulated and the system of supervision and inspection has been effective. Thus the retail price index of foodstuffs and groceries for September showed a rise of only 0.3 per cent. on the index for August. This result could not have been achieved without the close co-operation of the State governments, which have made available to the  Deputy  Prices Commissioners experienced officers in addition to those provided by the Commonwealth, mainly from the Customs Department. </para>
                    <para>In regard to rents the Government took prompt action by which rents of shops and houses could be fixed at the level of the 31st August, and to provide a basis for their control during the war. On the 2 7th September, 1939, the National Security (Fair Rents) Regulations were issued. Those regulations give authority to each State to establish a Fair Rents Board to determine fair rents. If the States so desire they may pass their own legislation either in substitution of, or complementary to, Commonwealth legislation. </para>

It is hoped soon afterwards to step up the production from Newnes to about 30,000,000 gallons per annum. Whether the rate of production could be increased immediately by the provision of additional capital, I am unable to say at this stage.

If so, and in view of the fact that many trains run empty, would it not be possible to issue railway warrants without involving extra expense to the Railway Department? </para>

Some of his reports have been issued by the British Government in the form of white papers, and have, I understand, been made available to the members of the House of Commons. Will the Prime Minister inquire whether it is possible to obtain copies of these white papers for distribution among honorable members of this Parliament?  </para>

                        <para>- Can the Prime Minister indicate the precise duties which will be required of Sir Walter Massy-Greene, the newly-appointed  chairman  of the Treasury Finance Committee? Also whether those duties will in any way conflict with good taste from the point of view of advice which might be given to the Government, insofar as concerns his association with private financial institutions - J. B. Were and Son, for instance, and possibly others? </para>

                            <para>- When the honorable member put his question I heard, for the first time, the suggestion of any association between Sir Walter Massy-Greene and J. B. Were and Son. There certainly was no such association until this morning. Sir Walter has been appointed  chairman  of the Treasury Finance Committee, which will otherwise consist of the finance members of the Service boards, a Treasury official, and an official representing the Defence Secretariat. Its function will be to submit to financial scrutiny various proposals that may be made for defence expenditure. Its criticism will be directed to the financial aspect of proposals, and it will submit its reports to the Treasurer. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish to enter into a debate with the honorable member on this point, but I should say that the work could not more efficiently be carried out by the Public Accounts Committee. The Treasury Finance Committee's function will be to scrutinize various proposals before the money is expended, not to make post mortem inquiries regarding expenditure already incurred. Sir Walter Massy-Greene's qualifications for the position are very great indeed. He was, for some time, Acting Treasurer of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>The pre-war negotiations were conducted continuously throughout the present calendar year, under the direction of the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay).</inline> An officer of the Department of Commerce was sent to London to work under the High Commissioner, who directed the London discussions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLeay</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride,</inline> Assistant Minister for Commerce, established continuous contact with representatives of shipping, and of the wool, wheat, meat and dairying industries. These contracts facilitated the pre-war discussions, which resulted in certain important understandings being reached with the United Kingdom Government. </para>
                    <para>It was agreed in July that, in the event of war, the entire Australian wool clip would be purchased by the Government of the United Kingdom for the term of the war. This arrangement was modelled on that which proved so successful during the last war. It is satisfactory alike to the United Kingdom and to Australia. The United Kingdom is able to select wool of types suitable to wartime needs, and has complete control over a commodity of great economic importance in war. Australia is assured of the complete disposal of each clip during the war, and of one complete clip after the war. The uncertainty of the market is eliminated. </para>
                    <para>The pre-war discussions also resulted, in July, in the understanding that the United Kingdom Government would purchase, the export surplus of Australian meat, dairy produce, eggs, dried fruits, and canned fruits. The advantages of such, an arrangement are clear. There is no question of restricting production, of allocating quotas to individual exporters, or of constantly negotiating contracts for relatively small quantities of specified commodities. The position of Australia as an exporter of these products has greatly altered since the last war. Export is now on a substantial scale; and its interruption might create chaotic conditions in the domestic market The free flow of exports according to seasonal conditions is of fundamental, importance, particularly to the livestock industries, and the recognition of this principle beforehand enabled Australia to proceed with normal export activity when war broke out, even before the contracts were concluded. In addition to the above understanding, the way was paved for detailed negotiations for the sale of sugar and base metals. </para>
                    <para>A less favorable result of these preliminary discussions, but nevertheless a valuable forewarning, was the recognition that it would not be possible for the United Kingdom Government to purchase the entire Australian wheat and barley harvests, and that no arrangements could be made for the purchase of wine, apples and pears. </para>
                    <para>When war broke out, negotiations were opened immediately with the United Kingdom Government regarding prices, finance, and other terms of sale. Three factors enabled the Government to cooperate expeditiously with the United Kingdom Government in the handling of needed commodities. These factors were :  - </para>

                    <para class="block">The marketing boards already established to. control the export of meat, dairy produce, dried fruits, canned fruits, apples and pears, and wine, were available for immediate consultation. Experience gained in marketing control enabled the Government to proceed quickly with the establishment of the Central Wool Committee, the Australian Wheat. Board, and a committee to supervise the export of eggs. All of these boards and committees have substantial producer representation, and the Government was thus assured of securing the views of producers in respect of price and market organization. This system of market control has proved of very great value. It has enabled the Government, with the continuous help of the industry representatives, to negotiate quickly. We were, in fact, in all cases ready for finality before the United Kingdom Government had completed negotiations with other countries. As contracts were completed, we were in a position to proceed immediately with the marketing arrangements. The marketing boards have therefore served a twofold purpose; they have assisted the Government in. the negotiations in regard to price and other conditions, and they control marketing, subject to the directions of the Minister for Commerce. </para>
                    <para>The Minister for Commerce has already circulated to honorable members through the post an explanation of the contracts which have been concluded, and of other arrangements that have been made in respect of the major commodities. Honorable members will have noticed that the a mural value of the commodities concerned is approximately £100,000,000. Contracts have actually been completed in respect of commodities of an annual value of about £90,000,000. Details of these contracts, circulated to-day on behalf of the Minister for Commerce, will form an addendum to this statement. Negotiations are proceeding in respect of dried fruits and canned fruits, valued at nearly £3,000,000 annually, and it is estimated that the value of wheat, barley and other commodities which will be sold under wartime contracts will be not less than £8,000,000 annually. . I do not propose verbally to explain in detail the provisions of all of the contracts, but shall leave to honorable members the study of the documents furnished to them. I take this opportunity, however, to mention some aspects of the negotiations concerning wool. </para>
                    <para>The negotiations concerning the price of wool were undertaken at a difficult time. During the year ended June, 1939, the average price of wool had been approximately 10½d. per lb. Australian currency, and there was no sound guide to the future. The Government consulted the Central Wool Committee, on which the wool-growers are represented by Messrs. Abbott, Boyd, and Cole. It was recognized that advantage should not be taken of the position by demanding an unreasonably high price from the United Kingdom Government. At the same time, however, the Government decided that the year just past could not be taken as a guide. In order to raise the matter above a mere bargain based on recent values, the Prime Minister established personal contact with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and arranged for special attention to be paid to this commodity, the price of which has such an important bearing, not only on the financial position of the individual grower, but also on the economic prosperity of the entire Australian community. The negotiations were concluded within a comparatively short time, but during their progress there were daily telegraphic exchanges between Australia and London, and the High Commissioner was in daily personal contact with British Ministers. The arrangement which resulted from the discussions is a very satisfactory one. The entire wool clip has been purchased by the United Kingdom Government for the period of the war, and one year thereafter. There is thus no question of market difficulty, or of unsold carry-over, as far as Australia is concerned. The price of10¾d. per lb. sterling in the store, equal at present exchange rates to 13 7-16d. Australian currency, is approximately 3d. per lb. above the previous year's average. It will bring to Australia an annual income of £12,000,000 in excess of the wool cheque for 1938-39. Three farthings sterling per lb. is added to cover costs from the store to the ship. Moreover, Australia will secure 50 per cent. of the profits accruing from sales of wool for use outside the </para>
                    <para>United Kingdom. The price of wool is arranged in terms of sterling. Should the rate of exchange between the United Kingdom and Australia alter during the operation of the arrangement, such a change would naturally affect the Australian equivalent of the sterling price. Other conditions also may alter, either in the United Kingdom or in Australia, and arrangements have been made for an annual consultation between the Governments of the United Kingdom and Australia with a view to considering whether conditions have so changed as to justify a review of the price. </para>

                    <para>Appraisement of wool is now proceeding steadily, and wool-growers receive their cheques, in respect of 90 per cent. of the appraised value, within fourteen days of appraisement. The balance of 10 per cent. will be paid at the end of each year. Should the appraisements during the first year prove to have been on the conservative side, there will be a further distribution at the end of the year in addition to the 30 per cent. The point is, that the total payments to growers during the cur- ' rent year will be 13 7-16d., multiplied by the total number of pounds of wool appraised. Some growers will get more than 13 7-16d. and some will get less, according to the type and quality of the wool produced by them. </para>
                    <para>Having expounded the position regarding wool - the most important of the many commodities for which satisfactory arrangements have been made - I shall now explain briefly the position regarding wheat, which is the most important of the products that have encountered additional marketing difficulties because of the war. Wheat presents a very difficult problem indeed. Why it has not been possible to make arrangements for the sale to the United Kingdom of the entire Australian wheat harvest is not generally understood. The reasons can be stated briefly. They are - </para>
                    <para>First. - There is more wheat in the world than can be purchased at a price that is payable to producers. </para>
                    <para>Canada, whose recent harvest was the largest for seven years, has at present an export surplus of more than twice the volume of the United Kingdom's annual wheat imports, and Australia's export surplus is equal to rather more than one-half of the United Kingdom's total annual imports. </para>
                    <para>Secondly. - The transport of wheat presents a colossal shipping problem, even in peacetime. It will be clear to honorable members that the problem is greatly intensified under war conditions, particularly as Australia is so far from the centres of consumption in the northern hemisphere. </para>
                    <para>Thirdly. - Because of proximity and for other reasons, the United Kingdom Government finds it expedient to purchase wheat even from European sources, such as Rumania. </para>
                    <para>J  Just  as the problem of wheat could not be solved in peacetime by resort to Empire preference, so also in wartime it is not possible to dispose of the entire Empire surplus of wheat by sale to the United Kingdom. It is possible that, if the war continues for a long period, existing surplus stocks throughout the world may be absorbed and a better price secured for Australian wheat exports. At the present time, however, we have to face the unpleasant fact that the world price is low and is likely to remain low in the near future, that markets are and will be difficult to obtain, and that shipping for transport of wheat over long distances cannot be obtained for the mere asking. The difficult problems confronting wheat marketing cannot, therefore, be solved by Australia or even by the Empire at the present time. All that we can do is to devise means for selling as much wheat as we can at the best price obtainable, and for storing the temporary unsaleable surplus under conditions that will prevent deterioration as far as possible. </para>
                    <para>Negotiations conducted with the United Kingdom Government immediately upon the outbreak of war resulted in the sale of 200,000 tons of old wheat in Western Australia and South Australia at prices which constituted an advance on the prices ruling just before the outbreak of war, and the contract for the sale of 50,000 tons of flour to the United Kingdom Government provided a further outlet for wheat and enabled mills to be employed in its gristing. These deals satisfactorily disposed of the old crop, although the whole of the wheat and flour purchased has not yet been lifted 'by the United Kingdom Government. We are now faced with the problem of the storage, financing, and disposal of the forthcoming harvest, which will probably aggregate not less than 160,000,000 bushels of marketable wheat. The Government is doing its utmost to market this wheat. Negotiations are being conducted with the Government  of  the United Kingdom with a view to arranging the sale of the largest possible quantity at the best price obtainable. At the present time the Government is not in a position to make a forecast as to what the quantity will be, or what price will be received for it. The Government has no desire to hide its anxiety as to the disposal of the balance of the exportable surplus over and above the purchases by the Government of the United Kingdom. Markets will be difficult to secure, and prices cannot be expected to be high. In the meantime, the Australian Wheat Board, on which there is a majority of growers and representatives of cooperative organizations, has recommended that the Government should acquire the wheat, so that it may be marketed to the best advantage, in the interests of the growers. The Government proposes to act on this recommendation and to accept the responsibility for financing advances to the producers, in anticipation of the ultimate disposal of the wheat. </para>
                    <para>The marketing problems of barley, and of apples and pears, have been referred to by the Minister for Commerce in a document that he has circulated to honor-, able members by post. The Australian Barley Board is now functioning, and the Government has acquired the barley crop. As regards apples and pears, an additional detailed statement, which is being circulated for the information of honorable members, will be found as an addendum to this statement. The Australian Apple and Pear Board, composed principally of producers, is working actively on plans for increasing the consumption of apples and pears in Australia, and the Government is exploring all possible avenues of oversea disposal, in the forms of fresh fruit, canned and dried fruit, and fruit juices. It will be necessary to acquire the whole of the crop, to make advances to growers, and to put into operation machinery for the rapid transport of fruit to consuming centres throughout Australia. </para>
                    <para>Early in this statement, I mentioned that storage and shipping are an important feature of the arrangements for the sale of Australian products. A Shipping Control Board has already been appointed to control coastal shipping in Australia if the need arises for close supervision and control of the cargo requirements of our interstate trade. The same machinery will be available for the control of overseas shipping, should such a course be decided upon. The United Kingdom Ministry ofShipping is at present considering its policy in respect of the conduct of the shipping services between the United Kingdom and Australia, and the Commonwealth Government is ready to co-operate fully with it at the appropriate time. Meantime, the Minister for Commerce is in close and constant touch with the Overseas Shipping Representatives Association, and is arranging for the important export industries to appoint . representatives to co-ordinating shipping committees, the object being to ensure that all available shipping space shall be utilized to the best advantage. </para>
                    <para>The transport of refrigerated commodities presents a. particular problem. Thosecommodities have to be stored on land from the time of their production up to the time of their shipment, and they require refrigerated space during transport to the United Kingdom. Some time before the outbreak of war, a survey was made of the refrigerated and cold storage space available on land throughout Australia, and certain deficiencies are now in course of correction. As far as can be judged at present, having regard to the shipping tonnage available, it is anticipated that it will be possible readily to transport overseas the Australian commodities in respect of which contracts have been made. Should the demands on shipping space in various parts of the world become more pressing, the Government's contact with the United Kingdom Government and the shipowners is such that the most efficient possible use will be made of whatever shipping is available. </para>
                    <para>In conclusion, I wish to say that the negotiation of these contracts and the provision of the necessary machinery has entailed an enormous amount of work which has been very ably performed by the Minister for Commerce and his staff, and by the High Commissioner in London and his staff. At the outset of new marketing arrangements, administrative difficulties naturally occur; these are being coped with as they arise. The Government believes that the arrangements it has made will result in the efficient marketing of the commodities it has contracted to sell to the United Kingdom, as well as those for which other marketing arrangements arc necessary. </para>

                <para>Arrangements have been concluded for the sale of, by the Queensland Government to the British Sugar Control Board, the balance of Australia's surplus production of raw sugar c.c the 1939 crop. </para>
                <para>The quantity of raw sugar involved is approximately 332,500 tons, and the price will be 7s.6d. percwt. sterling (£7 10s. per ton) c.i.f. United Kingdom ports, basis 90 degrees polarization, plus the existing British Tariff Preference of £3 15s. on dominion sugar. Any excess of freight rates above £1 15s.6d. per ton, or of insurance above pre-war normal rates will be paid by the British Sugar Control Board. </para>
                <para>These arrangements are subject to an understanding between buyers and sellers that the price is intended to represent the basis of 7s. 6d. per cwt., according to values at the time the negotiations took place, and that in the event of currency or other developments rendering 7s. 6d. inadequate to give sellers ( i.e. the sugar producers ) their present return therefrom, sellers will be entitled to reopen the question of price with a view to revision. </para>
                <para>It has also been agreed that if better terms are granted to other Empire sugar producers, those terms will be extended to Australian sugar. With regard to freights, as long as chartering remains free, the British Sugar Control Board will do everything possible to support the sellers' chartering agents in their endeavours to secure tonnage to meet the approximate monthly requirements under the present contract and, in the event of all ton nage being requisitioned by the BritishGo- vernment, the British Sugar Control Board will continue to assist in the same manner. </para>
                <para>The price and conditions mentioned will result in a net return on Australian raw sugar f.o.b. mill of approximately £10 per ton, which is slightly higher than that from recent sales to the United Kingdom', and compares favorably with the low average return of £8 4s. 3d. per ton on the previous season's exports. </para>
                <para>The arrangement involves an increase of 79,500 tons in the exports from the 1939 crop than had previously been anticipated. Prior to this sale, 130,000 tons of raw sugar had already been exported to Great Britain and 72,500 tons to Canada. The total exports' for the season will thus be 534,500 tons, which will substantially exceed the 1938 season's record exports of 441,786 tons. The export value of the 1939 shipments will be approximately £5,500,000. </para>

                            <para>- The Chair almost despairs of inducing honorable members to conform to the rules in regard to the asking of questions. Honorable members have frequently prefaced their questions to Ministers with the words, " Is the Minister aware " that something has happened, and having made a statement they then proceed to ask that the matter be rectified. The initial statement, although in interrogatory form, is out of order, and is quite, unnecessary. </para>

                        <para>- Following on a question which I asked earlier in the session, I ask the Minister for Information whether he has yet; secured the permission of the Australian Associated Press and Australian Broadcasting Commission to divulge to the public the details, particularly the financial details, of the agreement arrived at between them for the privilege of broadcasting news. If not, is it his intention to continue to refuse . to do so, and to leave the public in the dark with regard to the matter? </para>

When we meet to-morrow further statements will be made by Ministers. It is proposed that the remainder of this week, and probably at least the first day of next week, shall be devoted to the discussion of the various ministerial statements. </para>

                        <para>On the 6th October, 1939, the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner gazetted tea as a commodity the maximum price of which is fixed under the provisions of Prices Regulation Order No. 2 gazetted on the 5th October, 1930. One large tea merchant, applying the " averaging " provisions of this order, on the 9th October, 1939, increased wholesale prices by 3d. per lb. Increases ranging up to 3d. per lb. have since been made by othermer- chants. Test checks by the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner have revealed that the increases arc justified on account of increased costs. </para>
