<INTERJECT CHAIR="1" SPEAKER="Mr SPEAKER" NAMEID="10000">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr SPEAKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 24 June 1983, I approved a request from the then Leader of the House to allow certain Hansard reports of the proceedings of this House to be adduced into evidence and referred to by the Royal Commission on Australia's Security and Intelligence Agencies-the Hope Royal Commission. Before giving that approval, I satisfied myself that it was in accordance with a similar decision made on 20 July 1982 by my predecessor, Sir Billy Snedden, in respect of the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry and that to refuse the request could cause a delay in the work of the Royal Commission. In my absence overseas, my decision was conveyed by the Deputy Speaker on my behalf to the Leader of the House (Mr Lionel Bowen), the Attorney-General (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Manager of the Opposition Business in this House, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). In doing so, it was made clear that my approval was given on the understanding that the Royal Commissioner and counsel assisting the Royal Commission were aware of, and would have proper regard to, the limitations imposed by article 9 of the Bill of Rights as applied by section 49 of the Constitution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 25 July 1983, I approved a request that certain additional Hansard reports could be adduced into evidence before the Royal Commission and advised the Attorney-General and Manager of Opposition Business in this House of this further approval.</PARA>
<PARA> A statement of issues to be resolved in respect of paragraph (c) of the Commission's terms of reference was published on 11 July 1983. When informed of this statement, it appeared to me that certain of those issues posed a potential threat to the privileges of the Parliament in that they purported to question the actions of certain persons in this House which would be an infringement of article 9 of the Bill of Rights. My concern was conveyed to the Royal Commission and on 28 July I was informed that it was proposed to omit one of the issues and to amend others. Nevertheless, the Royal Commissioner was still facing a difficult area in respect of the issue of parliamentary privilege and I considered it prudent that I should engage a solicitor to brief counsel to represent me, as the custodian of the rights of this House, when the question of parliamentary privilege was argued before the Commission. The firm of Stephen Jaques Stone James was engaged and Mr I. M. Wales briefed as junior counsel and the Hon. T. E. F. Hughes, QC, as senior counsel. Having briefed counsel, I informed the staff of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Attorney-General and the Manager of Opposition Business in this House of my action.</PARA>
<PARA> The question of parliamentary privilege was argued before the Royal Commission on 1 August and my decision to seek representation was vindicated when counsel representing one of the parties before the Commission stated that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we want to question ministers about statements made by them in the house . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Whilst His Honour immediately indicated that this prima facie would be within the scope of privilege, it was clear that my representation before the Commission and argument put by Mr Hughes on my behalf served to assist in clarification of the application of the law of parliamentary privilege in respect of the matters before the Royal Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> I continued to have representation before the Royal Commission through Mr S. L. Walmsley, instructed by Stephen Jaques Stone James, during the examination of the Prime Minister, the former Leader of the House, Mr Young, the Minister for Defence (Mr Scholes) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock). Subsequently , the President of the Senate engaged the same firm of solicitors and counsel to represent him on behalf of the Senate during the hearing of evidence by the Attorney-General, Senator Gareth Evans.</PARA>
<PARA> I should say that the somewhat unique action I took was designed to help ensure that no action was taken or decisions made before the Royal Commission which would have the effect of eroding the privileges of this House. Freedom of speech is an essential of a free parliament in a democratic society. To allow any action which would result in members of this House being questioned by outside authorities in respect of statements made by them in this House or their motives in making those statements would amount to a serious weakening of that privilege . Such action is reserved for the House itself. Finally, it must be remembered that the privilege is that of the Parliament as a whole and not that of an individual member or of the collection of members who, for the time being, constitute the membership of the Parliament. For me to have ignored the potential threat to the privilege of this institution would have been a very serious dereliction of my duties and my responsibilities to this House as its Speaker.</PARA>

As you have indicated, Mr Speaker, this unique action had as its root the essence of free speech in a democratic society. It is a reminder that what transpires in this House is distinct and separate from what transpires elsewhere. This distinction is historic and fundamental to our freedoms. It is also a reminder of the way this Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has sought to blur these distinctions, to denigrate the institution of Parliament even to the point of having explained to the Royal Commission on Australia's Security and Intelligence Agencies the reasons for the resignation of a Minister , a matter which properly should be put before this Parliament. But no, counsel for the Government did this before the Royal Commission. If that was not bad enough, Mr Speaker, this Prime Minister has sought to bludgeon and muzzle not just members of the media but also members of the Opposition in the most outrageous manner, even to the point of threatening me with being charged with contempt of the Royal Commission.

However, the point that is of interest in your statement is that there always has to be vigilance by Parliament in respect of what can happen. This is not the first time that an attempt has been made to make statements given in this House the subject of cross-examination in a court of law. Such an attempt was made in respect of my colleague the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren). It has happened in the past. Whilst we fully appreciate what has happened, Mr Speaker, we applaud the action you took, with the safeguards you have indicated. We thank you for your statement.

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that whereas the Government of Australia has signed the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which in Article 23 (1) states that 'The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to the protection by society and the State' and whereas the terms of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women would violate the above Article 23 (1).</PARA>
<PARA> We humbly pray the Government to refrain from ratifying the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women; believing that its implementation would result in:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Undue cost to the nation at this time.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) 'The elimination of any stereotyped concept of roles of men and women at all levels' as described in Part 3 Article 10 (c), being a disruption of traditional parental roles, is likely to result in emotional disturbances of childhood.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The strong encouragements to mothers to join the workforce, with the provision of networks of creches and child care centres as outlined in Article 11 of the convention is likely to result in maternal deprivation and psychological disturbances among children with an increase in childhood psychiatric illnesses.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The sexual role changing as recommended in Part 3 Article 10 (c) is likely to contribute to further marriage insecurity and breakdown.</PARA>

<PARA> That chiropractors provide a safe, effective and economical health care service that is complementary to medicine.</PARA>
<PARA> That the introduction of a federally funded health care system restricted to the services provided almost exclusively by the medical profession restricts the freedom to select the health care practitioner of one's choice and does nothing to reduce the high cost of health care in Australia.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MI4">Mr PEACOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is in writing and it is seconded by the right honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony). The decision by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to leave open the position in Cabinet of the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) is an act of gross impropriety. We move the suspension of Standing Orders for him to explain the reasons behind this and the circumstances surrounding the resignation of the Minister. This is not a royal commission; there is no need for someone to be briefed to explain the circumstances. The Government is answerable to this Parliament. The Prime Minister and all Ministers derive their authority from the people and through this Parliament. On the day the Parliament resumed we are entitled at least to an explanation of why , firstly, this Minister resigned and, secondly, the Prime Minister has subsequently determined to leave the vacancy open. The Parliament-I repeat, the Parliament-has received no explanation whatsoever. By leaving the way open for the return of the honourable member for Port Adelaide, the Prime Minister is unquestionably treating our system of government with contempt. Furthermore, he is treating this Parliament-this House-with contempt. He has a duty to explain his actions to this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It certainly does appear that the Prime Minister has surrendered to the dictum of the honourable member for Port Adelaide. Honourable members will recall it. During the one-day sitting of the Parliament in April this year the honourable member said: 'If you have the numbers, you might as well use them.' The Prime Minister will seek to hide behind those numbers and debase this Parliament, thereby, I assume, leaving the way open for the honourable member's return to the Ministry. By so doing he downgrades the impropriety of his own very similar actions. </PARA>
<PARA> Standing Orders should be suspended so that the Prime Minister can explain the conduct of the honourable member for Port Adelaide as, indeed, he ought to as a Minister of the Crown. The honourable member for Port Adelaide abandoned his responsibilities as a Cabinet Minister and as a member of the Cabinet Sub- Committee on National and International Security. The House is entitled to an explanation of why the Prime Minister is anxious to ignore this behaviour.

In other words, he did believe that what the former Special Minister of State had done was very serious and that it also bore on matters of national security.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This comes to why we are having this debate. Mr Speaker, I accept your ruling on the point of order but I remind the House that honourable members opposite, through their actions, are accountable to this institution. They cannot hide behind another body in circumstances in which they are answerable to this Parliament. Frankly, the actions of the honourable member for Port Adelaide deserve the strongest censure. By keeping his ministerial seat warm the Prime Minister compounds the disgrace of the actions committed by him. We look forward to the Prime Minister telling us why on 13 May the honourable member for Port Adelaide issued a statement revealing that on 22 April he had told a Mr Cameron that the Government 'was about to kick out a Russian'. In the letter that he wrote to the Prime Minister he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My brief comment in my office was, during that time, the only reference to the expulsion of Mr Ivanov. </PARA>
<PARA>As honourable members will recall, at that time the Opposition quite properly demanded the resignation of the honourable member. It was clear that he had breached national security by revealing a matter of the greatest sensitivity. Undoubtedly, by the subsequent actions of the Prime Minister, particularly yesterday, a naive and cavalier approach has been taken to the honourable member 's impropriety. </PARA>
<PARA> But let us go back further, beyond the Caucus meeting of yesterday. All that the Prime Minister did was tell the honourable member for Port Adelaide that his leak was 'not an appropriate thing for him to say'. The Prime Minister added in Parliament that he accepted the assurances of his Minister about his conduct during that luncheon. Indeed, there were words used to the effect, 'I am not going to question the matter any further'. That relates to the conduct of the Prime Minister himself in not adequately probing, in not adequately questioning, in not adequately analysing what transpired. As I shall develop, as a consequence of the way in which this House was misled by the former Minister, the Prime Minister was associated with misleading this House. The fabrications of his colleague caused the Prime Minister also to mislead the Parliament. I shall be looking forward to the reasons why the Prime Minister does not regard those facts that to date I have briefly outlined as serious enough to keep the honourable member out of the Ministry. Clearly, he wants him back. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us contemplate the Prime Minister's words to this House on 17 May:</PARA>
<PARA> While it was not appropriate for the Minister to have made the statement that he did, he has in all other respects acted as we, that is the honourable member and me, would expect him to do-with honour and propriety. </PARA>
<PARA>The true value of the honour and propriety of the honourable member for Port Adelaide, to use the Prime Minister's own words, was soon to be revealed. But why was it not revealed in this House? Why had it not been probed, and why was the House misled? Of course, on 14 July the Prime Minister announced the honourable member's resignation from the Ministry. There was a four-day interlude before we were told why. We were not told by the Prime Minister, though-by the head of this Government. We were told by the Government's counsel to the Hope Royal Commission. As we know, there was nothing in that statement by counsel on that day that could not have been stated by the man who is answerable to this Parliament and the people. There was no need for him to brief counsel to make that statement. It was sufficient to call a Press conference and cast aspersions on elements of matters before the Royal Commission, but it was not sufficient to call a Press conference or to come before this Parliament, without the urging of the Opposition, to indicate why a Minister had resigned. </PARA>
<PARA> The man of honour, the man of propriety-again, to use the Prime Minister's words-had evidently, we later discover, told another of his friends-dare I say ' cronies'-this time his old mate Eric Walsh, that Mr Combe was involved with Mr Ivanov, to quote the honourable member, 'in a fairly messy scenario' which the Government had been looking at that day. Was this deliberate premeditated tip- off, this leak which amounted to a breach of national security, to the commercial advantage of Mr Walsh and his client, the reason for the honourable member's resignation? I assume that the Prime Minister will tell us. Was the commercial advantage to Mr Walsh the reason? I trust that the Prime Minister will tell us. Or was it the fact that the leak took place while Mr Combe was still under surveillance and, on the Prime Minister's own admission, was a potential security risk? Was that the reason? Will the Prime Minister tell us? Or was the reason this breach of national security which brought with it the risk that Mr Ivanov could be tipped off well before he was officially informed of his expulsion? I trust that we shall be told. </PARA>
<PARA> In listening carefully to the first two elements that I have raised, as to whether there was a commercial advantage to Mr Walsh, I ask honourable members to bear in mind that others who were telephoned on a given weekend received a commercial advantage, and to bear in mind that when these others were tipped off , the leak, the tipping off, the leak of the call to Mr Butler and Mr Farmer, took place while Mr Combe was still under surveillance. I trust that we shall be told how the Prime Minister distances himself from the actions of the former Special Minister of State and that he will come clean. We shall be interested in facts, in details, in reasons and, if you like, in the propriety of a mea culpa. So seriously did the Prime Minister view the misdemeanor of the Special Minister of State that the asked the Attorney-General (Senator Gareth Evans) to advise whether the member had breached the Crime Act. Of course, that investigation is still underway. Are any others to have their actions referred to the Attorney- General for investigation? Are any other telephone calls, cases of wilful or unwilful commercial gain, leaks while people are under surveillance, also to be referred to the Attorney-General? If they are not, I will listen with interest as to why not. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that these matters have to be fully explained to this Parliament by the Prime Minister and, indeed, by the honourable member for Port Adelaide. Observers of the Hope Royal Commission were stunned to learn that the indiscretion of the honourable member for Port Adelaide extended still further. He revealed recently that he had told all the lucky participants at the now famous 22 April luncheon of the expulsion of Mr Ivanov at least half an hour before it was announced. I regret to say again-no one gets any pleasure in these matters-that the honourable member misled the Prime Minister and the Australian people about his actions on 22 April. Honourable members cannot escape from that harsh reality. After all that and after revelations which have shown that the honourable member has behaved regrettably, with a degree of impropriety which to date is unprecedented, the Prime Minister still wants to leave the way open for the return of the honourable member for Port Adelaide to the Ministry. Why? I trust he will tell us why, because the motion he has accepted relates not only, bear in mind, to the Prime Minister's acceptance of the Minister's resignation but also to the reasons for his leaving that position open. We wish to know why the Prime Minister is not filling that vacancy at this moment. Has the Prime Minister warmly embraced, we may ask, the arguments of those members of Caucus who have urged him to forget about 'Westminster purities' and take account 'of political realities' by not filling the portfolio of the honourable member for Port Adelaide with a full time successor?</PARA>
<PARA> There is one further serious question. Will the honourable member for Port Adelaide not only return to the Cabinet but also very shortly regain his place on the National and International Security Committee? That is a reasonable question to pose when one bears in mind that the Prime Minister said only recently that the disclosure by the honourable member of matters from that Committee was both very serious and bore on matters of national security. How, then, can he return to these positions? Of all the improprieties of the Labor Government-and there have been enough of those in less than six months; it seems interminably longer than that-the decision to leave open the vacancy of a man who is now discredited must be one of the worst. The House looks forward to the reasons why both the resignation occurred and, more particularly, the position is being kept vacant. I hope that honourable members will remember for a lengthy period the words of the honourable member for Port Adelaide to this House on 17 May. The House will remember that on that day he was asked by the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Fife) whether he recalled taking his ministerial oath of office and swearing that he would not 'directly or indirectly reveal such matters as shall be debated in Council and committed to his secrecy'. The honourable member for Port Adelaide replied to that question as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> I was so excited-I had just been shown the salaries of Ministers-that I forgot what really the commitment was when I was sworn in. </PARA>
<PARA>That pretty slick approach to ministerial responsibility comes home to roost in circumstances such as these. At least we can say on that occasion the honourable member told the truth, and I trust that in that spirit we will get a truthful explanation from the Prime Minister himself, because this matter goes to the heart of ministerial conduct and government in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> When one bears in mind the remarks that I made earlier, when you, Mr Speaker, properly informed us of the actions that you had taken, that this Prime Minister had not only refused to give an explanation-not only for the Parliament but also for the people-but also had sought to traduce, bludgeon and muzzle members of this Parliament and members of the media should they choose to interpret his action and his words in a manner with which he did not concur, it is now opportune to hear the fullest possible explanation. I have never, in the history of my participation in this Parliament, seen any occupant of the prime ministership seek to take action which could lead to the Leader of the Opposition in this country being thrown in gaol for political comment. If I have to keep referring outside to the actions of this Prime Minister I will, but at least today, by our persistence, we have forced this Prime Minister to his feet and we have forced him to indicate to the Parliament what he has run away from until today; an explanation to the Australian people as to why the Minister resigned and particularly an explanation as to why, in all the circumstances which amount to a gross breach of national security, the honourable member should be considered proper to return to the Ministry in the shortest space of time. At the end of a speech, after this matter was first raised by way of a statement in this House back in May, I said that a judicious Prime Minister would not have handled this matter in this manner and that a judicious Prime Minister would not have embarked on this course of action but would have thought through the consequences of it from the breach of civil liberties to the breaches of national security right from the start. One was forced to say then that the current occupant is not a judicious man. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had prepared a few notes on the basis that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) and those behind him would have had the courage to use the forms of this House to move censure against this Government if they had reason to believe that any actions that I or the Government had taken in respect of the matters to which they have now alluded warranted such action. As, Mr Speaker, they have not had that courage I will make use of some of the material that I have briefly prepared in this respect. I commence my remarks by saying something about the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young). The House has just listened to this confected indignation of the Leader of the Opposition. In the course of that confected indignation, a very considerable disservice has been done to the honourable member for Port Adelaide. I will have a good deal to say-</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As will become clear, certain actions of the honourable member for Port Adelaide were improper and unauthorised, a fact recognised by the honourable member for Port Adelaide, and certain consequences have flowed from those facts. I am not going to listen to the Leader of the Opposition refer to the honourable member for Port Adelaide as though, in speaking about those matters, he has exhausted all that need properly be said in these circumstances about that honourable member. From the time when this Government was commissioned on 11 March, the honourable member for Port Adelaide assumed the position of Special Minister of State and, during the period when he occupied that portfolio responsibility, he was an excellent Minister. He has in respect of the Australian Labor Party, this Government and this country done many fine things in his very short period of tenure of that office, things which have been carried on by his successor and which will move to bring about, after so many years of neglect by the conservative forces of this country, an electoral system which will be worthy of a democracy. If in these circumstances we will be dealing, as we must to some extent, with the honourable member for Port Adelaide , let fairness be done and let it be acknowledged that, in his brief period in office, he has done many excellent things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true that, in respect of certain issues that arose following the meetings of the Cabinet Sub-Committee on National and International Security on 20 and 21 April, the honourable member for Port Adelaide did certain things which, as I say, were improper, but I will come to those in a moment. However, I want it clearly established at the outset that I and those people behind me are not going to allow these proceedings to go apace in terms of a total denigration of this man. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me come to the circumstances of the matter in my way. But, before I do, let me say this: The Leader of the Opposition, at one point in his parade of, as I say, confected indignation, said: 'Let me go back to the Royal Commission'. Let me at the outset of my remarks warn the Leader of the Opposition that, in the period since 21 April, he has trod a very dangerous path in terms of how he deals with a royal commission. I do not want to go into those details because I and the members of my Government will proceed on the path that we have followed consistently since the time when, with the support of the Opposition, we established the Royal Commission on Australia's security and Intelligence Agencies. In respect of the matters properly before the Royal Commission, we have said that we will deal with them within the Royal Commission and not use the processes outside it to try, in any way, to put an improper pressure upon the Royal Commissioner who has under the letters patent the obligation to deal with those matters. However, to some extent obviously in dealing with this matter in these circumstances I will have to go in some way to some of those issues. I want to make the point-and I ask every honourable member of the Opposition to remember it-that every honourable member on this side of the House is looking forward to the day when the report of the Royal Commission is brought down and this Parliament in this House and in the other place will have a full and unfettered opportunity to deal with every matter that went before the Royal Commission, including the actions of the Leader of the Opposition and other people around him. </PARA>
<PARA> Having made those preliminary observations, I make the first point-it ought not to have escaped the attention of honourable members opposite but in some way it seems to have escaped them-that as from 14 July the honourable member for Port Adelaide ceased to be a Minister in this Cabinet. He is not now a Minister. Why is he not a Minister? The reason is that he came to me on the morning of 14 July and he resigned. </PARA>

The Minister came to me because he recognised that he had breached Cabinet confidentiality and that he had not informed me of that fact. I did not have to seek his resignation; he gave it to me and he gave it to me for those reasons. It is quite clear why the Minister resigned. He came to me and he pointed out that he had breached confidentiality and he had not informed me of it. On the basis of what he put to me, of course the resignation was accepted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true-in no way do I try to hide the fact-that there can be legitimate divisions of opinion as to whether, that having happened, there should have been an immediate recourse to fill that vacancy, whether in fact it was an appropriate course of action not to fill the vacancy at that point or whether, as the actions of the Minister were very much an issue before the Royal Commission, it was not inappropriate to allow that vacancy to remain unfilled until such time as the Royal Commissioner dealt with that matter in his report under terms of reference (c). </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, in terms of those differences of view, the position that was adopted after considerable discussion was that it would not be inappropriate -the position in respect of the Special Minister of State having been filled and the responsibilities of government having been carried out by the allocation of responsibilities- to allow the full matter to be considered by the Royal Commissioner and in the light of that report appropriate action would be taken. I repeat that when the Minister came to me and pointed out what he had done action was taken at that point to deal with the matter and it remains in that position. It is entirely inappropriate to suggest and there is no evidence to sustain the proposition, in the language of the Leader of the Opposition, that the ministerial seat is being kept warm. There is nothing whatsoever to sustain that proposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As distinct from the attitude of the Opposition, it has been decided that all members of this Government will await the report of the Royal Commissioner. In considering the report of the royal commissioner we will attach what weight has to be attached to it in regard to this issue. There is no guarantee at all, nor does the honourable member for Port Adelaide understand that there is any guarantee, that through our delaying the filling of this vacancy until such time as the report of the Royal Commissioner is available he will be returned to the Ministry. Neither I, nor the Cabinet, nor any member of the Caucus nor the honourable member for Port Adelaide believe that there is any such guarantee in the course of action that has been adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a reasonable course of action in a debate such as this to consider what is the right and the authority of those opposite to deal with these matters. Do they come with clean hands? Mr Speaker, I want to take the House with me through a consideration of the entitlements of those opposite, particularly the Leader of the Opposition, to speak on this matter in any way which will allow members of this House to place any credence at all on the Leader of the Opposition coming into this House and addressing himself to questions of resignation in general and questions of resignation in particular related to the co-existence of royal commissions. Let me address myself to this question of the resignations of Ministers. When the honourable member for Port Adelaide came into my office on 14 July, I did not have to look into his eyes, those misty Irish eyes; nor did I have to examine his visage to see whether he was serious in the proffering of his resignation. When he came to me, he gave me his resignation and said: ' Here it is'. That is quite distinct from what happens when people from the other side of the chamber and their associated parties engage in this question of the submission of resignations. Look not only at what happened in respect of their colleagues but also at the way in which the Leader of the Opposition got involved in this question of resignations. When members of the Leader of the Opposition's own Party went along to the Leader of the National Party in Queensland the other day and said: 'We submit our resignations', what did the Leader of the National Party, the Premier, in that State do? He said: 'I looked into their eyes; I examined their countenances. When I looked into their eyes and I examined their countenances I formed the opinion that they were not really serious about submitting their resignations'. So off he went to the Governor of Queensland and said: 'Your Excellency, some Ministers submitted resignations to me but I looked into their eyes and I examined their countenances and they were not serious. So do not take these resignations of these Liberal Ministers seriously, Your Excellency'. Of course, we were not privy to what happened in the private studies of the Governor, but presumably the Governor smiled back at Mr Bjelke-Petersen, the Leader of the National Party, and he said: 'Of course, yes, we have these resignations. But I accept your word, Mr Premier, that they are not serious resignations. So let us forget those resignations'. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, that was not the end of the story. I have been asked a number of questions; I will return the compliment. I ask whether the resignations of those Liberal Ministers were proper. Were they contrived? More importantly as regards the Leader of the Opposition in this House, was any improper pressure put on those Liberal Ministers to get them to withdraw their resignations and, subsequently, was any improper pressure applied by the Leader of the Opposition in this House? Did the Leader of the Opposition in this House seek to exert any improper pressure upon those Ministers to make them resubmit their resignations? If one addresses that set of questions about whether they were real resignations , whether any improper pressure was put upon those Ministers and whether those resignations were contrived, the answers one gets will depend on the side of the House to which one puts the questions. If one were to ask the Leader of the Opposition one would get one set of answers. However, if one asked the Leader of the National Party (Mr Anthony) one would get another set of answers. With what authority does the Leader of the Opposition come in here and talk about resignations when, in the recent past, in Queensland, he has been involved, as has the Leader of the National Party in this House, in a series of sordid machinations to try to conjure up reality, or rather unreality, in regard to the resignations of seven Liberal Party Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me be even more direct in regard to the people opposite and the question of resignations associated with royal commissions. We can see what sort of seriousness should be attached to these people who purport to come in here and talk in terms of principle. I remind honourable members that just under 12 months ago we witnessed in this House an exhibition of principle on the part of these people in relation to resignations and royal commissions. Honourable members will remember that on 12 September 1981 letters patent were issued by the previous Government to Mr Justice Woodward. I remind the House that those letters required Mr Justice Woodward to inquire into:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Whether administrative arrangements and procedures for the supervision of the handling of meat for export are adequate to ensure that all meat exported from Australia meets the requirements prescribed by law;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Whether malpractices are occurring, or have occurred, in the handling of meat for export or the exportation of meat;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Allegations made, whether in public or to a Minister, department or authority of the Commonwealth, of malpractices alleged to have occurred during the past ten years, in the handling of meat for export or in the exportation of meat;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Whether such allegations were dealt with in a manner that was adequate and effective;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) Whether in response to such allegations, any illegality or corruption occurred. </PARA>
<PARA>Those letters patent were issued on 12 September 1981. The matter came on for debate after the handing down of the report of the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry in this House on 21 September 1982. We will see just what were the principles and commitments of honourable members opposite in regard to what should happen with resignations and the relationship of those resignations to a royal commission when they had to deal with such a matter 12 months ago. When honourable members analyse just what they did on 21 September of last year they will see, for what it is worth, that the statement by the Leader of the Opposition is hypocrisy at its worst. When the report of the Royal Commission was tabled in this House the then Minister for Primary Industry, on the basis of the report, offered his resignation to the Prime Minister of the time. But the Prime Minister refused to accept the resignation of the Minister for Primary Industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The previous Government appointed a royal commissioner to investigate those matters. On the basis of the report of the Royal Commission the Minister for Primary Industry felt compelled to proffer his resignation to the then Prime Minister. All Opposition members who served under that Prime Minister-some, of course, with self-imposed interruptions which were conveniently brought to an end-accepted that the proper course of action and adherence to principle required certain things to happen. Firstly, a royal commission was appointed to examine those matters, secondly, on the basis of the report of the Royal Commission, the Minister who was under investigation felt impelled to tender his resignation, thirdly, the previous Government refused to accept his resignation and the then Prime Minister, with the total support of members of the previous government in this House, set about traducing the Royal Commissioner whom he had appointed. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable members opposite what the then Leader of the Opposition, the present Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Hayden), felt properly impelled to say, in terms of the totally unprincipled action followed by the previous Government. Having heard the despicable performance of the then Prime Minister, who was backed entirely by members of his government, the then Leader of the Opposition stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The behaviour of the Prime Minister today destroys the tradition of independent service on royal commissions. </PARA>
<PARA>Anyone in this House who had any respect for proper procedures was absolutely appalled by the lack of principle demonstrated by the previous Government. It appointed a royal commissioner who brought down his report. The Minister tendered his resignation, but it was not accepted and the Prime Minister of the day--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I can understand the concern of honourable members opposite at the exposure of the hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition and all Opposition members who supported him. The present Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Kerin), in his capacity as the then shadow Minister for Primary Industry, made a very proper observation on 21 September last year, which appears at page 1675 of Hansard. In respect of the proceedings of that day he stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It shows that the offered resignation of the Minister for Primary Industry was a sham. Obviously when he went to the Prime Minister or discussions were held they said: 'Here is the problem; what is the best way to get out of it?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, let us put interjections to one side and examine how clean are the hands of the Leader of the Opposition and every honourable member opposite in respect of the question of resignations being offered in the context of a royal commission. We can judge the principles which were applied by them less than 12 months ago. In September 1982, they followed principles which were totally unacceptable. I repeat what they said: 'We will appoint a royal commissioner'. Having appointed him, they got a report. In the light of the actions which he had undertaken and which were investigated and reported upon by the Royal Commission, the then Minister for Primary Industry said: 'I must tender my resignation'. He tendered it. And what did members opposite do? They rejected the resignation of the Minister. Not content with rejecting the resignation, they then embarked in this House on a course of action which had never before been embarked upon in the history of this Parliament. The then Prime Minister, supported by each and every honourable member sitting still behind him, attacked the Royal Commissioner whom they had appointed. They appointed him; they established the letters patent. They told him what to investigate. He brought down his report and the report was such a damning indictment that the then Minister for Primary Industry felt impelled to submit his resignation. Members opposite did not accept the resignation which flowed from the report of their own Royal Commission. Not content with that, they then took to Mr Justice Woodward, the Royal Commissioner whom they had appointed, and traduced him and accused him of being selective in regard to the evidence with which he had dealt . They said that he had used half the Kelly report to sustain the conclusions of the Royal Commission. They said that he deliberately left out the other half of the Kelly report. That is what members opposite do in respect of royal commissions. Those are their standards in respect of resignations. Less than 12 months ago they followed a course of action unprecedented in the history of this Parliament by which they made a mockery of the concept of ministerial responsibility. Their own Minister felt impelled to resign as a result of their own Royal Commission. They would not accept that and they then set about attacking the Royal Commissioner. Mr Speaker, I ask you to contrast what happened then with what happened on this occasion. On this occasion the Royal Commission was not finished. The honourable member for Port Adelaide did not say : 'I am going to wait now until the report of the Royal Commission'. He came to me and he submitted his resignation; and it was accepted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It obviously hurts because the contrast is absolutely stark. As distinct from the then Government's miserable performance in September 1982, this Minister did not go to his Prime Minister and say: 'Let us see how we can get out of this. I will put in a sham resignation'. He did not do anything of the sort. Without even waiting until the Royal Commission finished, he said: 'I put my resignation in now'; and it was accepted. In that context, and because his action is involved in the consideration of the Royal Commission, it was regarded as reasonable for this Party and this Government to decide that no further action would be taken in regard to filling that vacancy until the report of the Royal Commission came down. But I tell honourable members opposite this: The course of action followed by this Government and by the honourable member for Port Adelaide is the opposite of what they did less than 12 months ago when they concocted a sham resignation, accepted the rejection of that resignation by the Prime Minister and then embarked upon a totally unprincipled attack upon the Royal Commissioner whom they had appointed. Our course of action was principled. The honourable member for Adelaide had acted improperly. He had acted without authorisation. He recognised that and he came to the Prime Minister. We did not confect some sham resignation. The resignation was put clearly and it was accepted. He is not a Minister now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As distinct from what honourable members opposite did less than 12 months ago, we will wait until the report of the Royal Commission comes down. This matter will then be dealt with in the light of that report. But honourable members opposite will not find this Prime Minister acting as their Prime Minister acted less than 12 months ago when he attacked in this House the royal commissioner that his Government had appointed. That has never happened before in the history of this country. That instance was the exception. It happened under the previous Prime Minister whom the Leader of the Opposition does not now exactly regard as a helpmate in his present crisis. Nevertheless, the course of action that was followed by the honourable member for Port Adelaide can be distinctly contrasted with the action of the previous Minister for Primary Industry. My action as Prime Minister can be contrasted with the action of the previous Prime Minister when, with the total support of honourable members opposite, he rejected the resignation of the then Minister for Primary Industry, submitted on the basis of the Royal Commissioner's report about the matters involving whether that Minister should retain his portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the honourable member for Port Adelaide has made no attempt to disguise the fact that he acted improperly in this matter. He told me that and he has given evidence on oath to the Royal Commission in respect of what happened. He recognised on 14 July that the action he had taken in April warranted his resignation and, manfully, he submitted that resignation. It was accepted and he does not now occupy a position in the Ministry. The position that he occupied is now being filled by the Minister for Aviation (Mr Beazley). Honourable members opposite know that under the requirements of the relevant legislation there do not have to be more than 27 Ministers. When they were in office they had a Minister occupying and discharging the duties of more than one portfolio. There is not the beginning of a suggestion that the responsibilities of government are not being properly discharged by the Minister for Aviation in his dual capacity of Minister for Aviation and Special Minister of State. The needs of this country and the responsibility of government are being properly discharged. The actions of the honourable member for Port Adelaide are a subject of investigation by the Royal Commissioner. We understand that he will be reporting within a relatively short time. When the report of the Royal Commissioner is brought down it will be examined by me, by members of the Cabinet and by all members of Caucus. </PARA>
<PARA> The former Minister has clearly indicated that he acted improperly. He is already serving punishment by not being a Minister. He is serving his punishment . The question of how long that has to go on, particularly in the light of what the Royal Commissioner has to say, will be properly considered by the Government and by all members of Caucus. I ask you, Mr Speaker, and all honourable members to contrast the action of this Minister with that of the Minister in the previous Government, the action of this Prime Minister with the action of the previous Prime Minister, and the treatment of the present Royal Commissioner by this Government with the treatment of the Royal Commissioner appointed by the previous Government. Honourable members opposite traduced him in this House. On all bases of comparison the honourable member for Port Adelaide has acted infinitely more honourably than did the other Minister concerned. I as Prime Minister have acted infinitely more properly than did the previous Prime Minister who refused, with the support of all honourable members opposite, to accept his Minister's resignation and who then attacked the Royal Commissioner. At each point of comparison the actions of the ex-Minister, of me as Prime Minister and of this Government show out in stark contrast against the total impropriety of what was done by the previous Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks in respect of this temporary Leader of the Opposition by suggesting that what happened yesterday was indicative of the sort of thing that will happen to him. So desperate is he to get some recognition that he and the Leader of the National Party were observed bobbing around on camels opposite Parliament House. The Leader of the Opposition is really battling when he needs publicity so badly that he is seen bobbing on the back of a camel. I understand that when he descended from the back of the camel the lovely Gucci shoes descended into something less salubrious. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have witnessed today from the Leader of the Opposition and those who sit behind him in this House demonstrates why they are destined to sit for such a long period on that side of the House. For the last decade they have debased the coinage of Australian politics. They have mouthed piously their adherence to the concepts of law and order and of principle. Every action they have undertaken in the last decade has made a mockery of standards of decency and of principle. On every occasion they have been hypocritical in respect of this so- called adherence to law and order. They were hypocritical during the period from 1972 to 1975 and when they were in office from 1976 to 1983. While they mouthed adherence to law and order, every relevant action made a mockery of it. As I have said, they were in respect of the situation with the Royal Commission last year. They were in respect of the so-called resignation of their Minister. They were in respect of the so-called independent Royal Commission they established. </PARA>
<PARA> When this matter comes to its finality when the report of the Royal Commissioner is brought down, including his recommendation on the matter of the honourable member for Port Adelaide, for the first time this House will have a full opportunity of examining every aspect of this whole issue of the Royal Commission, including the actions of the honourable member for Port Adelaide, the actions of the Leader of the Opposition and the actions of the Leader of the National Party. I indicate to this House that at that time-when that report is considered-the fullest opportunity will be provided to the House for the fullest debate on every aspect of this matter. In the light of that report this Government will also take final action in respect of the matters concerning the honourable member for Port Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude, as I began, by saying that I will not stand idly by and see the honourable member for Port Adelaide traduced in this debate as though he has not made a fine contribution to the Government of this country, the business of this country and the welfare of the people of Australia. He has made such a contribution. He made a grievous mistake for which he resigned and for which I accepted his resignation. I believe that it is the hope not only of the people on this side of the House but the majority of the people of Australia that when he has served an appropriate period of penance-or whatever one wants to call it- for the inappropriate action that he followed, at some later appropriate stage the people of Australia will once again be able to have the value of his services in government. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. This report was prepared by Mr O. F. Roach, who was then a partner in the firm of consulting actuaries, E. S. Knight &amp; Co. It was provided to the previous Government just before the general election. Mr Roach was asked to compare the advantages and/or disadvantages of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme with those of other schemes available for comparable staff in the private sector and for State public servants. This was a formidable task, because the diversity of arrangements throughout Australia makes it difficult to draw meaningful comparisons between schemes. Moreover, as the report points out, superannuation benefits are part only of the total conditions of employment and the only satisfactory comparison would be one based on the value of all such conditions. This was, of course, beyond Mr Roach's terms of reference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I mentioned in my Press release on 11 July 1983, when my predecessor, Senator the Hon. Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, brought Mr Roach's report to my attention shortly after the election, she said she had not planned to release the report. Some weeks before my 11 July Press release I passed a copy of the report to the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. During the parliamentary recess, I circulated copies of the report to all members and senators; copies can also be purchased from the Australian Government Publishing Service bookshops. The report complements other information on the Commonwealth superannuation scheme which is available to the Parliament and the community, including a report recently prepared by Mr J. R. Ford, the Australian Government Actuary, on the long term costs of the scheme and the comprehensive annual reports prepared by the Commissioner for Superannuation and the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has provided superannuation benefits to its employees since 1922. The present scheme, which was introduced by the previous Government in 1976, is the largest occupational superannuation scheme in Australia. The explanatory memorandum to the Superannuation Bill 1976 contained actuarial estimates showing that the cost of the new arrangements, as measured by the new entrant employer contribution rate, was expected to be similar to that of the previous scheme. This assessment has been confirmed by Mr Ford's report in the light of his review of the overall experience of the early years of the new scheme. In a separate exercise however, Mr Ford has identified substantial differences in the employer contribution rate attributable to individual authorities whose employees are members of the scheme. These differences reflect the particular circumstances of authorities, including substantial variations in their experience in relation to invalidity retirements. The fact that there are large differences between authorities in the assessed cost of providing identical benefits underlines the need for examination of the level and form of benefits provided in any comparison of occupational superannuation schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Roach compares the Commonwealth scheme with other schemes from this standpoint. He describes the principal form of benefit provided under the scheme -that is, an indexed pension-as an 'ideal' form of benefit, but notes that the provision of benefits in pension form is a disadvantage when lump sum recipients are able to reduce the income tax payable and maximise their social security benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> These comments were, of course, made before the Government's announcement of major measures affecting the taxation of lump sum benefits and other initiatives relating to retirement incomes. We are committed to an ongoing program of reform in this area, including ensuring that superannuation benefits in the Commonwealth's own area of employment are consistent with our broader policies, and that greater opportunities are available to private sector employees to gain access to the secure and regular retirement incomes which Australian governments provide to their retired employees. That is the objective of the important changes we have under consideration to enable annuities to be provided on more attractive terms than at present. </PARA>
<PARA> In developing further initiatives in relation to retirement incomes, the Government will have available to it a wide range of information and advice, including the studies by Mr Roach and Mr Ford, the report of the Commonwealth Task Force on Occupational Superannuation and the advice of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Confederation of Australian Industry and Government officials working group on superannuation matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The statement just made by the Minister for Finance (Mr Dawkins) is extremely general and relates to a report which I believe to be very significant in the area of superannuation. All honourable members would be aware that considerable debate is going on within the community about government proposals in this area. The report commissioned from E. S. Knight and Co., very imminent actuaries, certainly points to a very large area of inquiry. This can only underline to honourable members the concern that the general public would have at the way in which superannuation payments are made by the state as opposed to the private sector. There is no doubt that the large, unfunded commitments of the Public Service superannuation scheme will increasingly place a very significant load on the annual Budget figures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one looks through the areas that this report covers, one will see, in terms of quantitative issues, coverage employer's contributions, pension or lump sum; on qualitative issues, the benefits derived from that, such as resignation benefits, special arrangements and, most importantly, funding. All of these matters are raised in this report. I can well understand that many people who view this report would seek to push it to one side or certainly not elaborate on it. I hope that those who are concerned will read the report and make inquiries from the private sector as to the comparisons between the two schemes that are offered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the parliamentary recess, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Hayden) made a number of major overseas visits. I would have thought that as a courtesy to this House notice would have been given by now by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of his intention to inform the House on the purpose and outcome of these visits. The Prime Minister, in his first major visit overseas, gave a high priority to the importance of Australia's relationship with the United States of America and the central role the ANZUS treaty plays in that relationship. His whole approach seemed both reassuring and positive, but it is clear that the Prime Minister's apparent emphasis was not shared by a major and an influential section of his own party. I need point out only that this section is led by the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party which is dominated by the socialist Left faction for that statement of mine to become apparent. The significant thing about this faction is the prominence it gives to a foreign policy perspective which takes a very friendly view of the Soviet Union and a consequently negative and destructive view of those policies which frustrate Soviet designs. But the fact remains that that faction represents a significant section of the party and a great deal of effort has to be put into satisfying its complaints. Foreign policy formulation of this Labor Government has, therefore, been the victim of this internal dispute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Foreign Minister has tended to reflect the qualifications in the Government 's internal position. In this process he has given the impression that the Prime Minister's remarks needed to be discounted. The Prime Minister gave unqualified support for ANZUS. The Foreign Minister, on the other hand, set out with a mission to review ANZUS. The Foreign Minister's remarks conjure up a number of anti-United States phobias. He says that we must be wary of over-reliance on the relationship with the United States. These comments and other comments have been accompanied by a whole series of background briefings. Tensions between the Foreign Minister and the Secretary of State for the United States of America, Mr Shultz, were being dramatised in the Press and were said to proceed from Mr Shultz's concern about an apparent downgrading of ANZUS by Australia and this Labor Government. The Australian Foreign Minister is reported to have said that Australian foreign policy tended to rely exclusively on great power relations. That would be a sensible observation if it happened to be true. But the truth is that it is a fiction to describe Australian foreign policy of the 1970s and 1980s in those terms. The Fraser Government's emphasis on relations with the Commonwealth, the Third World and the Pacific give the correction to this proposition. It is blurring a very important issue. The issue of Australia's security is one which has to be defined in the context of great power moves in the Indian Ocean, South East Asia and the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA> The Soviet Union, contrary to the view of the socialist Left, is not benign in its foreign policy. It is purposeful and opportunistically aggressive. Its major objective is to embarrass and reduce the strength and capability of the United States, whether the region be Europe, the Middle East, Asia or the Pacific. That is the critical and central fact of foreign affairs. The role of any government interested in the fundamental security of Australia is to ensure that that fact is not obscured. </PARA>
<PARA> It may sound a truism but it is also a fact that the world is a dangerous place . In the last year we have seen the Soviets insist on the military subjugation of the Polish people, who seek a full expression of an independent, Christian culture. We have seen the Soviets conduct a cruel war against the Moslem people of Afghanistan. In South East Asia, its surrogate, North Vietnam, has continued to suppress the Buddhist peoples of Laos and Cambodia. For what end does the Soviet Union produce these crimes against the legitimate aspirations of people who wish no harm to their neighbours? The simple aim is a strategic one-to control and subjugate territories to which the Soviets have no entitlement. Clearly, Australia cannot afford to take a complacent view of the movement of Soviet power and influence in its region. It is, therefore, mandatory in the face of such dangers to maintain a positive and constructive relationship with the United States. The Prime Minister, for his part, appears to recognise this clearly enough. It is a dubious development to introduce the notion which sees a competition between our relations with the United States and South East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian interests in South East Asia are considerably bound up with the success of the Association of South East Asian Nations, which of course is a great force of stability in the region. Our relations with ASEAN and the United States are brought together in the consultations that take place between ASEAN and its dialogue partners. ASEAN has its own active diplomacy with the United States. But it would be most concerned if Australia were to downgrade the role of the United States in world affairs. On this side of the House, we see the continuing need for a mature, sensible and constructive relationship with ASEAN and the United States. But it is not practicable to conduct that relationship in terms which pick up differences and explode them into a prominence which serves only the interests of our enemies. ASEAN countries are frankly disturbed at the current state of relations with Australia. I have that at first hand from my recent visit to one of the ASEAN states. The priority given to Vietnam and the somewhat naive interpretation of Vietnamese intentions implied in this emphasis are extremely worrying to ASEAN. </PARA>
<PARA> Since ASEAN's interception in 1967 there has not been any shadow of genuine doubt cast over our security relations with ASEAN members. In its early days there was no explicit projection of the common security interests of ASEAN as a group. But Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia has changed things considerably. In addition to defence co-operation arrangements with individual members it was never anticipated that an Australian government would not be supportive of ASEAN strategic priorities. This operative assumption of ASEAN is fundamental for us and for it. Uncertainty, however, now afflicts the ASEAN-Australian relationship . We have to realise that the efforts of the Foreign Minister may not be sufficient to avoid the inherent dangers of these sustained uncertainties which still remain even though the visit to Hanoi is now over. Thus we, as a nation, are faced with a serious diplomatic problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look more closely at Vietnam's candidature for conciliation. It has one of the largest armies in the world. It is backed by massive Soviet aid. It has a defence treaty with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has access to a major naval facility and airfields. Vietnam insists on dominating Cambodia and Laos. It is run by a small pro-Soviet clique of which one of the great strongmen is Le Duan, the Secretary-General. I think it is worth remembering that Le Duan always advocated the successful military strategy-the regular force strategy-which won the final victory. He seems to be unwaveringly pro-Soviet. One must then ask: What has led the Government to believe that Australians should put any trust in Hanoi to the extent of discounting the views of ASEAN and the United States in particular? What factual assessment is the Government using for a policy which puts at risk the confidence of out friends, our neighbours and our allies? I would like the Foreign Minister in his reply to detail those assessments and, if possible, make them available so that we will see what basis there is for this sudden change in policy which has characterised this new Labor socialist Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Foreign Minister paid a visit to Japan. Whilst he was there he chose to raise the spectres of international fears about Japan's defence expenditures. Clearly, this misrepresents what is happening. The Japanese have a vital interest in their self-defence in a region which is under pressure from the Soviet Union directly. The Japanese have undertaken to increase their self- defence capability-I underline the words 'self-defence'-in consultation with the United States. Clearly, the defence of Japan, a prodigious industrial power, is a fundamental and major strategic issue. Japan can greatly assist by maintaining a high quality capability for her self-defence forces. It is unreasonable and dangerous to misrepresent what is being done and to warn Japan in gratuitous terms about its self-defence concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States fundamentally has to guarantee the security of the region. But it has other major commitments, for example, in the Middle East. Australia and Japan derive a primary benefit from the exercise of American influence and power in the Middle East. Is it reasonable to let fly with remarks which can only be interpreted as questioning publicly the decisions arising from American and Japanese consultations?</PARA>
<PARA> So far as the public record is concerned, we have a reporting of the Foreign Minister's concerns which are not argued or substantiated, nor are they placed in any context of strategic argument. Here again I ask the Foreign Minister whether in the future he could make available the strategic assessments and foreign policy advice which, hopefully, is the background to these seemingly off the cuff remarks that emanate from him. The headline 'Hayden ''No'' to Japan Forces' has appeared. Are we not obliged to enter such issues with a more careful approach? Is the Parliament not entitled to have the Government's considered views, or are they not considered views? Is Japan not entitled to the consideration that her vital interests are not to be lightly viewed or assessed by an Australian government?</PARA>
<PARA> When the Prime Minister returned he was faced by rumblings in his own party. Because of the influence of the socialist Left one newspaper predicted that the Prime Minister would not find it easy to still the rumblings in the lower echelons of the party. But the Foreign Minister, for his part, has chosen to offset the strengths of the Prime Minister's statements by a series of statements calculated to depreciate our relations with ASEAN, the United States and even Japan. In all this there is a failure to address the main currents of strategic thought. The factor of the Soviet Union has been obscured by an obsessive concern about the need for adjustments in the policies operating with our friends. I regard it as a strange twist. </PARA>
<PARA> In this context I should mention that strains have been introduced into our relations with Indonesia over Timor; differences with China over Vietnam; resource diplomacy has been used against France and our Indian Ocean policy is to be subjected to more instant rethink-not a bad record for five and a half months in government, and one of considerable concern not only to the people in Australia but also to people overseas. My friend the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Coleman) will be detailing more of these arguments. </PARA>
<PARA> If continued, these policies will lead to a puzzlement about Australia's motives and intentions. This in turn will have a negative international effect. It will in fact produce a cynical view of Australia internationally. The Opposition believes that the Government has a duty to make a more systematic and considered outline of its foreign policy and, in that process, remove the uncertainties which are clearly evident in the current naive, inconsistent and confused presentations made by a number of spokesmen for this Labor socialist Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I respond as a dedicated socialist and, of course, a member of this democratic socialist Government; but first some pleasantries. I note that the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) has returned to the Parliament after the recess with an injured arm. I trust that it heals rapidly. I trust also that it is not the only part of his body that became disabled or injured in some way during the recess. I must confess that during the recess something rather strange happened to his capacity to think in a reasoned and consistent fashion, because this is the most extraordinary presentation I have heard for many years in Parliament. We limped through the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), and the ANZUS alliance. We picked up the socialist left of Victoria as we went by. Then we heard some quotations of recent vintage attributed to me which I have never heard before. But why worry about accuracy; a good story is more important. Then somehow we got into Poland with an amazing double backflip, condemning the Soviets. We then fell out of that, perhaps flat on our faces, which a side twist into South East Asia, the Association of South East Asian Nations and competition with the United States of America. As if the vagueness and irrelevancy of this meander were not enough, we suddenly found Vietnam being dragged in along with Japan and the Middle East. This mishmash, presented to the national Parliament, is supposed to represent the distilled wisdom of the Opposition on the issues of foreign affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Warringah had all the facilities which I could make available to him as Foreign Minister to support and facilitate a recent extended visit overseas. One rather hoped that as a consequence of that-of those experiences, reflected judgments, weighing up, conversations, the people he met and the points of view put to him-in the context of the national interests of this country, a very mature, measured and reasoned presentation would have been made to this Parliament. But what do we get? We get a sailor's stumble as he goes from one saloon bar door looking for the next. That is not the way to handle foreign policy. It is quite extraordinary for him to try to berate my views as presented recently in association with and at the ANZUS Council meeting and then make some sort of strange, sinister linkage with the socialist left in Victoria-as though it is a sinister body-and to draw from that the massive and heroic conclusion that what I was really aiming at was to discount the role of the Prime Minister and undermine the Americans. All I have to say is that if the honourable member finds that I am on the same platform in terms of values and views expressed on this matter as the socialist left of Victoria let me tell him this: We are on the same platform as George Shultz, Secretary of State of the United States of America. It must be a big platform; to have George Shultz on one end and the socialist left of Victoria on the other in happy harmony. Let me tell honourable members what was decided in the communique in Washington and agreed to by all of us-Mr Cooper, the Foreign Minister of New Zealand, George Shultz and me. The communique states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Council members affirm that the alliance is firmly based-</PARA>
<PARA>there is no dispute about it-</PARA>
<PARA>on the partners' common traditions and concern to protect democratic values. They value highly the co-operative defense arrangements, facilitated by the Treaty since its conclusion, which have served their Government's mutual security interests and promoted a strengthening of each other's defense capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>On a much more generous plane than the honourable member is able to muster, let me say that it is my belief that allowing for the edges of disagreement which are justifiable in a society such as ours where there are healthy differences in points of view, there has nonetheless been a fairly substantial amount of bipartisan support for the sorts of views being presented on many of these issues. The honourable member for Warringah sought to convey the impression that I was suggesting that because, allegedly, we cannot count on the United States in all of these matters we should beware of too much dependence on the United States. I think that was roughly the quotation he attributed to me, saying that by implication perhaps there was some lack of patriotism there, if not something downright worse. I remind him of what his former Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, said on May 28 last year:</PARA>
<PARA> You can never automatically anticipate assistance. Nations will always read treaties in terms of the circumstances of the time, in terms of the relationship between the countries at the time; in our case, between the United States, Australia and New Zealand. I do not believe it has ever been the case that anyone-Britain or the United States-would automatically come to Australia's aid, no matter what the circumstances are. </PARA>
<PARA>I thought at the time that that was a rather sane and balanced statement. I still believe so. But it is obvious that for some purpose of convenience the honourable member for Warringah has another point of view which he seeks to put forward. I do not want to spend any more time on ANZUS, not because it is not important. On the contrary, it is very important. I will be talking about it in the Parliament in a few weeks time when I present a statement on our recent discussions in Washington on this matter. I want to make it unambiguously clear that there is no difference between the Prime Minster and me, or between any members of the Labor Party including me, on this issue. However, we are sensible . We recognise that a statement of fact in a drafted, legal document such as an international treaty must be literally interpreted. What the ANZUS treaty says very simply is that if one of the partners is subjected to threat or attack there will be a response. But, as George Shultz said, in response to a question from me and speaking as Secretary of State at the ANZUS Council meeting in Washington a few weeks ago-I relayed it virtually exactly at the subsequent Press conference in his presence and there was no demur-what ANZUS says is that there will be a response, but it does not necessarily imply that it will be a military response. A range of responses could be forthcoming. In that sense it was highly desirable that I undertook the mission charged of me by the Prime Minister which was to engage in a review of the ANZUS treaty. This review was welcomed by the other signatories. That is clearly and explicitly stated in the communique. Let me move on in this bewildering pilgrimage that the Minister embarked on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not now that we have a good Foreign Minister. The honourable member for Warringah said that he knows unnamed people in South East Asia who whispered to him-goodness knows where because there are some dark places you can get lost in in South East Asia-that the condition of our relationship is not good. I can only tell the honourable member what the record states. He drew the United States and China into this debate. Mr Siddhi, the Foreign Minister for Thailand, stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As this is an international problem,</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the matter of initiatives we are taking in relation to the Vietnamese presence in Kampuchea, which we oppose and which we say is something that must be terminated. We have set down principles on this matter. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>we have no reservation as for Mr Hayden's trip to Hanoi because we also told Mr Hayden the purpose that we have made thus far. If he can probe further and get more information for us, it would be very useful to our search for peace and a political solution for Kampuchea. So in that case I will say that Mr Hayden has a role to play for us, so we have no reservation for his trip at all. </PARA>
<PARA>The role that I have enunciated is a very moderate one in its aspirations, aimed at nothing more than helping to facilitate, if possible, some coming together and dialogue. The likelihood of succeeding is very slim and probably non- existent. But that role has been endorsed by the ASEAN countries and by China. When I spoke to the Chinese Premier, Mr Zhao, in China on 5 August, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Australia is conducting a dialogue with Vietnam now and I wish you success . </PARA>
<PARA>He added:</PARA>
<PARA> I hope the Lord will bless you and that you can persuade Vietnam to change its mind and to change its policy . . . If you succeed, then you have actually performed a meritorious service. </PARA>
<PARA>He pointed out that as an atheist there were some qualifications in the strength of his latter observation. The ANZUS Communique, at the suggestion of the United States, includes explicitly a welcoming statement in relation to that initiative . It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Council Members reaffirmed their conviction that the conflict in Kampuchea should be settled by peaceful means. They support diplomatic efforts which would lead to a comprehensive political solution to the Kampuchean problem. The Council welcomed the efforts of Australian Foreign Minister Hayden to establish common ground in the search for a negotiated settlement. </PARA>
<PARA>In all the circumstances, no evidence has been produced by the honourable member to substantiate his florid claims, which were perhaps the product of a rush of blood to the head after passing through the equator recently. I have produced evidence to show that there is substantial endorsement for what we are trying to do. In each case, of course, those sources, like us, recognised the difficulty of making much headway and the very high likelihood of failure because of the complex and varied range of interests which must be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> I will quickly discuss the issue of Vietnam. It makes no sense, in my assessment, to continue to isolate and punish Vietnam if all that that achieves is to guarantee that the Soviet presence in South East Asia is expanded and entrenched. It is a matter of some concern to me that the evidence we have available shows that there has been a shift of naval surface and sub-surface vessel deployments from the Indian Ocean to the South China Sea. Cam Ranh Bay is the focal point for supporting this shift. Very simply, I say-I am sure listeners will apprehend-that the longer this isolation and punishment continues , the greater the dependence of Vietnam on the Soviets to sustain itself and the greater that dependence becomes and the more extensive becomes the role and the influence of the Soviets in the South East Asian region and, indeed, in East Asia. We do not want to see that outcome occur in any circumstances. There are enough tensions and instabilities in the world arising from super-power and great power competition without having a new and potentially very nasty dimension injected into our area. </PARA>
<PARA> We respect the views and principles being put forward by our friends and colleagues in China and the ASEAN countries and by our friend and ally the United States. When I visited Vietnam I told Mr Nguyen Co Thach, the Foreign Minister, that in our endeavours it had to be understood that our powerful and valued friend, the United States of America, represented our most important alliance association; that we would in no way allow our friendly relationships with the ASEAN countries and China to be impaired, that we intended to build upon them, and that they were our highest priorities. So there is no misunderstanding about the basis upon which any consultation takes place in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member managed to loop his way through the Middle East and end up in Japan. I thought he showed an extraordinary effort of adaptability in linking all those places together in a rather inchoate way. In respect of Japan I have said, very simply, that we can understand Japan improving the capabilities of its self-defence force. Its command controlled communications systems need replacement. Some of its ammunition stocks are dated probably suspect in their effectiveness and of a low quantity. Some of its capital equipment has been superseded. There is no quibble about that. I said that it would cause us and other nations in the region concern if there was a dramatic increase in spending, or if the Japanese defence forces were dramatically restructured so that they projected power with an aggressive capability. Again, if Japan sought to have a militarily strategic role in the region, we and other nations would be concerned. It may come as a surprise to the honourable member to discover that the United States finds absolutely no problems at all with our presentation on this matter. The final thing I want to say to the honourable member is this--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is obvious that very few matters can have as important an influence on the Australian Government's international standing as the decisions and pronouncements of its leaders on foreign policy, on the issues troubling the world. It is these pronouncements that lead other governments to decide whether the Australian Government is responsible or reliable, one with which they can make agreements which will stick and one that can be counted on as an ally in a crisis. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) recognised that when, during his visit to the United States of America, he made what must in fairness be called one of his better speeches on foreign affairs. He stressed his determination that Australia would continue the foreign policy of the previous Liberal-National Party Government; that our alliance with the United States was fundamental; that United States bases in Australia were safe; and that Australia was not, and could not be, a non-aligned nation. The Prime Minister realised the importance of all these statements to Australia's standing and reputation in the United States and the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But what has happened since is not bipartisan clarity and certainty, but a bewildering confusion which must make foreign governments believe we have one of the more ridiculous, even clownish, governments in the world. I refer, for example, to the Japanese. They witnessed the spectacle earlier this year of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade (Mr Lionel Bowen) announcing his extraordinarily inept idea of a joint Australian-Japanese peace keeping force in Kampuchea, despite the fact that it would be against the Japanese Constitution and despite fresh memories of Australia's recent involvement in Indo-China. Not only did the Deputy Prime Minister not bother to consult the Japanese; he did not even consult the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Hayden). Headlines in newspapers across the country read: 'Hayden denies knowledge of the Bowen peace plan'. The Deputy Prime Minister was so discomfited by the amazed reaction to his harebrained idea that he stood up in this Parliament and poked out his tongue at the Opposition! To complete his discomfiture, the Foreign Minister, when he was in Japan, took the opportunity not to ask the Japanese army to return to Indo-China, but to criticise moves to increase Japan's extremely low investment in self-defence. The point is that the Japanese must regard the Government as incompetent and will act accordingly in its dealings with us. </PARA>
<PARA> The Foreign Minister, however, even outdid the Deputy Prime Minister in fantastic unthought-through ideas. He recently pronounced that Australia should have a naval task force patrolling the Indian Ocean which was independent of the United States Navy. Of course, he had not bothered to discuss this idea with the Minister for Defence (Mr Scholes), who was plainly embarrassed. The absurdity or , rather, the irony of it is that the Foreign Minister's inspiration followed closely on complaints by the Fleet Commander, Rear-Admiral Michael Hudson, that the Royal Australian Navy would have to consider mothballing some of its ships if its fuel stocks were diminished further in the Budget. Already the RAN had planned a 20 per cent cut in fuel allocation this financial year, which has caused the RAN to scale down its participation in next month's Kangaroo 83 exercises in the north-west. Consideration is being given, the Rear-Admiral said , even to paying off our minesweepers to conserve fuel. He said: 'We have just about reached our bottom line'. Yet the Foreign Minister was about to send a naval task force to Africa, without United States support and without helicopters for anti-submarine patrolling or for over-the-horizon surveillance and missile targeting since none of the RAN's destroyers is fitted with these helicopters. Needless to say, the lack of an aircraft carrier-one of this Government's first decisions was to scrap plans for a carrier-makes any real naval presence in the Indian Ocean ridiculously unsafe. Again the point is that this sort of posturing proposal by the Foreign Minister makes the Australian Government seem irresponsible, even absurd, in the eyes of our neighbours and allies. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take another example of the Governments bewildering uncertainty, one to which the Labor Party gives a lot of attention-Central America. The Prime Minister in Washington substantially supported the Reagan policy in Central America. Of course, everyone in this chamber is concerned about violations of human rights in Central America but the fact is that all international observers who were on the spot said that the elections last year in El Salvador were fair and democratic. Let me just refer to the universally-respected Freedom House in New York which sent five observers to the election. Sixty-two per cent of those entitled to vote voted despite threats of murder and mutilation by the guerrillas, and the Christian Democrats, who are well to the left of some members of the Australian Labor Party, got 40 per cent of the vote. This drive to democracy is supplemented by an American-inspired land reform and land redistribution program which so far has been carried out so thoroughly that it is causing reduced agricultural production. So, of course, people concerned to support democracy have to support the Reagan policy and the Prime Minister, to his credit, did so. </PARA>
<PARA> But what of the other Ministers? The Minister for Defence Support (Mr Howe) chose a meeting of the Australia-Cuba Friendship Society, of all things, to attack American policy in El Salvador and to urge the Government to extend economic aid to Marxist Nicaragua which is a militarised dictatorship with the largest army in the whole of Central America, which is engaged in genocide against the Miskito Indian population and which fills its gaols with social democrats, dissident communists, Moravian pastors, Jehovah's Witnesses or any opponent of the regime. To round off the tragi-comedy, the Minister for Foreign Affairs used his visit to the United States also to attack the miniscule American military presence in El Salvador which is helping to train the army against the Cuban-backed and Soviet-backed counter-revolutionary guerrillas the Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation. Again the point is that these public divisions and these uncertainties within the Government's ranks place Australia in an absurd position. </PARA>
<PARA> Another example is South Africa. Everyone in this Parliament, certainly everyone in the Liberal Party, finds apartheid abhorrent. Now at last the South African Government has taken what must be called a revolutionary move away from apartheid with its proposals for a new constitution replacing the present Parliament by a tricameral legislature, one House elected by the whites, one by the coloureds and one by the Indians. Whatever criticisms we may make of the proposals-and we can make many because, for example, they still exclude the blacks entirely-the fact is that the proposals are truly revolutionary and are obviously a dramatic move away from exclusive white domination. </PARA>
<PARA> What does the Foreign Minister say of these historic developments? He said in his statement of 5 June that they are 'an exercise in attempted deception'. This is strong and offensive language. The South African proposals are in fact such a 'deception' that they have split the Government and have drastically reduced Government support in three by-elections in South Africa. The world knows this, and the world is watching this development away from apartheid in South Africa. But the Foreign Minister can regard these promising signs of change only as a trick. Once again the point is that the Foreign Minister makes himself look ignorant and foolish and consequently makes Australia look ignorant and foolish in the eyes of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> There is not time to discuss many other examples such as the Prime Minister's extraordinary new style in foreign policy in France, announcing a major action against France and against French trade just before meeting the French President ; or the Foreign Minister's shuttle diplomacy fiasco in China and Indo-China; or indeed his discourtesy on his visit to South Korea in his attempts to interfere in domestic South Korean politics. There are many other examples. The obvious fact is that far from maintaining a clear, certain and bipartisan foreign policy , as the Prime Minister said his Government would, the Government has created major uncertainties in our international relations and deserves the condemnation contained in this motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is probably appropriate that very early in this session we should have some mention of foreign affairs because one of the new initiatives of the Hawke Labor Government has been in the area of foreign affairs. This is my first opportunity to acknowledge the very positive role played by the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Street) when he had this responsibility in the former Fraser coalition Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was intrigued by some of the things said in this debate this afternoon. It has been suggested by the Opposition that the foreign policy of the Government, as expressed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Hayden) and other Ministers , has created uncertainty amongst our friends, in our region, and throughout the world. As a member of the Australian Labor Party, I am very proud of the role which the honourable member for Oxley as Minister for Foreign Affairs has played in developing and explaining foreign policy under the Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We all understand that a government develops foreign policy not only from decisions made by its party conference but also from an interaction of personalities as Ministers go overseas, study their dispatches and communicate with Ministers and people at all levels in other countries. So foreign policy is determined not only by the written word but also by a real understanding of the problems of the relationships in and the changing spectrum of foreign affairs throughout the world. I am very proud that the honourable member for Oxley has been working so hard at explaining and developing foreign policy for the Labor Government. Officials of his Department and diplomats in Canberra and overseas-I also have recently been overseas-have expressed their appreciation of the energy with which the Minister is carrying out his responsibilities. </PARA>

<PARA> I take up some particular points, some of which were made by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Coleman). They deal with Australian-American relations and a whole range of other areas in which it was suggested that one Minister or another had made a mistake. There are elements in the Labor Party's foreign policy which do not exist in the foreign policies of the coalition. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has made very clear the initiatives he has taken as far as the ANZUS alliance and our relationship with the United States and New Zealand are concerned. Amongst the new initiatives which have been taken and which have been widely welcomed in the Australian community has been the appointment of an Ambassador for Disarmament in order that in the future Australia would not be a mere spectator on the sidelines of the greatest foreign affairs problem that the world faces. Mr Richard Butler has been appointed to that important responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wentworth criticised, rather carefully I thought, what was allegedly the Minister's interference in the domestic policies of South Korea. He was referring to the Minister's expression of support for the human rights of the Opposition and other people who might be regarded as dissenting groups in South Korea. This is another element of the Labor Party's foreign policy which is at difference with the foreign policy of the coalition. The same problem comes through in our relationship with Indonesia. While I think almost every member of this House-I hope all members of this House-would wish Australia to have a continued firm and friendly relationship with Indonesia, it is obvious that how well that relationship develops in the future depends on the way in which the civil rights of people in East Timor and other places within the Indonesion archipalego develop. That is not something to be sneered at. It is not an interference in the domestic affairs. The people of Australia want to see an Australian government concerned not only with big power relationships but also with very important matters such as disarmament and human rights. I am proud to be a member of a government which once again is making these initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wentworth said that he was pleased that we had continued to follow the policy-he was referring to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) -of the Liberal and National parties as far as the American alliance was concerned. I wish to go back a little in history to 1942. In February 1942 when John Curtin made that memorable speech in which he called to the people of the United States of America for support in Australia's hour of need he was criticised in this House by members of the coalition because in those days they judged patriotism by the British association and not the American association. It was an Australian labor government that developed the Australian-American alliance. It developed the alliance in a time of war, sought to pursue it in the post-war period when many people felt that America was becoming isolationist again and supported it when the ANZUS treaty was developed. It is interesting that late in 1975 Mr Marshall Green, the most distinguished American Ambassador ever to be appointed to this country, said in the United States to the Foreign Affairs Association that relations between Australia and the United States were better, firmer and more honest under the Australian Labor Government then in office than previously. It is obvious that we are able to explore our own policies in this area and maintain a good relationship with the United States. One would think that the withdrawal of our troops from Vietnam shortly after the election of the Whitlam Government was an outstanding example of that. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to take up just a couple of the other points that were made. One related to the expression of concern by the Royal Australian Navy about the cuts in fuel that have reduced its steaming by 20 per cent. I point out that those cuts were made by the previous Fraser coalition Government. The first Budget of the Hawke Labor Government will be introduced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) tonight, so the honourable member for Wentworth was really reflecting on his own Government. I hope that in these difficult times the ambitions of the Foreign Minister for a more active Australian naval presence in the Indian Ocean will be met, but obviously there are serious economic difficulties. I also noticed the comment made on South Africa. In effect, by bringing the Indians and the Cape coloureds into some form of government in South Africa, the South Africans have made very modest progress indeed. They have made progress with every problem apart from the one that counts. That is the significant problem. We wish them well. </PARA>
<PARA> We are keen, as an Australian Labor Party government, to have a good relationship with every country. But that good relationship is brought about by having clear policies and by personal contact, by giving attention to the wishes of all nations and the particular problems as they arise. I was pleased indeed in my recent very short exercise overseas to learn what I learnt in years gone by-of the great competence of the officials of our Department of Foreign Affairs . I am extremely proud that they are receiving the leadership of the honourable member for Oxley, Bill Hayden, who will go down in history as one of the great Foreign Ministers of this nation. </PARA>

<PARA> Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 3-9 (1983) and Excise Tariff Proposals No. 2 (1983 ). </PARA>
<PARA>The proposals I have just tabled relate to proposed alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1982 and the Excise Tariff Act 1921. The proposals formally place before Parliament. As required by law. Tariff alterations made by Gazette during the recent recess. Excise Tariff Proposals No. 2 increases the rate of excise duty on motor spirit and diesel fuel by 1c per litre from 1 July 1983 in compliance with section 8 of the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund Act 1983. Customs Tariff Proposals No. 3 operative on and from 17 June 1983 implements the decision taken following a report by the Industries Assistance Commission that gelatin from Brazil be excluded from developing country preference. </PARA>
<PARA> Customs Tariff Proposals No. 4 contains tariff alterations arising from the Government's decision on recommendations contained in the Industries Assistance Commission report on the Australian tobacco industry. The decision involved the introduction of composite rates of duty, comprising ad valorem and specific duty elements, for certain manufactured tobacco. Proposals No. 4 is operative on and from 24 June 1983. Customs Tariff Proposals No. 5 operates on and from 1 January 1983 and contains two tariff changes. The first change amends the relevant reference in the New Zealand rate Schedule of the Customs Tariff Act to reflect the intention of the superseded New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement that certain leather jackets from New Zealand be granted duty free entry. The second change inserts item 49 in Part I of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act. This new item implements the Government's decision to provide duty free entry of certain imports required for approved Australian industry participation programs including defence offsets programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Customs Tariff Proposals No. 6 operates on and from 1 July 1983 and contains a variety of tariff alterations, the main ones being:</PARA>
<PARA> The creation of five new tariff items in Part I of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act. New items 50 to 54 are necessary for the operation of the Government 's decision to introduce the commercial tariff concession system. </PARA>
<PARA> An increase of 1c per litre in the surcharge on imported motor spirit and diesel fuel. This change is complementary to the increase proposed in the Excise Tariff Act and is in accordance with the provisions of the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund Act. </PARA>
<PARA> An amendment of section 27 of the Customs Tariff Act and deletion of section 28 of that Act. Various changes have also been made to items 5 to 10 and item 15 in Part I of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act. These measures follow a review of the concessional tariff treatment available to goods imported by non- diplomatic trade commissioners, by international organisations and by visiting servicemen of the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Canada. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposals No. 6 also contains a number of miscellaneous amendments to specify correctly the duty treatment, the wording or the coverage of various tariff items. Customs Tariff proposals No. 7 contains tariff changes to bring under quota certain footwear having a value of less than $1 per pair. These changes arise from the Government's acceptance of a recommendation by the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Advisory Committee. Proposals No. 7 will operate on and from 1 September 1983 but were gazetted earlier to enable the preparation of tender quota arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Customs Tariff Proposals No. 8 contains tariff changes following the Government 's decision on a Temporary Assistance Authority report on fluorescent and filament lamps. The decision imposes an additional temporary duty of 10 per cent on certain filament lamps. The proposals also incorporates decisions relating to developing county preference for filament and fluorescent lamps and the continued exclusion of Taiwan Province from developing country preference on fluorescent lamps. These changes became operative on and from 13 July 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> Customs Tariff Proposals No. 9 contains tariff changes relating to the Government's decision in respect of recommendations contained in an IAC report on non-electrical absorption-type refrigerators and freezers and parts. The decision broadens the terms of a tariff sub-item to incorporate non-electrical domestic refrigerators and freezers and parts therefor. The decision makes these goods subject to the rates of duty applicable to electrical refrigerators and freezers and parts therefor. In accordance with arrangements under the closer economic relations agreement the New Zealand rates on non-electrical goods will phase to free on 1 July 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposals No. 9 also covers decisions taken in relation to IAC reports on sodium and potassium alkylxanthates-developing country preference; and power transformers-developing country preference. The decisions exclude from developing country preference sodium and potassium alkylxanthates from the People's Republic of China and Yugoslavia; and certain power transformers from the Republic of Korea and Taiwan Province. The changes in Proposals No. 9 have operated on and from 5 August 1983. A summary of alterations contained in these proposals has been circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposals to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Ombudsman Amendment Bill 1983 and the Ombudsman ( Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 1983 are both supported by the Opposition. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Willis), the then Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters, in his second reading speech introduced the first of these two Bills, graciously acknowledged the bipartisan support for the original Ombudsman Act 1976. Further, he acknowledged that the present Bill is substantially the same amendment Bill introduced in September by my colleague the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Fife) on behalf of the former Government. He noted that each Bill largely implemented the recommendations of the Administrative Review Council, a statutory advisory council to government. The Council's views were developed in its working party report 'Jurisdiction of Ombudsman' of 1980. That report was tabled in the Parliament by the honourable member for Farrer on 4 July 1981.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Ombudsman Amendment Bill has two purposes. The first is to create a statutory office of Defence Force Ombudsman to replace the previously non- statutory office and to create and confer that office on the Commonwealth Ombudsman. The second purpose is to make various other amendments to the Act in the light of what is now called operational experience to date. The Ombudsman ( Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill is complementary and makes similar operational amendments to the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981, which Act provided a role for the Ombudsman to investigate complaints made against the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now six years since the Commonwealth Ombudsman commenced operations. Professor J. E. Richardson has admirably fulfilled that role. In his 1981-82 report he gave details of the way in which members of the public are becoming increasingly aware of the way in which the Ombudsman may be of assistance and have made larger numbers of complaints to him, both written and oral. In addition to public awareness he noted that the increasing involvement of government in people's lives was a contributing factor to his increasing work load. Professor Richardson did not see that growth as an index of dissatisfaction with Commonwealth administration. In fact, the Ombudsman commented favourably on the high level of co-operation received from government departments and authorities, notwithstanding the particular complaints on which he was required to report to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note at this time and in this debate the willingness of members of parliament to have resort to the Ombudsman in particular cases. The honourable member for Farrer stated last year that on 300 occasions in the five years of operations members had referred complaints to the Ombudsman on behalf of constituents. I well recall participating in debates before entering this House on whether the Scandanavian Ombudsman could fulfil a useful role in our parliamentary and responsible system of government. Like many students of government at that time, I saw this European model as alien to our system in which members should be responsible an accountable to Parliament for all actions of their departments and officials. I can well recall hearing the view that such an intrusion into our system would prejudice the role of members of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The acceptance of the Ombudsman in six short years is best reflected by the statements of the former Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, in his address of October last year to the Australian Conference of Ombudsmen. He noted that the institution helps government administration to be adaptive, responsible and sensitive to the needs of average Australians. He noted that in his experience he sometimes used the Ombudsman to check the Ombudsman's efficiency against normal departmental inquiries. I am sure that, to officials, that was an interesting race. It is in this context of six years practical experience that these amendments-these reforms-are being proposed in order that the Ombudsman might work more efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the Defence Force Ombudsman. The Bill proposes to vest in the office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman a statutory office of Defence Force Ombudsman. While the powers are the same, the Defence Force Ombudsman will have jurisdiction to investigate actions arising out of service in the Defence Force. A special office of Deputy Ombudsman (Defence Force) is to be created. This proposal avoids the existence of two ombudsmen with overlapping jurisdiction and should ensure savings in cost. I note from the Minister's address that the only anticipated extra cost is the extra salary of the Deputy Ombudsman of $50,350 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply would like to reiterate that servicemen and women do not enjoy complaints mechanisms that other Australians, particularly those in civilian employment, enjoy. It is envisaged that not only current and former servicemen but also their dependants will, if within jurisdiction, be able to lodge complaints under this amending legislation. As the Minister notes, there are some matters which, as with the Commonwealth Ombudsman, are excluded from review . In particular, the conduct of disciplinary proceedings and action relating to the granting or refusal of honours and awards are exempted. For completeness I observe that the Ombudsman's jurisdiction does not lie in the case of a service member unless he has first availed himself of existing internal redress procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to note one matter arising from a recent report of the Ombudsman, the report of 1980-81. It is one matter which concerned me and, I have no doubt, other honourable members, and which, I understand, these provisions will have now remedied. I certainly hope that that is so. In that report it was recalled that thieves tampered with naval station mail. The recovered mail was matched with envelopes and later delivered to those personnel to whom it was believed it had been addressed. In one case, naval personnel read a personal letter to one former serviceman and thereby ascertained that he was homosexual. Following a report to officers, the man was called before officers and later resigned from the Service. In reviewing the complaint which the Ombudsman received, the Navy accepted that the mail should not have been handled by Defence personnel but should have been handled by personnel of Australia Post alone, particularly in sorting and addressing it to addressees. However, the substance of the lack of jurisdiction arose when it was ruled that the Ombudsman could not review the later action taken by the Navy leading to the man's resignation, and it also excluded the possibility of the Ombudsman ordering reinstatement. </PARA>
<PARA> Other provisions in this legislation include those that were developed in the light of operational experience to date. The explanatory memorandum puts them as follows: To provide a statutory basis for the Ombudsman's practice of resolving most complaints with a minimum of formality and resources; to furnish the Ombudsman with additional discretion in taking action after an investigation, and to clarify that he may publish information on a current investigation in some circumstances; to facilitate co-operative investigatory activities involving the Commonwealth Ombudsman and other Australian ombudsmen; to provide for determination by the Federal Court of issues arising concerning the Ombudsman's jurisdiction; and finally, to clarify that the Ombudsman may investigate official actions preceding and succeeding Ministers' actions, and may make informal inquiries to establish his jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some matters of topical interest which I should like to draw to the attention of honourable members, and they relate to the question of jurisdiction . Firstly, while the Ombudsman's role is extended to the administrations of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island, on one of our other external territories, Norfolk Island, his jurisdiction is removed because of the degree of self-government which has now been granted to that particular territory. Secondly, royal commissions are now to be excluded from the Ombudsman's review. No doubt that will be a matter of topical interest to members on the Government side of the House, in view of suggestions that the Ombudsman might be used in relation to some inquiries of late. The Bill now provides for questions of jurisdiction to be determined by reference to the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA> The Ombudsman's report of 1981-82 noted that in 1981 the Ombudsman experienced two challenges to his jurisdiction, one from the Secretary to the Treasury and the other from the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. The former matter, whilst topical, was resolved after the Ombudsman was able to complete his inquiries on information supplied by the Treasury. The latter case, it was reported, was not resolved but related to the question whether the Ombudsman could investigate what the Australian Broadcasting Commission asserted to be programming autonomy. The difference emerges not from the Ombudsman's right to investigate programming matters but, rather, his claim to investigate complaints about false or misleading information. One would, of course, hope that such matters could be resolved by officials without cost or, if they were not able to do it, with the assistance of Ministers mindful of public expenditure. But now one hopes that, as a last resort, this matter and other like matters will be able to be determined by the Federal Court if required. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other new provisions in this legislation that differ somewhat from the Bill introduced by the honourable member for Farrer in 1982, and they differ in two respects. I want to make it clear that the amendments to which I am about to refer are acceptable to the Opposition, although I note that the Minister did not draw these matters to the attention of honourable members in the way of a bipartisan approach, which he asserted in his address was to be the case in relation to matters dealing with the Ombudsman. The first amendment is to clause 12, which is altered by the addition of a paragraph (B). It amends section 9 (3) of the principal Act, so that when the Attorney exercises his discretion to furnish a certificate that the disclosure of certain information is against the public interest by reason, for example, of it being that it would prejudice security, defence, or international relations of the Commonwealth-and there are three other reasons also enumerated in that paragraph, which I shall not enumerate-that certificate of the Attorney relates only to information disclosed to the Ombudsman. As I mentioned, that amendment was acceptable to the Opposition, although the matter was not outlined by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter relates to clause 19, which amends section 19 of the principal Act. It adds additional sub-sections (6), (7), (7A) and (7B). These provisions allow for an extension of time for presenting the Ombudsman's annual reports to Parliament. The Act now provides that the Ombudsman shall submit his report as soon as practicable after 30 June in each year. The 1982 Bill provided that he should lodge his report 'as soon as practicable and in any event within six months after each 30th June'. The new amendment provides that if the Ombudsman is of the opinion that he cannot comply with that six-month time frame , he may apply to the Minister for an extension of time, giving reasons. The Minister may grant an extension, but he is required within three sitting days to inform the House of the extension and his reasons for granting same. Procedures are then laid down for tabling the report if within the extended time or, alternatively, for lodging a further explanation if the report is not completed within time. While these procedures are cumbersome, the Opposition finds them acceptable in the context of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Bill that we are discussing is the Ombudsman (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill. As I mentioned earlier, this Bill makes amendments, primarily to the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981, which complement the Ombudsman Amendment Bill. Honourable members will be aware that the Ombudsman has jurisdiction to undertake in certain cases independent investigations of complaints against the Australian Federal Police. The amendments are parallel so as to ensure basic uniformity in the Ombudsman's powers, duties and procedures in relation to complaints, be they complaints of a general nature or those relating to the Australian Federal Police. This Bill develops the informal procedures for deciding which complaints will be investigated, clarifies jurisdiction in certain territories, provides for reference to the Federal Court in appropriate situations to clarify questions of jurisdiction and the like, and assists in obtaining documents and authorises the disclosure of information by the Ombudsman in certain circumstances. It also meets with the Opposition's approval, and therefore will not be the subject of any objection from the Opposition on this occasion.</PARA>
<PARA> From time to time a number of people have written about the role of the Ombudsman, and a number of matters have been brought to attention either in reports of the Ombudsman or by independent commentators. While this legislation does not pick up all of the matters that have been the subject of comment, I should like to note some of them, because it may well be that the Government would like to look at those matters at some future time. I am not suggesting that, by examining them, whatever proposals the Government might bring forward would necessarily meet with the Opposition's approval, but some of the matters that have been noted include the fact that there is no power over Commonwealth employment matters for inquiry by the Ombudsman. From time to time, some people have suggested that the question of de facto relationships and what is in the nature of a de facto relationship might be the subject of some legislative treatment. In fact, different approaches have been taken in treating de facto relationships by the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Social Security. There is no change, for instance, in relation to that matter in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to Telecom Australia, for instance, section 101 of the Telecommunications Act has not been amended but it has been the subject of some comment by the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman has drawn attention to situations in which quite properly, in his view, Telecom ought to be responsible for its actions causing loss to be suffered by telephone consumers or others. Very often the Ombudsman has drawn attention to the question of default, delay, error or omission. Telecom is given immunity under the Telecommunications Act for actions which cause loss by such reasons as default, delay, error or omission, and that has been the subject of comment on a number of occasions. There is still no power, as I understand it, in the hands of the Ombudsman to investigate private bodies, incorporated bodies or associations which have not been established pursuant to enactment. Whilst the definition of enactment has been widened in this Bill there are a number of bodies, private companies and the like which perhaps ought to be the subject of inquiry. I know the working party looked at the question of which private companies owned by the Commonwealth ought to be the subject of investigations. I simply note that there is still no power to investigate the whole range of private bodies, incorporated bodies or associations which people see as Commonwealth authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I note that the Ombudsman can still investigate only matters of administration. There are other areas which commentators from time to time have suggested may be the subject of review and advice by the Ombudsman. There have been suggestions that his jurisdiction in that area ought to be widened. I draw those matters to the attention of the Government not because the Opposition necessarily believes that there is a need for legislation in each of those areas but because they are areas which, because they have been commented on, ought to be examined closely by the government of the day. As I said, I indicate on behalf of the Opposition our concurrence with these Bills.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to speak in support of the two Bills before the House, the Ombudsman Amendment Bill and the Ombudsman (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill of 1983. As has been noted the major Bill has two main purposes : First, to create within the office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman a statutory office of Defence Force Ombudsman and, secondly, to make certain other amendments to the Ombudsman Act of 1976 in the light of the review by the Administrative Review Council. The minor Bill makes certain amendments to the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981 and also, of course, complements the provisions of the major Act. Originally, legislation to establish the office of Ombudsman was an initiative of the Whitlam Labor Government, carried forward by the succeeding government and finally coming into operation in 1977. That bipartisan approach to ombudsman legislation is obviously essential, and that same approach is evident in the current amendments. A very significant aspect of the legislation before the House is the insertion of a new Part IIA under clause 20 of the amendment Bill which deals with the establishment, functions, powers and duties of the Defence Force Ombudsman, and it is that aspect of the legislation before us on which I propose to concentrate my remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A Bill providing for the appointment of the Defence Force Ombudsman was first passed in the House of Representatives in 1975. It was introduced into the Senate but lapsed on the dissolution of Parliament in November 1975. Legislation to amend the Act was again introduced into Parliament in September last year but also lapsed with the dissolution of Parliament in February of this year. Between 1976 and the present the office of Defence Force Ombudsman has operated on an interim basis under an executive director authorised by the Minister for Defence . The creation of the Office of Defence Force Ombudsman will significantly improve the conditions of employment of members of the Services and their families. Members of the defence services do not have the opportunity of utilising the normal external grievance mechanisms which are found in civilian employment, and their relationships with their employer often extend into many aspects of their working and private lives. </PARA>
<PARA> With certain reasonable exclusions, particularly those relating to disciplinary procedures and the granting or refusal of honours and awards, as outlined in section 19 (c) of the principal Act, the Defence Force Ombudsman will provide an independent statutory avenue for the consideration and review of all service related grievances. There are two significant defence service establishments operating within my electorate of Bendigo: Puckapunyal, near Seymour, is the base for Australia's major armoured and transport corps. The Army base makes not only a substantial contribution to Australia's defence requirements but also a notable contribution to the economy and community of Seymour. More than 2,000 personnel are directly employed at Puckapunyal, with some 800 families living in married quarters at or around the base. Honourable members would also be pleased to hear that work on the $14m armoured centre redevelopment project, which was commenced early this financial year, is progressing very smoothly and is creating very valauable work opportunities for local contractors in the Seymour area. Bendigo is home to the Army survey regiment unit based at the historic Fortuna site. Some 300 Service personnel are directly employed at Fortuna, and when families are taken into account more than 500 people in Bendigo are directly or indirectly dependent on the regiment for their livelihood. It goes without saying that the survey regiment unit also makes a very sigificant contribution to the economy and the community of Bendigo and its surrounds. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that the Defence Force Ombudsman's function will be to investigate, either on the basis of a complaint being made or on his own initiative, administrative actions related to or arising from a person's service in the defence forces, it is clear that this initiative will have significant benefits for people within my electorate. Importantly, also in this legislation, other persons such as the dependants of Service personnel will also be able to lodge complaints if they are affected by actions within the Ombudsman's jurisdiction. So within my electorate of Bendigo some 2,300 service personnel and their dependants will now have access to an independent and statutory Defence Force Ombudsman. I should add that review by the Ombudsman will complement rather than compete with the existing internal redress procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill requires that serving members will normally have to exhaust the redress system before taking a matter to the Defence Force Ombudsman. This is a very sensible approach which will allow commanders to learn of grievances of servicemen and women and to have the first opportunity to remedy them. Additionally, making a complaint to the Defence Force Ombudsman after exhausting the usual internal procedures will not be seen as undermining the normal command structure. During 1982 the interim office of the Defence Force Ombudsman received 122 new complaints compared with 165 in the same period in 1981. An analysis of the complaints received during 1982 shows that administrative decisions concerning pay, allowances and conditions of service were the major source of concern closely followed by complaints related to discharge from the defence forces. Other significant sources of complaints related to transfers, postings and promotions and to the other area of compensation. </PARA>
<PARA> The following three cases are typical of complaints which presently fall and will fall within the jurisdiction of the new office of Defence Force Ombudsman. Case one, as an example, concerns a soldier who is discharged on medical grounds and complains to the DFO's Office. The DFO examines the administrative procedures adopted by the Army to determine whether the discharge was lawful and in accordance with policy. Case two is the matter of an airman who is discharged following conviction in a civil court for a serious offence and complains about that discharge. The Defence Force Ombudsman examines relative files, obtains a report from the Royal Australian Air Force officer and determines whether the discharge was administratively in order. In case three a sailor complains that he was not paid temporary accommodation allowance when he was posted. The DFO would examine his file and determine whether there was an entitlement to that allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have indicated earlier in my remarks, the creation of this statutory office of Defence Force Ombudsman will provide a very important advance in the conditions of employment for Service members. Amendments within the Bill strengthen and widen the Ombudsman's role in line with developing practice and provide for greater discretion and flexibility by modifying formal, procedural requirements in the Act. There is no question that this initiative is a genuine advance in the conditions of service for members of the defence forces. The establishment of this office does not mean that the Services are badly administered but rather, there will now be a process for a completely independent and statutory investigation of complaints. I know that the initiative will be welcomed by Service personnel throughout my electorate and, in terms of this specific initiative to establish the office of Defence Force Ombudsman, it is fitting that this provision, first introduced by the Whitlam Labor Government, will now finally be implemented by the Hawke Labor Government. I commend both Bills to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The main reason I wish to participate briefly in this debate relates to the inclusion within the first Bill-the Ombudsman Amendment Bill-of clause 20 which inserts Part IIA relating to the establishment , functions, powers and duties of the Defence Force Ombudsman into the original Act. I do not want to go down the track too far for an explanation as everybody is now aware that essentially there will be a new deputy ombudsman who will be responsible for this part of the Act as it applies to the defence forces. His office will be responsible for investigating administrative actions concerning matters related to or arising in consequence of a person's service in the Defence Force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think we are all very aware that the nature of a serviceman's commitment is such that he does have a far more total involvement than a person in civilian employ. Therefore, it is necessary that there be open to members of the Services to the maximum ways by which either perceived or real wrongs can be redressed. I believe this Act extends quite properly the responsibilities of the Ombudsman in relation to the defence forces. Several aspects of that are worthy of comment. I am sure that it is necessary as specified in proposed new sub-section 19C. (5) ( d) of the Bill that the proper disciplinary provisions need to be maintained. Indeed they are excluded by that sub-section from inquiry by the Defence Force Ombudsman as is 'action taken in relation to the grant or refusal of an honour or award to a particular member of the Defence Force' under paragraph (e) of the same sub-section. Those two areas are matters which concern me in other ways and it is because of my concern that I thought it worth mentioning in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to discipline in the forces, I have long felt that it is unfortunate that we still have significant differences between the three uniformed Services. The Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Air Force do have differences in the application of the respective defence Acts as they pertain to each Service. There are elements in the exercise of discipline and in the administration of the Services which I think through their difference do not enhance the efficiency of the Services but detract from them. It is one of the areas that, had we stayed in government, I would have asked the Utz Defence Review Committee to look into. There are a number of matters in that field that, if simplified, would be of benefit to each of the Services, they would certainly be a lot more effective. While the processes of discipline are excluded from the responsibilities of the Defence Force Ombudsman , I think it right that I ask the Minister for Defence (Mr Scholes), who is not in the House at the moment, to look very closely at those differences and give consideration to ways by which similar Acts could be introduced to a greater degree than now applies to the three Services. </PARA>
<PARA> I will identify that process in its ultimate point of appeal as one of those areas which certainly needs to be further examined. When Sir Zelman Cowen was Governor-General, he and I had some discussions about the redress of wrongs procedure as it applies through the Executive Council. I share his worries that, at the moment, the process does not properly allow for a serviceman to have an independent and valid assessment made in the same way that those who are in the Army and Air Force have that procedure available to them and which in most instances, I believe, they expect. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in part, without going down the track too far in explanation, because the Minister for Defence is responsible for making submissions to the Executive Council through the Governor-General. He is virtually forced to reach an opinion on any matter that goes by way of redress of wrongs to him. I believe that it would be better if a procedure could be devised whereby when a redress of wrongs is submitted to the Executive Council it has some chance to hear both sides of the argument so that the person within the Defence Force who is complaining could be certain that there is an independent appraisal of the matters. I certainly think it quite anomalous that at the moment at least this procedure is not available to members of the Royal Australian Navy. That is an area that does need correction. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area in this Bill that I want to refer to briefly is again of exclusion rather than inclusion; that is action which is taken in relation to the grant or refusal of honours or awards. Proposed new sub-section (8) states:</PARA>
<PARA> The reference in paragraph (5) (e) to action taken in relation to the grant or refusal of an honour or award to a particular member of the Defence Force does not include a reference to action taken in relation to the grant or refusal of honours or awards to members of the Defence Force generally . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I have been most concerned that with the granting of awards we still have some difficulty in providing adequate recognition for members of the armed forces who serve in particular units around the world. I instance to honourable members the members of the Army who today are serving in Uganda. This is only a small troop. It is there under one of our aid programs and its members are doing a very fine job in extraordinarily difficult circumstances. We badly need to have an award which notes the fact that Australian servicemen are serving outside Australia. We should provide some sort of a clip to designate where that area is. </PARA>
<PARA> As I read this Bill, I believe that the Ombudsman can make recommendations in this area but it is something that perhaps we do not take sufficiently to heart. We can probably do something more to give due recognition to those members of our forces who work under very arduous conditions, often far more so than their civilian counterparts, but who receive too little recognition for that service which they perform on the nation's behalf. One need only see members of the American forces who have served abroad to recognise how generously they are endowed with ribbons and awards. </PARA>
<PARA> One perhaps feels that is going to the extreme. I do not think we go far enough for the Australian forces. I would like to see the grant of an award for overseas service with a particular star or clip designating the area where a serviceman has served. Perhaps out of the power now being accorded the Defence Force Ombudsman there might be some capability to extend that recognition. Apart from that I would comment only that these Bills are identical with the Bill that the previous Government intended to submit to parliament in due course, that is with respect to the Defence Force Ombudsman. I therefore have no dissent from the provisions as they are set down. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In light of the bipartisan nature of the discussions so far I would like to make some comments about some of the other provisions in respect of the operation of the Commonwealth Ombudsman which will continue the thrust of what the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) has said. I think it is quite true that many of us who are in the parliamentary arena recognise that the role of the Commonwealth Ombudsman is very important by way of settling complaints from the public. Those in the public arena at the moment who are listening to this broadcast will recognise that, from time to time, they have complaints that they wish to take up and that we, as members of parliament, offer one of the avenues. I think it is also important to understand that the Ombudsman performs that sort of a role. In fact, the Commonwealth Ombudsman deals with approximately 11,000 complaints a year. It is important to understand, as a member of parliament and as a member of the public, that this form of complaint, inquiry and representation is a very important part of the functioning of government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Ombudsman Amendment Bill and the Ombudsman (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill, in particular the provisions that relate to the role of Commonwealth Ombudsman, make some changes which we believe are important in terms of the operation of the Ombudsman. One of the changes that are very important is the capacity in the future-under what is now proposed new section 7-for the Ombudsman to take complaints orally. Honourable members, and many people in the community, will understand that if we make a requirement that all complaints must be in writing, those in the community who have come from a background in which written English is a newly acquired skill are automatically disadvantaged. They will be disadvantaged if they have to give all their complaints to the Commonwealth authorities in writing. There has been an amendment which takes recognition of the fact that many in the community will be advantaged by being able to give their complaints orally. Those complaints of course will be translated into the written form later. But we believe that it is important that people give their complaints orally. We think that that will be a very important amendment with respect to the operation of the Ombudsman. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another point that is very important and crucial. Those of us who operate in the public arena with the electorate at large will recognise that a lot of the work we do is in the sense of mediating between the complaint of an elector and the role of the Commonwealth authority. That mediation role is, in many ways, the role the Ombudsman plays. He, in fact, offers a court of appeal to which members of the public, who believe themselves to be aggrieved, can go. These Bills strengthen that thrust. There is an intention, which is quite explicit in these Bills, that the whole role of the Ombudsman should be relatively informal. The capacity of the Ombudsman to investigate complaints on an informal basis will be strengthened. That is also very important. One of the things that emerges when we look at the operation of the Commonwealth administration is that it is not always necessary to have a fully formal inquiry into an area of complaint by an elector but rather, more importantly, to investigate on an informal basis whether the complaint may have greater substance. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence, there is a thrust in the Ombudsman Amendment Bill to allow for that informal complaint to be widened. It is then within the capacity of the Ombudsman, if he so judges, to make that complaint more formal. I should emphasise that with respect to that matter it is not intended that the power of the Ombudsman be reduced. I think it is important that those who are listening to this broadcast should recognise that there will still be a capacity for the Ombudsman, should he deem it necessary, to investigate a complaint fully on a formal basis using the full range of royal commission-type powers such as examining witnesses on oath and requiring production of documents, et cetera. That will still be there. The changes in the Bill do not affect the availability of these powers. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a recognition in this Bill-it comes from the previous Government and is carried through by this Government-that so many of the complaints that do arise with respect to Commonwealth administration do not require the fully formal authority that the Ombudsman possesses. There is an analogy and the analogy is that within the general industrial relations arena the arbitration power, as such, is used rather in the minority and the conciliation and mediation powers are used in the majority. That notion of discussion and resolution of conflict is being used with respect to the role of the Ombudsman. We believe that is a very important matter. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another matter which is also important with respect to the operation of the Ombudsman. It is one I would like to address very quickly; that is, the capacity of people to have their complaints dealt with on a confidential basis will be preserved. In particular, there is recognition within the Bill of those in custody who may make a complaint to the Ombudsman. There is a capacity within this Bill for those complaints to be placed within sealed envelopes and to be delivered to the Ombudsman and that further discussions can remain confidential, allowing that the complainant has the capacity therefore to make, in a protected way, complaints against Commonwealth authority. We believe that is also a very important provision. </PARA>
<PARA> Another question which obviously comes to mind when we are talking about the role of an ombudsman in investigating Commonwealth operations is: To what extent do secrecy provisions exist? Quite obviously there have to be limits on the questioning capacity in the public arena of Commonwealth authorities. The Bill does provide that if, as a result of deliberations and the advice of the Executive Council, it can be deemed that to provide that information would result in a breach of the deliberations and the authority of the Executive Council, those documents and that advice would not be made public. We are suggesting, in essence, that there is a need to have some secrecy provisions. Those secrecy provisions go to the heart of the role of government; that is, the Executive Council. We are not allowing the cut-off point to be at an earlier stage with respect to protecting Commonwealth administration. </PARA>
<PARA> In talking to these matters it seems that there are some important things to bring out. I believe it is important to recognise that this Bill, in essence, carries forward many of the provisions of the previous Government. It is important for the public at large to understand that there is a bipartisanship on this matter. The electorate should understand, in looking at a crucial matter such as this, that both sides of the House are clear on these matters. We are making the area of complaints a far less formal process and thereby giving much greater capacity for members of the public to get across their viewpoint. There is also an emphasis on this mediation role. That is being seen as being a very important role of the Ombudsman. On the question of confidentiality of complaints-the matter I referred to earlier-people, who in special circumstances , may wish their complaints to remain confidential will be able to do so. In the light of those remarks, I commend the Bills to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>RECENT ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE</PARA>
<PARA> This Government inherited an economy undergoing its worst recession in fifty years. </PARA>
<PARA> Activity, both in the farm and non-farm sectors, began to weaken almost two years ago, and was still falling when the Government came to office. </PARA>
<PARA> Gross Domestic Product has declined by 4.5 per cent from its pre-recession peak . </PARA>
<PARA> The labour market deteriorated even more sharply than this figure suggests. </PARA>
<PARA> Nearly three-quarters of a million Australians were already out of work when the Government took office. </PARA>
<PARA> Unemployment had risen by 263,000 during the previous twelve months. </PARA>
<PARA> Inflation, at 11.5 per cent, was running at more than double the OECD average and was accompanied by high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, the economic policies of the previous Government had failed to come to terms with Australia's deep-seated problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy of 'fighting inflation first' had not only failed to restrain the inflation rate but had laid to waste large areas of our industries, relegating hundreds of thousands to the misery and indignity of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government sought and received a very clear mandate from the Australian people to put the country back on the path to economic prosperity and to deal with inflation and unemployment simultaneously-with a spirit of consensus and fairness that would give the strategy its greatest opportunity for success. </PARA>
<PARA> With those objectives in mind the Government embarked upon the National Economic Summit, the May Statement of economic measures, the Premiers' Conference and now the Budget to build that consensus and hone the edge of its policies to turn those objectives into achievements. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Economic Summit endorsed the broad thrust of the Government's economic strategy with particular support for the policy of fighting inflation and unemployment simultaneously. </PARA>
<PARA> At the Premiers' Conference, an historic accord of all Premiers endorsed the Commonwealth Government's approach to its forthcoming Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The process of discussion, consultation and consensus has produced the first signs of optimism in a country wearied by broken promises, dashed expectations and depressed economic conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget seeks to build upon that optimism-to nurture it, to develop it, until consumer spending and business investment regain their appropriate momentum. </PARA>
<PARA> While that private sector spending is at a low ebb, the Government has accepted the need for a more substantial role for the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Its policy in this Budget is to provide the maximum fiscal stimulus to the economy consistent with its anti-inflation objectives but without placing undue burdens on interest rates or the balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA> To this end, the Government took the opportunity in May of providing an early stimulus to the badly depressed building and construction industry, with measures directed at both private and public sector housing. </PARA>
<PARA> In fulfilment of one of its major election commitments it also established the Community Employment Program to assist the long term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> A similar approach was taken at the Premiers' Conference. </PARA>
<PARA> Through both tax sharing grants and loan programs the Commonwealth assisted the States to increase their activity, including their large capital works programs.</PARA>
<PARA> This Budget builds on those earlier steps. </PARA>
<PARA> It is designed to provide a floor of activity in the economy while the private sector recovers. </PARA>
<PARA> There are already signs of a pick-up in that activity. </PARA>
<PARA> 1983-84 holds promise of a considerable improvement in economic performance. </PARA>
<PARA> But our economic problems are deep-seated and they cannot be resolved quickly or by precipitate action. </PARA>
<PARA> The key task of our policy therefore is to facilitate a sustained recovery that wears away the unacceptably high level of unemployment we are now experiencing. </PARA>
<PARA> But this Budget is also about fairness and equity-about a re-ordering of priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> It focuses assistance on those who have suffered most from the recession and on those areas so long neglected by our predecessors. </PARA>
<PARA> Today's unemployed are victims of events beyond their individual control. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unconscionable that they also be made victims of government indifference.</PARA>
<PARA> Later in my Speech I will announce substantial increases in benefits to the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Community Employment Program also makes its contribution in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> It is directed at the longer term unemployed who, because of their lack of recent work experience, are particularly disadvantaged in job- seeking. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also taken steps to fulfil our election pledge to introduce Medicare which will share the costs of health care for all Australians more equitably. </PARA>
<PARA> Fairness also requires that those who are evading their obligations to society by avoiding tax are made to pay their share. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing system and structure of taxation has developed in a fragmented and ad hoc fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> The substantially increased weight of taxation overall makes the need for efficiency in tax arrangements all the more pressing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has given this high priority both in the measures announced in May and those I will be announcing tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> Before turning to the detail of our outlays proposals, I note that the burgeoning cost of our predecessors' programs, if left unchecked, would have severely circumscribed our ability to meet our own high priority commitments. </PARA>
<PARA> On taking office we were advised that, on unchanged policies, the tentative Budget outlook for 1983-84 was for a deficit of $9.6 billion-including an increase of 12 per cent on 1982-83 outlays as then estimated. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it became clear during the Budget process, in the light of more recent estimates, that outlays would be more than $800m higher than indicated in the forward estimates. </PARA>
<PARA> A full reconciliation of the revised forward estimates with the original is provided in an Appendix to Statement No. 3 in the accompanying Budget Paper No. 1. </PARA>
<PARA> If that had been the only change to the Budget estimates we would have been facing a deficit in 1983-84 of $10.4 billion rather than $9.6 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> But because of several factors, including the higher growth estimates now in prospect, in part because of events put in train by this Government, the revenue estimates have increased by about $1.4 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that the residual deficit of $9 billion was higher than the Government had considered acceptable, our new expenditure initiatives could only be financied by cutting back on our precedessors' programs or by increasing taxes. </PARA>
<PARA>OUTLAYS</PARA>
<PARA> Because of the fiscal position the government inherited we were not prepared nor able simply to add our own programs to those of the previous Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather, we have sought-and achieved-a substantial re-ordering of priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> In doing so, we have reduced prospective expenditures, to the extent of almost $1220m in 1983-84, on those programs which supported organisations or individuals who could reasonably be expected to provide for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, we have made revenue savings on program-related tax expenditures amounting to $230m in 1983-84; these include the income tax rebate for basic health insurance and the tax rebates for housing loan interest. </PARA>
<PARA> On present estimates, a further $390m will be provided by the Medicare tax levy . </PARA>
<PARA> The combined effect of these measures is to reduce the prospective 1983-84 Budget deficit by $1840m. </PARA>
<PARA> Our decisions on new programs and additions to existing programs are estimated to add about $2490m to outlays in 1983-84; these include the introduction of Medicare, the Community Employment Program, our initiatives on public housing, measures to ease the plight of the unemployed, and a wide range of other initiatives-some already announced and others which I shall outline this evening . </PARA>
<PARA> We have also provided substantial real increases in payments to the States and in a number of other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> After allowance for the offsets I have just mentioned, totalling $1840m, the net cost of our new expenditure initiatives is about $650m. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat, therefore, that we have achieved our objectives for new programs, not by simply adding them on, but by a genuine re-ordering of priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Details of individual programs are set out in Statement No. 3 and other Budget statements: more information will be provided, as appropriate, by the Ministers responsible. </PARA>
<PARA>HEALTH</PARA>
<PARA> Under Medicare, to operate from February 1984, all Australians will be covered automatically for the costs of basic health care regardless of their income. </PARA>
<PARA> Medicare will be a simple, equitable and universal system of medical and hospital cover; the additional outlays involved in its implementation are estimated at $600m in 1983-84 and about $1800m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> Taking account of our decisions announced in May and estimated revenue from the proposed levy on taxable income, the net cost of Medicare to the Budget is estimated at $35m in 1983-84 and about $80m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Health will introduce relevant legislation during the present sittings of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> To counter medical fraud and overservicing, a special Surveillance and Investigations Program will be introduced in 1983-84; expenditure in this Field will double to $8m. </PARA>
<PARA>SOCIAL SECURITY AND WELFARE</PARA>
<PARA> This Government places very high priority on improving the lot of the most disadvantaged in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> The welfare of this group deteriorated sharply, and its numbers increased substantially, during the seven years of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We reject that Government's expenditure priorities and we reject their macroeconomic policies which added drastically to the ranks of the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA> But the damage cannot be repaired overnight. </PARA>
<PARA> The measures I shall now announce, together with those I announced in May, represent first steps in re-establishing priorities in favour of those in the community who have suffered most from recent economic conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> Further details will be provided by the Ministers for Social Security and Veterans' Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>Unemployment and Other Benefits</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has already increased, from May 1983, the rate of unemployment benefit for single persons aged 18 and over by $4.25 per week to $68.65 per week , at a cost of about $100m in 1983-84. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has now decided to increase the rate again in November 1983 by $ 4.95 per week, or by $2 a week more than needed to allow for inflation, to bring the rate to $73.60 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> Commencing in May 1984, this rate will be automatically indexed for increases in the Consumer Price Index; at that time, a $2 supplement will again be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> On current reckoning, this will amount to a further increase of about $4.80 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> The total increase since this Government came to office will be around $14 per week or more than 21 per cent; over the same period the combined married rate is likely to have increased, with existing indexation arrangements, by about 16 per cent to around $148.90 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> The rate of unemployment and sickness benefit payable to single persons aged under 18 years, which has been increased only once since 1975, will be raised by $5 to $45 per week in November 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> To encourage unemployed people to seek casual and part-time work, the income test for unemployment and sickness benefits is to be liberalised from March 1984 . </PARA>
<PARA> Beneficiaries will be allowed to earn $20 per week rather than the present $10 per week without any reduction in the benefit they receive; and the upper limit of the non-benefit income range over which the benefit is reduced on a 50 per cent basis will be increased from $60 to $70 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> These Budget measures are estimated to cost $118 million in 1983-84 and $276 million in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> Other measures which I shall announce shortly will also benefit the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA>Assistance for Families</PARA>
<PARA>Supplements for Children of Pensioners and Beneficiaries</PARA>
<PARA> The rate of additional pension and benefit for the 800 000 children of pensioners and beneficiaries, which has been increased only once since 1975, will be increased by 20 per cent to $12 per week from November 1983; the maximum rate of Family Income Supplement will be increased by the same amount per child.</PARA>
<PARA> To ensure that such assistance is not reduced by the impact of personal income tax, all additional assistance for the children of unemployment, sickness and special beneficiaries will be made non-taxable from 1 March 1984 at a full-year cost of $20 million. </PARA>
<PARA> For beneficiaries who are standard rate taxpayers, this exemption will mean a reduction in tax of up to $3.60 per week for each child from March 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> The comparable payments to pensioners, supporting parents and employed persons with low family incomes are already exempt from income tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will also legislate to provide for a uniform rate of mother's/ guardian's allowance of $8 per week payable to sole parent pensioners and supporting parent beneficiaries; we will extend, from May 1984, this non-taxable payment to single unemployment, sickness and special beneficiaries with dependent children. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will be allocating $10 million in 1983-84, rising to $30 million in 1984-85, for high priority new and expanded projects and initiatives under the Childrens Services Program. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of these various measures to assist families is estimated to be $77 million in 1983-84 and $141 million in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Assistance for Those Living in Remote Areas</PARA>
<PARA> Most pensioners and beneficiaries living in remote areas of Australia can take little or no advantage of the Tax Zone Rebate. </PARA>
<PARA> To redress this, the Government has decided to introduce a new payment for pensioners and beneficiaries living in Tax Zone A of $7 per week for single people $12 per week for married couples and $3.50 per week for each dependent child. </PARA>
<PARA> These allowances, which will be payable from May 1984 and will be non-taxable, are estimated to cost about $3 million in 1983-84 and about $16 million in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Retirement Incomes</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is determined to make Australia a fairer society. </PARA>
<PARA> We must reform our taxation and welfare systems so that tax burdens are spread throughout the community on the basis of capacity to pay, and welfare payments are provided according to needs. </PARA>
<PARA> Since taking office, the Government has moved decisively to enhance our equity objectives in the retirement incomes area. </PARA>
<PARA> In my May Statement, I announced the introduction of an income test on the component of age and service pensions for persons aged over 70 which was previously paid free of any income test. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also reformed the tax treatment of superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is evidence of extensive and increasing avoidance of the pension income test by people who do not need the pension. </PARA>
<PARA> One reason for this was the removal of the assets test in 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to reintroduce a test on both income and assets along similar lines to the test that applied before. </PARA>
<PARA> An outline of the new test will be announced shortly by the Minister for Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA> For the moment, I simply say that the exemptions will include the following types of assets:</PARA>
<PARA> the pensioner's home or principal residence;</PARA>
<PARA> a car for personal use by each pensioner;</PARA>
<PARA> personal effects including furniture, household effects, a caravan, a boat, jewellery, works of art; and</PARA>
<PARA> other assets to the value of $1500 for a single pensioner and $2500 for pensioner couples. </PARA>
<PARA> Allowing for administrative processes, the new test will not operate until about 12 months after legislation has been passed. </PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile, the Government has decided to remove the exemption from the pension income test of certain income received from friendly societies, which has been increasingly exploited for the purpose of gaining or increasing pension entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA> Removal of the exemption will take effect from 1 November 1983 and is estimated to save about $7m in 1983-84 and $10m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Pensioner Fringe Benefits</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to take action on the fringe benefit income test to reduce incentives for income test avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> This test, like the pension income test, will be based on income and assets; in the meantime, the Government will introduce automatic indexation of the income limits on a twice-yearly basis in line with increases in the Consumer Price Index. </PARA>
<PARA> This will help to maintain entitlement to concessions for eligible pensioners whose incomes increase from time to time because of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>Assistance for the Handicapped</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to introduce, from December 1983, a spouse carer's pension. This will allow the husband of an age, service or invalid pensioner wife to receive assistance, on the same basis as wife's pension, where the husband provides care and attention for an extended period on account of his wife's severe physical or mental disability. </PARA>
<PARA> Sheltered workshops, activity therapy centres and training centres for the handicapped will be eligible for certain increased subsidies towards staff costs , and a new bonus of $500 will be paid to people previously receiving sheltered employment allowance who successfully transfer to open employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The total cost of the spouse carer's pension and the additional assistance for the handicapped is estimated to be $4m in 1983-84 and $10m in a full year.</PARA>
<PARA>Emergency Relief</PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises the pressures on voluntary agencies at this time to provide additional emergency relief. </PARA>
<PARA> To assist in meeting those pressures, the amount provided to assist such agencies will be doubled to $5m in 1983-84. </PARA>
<PARA>Care of the Aged</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is determined to reduce the extent to which Australians rely on inappropriate and expensive institutional care for the elderly and infirm. </PARA>
<PARA> Pending the development during 1983-84 of detailed proposals on community care and the completion of a review of funding guidelines for nursing homes, the Government has decided to restructure the existing personal care subsidy for hostel care and to relate assistance more closely to the needs of hostel residents. </PARA>
<PARA> We also plan to develop geriatric assessment units and to provide funds for essential research. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost in 1983-84 is estimated at $9m</PARA>
<PARA>Assistance for Migrants</PARA>
<PARA> In 1983-84 an additional 60 grants at a cost of $778 000 will be provided under the Grant-in-Aid Scheme to assist ethnic and other community organisations to employ social welfare workers to provide services to migrants. </PARA>
<PARA> The additional grants will bring the total number of grants under the scheme to 200 by June 1984. </PARA>
<PARA>Assistance for Aboriginals</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget provides $207m-an increase of 28 per cent-for Aboriginal advancement programs administered by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> These funds will be directed towards expanding the role of the National Aboriginal Conference and expanding existing programs for Aboriginals in the fields of employment, health, legal aid and community management and services; special programs will also be developed to assist Aboriginal fringe dwellers. </PARA>
<PARA> Other spending specifically to assist Aboriginals will total about $167m in 1983-84, an increase of 22 per cent; for example, grants of $52m are earmarked for Aboriginals under the welfare housing program, and $7m is provided under the Community Employment Program for Aboriginal employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Reflecting the state of the economy and the measures I have announced tonight, total outlays on Social Security and Welfare are estimated to increase by 19.3 per cent in 1983-84 to $16 843m. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with our general approach of re-ordering priorities, the substantial improvements to our welfare system which I have just outlined have been achieved at a net cost of only $107m in 1983-84. </PARA>
<PARA>EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has already announced several initiatives which will put people into work quickly, and which will also result in worthwhile improvements in the country's infrastructure, notably in such areas as roads and country town water supplies. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1983-84 we expect to spend $958m on employment and training schemes-80 per cent more than in 1982-83-which, when fully operational, are expected to result in employment and/or training opportunities for about 300 000 people a year. </PARA>
<PARA> Other spending aimed at increasing the supply of housing, Commonwealth office space and roads, maintaining the Commonwealth's assets and assisting the steel industry and steel-producing regions will also boost employment substantially.</PARA>
<PARA>HOUSING</PARA>
<PARA> Our housing programs provide increased, and more flexible, assistance for first home buyers and substantial additional funds for public housing. </PARA>
<PARA> These programs, the details of which have already been announced, will lead to increased housing activity in both the public and private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> This increase in activity is expected to create at least 30 000 additional jobs . </PARA>
<PARA> Total outlays from the Budget on housing in 1983-84 are estimated at $912m, an increase of 23 per cent on 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA>CAPITAL WORKS</PARA>
<PARA> Contrary to the failed approach of our predecessors, this Government supports the use of expansionary fiscal policy during economic downturns, including by way of capital works spending which directly stimulates employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Substantial capital works spending is warranted by the overall slack in the economy, and in particular by the spare capacity at present in the construction sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, after seven years of neglect under our predecessors, during which capital spending became the scapegoat for the lack of genuine expenditure restraint, there is a heavy backlog of urgently needed public works. </PARA>
<PARA> Reflecting these factors, expenditure on civil works financed directly from the Budget is to be $390m in 1983-84, an increase of 16 per cent over 1982-83.</PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, in total, direct capital expenditure and capital grants provided in the Budget will increase by about 22 per cent to $3700m in 1983-84. </PARA>
<PARA>Airports</PARA>
<PARA> There will be a major upgrading of our airports, including the relocation and upgrading of civil aviation facilities at Darwin at the total cost of $95m and the commencement of a new international terminal at Perth, to cost $48m. </PARA>
<PARA> New aviation works to be started in 1983-84 form part of a program estimated to cost $213m over the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA>Commonwealth Offices</PARA>
<PARA> We shall embark on a major Commonwealth office construction program which will stimulate the construction industry and hold down our rapidly increasing expenditure on rental accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> Offices will be commenced in Townsville, Thursday Island and Lismore, and in Glenorchy and Bellerive in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> We shall also call for expressions of interest from the private sector with a view to proceeding with lease/purchase office development, as appropriate, at Parramatta, Newcastle, Wollongong, Dubbo, Rockhampton, Mackay, Cairns, Fremantle , Port Pirie and Devonport. </PARA>
<PARA>Repairs and Maintenance</PARA>
<PARA> Expenditure on repairs and maintenance (including funds under the Community Employment Program) will increase by 29 per cent to $220m in 1983-84. </PARA>
<PARA> This labour intensive and geographically dispersed program will create jobs and will begin to redress the serious decline in the physical condition of Commonwealth assets that has been allowed to develop in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA>TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS</PARA>
<PARA> Total 1983-84 Budget outlays on transport and communications are estimated at $ 1705m. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the effect of once-only capital injections for Qantas, TAA, ANL and AUSSAT in 1982-83, this is about 3 per cent below 1982-83 spending. </PARA>
<PARA>Roads Assistance</PARA>
<PARA> Grants to the States and Northern Territory for roads will total $1233m in 1983 -84, an increase of 45 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This includes $70m earmarked for expenditure on local roads under the Jobs on Local Roads element of the Community Employment Program. </PARA>
<PARA>Road Safety</PARA>
<PARA> Expenditure to improve road safety in Australia is to be increased in 1983-84 by 56 per cent to $6.1m. </PARA>
<PARA>Rail</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is undertaking a comprehensive review of Australian National Railways' operations with a view to improving its efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile, the $85m provided towards operating losses in 1983-84 compares with a subsidy of $106m in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA>EDUCATION</PARA>
<PARA> In 1983-84 our direct spending on education is planned to rise by about 11 per cent to $4211m; most of this-about $3515m-will support programs administered by the Commonwealth Tertiary Education and Schools Commissions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Education and Youth Affairs has already announced funding details for these programs in calendar year 1984; they include measures directed towards increasing the participation rate of young people in post-compulsory education. </PARA>
<PARA>Student Assistance</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to increase the main allowances under student assistance schemes from the beginning of 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> The allowance payable under the Secondary Allowances Scheme will rise by 20 per cent; for TEAS and the other schemes, the increase will be between 5 per cent and 7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Income test requirements for all schemes will be eased with limits being increased by 6 per cent for 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of these increases is estimated at $21m in 1983-84 and about $41m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginal Education</PARA>
<PARA> To increase the number of trained Aboriginal teachers, the Government has decided to make available within the Aboriginal Study Grants Scheme a special allocation of 100 teacher training awards, to be available to mature age students; benefits will comprise a living allowance of $150 per week plus other normal entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA>DEFENCE</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget provides $5280m for defence, an increase of 10.4 per cent on 1982-83 outlays, and real growth of about 4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> During the course of the year the Government will be assessing Australia's strategic environment as a basis for reviewing our forward plans for defence. </PARA>
<PARA> The Ministers for Defence and Defence Support will provide further details. </PARA>
<PARA>OVERSEAS AID</PARA>
<PARA> A total of $822m is provided for overseas aid expenditure, including administrative costs, an increase of about 13 per cent on 1982-83 expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA> Budgetary assistance to Papua New Guinea will increase by 10 per cent to $288m, reflecting recent special aid and the revision of the five-year aid agreement with that country. </PARA>
<PARA> We will continue to give priority to assisting countries in Australia's own region. </PARA>
<PARA>CULTURE AND RECREATION</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget provides $599m for culture and recreation in 1983-84, an increase of 14.6 per cent on 1982-83 outlays. </PARA>
<PARA> Of this amount, the ABC will receive a total of $289m in 1983-84; this will enable initial planning for the proposed introduction of a second regional radio network and eventual use by the ABC of the domestic satellite system to be introduced in Australia in 1985-86. </PARA>
<PARA> The $37.9m provided for the Australia Council-an increase of 13 per cent over 1982-83-is the first step towards restoring arts funding to its 1975-76 real level. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has agreed in principle to the establishment of the Museum of Australia in Canberra; a Director will be appointed and initial design work on the museum will be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with certain changes in the basis of the present taxation arrangements to assist the film industry, which I shall announce later, an additional amount of $5m is provided in 1983-84 for direct investment by the Australian Film Commission in the production of films of high quality with potential for commercial viability. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this year we established the Ministry of Sport, Recreation and Tourism. An amount of $40m, an increase of 48 per cent, is included in the Budget for assistance to sport and recreation. </PARA>
<PARA>ASSISTANCE TO INDUSTRY</PARA>
<PARA> Total direct outlays on industry assistance are estimated to decline marginally in 1983-84 to $1104m. </PARA>
<PARA> This mainly reflects the breaking of the drought over much of Australia together with certain decisions already announced by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Rural Assistance</PARA>
<PARA> In recognition of the effects of the drought, expenditure under the general provisions of the Rural Adjustment Scheme is to be doubled to $35m in 1983-84.</PARA>
<PARA> A further $11m is to be provided under the scheme's carry-on finance arrangements to assist the sugar industry in New South Wales and Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will provide further assistance to the Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Eradication Campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's contribution for tuberculosis infected cattle destroyed under the campaign will be increased from 50 per cent to 75 per cent, the same as for brucellosis infected cattle; an additional $4m will be made available for a range of new measures designed to accelerate the eradication campaign in central and northern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Water Resources</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to provide $46m for the National Water Resources Program in 1983-84, an increase of 19 per cent on 1982-83 expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA>Industrial Development</PARA>
<PARA> The Government attaches a high priority to the development of high technology industries with growth prospects. </PARA>
<PARA> As outlined in our election policy we envisage a greater role for the Australian Industry Development Corporation in fostering industrial development.</PARA>
<PARA> To this end, a capital instalment of $12.5m has been provided to AIDC in the Budget and the Government has decided to increase AIDC's gearing ratio and to guarantee its borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA> Funds for expenditure under the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Scheme have been increased by 36 per cent to $71.6m. </PARA>
<PARA> An additional $4m has been provided to the CSIRO as part of the package of increased support for key technology areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Science and Technology will announce further details. </PARA>
<PARA>Steel Industry</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is committed to the maintenance of an efficient and viable steel industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Reflecting that commitment, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has recently announced details of the Steel Industry Plan. </PARA>
<PARA>Tourist Industry</PARA>
<PARA> To assist the development of Australia's tourist industry, funding for the Australian Tourist Commission will be increased by 75 per cent to $17.5m in 1983 -84. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Government will provide a grant of $1m in 1983-84 to the Queensland Government to subsidise the costs of diesel fuel to Barrier Reef island tourist resorts. </PARA>
<PARA>Trade Promotion</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget provides an additional $4.2m for expanded trade promotion activities , including the upgrading of trade promotion programs in Australia's major export markets and the establishment of a Market Research Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> Further details will be announced by the Minister for Trade. </PARA>
<PARA>Petroleum Products Freight Subsidy</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will be amending the Petroleum Products Freight Subsidy Scheme to improve administration and reduce costs. </PARA>
<PARA> This will involve removing from eligibility for subsidy, power kerosene and those locations where there is no retail site; in the latter case, subsidy rates will be based on the rate at the nearest location with a retail site or, for locations at sea, at the port of loading. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes will save an estimated $2m in 1983-84. </PARA>
<PARA>Banking</PARA>
<PARA> As part of a continuing commitment to the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, and in the context of a general review of its financial operations including its profitability, the Government has decided to provide a capital injection of $15m in 1983-84 to the Commonwealth Trading Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> This will be the first such capital subscription to the Bank since its inception. </PARA>
<PARA>LAW, ORDER AND PUBLIC SAFETY</PARA>
<PARA> Total expenditure on Legal Aid is estimated to increase by 23 per cent to $71. 4m. </PARA>
<PARA> Recognising the importance of adequate capability for criminal investigations, the Government is providing $4m in 1983-84 to allow for an increase in the manpower resources of the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA>PAYMENTS TO THE STATES, NORTHERN TERRITORY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT</PARA>
<PARA> Total net payments to the States, the Northern Territory and local government, including all specific purpose payments, are estimated to increase by 14 per cent to $18 710m in 1983-84. The major decisions affecting these payments have already been announced. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to providing for a once-only special revenue assistance grant of $ 155.5m to the States in 1983-84, the Budget includes $30m for payments for Tasmania in 1983-84 under the assistance arrangements arising from termination of the Gordon-below-Franklin dam; details are being announced as agreement is reached on individual projects. </PARA>
<PARA>RECEIPTS</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to revenue proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> Budget revenues show only moderate growth in 1983-84. </PARA>
<PARA> This reflects among other influences the 1982-83 recession, the full year effects of the previous Government's tax cuts and a projected drop in crude oil levy receipts. </PARA>
<PARA> This subdued revenue outlook, together with our expenditure initiatives, necessitates some increase in taxation for 1983-84. </PARA>
<PARA> In deciding on the measures involved, we have been guided by the principles we adopted in our May Economic Statement-namely, that they should be equitable, make a durable contribution to the budget and improve the operation of the taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA> As I noted earlier, the substantially increased weight of taxation overall makes the need for efficiency in tax arrangements all the more pressing. </PARA>
<PARA> It also makes even more urgent the drive against tax evasion and avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> Durable tax reform cannot, of course, be achieved overnight. </PARA>
<PARA> The measures already taken, and those I am about to announce, are a start to, rather than fulfilment of, our tax reform objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>Traditional Excises</PARA>
<PARA> The traditional excises-on beer, potable spirits, tobacco products and certain petroleum products-are set at specific rates, that is, at so many dollars or cents per unit of the exisable commodity. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past, discretionary increases in these specific excise rates have not been sufficiently frequent or, in aggregate, large enough to counteract the eroding effects of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> Real rates of excise have consequently tended to fall. </PARA>
<PARA> Between 1973-74 and 1982-83, revenue from the traditional excises, measured in constant 1982-83 dollars, fell from $4.3 billion to $3.3 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the same period, the share of traditional excise collections in total budget receipts fell from 13 per cent to a little over 7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is taking two steps towards countering this trend. </PARA>
<PARA> First, we are making some discretionary increases in certain nominal excise rates. </PARA>
<PARA> With effect from tonight, there will be a rise of 1.5 cents per litre in the excise on motor spirit and distillate. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be an increase of 0.5 cents per litre in the excise on aviation turbine fuel and aviation gasoline. </PARA>
<PARA> The rebate of excise on diesel fuel used off-road by the mining, forestry, farming and fishing industries and by households, hospitals, nursing and aged persons' homes will not be increased. </PARA>
<PARA> These discretionary rate increases are expected to yield about $295m in 1983-84 . </PARA>
<PARA> They will assist our energy independence by maintaining the real price of petroleum products, thus continuing the incentive to consumers to restrain their reliance on these fuels. </PARA>
<PARA> There will also be some additions to the base of excise taxation, with effect from tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> The excise on grape spirit used in fortifying wine will be reintroduced at the rate of $2.50 per litre of alcohol. </PARA>
<PARA> In order both to increase revenue and to control possible substitution and blending of certain petroleum products, fuel oil, heating oil and power and lighting kerosenes will become subject to excise at the new rate of excise on motor spirit and diesel fuel. </PARA>
<PARA> However, for excise and customs purposes, heating oil will be treated on a par with diesel fuel and will therefore be subject to the 7.155 cents per litre excise rebate for eligible off-road uses such as home heating. </PARA>
<PARA> The net revenue gain from these extensions to the excise base is estimated at $ 122m in 1983-84. </PARA>
<PARA> Certain minor items will be deleted from the excise base with effect from tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> Fusel oil, amylic alcohol, cigarette papers and tubes, and matches will no longer be excisable. </PARA>
<PARA> Although this will cost some $1.5m in revenue in 1983-84, it will permit more cost-effective allocation of administrative resources in the customs and excise area. </PARA>
<PARA> From tonight, following recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission , there will be a single excise rate for each of the three major tobacco groups- cigarettes, manufactured tobacco and cigars. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, the rate for cigars will rise to the rate on cigarettes; the rate on manufactured tobacco will rise immediately by $5.00 per kilo to $20.10 per kilo, with similar increases in future Budgets until such time as the rate reaches that which then applies for cigarettes and cigars. </PARA>
<PARA> The revenue gain is estimated at $4m in 1983-84. </PARA>
<PARA> As a second step towards countering the declining trend in real excise revenues , the Government is introducing from tonight a system of six-monthly indexation of traditional excise rates (that is, excluding the excises on crude oil and LPG ) and of the excise-equivalent component of customs duties on imports of comparable products. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure will allow for the maintenance of the real value of excise rates in a non-destabilising fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> Previous erratic reactions to the declining trend in collections, most notably in 1978, have destabilised the sales patterns of the industries concerned, imposed sudden and large increases on consumers, as well as providing problems for the overall economic management. </PARA>
<PARA> The new system will afford a greater degree of stability for consumers and industry alike. </PARA>
<PARA> These traditional excises will rise gradually in line with inflation and as wages and other incomes themselves increase. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the new arrangements will be simply to place excisable products on much the same basis as those products subject to sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The first six-monthly indexed increase in excise rates will take effect from tonight and will reflect the 4.3 per cent increase in the CPI during the March and June quarters of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> That 4.3 per cent increase will be applied to the new excise rates announced tonight in all cases except manufactured tobacco, on which the new excise rate has been set with specific industry considerations in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> Other traditionally excisable products, whose rates have not been subject to discretionary increases tonight, will of course also be subject to the indexation increase tonight and subsequently. </PARA>
<PARA> As examples of the effects of these changes (including the discretionary excise increases) on the retail prices of excisable products, the price of petrol might be expected to increase by about 2 cents per litre, of cigarettes by about 3 cents per packet and a bottle of beer by about 3 cents. </PARA>
<PARA> The second of the six-monthly indexation increases in nominal excise rates under the arrangements now announced will occur on 1 February 1984, based on the CPI increases for the September and December quarters of 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequent indexation of excises will occur on 1 August and 1 February each financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> The combined revenue gain from the two indexation adjustments in 1983-84 is expected to be about $236m. </PARA>
<PARA> For each of the excise increases announced tonight, there will be commensurate increases in the excise-equivalent components of the corresponding customs duties on imports. </PARA>
<PARA> These are estimated to add a further $13m to 1983-84 revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>Crude Oil Levy</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has taken action to encourage the maximum absorption by refiners of domestically produced crude oil with particular emphasis on excisable 'old' oil. </PARA>
<PARA> Legislation will be prepared to provide authority for the imposition of a duty on petroleum imports, should that prove necessary to discourage underlifting of indigenous crude oil. </PARA>
<PARA> Esso/BHP have been advised that the Government wishes that in 1983-84 not more than 18 million barrels of crude oil be produced for domestic consumption from the excise-free Fortescue field. </PARA>
<PARA> However, approval will be given for the export, for spot sale, of production from that field in 1983-84 in excess of that level. </PARA>
<PARA> Approval will also be forthcoming for spot sales of excisable 'old' oil in certain circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures should ensure that the maximum available level of domestic crude oil production is taken up and that a balance is maintained between the production of 'old' and 'new' oil. </PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated that crude oil levy receipts in 1983-84 will be $245m higher as a result of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Sales Tax</PARA>
<PARA> In reviewing the sales tax law for anomalies and inconsistencies, the Government has decided to change the classification for sales tax purposes of a wide range of goods. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes, which do not involve any general increase in sales tax rates, are estimated to yield $29m in 1983-84 and $44m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> Details are given at Appendix III of Statement No. 4. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes will variously mean that, of the goods concerned that pass the taxing point after tonight, some now exempt will be subject to tax, others now taxed will become exempt, while others again will be taxed at a different rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Under these arrangements, certain vessels used for tourist purposes that were subjected to tax in the 1981-82 Budget will become exempt. </PARA>
<PARA> To assist the boat-building and tourist industries, these vessels will also retrospectively be made exempt back to the 1981-82 Budget, at an additional cost to revenue of $5m in 1983-84. </PARA>
<PARA>Income Tax Measures</PARA>
<PARA> Section 26 (a) of the Income Tax Assessment Act imposes tax on profits made on the sale of property acquired for the purpose of resale at a profit. </PARA>
<PARA> With effect from tomorrow, that section is to be strengthened, in three ways.</PARA>
<PARA> The first will address situations where tax would have applied if property had been resold by the purchaser, but it was instead transferred, say by gift, to a passive recipient. </PARA>
<PARA> Under present law an intention to resell at a profit could not necessarily be attributed to the donee. </PARA>
<PARA> The law will be amended so that the donee will be regarded as having acquired the property with the same intention as the transferor had at the time of acquisition of the property, and for the same price. </PARA>
<PARA> The second will remove doubts about the effectiveness of section 26 (a) in situations such as that where it was arranged for a company to purchase property , and when it appreciated in value the shares in the company were sold. </PARA>
<PARA> It will also be made clear that other situations where there is not a strict identity between the property acquired with a profit-making purpose and the property subsequently disposed of are not beyond the reach of the section. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, profits on the sale of bonus shares or rights derived as a consequence of ownership of other shares will be made taxable if profits on disposal of the original shares would attract tax. </PARA>
<PARA> At present the bonus shares and rights are treated as separate from the original shares, and the purpose in acquiring the latter is not attributed to the bonus shares or rights. </PARA>
<PARA>'Bottom of the Harbour' Legislation</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has given careful consideration to the views expressed by honourable members and senators on the Bill which was considered by Parliament earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of those views, it has decided to resubmit to the Parliament a modified Bill which excludes two elements of the earlier Bill to which objections were raised-levying of personal tax on capital profits and on other accumulated profits from past years when there was no pre-company tax stripping.</PARA>
<PARA> Removal of those elements leaves two principal areas of the earlier Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The first is recovery of escaped personal tax relating to those years where there was pre-tax profit stripping. </PARA>
<PARA> The second is some strengthening of the recoupment tax law as it applies to company tax, and in certain other respects. </PARA>
<PARA> The modified Bill will permit the personal tax recouped to be paid over a period of 12 months, free of interest. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure is estimated to yield $60m in 1983-84 and a total of $270m ultimately. </PARA>
<PARA>Taxation Expenditures</PARA>
<PARA> Tax expenditures impact on the budget just as do direct outlays but from a base that is less readily controlled and accountable to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> After a review of tax expenditures, the Government has decided to make the following changes. </PARA>
<PARA>Expenditure on Land Clearing and Swamp Drainage, etc. </PARA>
<PARA> The write-off in equal instalments over 10 years of capital expenditure deductible under section 75A of the Income Tax Assessment Act (such as expenditure on land clearing and swamp drainage) is to be abolished in respect of expenditure incurred (other than under an existing contract) after tonight.</PARA>
<PARA> The estimated saving to revenue is $3m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure will meet the concerns of those who believe that the earlier tax treatment encouraged these activities to an environmentally unsound and economically unnecessary degree. </PARA>
<PARA>Expenditure on Home Insulation</PARA>
<PARA> The deduction of certain expenditure on the thermal insulation of a first home will be abolished in respect of expenditure incurred after tonight (other than under a contract entered into by today). </PARA>
<PARA> The concession was unnecessary, discriminatory and inequitable. </PARA>
<PARA> The first revenue savings, estimated at $6m, will come in 1984-85. </PARA>
<PARA>Part-time Members of the Reserve Defence Forces</PARA>
<PARA> The present exemption from income tax of the pay and allowances of part-time members of the Reserve Defence Forces is to be phased out. Concurrently, there will be a review of those emoluments. </PARA>
<PARA> Payments on or after 1 December 1983 and before 1 December 1984 will be exempt only as to 50 per cent while those in respect of service on or after the latter date will be fully assessable. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be estimated savings to revenue of $5m in 1983-84 and $20m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Incentives to Invest in Australian Films</PARA>
<PARA> The extraordinarily generous taxation incentives for investment in Australian films have proved a boon for accountants, lawyers and their well-heeled clients.</PARA>
<PARA> In the process, control of Australian film making has moved out of the hands of the film makers and Film Commissions to the detriment of the industry as a whole . </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, assistance to the film industry is to be restructured. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to investment expenditure incurred under a contract entered into after tonight, the tax deduction now available at 150 per cent of the investment will be reduced to 133 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the amount of net revenue from a film that is exempt from income tax will be reduced from 50 per cent to 33 per cent of the investment in the film. </PARA>
<PARA> The resultant saving to revenue in 1983-84 is estimated at $1m, and $4m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> As an offset to that and indeed as a generous expansion of assistance, as I noted earlier, additional funds amounting to $5m are to be made available this year to the Australian film industry through the Australian Film Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>BUDGET OVERVIEW</PARA>
<PARA> Total Budget outlays in 1983-84 are estimated to increase by 15.8 per cent to $ 56 703m. </PARA>
<PARA> Total Budget receipts are estimated to increase by 8.6 per cent in 1983-84 to $ 48 342m. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget deficit is therefore estimated at $8 361m, an increase of $3 888m on the outcome for 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> Abstracting from the overseas component, the domestic Budget deficit is estimated to be $5 744m, an increase of $3 262m over last year. </PARA>
<PARA> We have therefore kept our commitment, developed in extensive consultants, to keep the Budget deficit to no more than $8.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that this outcome represents the right balance between the immediate need for a fiscal stimulus and the on-going requirement for fiscal responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> There can be no doubt that this Budget, with a deficit increasing to an estimated 4.7 per cent of GDP from 2.8 per cent last year, will prove to be highly expansionary. </PARA>
<PARA> That deficit, however, is well below that which we inherited after our predecessors' period of pork-barrelling. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises that recovery in the private sector is fundamental to the restoration of Australia's economic health. </PARA>
<PARA> We intend to assist that recuperation. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless the structural deficit were to be reduced, strong recovery in the private sector would ultimately bring on a clash for funds between the two sectors, and thus put at risk the durability of recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> Our revenue measures, including those announced in the May Statement, have therefore been designed with an eye to the contribution they will make to financing future budgets when the private sector is enjoying more vitality than at present. </PARA>
<PARA>MONETARY POLICY</PARA>
<PARA> The performance of the economy over 1983-84 and beyond will be heavily influenced by our economic policy approach. </PARA>
<PARA> The essential elements of that approach are by now well known: an expansionary fiscal policy, with the Prices and Incomes Accord as a major anti-inflation instrument, supported by non-inflationary monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The task of financing the 1983-84 Budget deficit responsibly will be considerable, coming as it does on top of a monetary situation which our predecessors had for some years allowed to drift. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fraser Government overshot its monetary projections for each of the five years since 1978-79-contrary to their rhetoric, there was no effective monetary restraint. </PARA>
<PARA> While in 1982-83 the overrun was small, monetary growth accelerated as the year progressed and as liquidity was boosted by the burgeoning budget deficit.</PARA>
<PARA> In the twelve months to June 1983, M3 increased by 12.5 per cent; preliminary estimates suggest that in the twelve months to July that figure has increased further, to around 13 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> It is central to the success of our overall policy approach that monetary conditions during 1983-84 be such as to promote an environment of sustainably lower inflation while allowing the expected pick-up in real activity to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA> Given that expected pick-up, there will be a sharp increase in nominal output through the course of 1983-84-probably of the order of 14 per cent or so. </PARA>
<PARA> Setting a monetary projection consistent with that growth requires allowance to be made for the expected change in the velocity of circulation of money-that is, the relationship between monetary growth and nominal GDP growth. </PARA>
<PARA> During the recent recession, as in past economic downturns, velocity fell sharply. </PARA>
<PARA> This meant, in effect, that the banks were accounting for a greater share of financing, at the expense of non-banks. </PARA>
<PARA> As the economy picks up, this development can be expected to be reversed, at least in part, and velocity can be expected to rebound. </PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore appropriate to set the M3 projection below the expected growth in nominal GDP. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the Government will contain the growth in financial aggregates to a degree consistent with M3 growth in the rate of 9 to 11 per cent over the twelve months to the June quarter 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> The June-quarter basis of measurement is an attempt to avoid, on the one hand, the excessive amount of irrelevant history contained in year-average measures such as were employed by the previous Government in 1982-83 and, on the other hand, the possibility of undue influence from random events involved in measurement to the single month of June. </PARA>
<PARA> The monetary projection will continue to be presented in terms of M3, the aggregate which focuses on transactions of the banking system. </PARA>
<PARA> For the reasons I have mentioned, however, policy cannot focus solely on M3 and in the year ahead we shall be monitoring the progress of a range of financial aggregates with coverage both narrower and broader than M3. </PARA>
<PARA> The projection is a conditional one. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be a review of the projection during the year in the light of trends in activity and other relevant developments. </PARA>
<PARA> Policy will aim at gradually moving the excessive present growth in M3 to within the recommended range. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with the monetary policy just proposed, and on the timetable previously foreshadowed, the Treasury is announcing this evening details of the next bond tender, for an amount of $1500m. </PARA>
<PARA>THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the economic outlook for 1983-84. </PARA>
<PARA> In doing so, I stress the very great uncertainties involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that, in several major respects, the Australian economy is today operating outside the domain of our post-war experience. </PARA>
<PARA> That said, there will clearly be very strong growth in total public spending during 1983-84, probably of the order of 4 1/2 per cent in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Private consumption expenditure should grow by around 1 1/2 per cent, a litle faster than in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> Until the upturn in the economy is more firmly established, however, there, will be little prospect of an improvement in business fixed investment; in 1983- 84, there may be a decline similar to that recorded in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> Reflecting measures already announced, the outlook for private dwelling investment is much brighter; with a very sharp rebound of the order of 20 per cent through the course of the year, real growth of around 3 per cent is projected for 1983-84 as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The sharp decumulation of non-farm stocks which occurred in 1982-83 is expected to slow in 1983-84, making a positive contribution to output growth; and farm stocks should rise with the projected strong increase in farm product. </PARA>
<PARA> Exports should show some improvement in 1983-84, as a result of improving world demand and increased productive capacity in some parts of the resource sector; as the year progresses, recovery in the rural sector should also make its contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> With improved competitiveness as a result of the depreciation of the Australian dollar over the course of 1982-83, and private business investment continuing to fall, imports seem set for another decline. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of those trade movements, the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments should narrow further this year. </PARA>
<PARA> In aggregate, real non-farm product could increase by 2 per cent or so for 1983 -84 as a whole, with significantly faster growth-of the order of 5 per cent-over the course of the year. </PARA>
<PARA> With real farm product recovering by around 20 per cent, total gross domestic product could grow by 3 per cent or so in 1983-84. </PARA>
<PARA> No one can be certain how much of this projected pick-up in activity will be reflected in the labour market in the year ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> The slump in employment in this recession has been unprecedented for the post- war period. </PARA>
<PARA> Employers may require firm evidence that improved profitability and demand are likely to be sustained before reversing the labour shedding that took place in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile, increased output may come mainly from unwinding shorter working week arrangements and increasing overtime working. </PARA>
<PARA> That notwithstanding, and partly reflecting the Government's specific employment-generating intiatives, employment should grow by around 1 1/2 per cent over the course of 1983-84. </PARA>
<PARA> However, employment is currently below its average level in 1982-83 and the average level of employment this year may therefore not be very different from last. </PARA>
<PARA> With growth in the working age population continuing, it will take time for the upward trend in unemployment to be reversed. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of a centralised wage system applying half-yearly indexation, an assumption of strictly limited sectional claims and a significant increase in hours worked, average weekly earnings could increase by 7 per cent in 1983-84.</PARA>
<PARA> The Consumer Price Index could rise by about 7 1/2 per cent in year-on-year terms, and rather less over the course of 1983-84. </PARA>
<PARA> Both estimates take account of the direct price effects of the introduction of Medicare, increases in State taxes and charges and the revenue measures announced tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> Those Budget measures effective immediately are estimated to contribute directly about 0.4 per cent to the CPI, with a smaller impact from the February 1984 adjustments. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the course of 1983-84 average weekly earnings should increase markedly in real terms, primarily reflecting the usual pattern under indexation in times of declining inflation, and the expected growth in hours worked. </PARA>
<PARA>THE WAY AHEAD</PARA>
<PARA> Employment has now grown by more than 47 000 from its trough early in April. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of the economic forecasts outlined earlier, the employment gain should exceed 130 000 by the end of this current financial year, with the rate of growth of jobs accelerating further ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a heartening start to the task set during the election campaign of creating 500 000 jobs over our first three years. </PARA>
<PARA> But the employment growth is even more welcome because it is expected to occur in a context of a clear decline in the inflation rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, provided that the Prices and Income Accord is adhered to, the resulting subdued growth in money incomes during calendar 1984 holds prospects that a declining inflation trend can be sustained. </PARA>
<PARA> Continued declines in inflation would transform Australia's economic outlook.</PARA>
<PARA> Lower inflation would mean lower interest rates, which in turn would help to create jobs in credit-sensitive areas like housing and business investment. </PARA>
<PARA> Lower inflation would assist the maintenance of our international competitiveness, thus preserving Australian jobs against the inroads of foreign competition and allowing new jobs to be created as domestic firms are enabled to exploit their opportunities to the full. </PARA>
<PARA> Continued lower inflation would lessen fears of a renewed outbreak of economic conflict that would represent a major obstacle to the successful implementation of our expansionary fiscal policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout my speech tonight I have indicated in tangible ways the Government's concern for the plight of the disadvantaged, whether they be people in poor health, victims of the recession, or those who are finding it difficult to purchase a home. </PARA>
<PARA> Assistance in all of these areas is expensive. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the necessary finance has come from the improved growth prospects that our economic policies of consensus with controlled expansion have fostered. </PARA>
<PARA> But costs still have to be met. </PARA>
<PARA> The increased taxes I have announced tonight are in a direct sense the means we have adopted to finance the improved treatment of many disadvantaged Australians . </PARA>
<PARA> We have sought to share the burden of extra taxation fairly through the community so that nobody, other than blatant tax avoiders, is expected to make major sacrifices. </PARA>
<PARA> For the most part the imposts amount to a few cents on beer, cigarettes, petrol and the like and a levy on income tax to replace private costs of providing medical care. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that Australians generally will regard this as a small price to pay for helping the very many in our midst who have been badly disadvantaged by the events of recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Budget we have provided a substantial macroeconomic stimulus within an acceptable balance of risks. </PARA>
<PARA> We have embarked on major direct employment-creating programs. </PARA>
<PARA> We have begun to improve the lot of those most in need. </PARA>
<PARA> We have kept tax increases to a minimum and attempted to spread rather than heighten the burden that taxation imposes. </PARA>
<PARA> In extraordinarily difficult cirumstances, the Government has tonight pursued its major commitments within the mandate given to us last March. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend this Budget to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>This Bill seeks appropriations of the Consolidated Revenue Fund in 1983-84 totalling $2,860,169,000. Of this amount, $998,737,000 was authorised by the Supply Act (No. 2) 1983-84; the balance of $1,861,432,000 would be authorised by this Bill. The Bill provides for proposed expenditure on the construction of public works and buildings, the acquisition of sites and buildings, certain advances and loans, items of plant and equipment which are clearly definable as capital expenditure and expenditure on new policy initiatives for which legislation has not previously been provided. Provision is also made for grants to the States under section 96 of the Constitution and for payments to the Northern Territory. An amount of $120,000,000 is included under the Advance to the Minister for Finance, the same as was provided in the Supply Act (No. 2) 1983-84 which this Bill, when enacted, will subsume. Details of the proposed expenditures are set out in Schedule 2 to the Bill and the main features were outlined in my Budget Speech. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

The Bill seeks appropriations of the Consolidated Revenue Fund in 1983-84 totalling $35,062,000 . Of this amount, $14,008,000 was authorised by the Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Act 1983-84, the balance of $21,054,000 being sought in this Bill. The then Government agreed in March 1982 to the provision of a separate Appropriation Bill for the Parliament which, consistent with the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on the Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing, is not a Bill for the ordinary annual services of the Government. It was part of the agreement that detailed executive scrutiny of and control over expenditure estimates for the Parliament were not necessary and that the Government would limit its involvement to approval of the overall levels for recurrent and capital expenditure for the parliamentary departments. This has been done and the amounts included in the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Bill is to make provision for the financing of the prospective 1983-84 Budget deficit. The Budget deficit in prospect for 1983-84 gives rise to a deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund of about the same magnitude and thus creates a need to seek authority to finance certain expenditures from borrowings to the extent that amounts appropriated by the Parliament for expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund will exceed moneys legally available to that Fund. Legally, expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund cannot exceed the moneys available to that Fund. Thus, successive governments have, for many years, introduced legislation in the form of a loan Bill to authorise payments from the Loan Fund to meet defence and certain non- defence expenditures. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Budget Speech the Treasurer (Mr Keating) announced that the prospective Budget deficit for this financial year is estimated to be some $8.4 billion. The shortfall in the Consolidated Revenue Fund is estimated to be of the same order. Under existing standing authorities some $2 billion of expenditure can be charged to Loan Fund. This leaves a shortfall of some $6.4 billion for which separate funding authority is required. This Bill therefore seeks authority to borrow moneys for defence and other purposes to enable certain other expenditures to be met from the Loan Fund rather than from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. I should make it clear, however, that the Bill does not authorise defence or other expenditures additional to those otherwise authorised by parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill does not include any specific limit on the amount of borrowings that may be undertaken. The actual limit, in the case of defence expenditure, however , is the amount for which appropriation is sought for defence purposes in the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1983-84-some $5 billion-and any subsequent moneys for defence purposes that may be approved in subsequent Appropriation Acts. The effective limit is likely to be significantly less than these amounts as defence expenditures cannot be charged to Loan Fund until the legislation I am introducing is enacted. The legal limit for borrowing for non-defence purposes is determined by the level of borrowing authority approved by the Loan Council. Together, it is estimated that these limits will be sufficient to enable the financing of the Budget deficit. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>Some three months ago the Minister for Finance (Mr Dawkins) introduced into this House a Bill by this title. The major purpose of that Bill was to give effect to this Government's election undertaking to recover personal tax avoided by former owners of companies that were the subject of bottom of the harbour schemes. In addition, the Bill was designed to strengthen and improve in several identified areas the legislation passed by the Parliament last year to recoup the company tax that was evaded by the use of these schemes. Honourable members will recall that the Bill, after amendment, was passed by the House but defeated in another place. As foreshadowed by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in his Budget Speech earlier tonight the Government is now submitting to the Parliament, as an important part of the Budget, a Bill that covers esentially the same ground as the earlier one but which has been changed in significant respects. The principal change concerns the measure of personal tax to be recovered. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the earlier Bill, former owners of a stripped company were to be made liable for personal tax on the total after tax accumulated profits effectively received by them as part of the price received for the sale of their shares. The Government has now decided that the recovery of personal tax should be confined to such tax avoided in respect of the liberated after tax profits of those years of income where evasion of primary company tax was involved. In short, the personal tax measures will apply to current year profits. This limitation will mean that personal tax avoided in respect of profits of earlier years that had borne primary company tax will not be within the scope of the legislation as now proposed. Similarly personal tax is not to be recouped in respect of any capital profits of the stripped company, regardless of the year of income in which such profits were derived. Another significant aspect of the proposed limitation is that a liability for avoided personal tax will not arise in respect of any year of income where the only company tax evaded for that year was undistributed profits tax under Division 7 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. I mention also that the time to pay, free of interest, facility inserted in the earlier Bill by amendment in this House has been retained in the present Bill. The Government believes that, with these changes, the legislation is now in a form which responds adequately to the points made in the debate on the earlier Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, subject to one exception, the present Bill proposes to strengthen and improve the company tax recoupment measures in the same areas as were proposed in the earlier Bill passed by this House. The exception concerns the proposal under the earlier Bill to simplify the procedures that require copies of notices of company assessments be served on a range of former owners. The passage of time has reduced the administrative advantages which that proposal was designed to provide and has obviated the need for the amendments. The Government has therefore decided not to proceed with these. </PARA>
<PARA> For reasons connected with the grounds of a recent constitutional challenge in the High Court of Australia to the validity of the recoupment tax legislation, and about which I will have something to say later, this Bill now proposes a variation to earlier amendments to an evidentiary provision of the recoupment tax legislation. I turn now to the details of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Measures to Recover Personal Tax</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> By far the greater part of this Bill is related to amendments to give effect to our decision that the restitution expected of those persons who benefited form the sale of shares in companies that were stripped of pre-tax profits should not be limited to the tax that ought to have been paid by the companies concerned. Rather, those persons should also pay the tax that, as shareholders or other former owners, they escaped through receipt in a non-taxable capital form of after-tax profits that, if the companies had continued to operate as going concerns, would have been taxable as dividends in their hands. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, the recovery of personal tax will, however, be confined to the tax related to after-tax revenue profits of the stripped company for those years of income in respect of which primary company was evaded. In our view it is quite beyond argument that the revenue is just as entitled to have these tax losses made good as it is to have the lost company tax made good. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will accordingly insert in the recoupment tax law rules to be applied to fix the liability of former owners of a stripped company for personal income tax on those profits on which primary company tax was evaded. Broadly, these rules will require a former owner of a stripped company to pay income tax on the basis that the company had paid a dividend to the former owner at the time of sale of the shares. The amount of this imputed dividend will be the same proportion of the company's after-tax taxable income for the year of income in respect of which primary company tax was evaded as the proportion of the sale consideration received by that owner. The amount of after-tax taxable income will be determined after allowance has been made for the unpaid ordinary company tax that is to be recouped under the existing legislation, as proposed to be amended. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that a dividend will be deemed to have been paid in circumstances where the former owner of a company is liable to make good unpaid company tax on the company's taxable income, that is, where there is a liability for vendors recoupment tax in relation to ordinary company tax or there would have been such a liability if any payments of such tax made after 25 July 1982 were disregarded. That date is, of course, the date on which the former Government announced its intention to legislate to recover unpaid company tax escaped through bottom of the harbour schemes. This qualification is necessary to ensure that the liability for escaped personal income tax will not be avoided simply by making a payment of the company tax in pursuance of the former Government's announcement or of the legislation enacted last year. </PARA>
<PARA> The requirement that there exists or, but for payments of company tax, would exist a liability for vendors recoupment tax means that, where the liability for that tax is or would be less than $100 and the Commissioner of Taxation exercises his power under the existing law not to pursue the liability, there will be no liability for the relatively small amounts of personal income tax that would otherwise be liable to be recouped. Where the former owner concerned is a natural person the imputed dividend is to be included in his or her assessable income. In the case of an entity not itself subject to income tax on the dividend by reason of its tax exempt status or, in certain cases, the intercompany dividend rebate, the imputed amount will of course be treated as tax free income in the hands of that entity. </PARA>
<PARA> Where a company, or a person as trustee of a trust, is allocated a dividend that is deemed to have been paid by a stripped company and the owners of that company, or the beneficiaries of that trust, are the same persons as the former owners of the stripped company at the date of its sale, the company or trustee will, in the first instance, be liable to pay dividend recoupment tax on the dividend at the maximum personal rate applicable to the year of income in which the sale of shares occurred. However, there is to be a right for former owners in this situation to elect to be taxed on amounts equal in total to the amount of the dividend deemed to have been received by the company or trust concerned. If this election is made, and the Commissioner is satisfied that the allocation of the deemed dividend among former owners is reasonable and that personal tax, if any, payable by the former owners will, subject to the hardship relief provisions of the income tax law, be paid by them, the interposed company or trust will be freed from its liability for dividend recoupment tax. In a similar fashion a stripped company will, where a liability for personal tax or dividend recoupment tax exists, be freed from its liability for the income year concerned for undistributed profits tax payable under Division 7, and the former owners will accordingly no longer be liable for vendors recoupment tax on an unpaid Division 7 liability for that year. As already mentioned, a liability for personal tax or dividend recoupment tax will not exist in relation to the profits of a particular year of income where the only unpaid company tax for that year giving rise to a liability for vendors recoupment tax is a liability for undistributed profits tax under Divison 7 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA> As with the existing recoupment tax law, it will be possible under the provisions being inserted by this Bill to trace from the primary level to the next level and, as necessary successively to further levels where a company or trust has ceased to exist, has different shareholders or beneficiaries as a result of shares or beneficial interests having been sold, or is unlikely to be able to meet a liability for dividend recoupment tax on the dividend which is deemed to have been paid to it. The automatic tracing process applicable in this case will continue until a dividend is deemed to have been paid to a natural person, or tax free entity referred to earlier, or to a company or trust that still exists if, in the latter situations, the company or trust is one the ownership of which has not changed since the stripped company was sold and has the capacity to meet the dividend recoupment tax payable. </PARA>
<PARA> A significant feature of the Bill is the provision of a time to pay facility in relation to the personal income tax and dividend recoupment tax liabilities which are to be imposed by this and an associated Bill. This provision is modelled on an existing facility-which is to be retained in a modified form- which permits former owners of companies who are liable to pay a share of unpaid company tax to meet that liability by instalments, typically over 12 months without late payment penalty being charged. </PARA>
<PARA> In the earlier Bill as first introduced, the Government proposed that the existing facility be abolished from a date to be proclaimed. On review, we accepted and still accept that the particular facility for time to pay should be retained. Additionally, the present Bill also provides for dividend recoupment tax and related personal tax to be paid over 12 months without attracting additional tax for late payment. The modification of the existing facility I referred to a moment ago is to impost a strict limitation to 12 months as the period for which an arrangement to pay unpaid company tax may be made. Similarly , the proposed facility in relation to personal tax and dividend recoupment tax will require full payment to be made within a period of 12 months if the penalty free concession is to be attracted. An application for time to pay personal income tax or dividend recoupment tax in respect of a share of a stripped company's profits will need to be made within 30 days after service of the notice of assessment relating to that liability. </PARA>
<PARA>Post-sale avoidance schemes</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The recoupment tax legislation contains a let-out provision that operates where the stripped company was the subject of an unsuccessful post-sale scheme to avoid tax. Under this escape clause there is no liability to recoupment tax liability on the people who benefited by non-payment of the company tax. This provision was inserted by the former Government for reasons which are best known to it. In our view it defies logic and it is our announced policy to abolish it. This is to be done by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Pre-sale avoidance scheme</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Consistentily with the removal of the post-sale avoidance scheme provision, this Bill will also ensure that, in ascertaining the potential tax liability of a company for the purpose of determining whether the recoupment tax legislation applies in relation to it, any pre-sale scheme which is ulitmately established to be ineffective of its tax avoidance purpose is to be disregarded. There are several further amendments contained in the Bill designed to improve the administration of the legislation or to correct technical deficiencies. The Bill proposes to remove one of the pre-conditions to liability for recoupment tax-the requirement that the company was by a stripping scheme rendered unable to pay its tax-which was inserted by the previous Government, it seems for presentational purposes. The element that the requirement expresses is, in substance, present in all cases of pre-tax profit stripping to which the legislation applies and a specific reference to it is quite unnecessary. The ' stripping scheme test', and an associated provision requiring full disclosure by the Commissioner of known details of it, is being exploited by some taxpayers as a means of delaying issue of recoupment tax assessments. Because of their availability as a pure delaying tactic, the provisions are having and will continue to have, unless removed, an adverse effect on revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also proposed by this Bill to re-insert in the recoupment tax legislation a provision removed by the previous Government which authorised the Commissioner of Taxation to report to this Parliament the names of persons who fail to meet their liability for vendors or promoters recoupment tax. The Commissioner is already required to provide in his annual report to Parliament details of breaches or evasions of the taxation laws and it is consistent with that duty that he be authorised, where he considers it appropriate, to report details of failure to pay recoupment tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I explain an amendment I touched on earlier. An existing provision of the recoupment tax legislation that reflects the settled policy of the tax law in these matters seeks to ensure that persons liable for recoupment tax can contest the correctness of the underlying company assessment only through the established objection and appeal procedures against the company assessment itself. For this purpose it provides that a certificate specifying the amount of a company's liability to company tax is to be conclusive evidence except in an appeal concerning the assessment of the company. Some technical deficiencies in the provision were to be corrected by the Bill that was defeated earlier in the year and the Government has, with an eye to a particular constitutional question , now decided to make some other amendments as well. Honourable members will know that the recoupment tax legislation has been under constitutional challenge on a number of grounds. One of them concerns the evidentiary provision and reflects a legal argument that the Commonwealth cannot validly levy a tax that is uncontestable. It is said that there are circumstances where a certificate that is conclusive evidence would render the tax uncontestable. Obviously it cannot be predicted what decision the High Court will reach on the particular point but the Government has concluded that it should solve the difficulty by legislating so that the certificate represents only prima facie evidence, with the result that the matters that are the subject of it will therefore clearly not be uncontestable. In providing to that effect, the Bill also proposes that such a certificate would, in appropriate circumstances, represent conclusive evidence if a provision in the Bill that re-instates its conclusive nature were to be proclaimed. A decision on whether to make the proclamation, and thus have the provision revert to the conclusive evidence form that is reflective of settled policy, will be made in the light of any High Court decision on the underlying constitutional point. </PARA>
<PARA> The revenue implications of these amendments in the context of the Budget are significant. The measures contained in the Bill are estimated to yield $270m in total and $60m in 1983-84. They should be given the approval of the Parliament. As usual with amendments of the taxation laws, an explanatory memorandum giving details of the amendments contained in the Bill is being circulated to honourable members. It will be clear that while the Government stands by the principles of the Bill as originally introduced, it has nevertheless been prepared to modify its stance to meet all reasonable criticisms of the original measures. In that light, I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill, like the one I have just introduced, is a revision of an earlier Bill . That Bill too was passed by this House, but rejected in another place. Like the earlier Bill, this Bill will formally impose a tax-to be called dividend recoupment tax-on the dividend amount determined in accordance with the rules being inserted in the recoupment tax legislation by the amending assessment Bill . The underlying purpose of the amendments is to recover personal income tax escaped by individual former owners of stripped companies. That will be done in a direct manner wherever possible. However, in cases where former owners held their shares through interposed companies or trusts, recovery may in certain circumstances be by way of imposing on one or more of the interposed companies or trusts a tax equivalent to the maximum personal rate of tax applying in the year of income in which the shares in the stripped company were sold. This Bill will impose that tax. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Budget measure will alter the sales tax classification of certain goods, principally to correct a number of anomalies and inconsistencies. The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act which this Bill amends not only classifies particular goods as exempt from sales tax, but also places other goods in one or other of the tax rate categories. Goods not covered by the Act are taxable at 20 per cent. In all, there are 26 changes. Before the election, we undertook to review the rate structure and classification of goods under the sales tax law and this Bill is a step in that direction. In making the changes we have given attention to representations that have been made to the Government by honourable members and other interested people. Some alterations are designed to remove competitive anomalies; that is, those which give some products a competitive advantage over other products. Other changes are designed to achieve uniformity in classification of various types of goods or to remove weaknesses or correct deficiencies which are proving costly to the revenue. Others are designed to refine aspects of measures in the 1981-82 Budget which have thrown up administrative difficulties for taxpayers or have not fully achieved their desired purpose. In doing all this we have necessarily had to keep an eye on revenue consequences. Accordingly, a number of the amendments will bring into the taxable field goods which are exempt, while others will move goods into a higher tax bracket. However, it is not in any sense a one-way street, and in some instances anomalies and inconsistencies are being removed by exempting goods that are at present taxable or by moving goods into a lower tax category. </PARA>
<PARA> Speaking in more detail, several important changes have been made to the exemptions available to the agricultural industry. Our basic aim is not to curtail the industry's sales tax exemptions, but specifically to confine these exemptions to goods that are for use in that industry. At present, certain specified units of agricultural machinery, implements and apparatus are exempt from sales tax whether or not the goods are for use in the agricultural industry . This was not the intention underlying the particular item and we propose to correct the situation by restricting the exemption for the particular goods so that it applies only when the goods are for use in the agricultural industry. I emphasise again that restricting the exemption item in this way does not mean that there is to be any narrowing of the exemptions available on agricultural machinery, implements and apparatus for use by persons in the agricultural industry. In consequence of the changes that are being made, agricultural machinery, implements and apparatus not for use in the agricultural industry will now attract tax at the 20 per cent rate, but goods which are hand tools to which the 7.5 per cent rate generally applies will attract only that rate. </PARA>
<PARA> A further alteration will affect equipment, preparations and materials for the checking or eradication of disease or pests. The intention underlying the particular item is to exempt spraying equipment and materials used in the agricultural industry in controlling insect pests and other diseases. Due to deficiencies in the law, certain insecticides used, for instance, in and around the home to control insect pests, have gained exemption. Other domestic insecticides are taxable at 20 per cent. We proposed to correct this situation by restricting exemption under the item to relevant equipment and materials only when for use in the agricultural industry. As a result, insecticides, fungicides and herbicides used for domestic purposes will now attract tax at 20 per cent. Once again, I stress that there is to be no narrowing of the exemption available for equipment, preparations and materials for use in the agricultural industry for the checking or eradication of disease or pests. </PARA>
<PARA> Before leaving the agricultural area, I mention a change that involves the exemption for tractors. In order to overcome problems that have arisen in recent years with this exemption, it is now to be varied. Exemption will continue for tractors for use in the agricultural industry, tractors for use in the timber- getting industry in the hauling of log timber and tractors for use as aids to manufacture. However, exemption will no longer apply to tractors used in other circumstances unless overriding exemption provisions of the law, such as those which exempt goods for use by government departments, apply. Tractors for use in building and construction industries, including construction of roads, dams and other works will qualify for the rate of 7.5 per cent that applies generally to construction equipment. A major effect of the decision to withdraw the general exemption for tractors will be to tax at 20 per cent certain models of ride-on mowers for lawn and grass mowing. Although designed for use principally as mowers, these goods have the general appearance and features of a small conventional tractor. They have been marketed for use as general purpose tractors in order to gain sales tax exemption, but will now attract tax at 20 per cent in line with other mowers. </PARA>
<PARA> I move now to some of the other changes to sales tax classifications that will result in increases in revenue. The first of these relates to the exemption from sales tax available for piping, tubing, channelling and guttering. The intention underlying the particular item was to exempt these goods only when they are for use for irrigation, water supply, drainage or sewerage purposes. Due to deficiencies in the law, however, the item does not limit exemption in this way and we propose now to restrict exemption to equipment for use for those purposes . It is proposed to tax at the 20 per cent rate liners and component parts for swimming pools and to tax goods designed to form part of swimming pools, incuding swiming pool filters installed as fixtures, at 20 per cent. An anomaly exists at present as a result of which the smaller above-ground pools are taxable at 20 per cent, as are the component parts for them and portable filters , but other pools are exempt. We propose to remove this anomaly by making liners , component parts and filters installed as fixtures in respect of all swimming pools subject to tax at 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred earlier to proposals designed to refine further the measures taken to correct certain anomalies in the 1981-82 Budget which have given rise to administrative difficulties for taxpayers or have not fully achieved their desired purpose. With this in mind, we propose to tax all oils, greases and lubricants at 20 per cent. The particular item was amended in the 1981-82 Budget to exclude from exemption oils and greases for use as lubricants of road vehicles. Exemption continued for some oils and greases but was conditional on their being for use for business or industrial purposes as lubricants of machinery, implements and apparatus other than road vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA> Oil companies and distributors have complained about the additional paperwork in obtaining certificates from people in business who seek exemption. Likewise, purchasers have complained about the need to do this. In some instances purchasers have complained that some distributors are not prepared to allow exemption. Other problems arise where lubricants are purchased by persons or businesses which operate both road vehicles and other machinery for business purposes, as in the agricultural, mining and construction industries. The administration of the exemption is difficult for all parties where a particular lubricant is for use both in road vehicles and in other equipment in exempt circumstances. Accordingly, all oils, greases and lubricants will now attract tax at 20 per cent. As announced earlier tonight, the levy on matches is to be switched from an excise to sales tax. The Bill includes the necessary sales tax measures. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I have commented on the more important alterations to sales tax classifications that will result in increases in revenue. There are others, such as the proposal to increase the rate of tax on blank video tapes and blank recording tapes and on most recorded video tapes to 32.5 per cent, but I think that I need not go into all of them in this introductory speech. They are fully explained in the explanatory memorandum that is being circulated to honourable members and I think that what I have said sufficiently illustrates the kinds of adjustments of this nature that are to be effected by the Bill. Still other alterations will result in the withdrawal of minor exemptions and the restriction of certain exemptions to restore them to their originally intended scope. </PARA>
<PARA> I indicated earlier that a number of measures in the Bill will reduce sales tax revenue, and they are also covered in the explanatory memorandum and have been listed in Budget Papers. There are three particular reductions in sales tax that I would like to make some comment about at this stage. The first of them was announced recently by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and involves exemption from sales tax of certain tourist vessels. In the 1981-82 Budget, certain ships and other vessels for use exclusively or principally for purposes of pleasure, sport or recreation by the owner or by other persons, whether or not for reward, became taxable at 20 per cent. Prior to 1981, vessels let out on hire on a 'bare boat' basis for pleasure, sport or recreational purposes were taxed at 20 per cent, the hirers being regarded as using the vessel for such purposes. However, pleasure craft that took paying passengers on pleasure, sport or recreational outings and vessels hired out with a crew were exempt from sales tax. Vessels used as ferries for scheduled public passenger and freight transport services were exempt prior to the 1981-82 Budget and have remained exempt. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the 1981 amendment, it has been represented that tourist vessels should not be taxable in a situation where buses, trains and planes used to transport tourists are exempt. The boat building industry has also complained of a significant reduction in orders. The Government has recognised the problems in this area and we propose to exempt from sales tax certain types of tourist vessels which are used essentially for transporting paying passengers on regular and scheduled tours. Accordingly, the types of tourist vessels to be exempted are those vessels which are licensed to carry at least 12 adult passengers, are to be used by their owner principally in the course of a business carried on by the owner and are to be used principally for the purpose of transporting paying passengers on regular and scheduled sight seeing tours. The exemption will extend to vessels which are not owned but which are held under a long term lease or under a hire purchase agreement and are used in the requisite circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Exemption is not to extend to vessels to be used to take tourists on unscheduled scuba diving expeditions, game fishing outings or other general recreational trips. Nor is exemption to extend to vessels that are to be chartered or otherwise hired out, whether for purposes of pleasure, sport or recreation or for other purposes such as business promotions, functions and conferences where the transport of paying passengers is not involved and no regular, scheduled tour occurs. The Government has decided to backdate the exemption to 19 August 1981 so as not to disadvantage those who have purchased the particular vessels since that date. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided to exempt Videotex equipment, Teletext decoding equipment and similar equipment for use by the profoundly deaf in adapting a television receiver. Videotex equipment enables the spoken word and information to be reproduced in visual form on screens of television receivers or monitors designed for use with such equipment, without the need for sound. The benefit of such equipment to the deaf is obvious and I am sure members of the community will welcome the Government's decision in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also proposes to reduce the rate of tax on a range of household goods. Household goods in general, including glassware, crockery, sewing and knitting machines and furniture are already taxable at 7.5 per cent. However, because of alternative taxing provisions or the manner in which the particular provision relating to household goods has been framed, certain goods which are clearly household goods have not attracted the 7.5 per cent rate. </PARA>
<PARA> With this in mind, the Government has decided to reduce the rate of tax on cut glassware from 20 per cent to 7.5 per cent, the same rate as for other household glassware; to reduce the rate of tax on articles of a material other than glass, but used for similar purposes to glassware, from 20 per cent to 7.5 per cent, the same rate as for household glassware and crockery; to reduce the rate of tax on household spinning wheels and weaving looms from 20 per cent to 7.5 per cent, the same rate as for household sewing and knitting machines; and to reduce the rate of tax on jardinieres and vases from 32.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent. The net result of all the changes will be an increase in revenue estimated at $44m in a full year and $29m in 1983-84. I mention that these figures would have been $58m and $45m respectively if we had not provided the reductions in sales tax that we have. It is customary for sales tax changes to come into operation on the day following the introduction of the amending Bill and the Bill therefore provides that the amendments are to be effective on and after tomorrow, 24 August 1983. There is the exception that the amendment to exempt certain tourist vessels, which the Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism (Mr John Brown) is so pleased about, will be backdated to 9 August 1981 and some changes arising out of the closer economic relations agreement with New Zealand will have effect after the amending Bill becomes law. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will modify from 1 October 1983 the terms on which an income tax rebate is available to home buyers during the first five years of occupation of a sole or principal residence in Australia. The change was announced in the 19 May economic statement, as part of an overall package of housing measures. In particular, it was announced then that there would be a new cash subsidy scheme which would provide assistance to first home buyers, on an income tested basis, from 1 October 1983. The schemes of assistance for home buyers introduced by the previous Government had been neither efficient nor effective in targeting assistance to those in most need and in providing a stimulus to the housing industry. One of those schemes, which provided a tax rebate on the portion of interest payments that exceeded 10 per cent per annum on loans of up to $60,000, was terminated with effect from 1 July 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> The other tax rebate scheme, which applies only to first home buyers, is to be modified by this Bill so that, subject to a transitional measure, there will be no new entrants to the scheme after 30 September 1983. After that date prospective first home buyers will come within the new first home owners assistance scheme, which will have the effect of making home ownership an attainable goal of many more Australian families. Home buyers who first occupy their sole or principal residence by 30 September 1983 will remain entitled to a tax rebate on home loan interest payments during the first five years of ownership, subject to an income test. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the income test, benefits will be available in full to taxpayers whose family income in the 1982-83 income year does not exceed $24,300. Where a taxpayer's family income in that year exceeds $24,300 the rebate will be shaded out progressively, finally cutting out at $27,900. In applying the income test, family income will be taken to be the combined taxable income of the taxpayer and, where relevant, of the person who is the taxpayer's spouse on 1 October 1983. For the 1983-84 income year, of course, only the rebate entitlement for the period after 30 September 1983 will be income tested. </PARA>
<PARA> Although, as a general rule, there will be no new entrants to the rebate scheme after 30 September 1983, taxpayers who contract to acquire or build or commence to build by that date will be brought within the scheme even though they occupy the home after 30 September. This transitional measure to extend entry into the scheme will protect those first home buyers who will not be eligible for assistance under the proposed first home owners assistance scheme that I referred to earlier. Without this extension of the rebate some lower income first home buyers would not be entitled to the benefits of either scheme. In applying the income test in these cases, family income will be the combined taxable income of the taxpayer and, where relevant, of the person who is the taxpayer's spouse when the home is first occupied. A memorandum explaining the technical features of the Bill is being made available to honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>Excise Tariff Proposals No. 3 and Customs Tariff Proposals No. 10 which I have just tabled introduce certain tariff changes foreshadowed by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in his Budget Speech this evening. The Proposals increase the duties of Excise and Customs on beer, spirits, manufactured tobacco products and refined petroleum products. The increases operate from eight o'clock this evening. The Excise Tariff Proposals also remove duties of Excise on amylic alcohol and fusel oil, playing cards, cigarette tubes, paper and papers and matches. Corresponding amendments are included in the Customs Tariff Proposals to remove the relevant Excise components from the Customs Tariff rates. In addition the Government has accepted the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission to simplify the structure of the Excise Tariff on tobacco products which were contained in its report of October 1982 on the tobacco industry and the Excise Tariff Proposals No. 3 reflect this decision. A summary of the alterations contained in the Proposals is being circulated to honourable members. I commend the Proposals to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-In the Budget Speech, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) announced the Government's intention to re-introduce a means test that takes account of both income and assets for assessing entitlement for pension. This will replace the current test which only takes account of income, including income from assets. It will apply to social security pensions including age, invalid and widows pensions, sheltered employment and rehabilitation allowances, and supporting parents benefits and repatriation service pensions. The test will follow in broad terms that which applied prior to November 1976. The final details of how the new test will work in practice will be settled after the Government has consulted with pensioner organisations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The existing arrangements are intended to concentrate assistance on those more in need, but this has not been achieved. A particular problem is the prevalence of contrived arrangements designed to exploit the pension income test by people who in fact are well able to support themselves. There has been increasing circumvention of the test by such mechanisms as converting income to capital gains. The growth in these income test avoidance schemes in recent years has been such that they now jeopardise the Government's ability to direct scarce funds to the pressing welfare needs of the disadvantaged in our society. </PARA>
<PARA> Attempts by the previous Government to devise legislation addressing these loopholes failed. After considering similar options the Government has decided that nothing short of re-imposition of an assets component will redress this serious drain on the welfare purse. In designing the new assets test, particular attention will be given to protecting the position of the great majority of pensioners who have only small assets, and those who are not attempting to circumvent existing rules. In addition, the new test will be structured to ensure that there is no undue disruption of or intrusion into pensioners' affairs. Accordingly, specific types of assets that we envisage would be exempt include: The pensioner's home or principal residence; a car for personal use; personal effects including furniture, household effects, and a caravan, a boat, jewellery, and the like; and other assets to the value of $1,500 for a single pensioner and $2,500 for a pensioner couple. After the exemption of assets of this type, the test would operate by taking a uniform 10 per cent of the value of other assets into account and deeming that amount to be income for pension assessment purposes. This will then be added to non-assets income, such as earnings, to arrive at a total figure of means. Pensioners' means will then determine pension entitlement in the same way that income determines it at present. </PARA>
<PARA> Although these arrangements will be broadly the same as those which existed in 1976, employing a notional return rate of 10 per cent is relatively more generous than was the case in 1976 when prevailing interest rates were generally lower. The great bulk of pensioners will, as at present, fall below the pension free areas, so that they will continue to receive the full rate of pension. Some could be moderately better off than under current arrangements. For example, a single pensioner without other income could have up to $17,100 in a savings account and still receive the maximum rate of pension. A married pensioner couple could jointly hold $28,500 without reduction in pension. As a result, pensioners with a modest level of assets, or who have not been avoiding the income test would not be affected to any significant degree. But those with substantial assets who have been circumventing the income test to obtain or increase their pension entitlement will experience a reduction in that entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA> We intend that the new arrangements will include provisions which will ensure that the test is not circumvented by pensioners depriving themselves of assets. An effect of these provisions will be to take into account assets which have been gifted or otherwise disposed of without receiving adequate financial consideration in return. From tonight, a person who disposes of assets in this way will be deemed to continue to have that property for the purpose of determining entitlement to pension or fringe benefits. The treatment of modest gifts or allowances made by pensioners to their families will be a matter for discussion with pensioner organisations. We expect that the new arrangements will be in place about 12 months after the passage of the necessary amending legislation. This allows for the major changes to administrative systems and arrangements that will be required. </PARA>
<PARA> I would emphasise that this change is part of the Government's ongoing examination and rationalisation of the retirement income system. It will further reduce the attraction of lump sum superannuation payments and thereby encourage take-up of superannuation pensions or annuities to secure a regular retirement income. It is therefore consistent with the Government's recent measures in relation to lump sum superannuation, although it does not in any way lessen the need for these measures which are also designed to promote greater equity in taxation arrangements. Nor will an assets test interfere with further reforms and modifications to superannuation arrangements or preclude the examination of the feasibility of a national superannuation scheme that is to be undertaken.

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>When introducing the Migration Amendment Bill 1983 in this House on 26 May 1983, I foreshadowed a review of legislation within my portfolio to ensure that so far as possible, Acts provide for the equal treatment of all non-citizens. As a consequence of the amendments contained in the Migration Amendment Bill 1983, it is necessary to amend a number of other Acts, in particular where the terms ' immigrant' and 'prohibited immigrant' are employed within the meaning of the Migration Act 1958. Also, it is appropriate in my view to take this opportunity to amend other legislation within my portfolio so as to be consistent with the proposed terminology in the Migration Act 1958. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn briefly to the details of the Bill. Part II of the Bill effects amendments to section 25 of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 which are consequential to the removal of references to 'prohibited immigrant' from the Migration Act 1958. Clause 4 inserts a new sub-section 25 (7) to provide that a person who entered Australia before the commencement of the Migration Amendment Act 1983 and who at the time of entry, was a prohibited immigrant or the holder of a temporary entry permit, shall not become an Australian citizen under the section. The clause also inserts a new sub-section 25 (7A) to provide that a person who enters Australia after the commencement of the Migration Amendment Act 1983 and who, at the time of entry, is a prohibited non-citizen or the holder of a temporary entry permit, shall not become an Australian citizen under the section. </PARA>
<PARA> Part III effects a consequential amendment to the Civil Aviation (Offenders on International Aircraft) Act 1970. Part IV effects a consequential amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. Part V amends the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act 1946 so as to be consistent with the amendments contained in the Migration Amendment Bill 1983. Part VI effects consequential amendments to the Navigation Act 1912. Part VII effects a consequential amendment to the Navigation Amendment Act 1980. Part VIII effects consequential amendments to the Overseas Students Charge Act 1979. Clause 27 provides that a person shall be taken not to be an overseas student if the person ceases to be an immigrant within the meaning of the Migration Act 1958 as in force immediately before the commencement of the Migration Amendment Act 1983. Part IX effects consequential amendments to the Quarantine Act 1908. Part X effects a consequential amendment to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I desire to take the first opportunity available to any Tasmanian member of the Federal Parliament to register on behalf of my colleagues in the Liberal Party representing our State in the Senate and the House of Representatives the strongest possible protest at the disgraceful treatment of Tasmania by the Hawke socialist Government in the incredible Budget which has been brought down this evening. It is a matter of public record that prior to the Federal election on 5 March this year the then Leader of the Opposition, now Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), made a clear commitment to the people of Tasmania that if the Gordon below Franklin power development scheme was brought to a halt his Government would guarantee that Tasmania would be compensated for the cost of the generation of electricity over and above the cost which would have been incurred by hydro development. Secondly, he guaranteed that no person would lose his job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the House that prior to the election the former Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. Malcolm Fraser, on behalf of the then Federal Government, made an offer to Tasmania of the sum of $500m as compensation for our State. Mr Hawke won the election. In my humble opinion he won it on promises which he well knew at that time could not be honoured. As we have found out tonight in the Budget, those promises have been blatantly dishonoured. Let me refer to just two of them. There was a clear commitment by the leader of the socialists in Australia, the Prime Minister, that there would be immediate tax cuts for 96 per cent of the Australian work force-a promise which has been dishonoured. There was a second promise that 500,000 extra jobs would be created for Australians-a promise which again has been dishonoured. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to Tasmania. The Hawke socialist Government brought an action against the smallest State of the Commonwealth in the highest court of the land. It brought an action against Tasmania and, in the ultimate, it succeeded. As soon as that action had been concluded the Prime Minister said: 'Don't worry, we will compensate you'. First he sent Senator Walsh to negotiate with the people of Tasmania on behalf of the Hawke Government. The behaviour of Senator Walsh was such that I could not comment upon it without breaching Standing Orders. It came as no surprise to anybody that Senator Walsh was sacked. The next thing we heard the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Lionel Bowen) was to be the negotiator, and the Deputy Prime Minister is, indeed, an honourable man. But what has happened is that at every possible opportunity in negotiations with Tasmania the Hawke socialist Government has reneged and tried to wriggle out and dishonour its commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, let me quickly give some examples. First and foremost, the southern outlet was approved as an alternative works program for the men and equipment employed on the Gordon below Franklin scheme. Having agreed to that, the Hawke Government then reneged. Crotty Road was approved as an alternative works program. Having approved that program, the Hawke Government then reneged. As of yesterday the highest amount that this magnanimous socialist Government had offered the people of Tasmania was a miserable, paltry $5m. What do we find in the Budget tonight? We find compensation for Tasmania of $30m. Shame on the Government! On a clear mathematical calculation of what is involved the Premier of Tasmania has estimated-I support him-that the proper compensation the Government should pay for what it has done to our State is $3,500m, that being the difference in cost for 60 years between hydro generated power and the thermal or nuclear power generation which the Government is now going to force on our State. </PARA>
<PARA> What has the Government done in relation to freight equalisation? Last year the Fraser Government budgeted $32m for freight equalisation, and $27,252,000 was spent. What has this great, generous Hawke Government, which is committed to more employment, done? It has cut the guts out of Tasmania. It has cut expenditure on freight equalisation to $23m. It will send industries into bankruptcy. It will put thousands out of work. This is the Government which has already put an additional 3,000 Tasmanians out of work. </PARA>
<PARA> In 17 year in politics, both State and Federal, I have never found a government which, so soon after its election to power, has broken so many promises. It ought to be in the Guiness Book of Records. The Prime Minister has broken more promises in seven weeks than Malcolm Fraser broke in seven years. This Government and its treatment of Tasmania are to be condemned. It should not think that because it will not win a seat in Tasmania for two decades other States will not take notice of the way it behaves. This Government's performance is disgraceful. Its behaviour is scandalous. It stands condemned in the eyes of all decent and fair-minded Australians. Honourable members opposite should be ashamed of themselves. Tasmania will never forget them for what they have done to the smallest but finest State in the nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 5 May 1983 (Hansard, page 258) Mr Kent asked me a question, without notice, arising from a report in the Dutch journal P.T. Aktueel concerning development of the SYNROC process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Resources and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I have seen a translation in the article from the Dutch journal P.T. Aktueel on the development of SYNROC in Australia. The article is inaccurate and speculative. It is not based on fact. I have set out below the scope of Australian Government action on SYNROC.</PARA>
<PARA> No initiative has been taken by the Government to set up a collaborative program with the Netherlands Government and the article does not in fact suggest that it has.</PARA>
<PARA> The basis for the figure of 4m guilders is not clear. An amount of $1.009m ( about 2.5m guilders) was provided in the 1982-83 Budget for the construction of a small pilot plant at the AAEC's Research Establishment at Lucas Heights. This plant will be used to demonstrate all steps in the production of full scale SYNROC-filled cannisters and to commence the related testing procedures. In addition, a total of $1.037m has been committed to SYNROC research and development under the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration ( NERD and D) Program since its inception in 1978.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no substance to references in the article to possible reprocessing and nuclear waste disposal within Australia. The Government does however support the development of safe long-term nuclear waste disposal technology for application to existing waste problems, and has given medium priority to nuclear waste management in the Guidelines and Priorities for Grants under the NERD and D Program. By way of comparison, total funds committed to energy research and development in the period 1978-79 to 1982-83 under the NERD and D Program have amounted to $96.1m of which $8.9m was for solar energy.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr Beazley</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Biennial flight reviews are not conducted by the Department but by Grade One flying instructors and approved pilots from within the industry. These persons are required to certify in a pilot's log book that he has satisfactorily passed the flight review but they are not required to report this information to my Department. Thus the information needed to answer the question is not in the possession of the Department nor is it readily ascertainable.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) These are not test flights but rather educational refreshers. Undoubtedly, a satisfactory standard is reached by most pilots in one refresher period but its length will depend upon the time needed by each individual to reach a satisfactory standard. In some cases a second period may be necessary but the average, overall, would be close to one period.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Since the introduction of the review requirements in September 1982 the Department has received only isolated complaints and then, primarily, from pilots who live in remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No. It has always been clearly stated by the Department that the review is quite unconnected with the holding of a pilot licence. Failure to complete the review by the required date simply results in a loss of the 'command' privilege, not a loss of licence. To date, formal action has been taken against only one pilot arising from a failure to complete a review at the proper time. The investigation of an incident in which he was involved revealed that he was improperly undertaking a 'command' role and his licence was suspended until he had passed an appropriate test.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr Beazley</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Facilities at Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth Airports are provided for the use of international and domestic operators. As costs recoverable from particular sectors of the industry are determined on the basis of usage, part of the costs of these facilities will be recoverable from the domestic sectors, including domestic airlines. The extent to which any resulting increase in costs are absorbed by the airlines or sought to be recovered through fares is a matter for the operators.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) The Independent Air Fares Committee (IAFC) is presently the sole Commonwealth authority able to determine and approve air fares.</PARA>
<PARA> The extent to which increases in Commonwealth charges are reflected in air fares is a matter for that Committee to determine in response to an application from an airline. Air navigation charges, for example, are estimated to account for only 4-5 per cent of total airline costs for the domestic trunk operators and slightly less for regional operators. Accordingly, increases in ANCs have only a very slight impact on fares.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No. Air Navigation Charges (ANCs) and fuel excise paid by domestic operators are used to recover the costs incurred by the Commonwealth in providing, operating and maintaining the aviation infrastructure as a whole. The costs to be recovered from individual sectors of the industry are determined on a network wide basis, and accordingly charges are set on this basis. As a result any increase in aviation infrastructure costs which is passed on in fares is ultimately borne by all travellers on the network.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I am sure honourable members will be aware, the Ukraine was a founding member of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, established by treaty in December 1922 and confirmed in the 1924 Constitution. Australia has not contested the legality of this arrangement. In the light of this, the Government does not consider it appropriate more than sixty years later to attempt to ascribe colonial status to the Ukraine.</PARA>
<PARA> This does not mean, of course, that the Australian Government condones the repressive actions of the Soviet authorities towards assertions of nationalist identity in the Soviet Union. The Government will continue to condemn violations of human rights, from which Ukrainian dissidents have suffered particularly severely.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr Kerin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Tobacco growers benefit from general assistance measures available to all primary producers, and also from Government assistance to the joint industry/ Commonwealth tobacco research scheme which is similar to schemes applying to a number of other rural industries. In 1982-83 approximately $600,000 will be provided for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA> The Industry is also assisted by a joint State/Commonwealth stabilisation scheme which is administered by the Australian Tobacco Board and under which quota tobacco leaf is sold at a pre-determined reserve price. These marketing arrangements are supported by tariffs and by-law concessions on imported tobacco leaf and products.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) The cost to taxpayers in 1982-83 of the joint industry/Commonwealth tobacco research scheme will be about $600,000.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (b) The IAC has estimated that in 1980-81 the cost penalty to manufacturers of using Australian tobacco leaf under existing marketing arrangements was $29. 6m. On this estimate, if existing marketing arrangements were dismantled and if manufacturers passed on the full amount of the reduced costs, consumers of tobacco products could save $29.6m. This amounts to approximately one cent per packet.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Following careful and detailed consideration of the IAC report on the Australian tobacco industry, the Government has decided to implement a further 5 year stabilisation plan for the tobacco industry. While basic tariff and by-law provisions will be retained, the new stablisation scheme will include measures designed to rationalise the tobacco growing industry and ensure a narrowing of the margin between Australian and international leaf price over the period of the plan.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr Hayden</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Government takes a constructive, positive approach to the question of making the United Nations more responsive to the needs of its member states. As a practical matter however there is little likelihood of securing the necessary degree of agreement to amend the organisation's charter to remove the power of veto from the permanent members of the Security Council, since such a proposal would require the assent of the permanent members themselves.</PARA>
<PARA> Charter reform has been a difficult exercise, although Australia participates in consideration of this question and will continue to do so. The United Nations can only function effectively on the basis of consent. If major parties to a dispute refuse to heed the demands of the United Nations, including the Security Council, experience has shown that the United Nations' ability to resolve the problem is limited.</PARA>
<PARA> Countries like Australia have a duty to encourage member states to accept a greater role for the United Nations and the related arbitral and juridical process, but until this acceptance has become more widespread, moves for substantive amendments to the charter are unlikely to be successful.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr Hayden</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reply to Question No. 4680 was of course a reply by the previous Government .</PARA>
<PARA> (1) and (3) Australia would support any constructive proposal for reform of the United Nations Charter and, as stated in the reply to your previous question on this matter, spoke in favour of the principles enunciated in President Carter's report in the General Assembly. However as a matter of fact any agreement to reform the Charter will require widespread support from member states of the organisation, including the permanent members of the Security Council, and we must bear this in mind.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has been an active supporter of UN peace-keeping activities. In addition to financial contributions we have provided personnel and equipment to operations in Cyprus, Kashmir and the Middle East. Australia is also a member of the General Assembly's Special Committee on Peace-Keeping operations which was set up to review the whole question of peace-keeping.</PARA>
<PARA> There is, however, no doubt that the United Nations' record on peace-keeping is not entirely successful. The Security Council, the primary organ for the maintenance of international peace and security, finds its resolutions often ignored. Those provisions of the Charter dealing with collective action for peace and security have been rendered largely ineffective. Member States have contrived to avoid bringing particular problems to the Security Council, or to do so too late for the Council to have any effective impact. Obviously the attainment of the ideals which the original participants held for the ability of the United Nations to keep the peace has proved elusive. Nevertheless, the Secretary-General has proposed a number of measures to face what he himself has described as a crisis in the multilateral approach to solving world problems. These include a more systematic use of the Security Council which, when alerted by the Secretary-General, could attempt to identify and isolate disputes before they degenerate into armed conflict. The Secretary-General has also proposed that Member States use their collective influence to ensure respect for decisions of the Security Council.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia supports the Secretary-General's ideas, and spoke accordingly before the 37th Session of the General Assembly. They presuppose, however, a measure of co-operation among the permanent members, and until this consensus develops, have little chance of being implemented.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Government supports the goals and objectives of the world disarmament campaign and its policies on disarmament will be determined by a thorough and detailed assessment of Australia's interests. The Government has already given indications of positive directions on its policies on disarmament. These policies reflect principled concern for peace and security and for the achievement of effective balanced verifiable and negotiated disarmament measures . The Government's attitude to the positions taken by blocs in the United Nations will be based on these principles.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Australia's decision to impose sanctions on the Soviet Union was taken by the previous Government independently of the United Nations.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Articles 41 and 42 of the United Nations Charter empower the Security Council to employ a range of measures to give effect to its decisions in the event of it determining that a threat to international peace and security exists . These measures include complete or partial interruption of economic relations, the severance of diplomatic relations and the closure of communications links. Should these measures be ineffective the Council may resort to military action.</PARA>
<PARA> The Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council can exercise power of veto over calls for such measures. This Government, like those of other member States of the United Nations, must abide by these conditions. Although the power of veto of permanent member states can present disadvantages, it is a fact of life that the cooperation of the major powers can only be expected if they believe their interests are being protected or served.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Government is deeply concerned at the threat to survival of mankind posed by the size and scale of nuclear arsenals. The Government considers that the most effective way of addressing these questions is to give its strong backing to the negotiating process between the super powers and the other nuclear weapons states with the objective of achieving limits, reductions and ultimately the abolition of nuclear arsenals.</PARA>
<PARA> This is a period of intense rivalry and competition between the super powers and indeed between states in various parts of the world and any machinery or mechanism in the United Nations has to proceed from this basis.</PARA>

<PARA> Statistics of unemployment rates classified by country of birth are compiled from the Australian Bureau of Statistics' monthly labour force survey and are published in 'The Labour Force, Australia' (Catalogue No. 6203.0). Unemployment rates for persons born in Yugoslavia, Greece, Italy, Malta, Poland, Germany, the Netherlands and Lebanon are shown in this publication.

<PARA> Information on unemployment rates by country of birth is also available from the 1981 Census of Population and Housing; see Table 7 in microfische batch 81. 501, a copy of which is available in the Parliamentary Library.

<PARA> In relation to calls from Australia, the department's Central Office is the registered subscriber for the switchboard servicing all departments and authorities in the Benjamin complex. The existing account structure does not provide details of calls made overseas. In addition, some of the regional offices (which also make international calls), have their costs met by other departments which are the main subscribers in those regions.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5J4">Mr Scholes</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Defence Force has a clear need to maintain a capacity for survey and mapping under combat conditions. This is achieved by retaining a training cadre as a basis for rapid response and expansion should the need arise. Additionally, the Australian Defence Force needs detailed specialist maps and charts at scales suitable for both strategic and tactical planning. However, with limited mapping , charting and surveying resources available to the nation, it is not possible to produce and fully maintain satisfactory maps and charts of Australian and all overseas areas of potential military significance. As a consequence, there are military priorities for map and chart production which do not necessarily correspond to civil priorities based on national development, commercial, cadastral, recreational and other requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> The question posed by the honourable member has been considered and examined on a number of occasions. On the last occasion, following the Review of Commonwealth Functions during which the responsibilities of Commonwealth mapping , charting and surveying authorities were examined in detail, the previous Government in October 1981 agreed that merger of Commonwealth organisations undertaking survey and mapping was not warranted.</PARA>
<PARA> The present Army Survey Corps organisation is considered the minimum necessary to retain a viable core force in this specialised activity. In view of the significant amount of mapping yet to be achieved, and the large and increasing task of maintaining currency by revision and resurvey of existing mapping, I am assured there is sufficient work to keep all personnel involved in these activities fully employed for many years to come.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) It is estimated that approximately 40,000 Vietnamese troops are currently stationed in Laos. These troops, who perform for the most part a security role, are present under a Twenty-five Year Treaty of Friendship and Co- operation that has been in force between Laos and Vietnam since July 1977.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) It is estimated that there are upwards of 160,000 Vietnamese troops in Cambodia. Vietnam and the People's Republic of Kampuchea regime claim that these forces are in Cambodia by invitation of the Phnom Penh government, in accordance with a Twenty-five Year Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Co-operation, signed in February 1979. The main role of these troops is to uphold the People's Republic of Kampuchea regime, which it installed in 1979, and to prevent the Khmer Rouge returning to power.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Government has noted the announced troop withdrawal from Cambodia. It is also aware that foreign journalists were invited on 2 May to observe the departure of some two thousand troops and several tanks from Phnom Penh and that several hundred of these troops did arrive in Ho Chi Minh City on 4 May. It is not possible to be sure as yet whether the announced movement of troops represents a partial withdrawal or is only part of the normal rotation of troops .</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I can confirm that a similar withdrawal was announced by Vietnam on 7 July last year. What occurred, however, was apparently a normal rotation of troops.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The role of Migrant Resource Centres involves three complementary areas of activity. They provide a base for social, educational and cultural activities of ethnic groups; they are a service point for multilingual information giving, referral and counselling; and they assist the local community to better respond to the needs of migrants.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The original allocation for 1982-83 funds for the North Perth Migrant Resource Centre was $59,750. As part of the recent additional funding of $255, 000 for the MRC program the North Perth MRC was granted a further $8,000. Finally, a supplementary grant of $2,000 was made bringing its 1982-83 total to $69,750.</PARA>
<PARA> The additional funding represents swift action by the Government to ensure that Migrant Resource Centres are adequately resourced. It effectively restores real funding levels which had been progressively eroded since the program was introduced in 1978.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) (b) Information on the movement of Soviet naval ships in the North and West Pacific is provided primarily by friendly nations on the understanding that its composition is protected. In the South Pacific, in October 1982, a Soviet Naval research ship and a FOXTROT-class submarine were noted west of Tahiti. This group was also seen east of New Zealand in December.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) (c) It is not possible to provide a detailed analysis of Soviet naval activity specifically within the Persian Gulf, Gulf of Oman, Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea. However, the information provided on Indian Ocean activity in the above table, because of the geography of the area, takes in naval ship movements in these peripheral waters. Soviet naval movements in the East Mediterranean and the Black Sea, being of less direct strategic concern to Australia, are not analysed in detail.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The information given in response to Question No. 4641 and 2193 about developments at Dahlak Island, Aden, Socotra Island and the Bay of Turbah remains current.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The question of whether military attaches should be appointed to appropriate diplomatic missions in the Middle East is kept under review.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from the Australian Telecommunications Commission, is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. Various exchange-based or customer-based equipments exist throughout the world to itemise ISD and STD calls. Their suitability for a particular country depends on the nature of the exchange system in that country.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. Exchange-based equipment is being used by Telecom (see 3 and 4 below). Customer-based equipment which gives details of ISD, STD and local calls is also available in Australia, mainly for customer use in association with PABXs.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (4) Since 1980, Telecom has been progressively introducing, as a standard facility, a system known as Call Charge Recording (CCR) for international calls, which enables subscribers to be given details of ISD calls made from their services. ISD/CCR will have been provided on almost 2 million services by the end of June 1983.</PARA>
<PARA> Plans were announced some time ago for the provision of a CCR system for STD calls. Because of the substantial costs involved in this undertaking and the consequent tariff impact of these costs, Telecom proposes to offer the service on an optional basis. It is expected to be made available progressively from suitable exchanges commencing in mid-1984.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EV4">Mr Young</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am generally aware that there are differences between the Commonwealth and State electoral rolls in Western Australia. In the main these differences stem from the fact that the Commonwealth and the State maintain quite separate electoral rolls and electors need to complete both a Commonwealth and a State enrolment claim card in order to secure Commonwealth and State enrolment. There are also differences in the Commonwealth and State legislation which could be a contributing factor-especially the very restrictive witnessing provisions of the State legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> However, all this will change in the near future. The Western Australian Minister for Parliamentary and Electoral Reform has announced a number of amendments to the State legislation-all designed to improve the State legislation and to facilitate a Commonwealth-State arrangement under which electors would be able to secure Commonwealth and State enrolment by the completion of a single claim card. A formal arrangement will need to await the passage of the Western Australian legislation. Preliminary discussions between the Commonwealth and State electoral officials are proceeding with a view to early implementation of joint enrolment once the State legislation is in place.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There is already an exchange of information between the Commonwealth and State electoral administrations. The Australian Electoral Office in Western Australia provides a weekly list of all new enrolments and roll alterations made by it to the State Department. Such statistical information as the State Department requires is supplied to it on request. These arrangements have been in operation for the last 18 months.</PARA>

<PARA> There are no reliable estimates of the number of homeless persons in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Education and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Minister for Education in each State has the ultimate responsibility for decisions about what is included in the school curriculum.</PARA>
<PARA> However, I would advocate the inclusion in the curriculum of activities which would lead students to a more critical understanding of the global community, and the interplay of economic, political and military forces that have led nations into war. I would support studies which explore ways of settling differences other than by confrontation and armed conflict.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) and (b) It is difficult to make any general assessment of the aims of peace studies in schools, since these matters are decided individually by each school generally within broad guidelines laid down by education authorities. The content of courses related to the study of peace is decided in different ways, according to the policy and guidelines of the school and of the State in which it is located.</PARA>
<PARA> All States and Territories are aware of increasing interest in and support for Peace Studies. Education authorities claim there is provision within existing structures (basically within Social Science and Social Studies programs), for the introduction of the main themes embraced by Peace Studies, and that many of the issues are already incorporated in existing guidelines. As far as non- government schools are concerned a range of schools have Peace Studies programs. An outstanding example is the Australian International Independent School ( Sydney) which was established on a philosophy of non-violence. Peace Studies permeate the total curriculum of this school.</PARA>
<PARA> In the Australian Capital Territory, the Schools Authority and the United Nations Association of Australia in October 1982 organised an in-service course for teachers from government and non-government schools and interested members on the theme 'Education for Peace'. A committee was formed to promote peace education. One Australian Capital Territory school provides a course entitled ' Conflict and Crisis' as part of the Social Studies program and another has prepared a course in Peace Studies for accreditation. However, Peace Studies can also be treated as a theme in existing subjects by such means as an emphasis on co-operation rather than competition. In an Australian Capital Territory school the content of such a course would need to be approved by the school board and in the case of Year 11 and 12 courses be accredited by the Accrediting Agency.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> Commissioning has been in progress as parts of ANAHL have been structurally completed. Elements of the building that will be critical for security and which are commissioned have been the steam raising plant, which is essential for providing steam for sterilisation purposes; the diesel generators, which will provide power should power from the State Electricity Commission be discontinued for any reason; and the air compressors, which are vital to security because compressed air is used for sealing airtight doors, for moving automatic valves and for providing air to the fully-enclosed suits worn by personnel handling high-risk infective agents.</PARA>
<PARA> All of these systems have performed to the high standards required of them. A microprocessor control system which was developed by the Department of Housing and Construction for controlling a regime of negative air pressures within the high-security areas of the laboratory has been adapted to control all of the major items of engineering equipment and has been patented worldwide. Considerable confidence in this control system was built up during eighteen months of testing on a prototype constructed at Port Melbourne, and this has been vindicated by the excellent results that have been obtained from its application to the steam raising plant, boilers, compressors and the plant for providing chilled water.</PARA>
<PARA> CSIRO is very confident that ANAHL will provide a level of security over and above that determined to be necessary for the laboratory to operate continuously in a safe manner.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am aware of Senator Button's statement of 28 February 1983. However, I am also aware of Senator Button's media release of 1 March 1983 which states, inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA>'A Labor Government will not change the current provisions relating to cigarette and tobacco advertising . . .'</PARA>
<PARA>It is not the intention of the Government that advertising of tobacco products and alcoholic beverages be treated in the same way because, from a health perspective, these products are not the same. Tobacco consumption at any level is harmful to health. Indeed, it is estimated that more than 16,000 deaths resulted from tobacco-related diseases in Australia last year. However, alcohol- when consumed in moderation-has not been demonstrated to be harmful to health: it becomes so only when abused.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's stated health policy on tobacco and alcohol consumption recognises these differences. Whereas the Goverment is committed to take further action to inhibit the promotion of cigarettes, it acknowledges that alcohol, in moderation, is acceptable. Therefore, my Department will continue to do what it can to promote in the community an awareness of safe patterns of alcohol consumption.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the honourable member's question on how advertising requirements will differ, I can only reply in terms of my objectives as Minister for Health.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) The Commonwealth is taking action through the Ministerial Committee on Drug Strategy (MCDS) and the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General (SCAG) to implement the recommendations of the Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs (ARCID) in relation to the preparation of model drug legislation. It is expected that development of draft legislation, which ARCID suggested could be in the form of a uniform Drug Trafficking Act and a uniform Drugs of Dependence Act , will form the basis of a National Code to deal with drug trafficking. The detailed content and form of the legislation will not be finally decided until examination of the 218 ARCID legislation proposals has been completed by the Commonwealth and States in the forums of the Ministerial Committee on Drug Strategy and through the organs of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. It will be a matter for each State and Territory to determine , in co-operation with the Commonwealth, the form and content legislation will take in their jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The basis of the national strategy which has been endorsed in principle by the Commonwealth in the forum of the MCDS is outlined on page D28 of the ARCID Report. Those aspects of the National Strategy on page D28, which ARCID suggested would require legislative action e.g. statutory recognition of the difference which the community recognises between the trafficker and the pedlar/ user, and minimisation of the impact of the criminal law upon illegal drug experimenters by allowing the expunging of convictions, are matters which are being taken up in the context of the development of model drug legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The ARCID recommendations relating to the uniform scheduling and classifying of drugs throughout Australia, have been examined by the Australian Health Ministers' Conference which resolved on 28 April 1983 that the National Health and Medical Research Council be asked to review the definition of Schedule 8 drugs and examine appropriate Schedules in the Uniform Poisons Standard to see how they relate to the controls proposed under the Drugs of Dependence Act.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) It is Commonwealth policy that, for all major purchases of goods and services by departments and authorities which are totally or partly imported ( that is valued above $1m, with an imported content exceeding $500,000) the overseas supplier is required to provide Australian industry with acceptable offset work. The Offset Program seeks to secure workload which will broaden the capabilities of Australian industries which are of technological or defence significance and stimulate technology advancement in Australian industries. Communications portfolio authorities are required by their respective legislation, and AUSSAT Pty Ltd by its Memorandum of Association, to obtain ministerial approval before entering into contracts exceeding a specified amount -$500,000 for Telecom Australia, Australia Post, AUSSAT Pty Ltd, the Overseas Telecommunications Commission and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, $250, 000 for the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, and $100,000 for the Special Broadcasting Service. Compliance with the Government's offsets policy is a normal pre-requisite to ministerial approval.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Information on tenders invited and contracts arranged by Communications portfolio authorities is published in general issues of the Gazette of the Commonwealth of Australia. Details of Australian industry participation for particular purchases are usually available from the authorities and any offset arrangements against those purchases could be sought from the Department of Defence Support, which is responsible for administering the Offsets Program. Information on the present stage of progress of tenders invited and offsets arrangements being negotiated are generally of a commercial-in-confidence nature .</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr Hayden</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My predecessor stated on 20 September 1982 that the then Australian Government was appalled at the massacres which took place at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. The present Government shares that attitude. When I raised the issue in Parliament on 22 September 1982 I referred to the 'appalling slaughter' which had taken place on 16, 17 and 18 September and likened it to a 'slaughter which has all the appearance of a premeditated attempt at human extermination'.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government strongly believes that Lebanon should be free from outside interference and that it should remain a sovereign and independent State . We would support moves which would enable the Lebanese authorities to regain sovereignty over the whole of their territory. We would agree that the alleviation of the human suffering of Lebanon cannot await the resolution of the Arab-Israel conflict. On 18 may 1983 the Government welcomed the conclusion of an agreement between Lebanon and Israel on the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon. I subsequently wrote to the Lebanese and Israeli Foreign Ministers to welcome the agreement and to express Australian support for the concept of negotiations to resolve the problems of the area. On 27 June I wrote to the Syrian Foreign Minister to express the hope that Syria, through negotiations with the Government of Lebanon, would agree to withdraw its troops from Lebanon. I said the withdrawal of all external forces would contribute to a reduction in tension and the lessening of the potential for conflict in the region.</PARA>
<PARA> The suggestion is noted that an initiative should be taken to call for the internationalisation of Lebanon by the creation of a neutral disarmed Lebanon, backed by UN guarantees and a multinational force. Australia supports in principle arrangements which would give Lebanon, and its neighbours, confidence that their security would be assured. However, Australia is not a party principal to the negotiations for the withdrawal of external forces from Lebanon . Any initiative such as that proposed would have the most chance of success if it were to come from one of the parties directly involved, and it would certainly seem to require the concurrence of the sovereign Lebanese government.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government has already provided $10m to assist towards the reconstruction of Lebanon.</PARA>
