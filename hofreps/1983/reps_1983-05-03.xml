<PARA> That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on 28 January 1983 of the Right Honourable Francis Michael Forde, a member for the Division of Capricornia from 1922 to 1946, a Minister of the Crown and Prime Minister, and former High Commissioner to Canada, and that this House places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in its bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA>We were all saddened to hear during the recess of the death of the Right Honourable Frank Forde, who was a former Prime Minister and member of this House and a distinguished public figure for many years. When we look back over Frank Forde's long political career, his very significant achievements are often overshadowed by memories of his short term as Prime Minister in July 1945 following the death of John Curtin. But his contribution to this nation encompasses a period of service over 40 years with not only this Parliament but also the Queensland Parliament and overseas as Australian High Commissioner to Canada. </PARA>
<PARA> Frank Forde was born at Mitchell in Queensland on 18 July 1890. After completing his education at the Christian Brothers College in Toowoomba, he joined the then Postmaster-General's Department. It was at that time that he first joined the Australian Labor Party. In 1917, he was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly where he remained until 1922 when he decided to enter Federal politics. He was elected to this House as the Australian Labor Party member for Capricornia, a seat which he was to retain successfully until 1946. In 1925 he married Veronica, a partnership which was to provide much comfort and support until her death in 1967. </PARA>
<PARA> It was during the time of the Scullin Government that Frank Forde first achieved ministerial rank, first as Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs, from October 1929 until February 1931, and later as Minister for Trade and Customs from February 1931 until January 1932. During this time he also served as Acting Minister for Transport. In 1932 he was elected as Deputy Leader of the Australian Labor Party, in which position he was to serve his party until 1946. When the Curtin Government came to office in 1941, it was only natural that Frank Forde should have been Deputy Prime Minister. Mr Speaker, we all owe a debt to that Government, which led us through the dark days of the Second World War, and Frank Forde, as the Minister for the Army, played a very large and significant part in that effort. </PARA>
<PARA> After the sudden death of John Curtin in July 1945, Frank Forde briefly became Prime Minister. When Ben Chifley was elected as Leader of the Australian Labor Party, Frank Forde continued as his deputy and Minister for the Army. In 1945 he was a respected member of the Australian delegation to the conference which established the United Nations. Surprisingly, in 1946 he was defeated at the general election. Frank Forde's contributions and talents were not lost to the country when he lost his seat at the 1946 election. He was appointed to the position of High Commissioner to Canada, a post which he filled with considerable distinction until 1953. One would have imagined that after his return to this country he would have retired from political life. However, in 1955, at a time of great turbulence in the Australian Labor Party, Frank Forde re-entered politics when he was elected to the Queensland Parliament, after a 33 -year absence. He was beaten in the closely contested State election in 1957. </PARA>
<PARA> Frank Forde gave long and valuable service to this country in a period extending from 1917 until 1957. On behalf of the Government and of the people of Australia, I extend my sympathy to his family in their bereavement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and on behalf of the Opposition I join with him in expressing condolences to the surviving members of the late Frank Forde's family . As the Prime Minister has said, Frank Forde served Australia with very great dedication throughout his long and distinguished career as a member of the Queensland and Federal parliaments. He served two years in the Queensland Parliament as the member for Rockhampton before winning the Federal seat of Capricornia in 1922-a seat which he held for the next 24 years. Although he is best remembered as Australia's shortest serving Prime Minister, he held a number of important portfolios, and with distinction, as the Prime Minister has said, being Minister for Trade and Customs and Acting Minister for Transport in the Scullin Government and Minister for the Army during the very difficult times of World War II.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For 15 years Frank Forde served the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party as its deputy leader and was Deputy Prime Minister from 1941 to 1946. The Prime Minister has referred to the fact that he attended the San Francisco conference in 1945. It is my recollection that he was the leader of the Australian delegation to that conference, which was, of course, one of the most important conferences in world history, leading, as it did, to the establishment of the United Nations. When he lost his seat in 1946, he was appointed Australia's High Commissioner in Ottawa, where he served his country for nine years with customary distinction. He received honorary doctorates in laws from three Canadian universities and later from the University of Queensland, and, as the Prime Minister has said, he returned briefly to the Queensland Parliament in 1955. </PARA>
<PARA> Shortly after my election to this House, Frank Forde sought me out and introduced himself to me. We had a number of conversations over the years following that meeting. I well understand and agree with those who speak of his integrity and his compassion. He is remembered by members on this side of the House with great respect and great affection. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish briefly to support the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) in honouring the memory of Frank Forde and conveying condolences to his family. Not only did Frank Forde serve Capricornia, Rockhampton and Australia well but he also served the world very well. At the San Francisco United Nations Conference he and the late Bert Evatt led the campaign of the smaller nations to have a voice and equality of voting. In that they succeeded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One significant area in which they failed, again having led the arguments at the founding of the United Nations, was in preventing the power of the veto being given to certain members of the Security Council. Today, the atomic powers -none of which were atomic powers in those days; the bombs had not fallen on Hiroshima and Nagasaki when the United Nations Charter was drawn up-have drastically diminished the value of the work of Forde and Evatt because the Security Council is now hamstrung, by the veto, in fulfilling the prime function and purpose which these men strove so hard to establish. If there is a dispute between the atomic powers, the Security Council can take no action. It would be a fitting memorial and tribute to these gentlemen if this Parliament and Australia could lead the way in trying to achieve some means of establishing arbitration and consensus in place of the confrontation which dominates the world scene. There could be no more fitting memorial. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the members of the National Party of Australia and myself I support the condolence motion of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) and the honourable member for Capricornia (Dr Everingham ). Mr Frank Forde was well known to me, as was his career. He departed from the political scene the year that I entered Parliament. He was defeated in the Queensland seat of Flinders in 1957. He and my father sat on opposite sides of this House for many years. He was a very distinguished Australian who was held in great respect. After his retirement from politics he often visited this Parliament and whenever I had occasion I would talk to him and recall earlier days in Canberra. The Forde and Anthony families were very close. In the mid- 1930s, leading up to the war, the families of members of parliament lived in the Kurrajong Hotel. There were three daughters in the Forde family and two boys and a girl in the Anthony family--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Fordes had three very nice daughters; I can say that. We all mixed and lived together and enjoyed one another's company. At the Commonwealth Games last year I had the opportunity of meeting Mrs Mercia Ferrier, one of the daughters, whom I had not seen for 40 years. We recalled old times and it was then that she said her father's health was failing. I also had a link in that my electoral secretary of many years was also one of Frank Forde's personal staff during the war years. I recall Frank Forde as being a very courteous, polite man and always generous with his friendship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has already talked about the details of Mr Forde's career, which was long and distinguished. He was held in high esteem by members of both sides of the Parliament. They might not always have agreed with his views but he was respected as a man of great integrity, great compassion and great loyalty especially to his party and above all to this country. That respect was shown by a Liberal Prime Minister, Mr Menzies, when he extended his term as the High Commissioner to Canada when there was a change of government in 1949. It was a respect also shared by many Australian servicemen and women who looked to Mr Forde with a great deal of respect and concern when he was Minister for the Army during the War years. Mr Forde narrowly missed out on becoming Leader of the Labor Party in 1932. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sorry. I will not argue with the expert. Mr Forde missed out on becoming leader and it is an irony that he missed out by a margin of one vote, which was the same margin by which he lost the seat of Flinders in Queensland. But he became deputy to Mr Curtin and served him loyally until his death in 1945 . It was then that for a period of six days he was Prime Minister of this country. When Mr Chifley was elected Prime Minister, he was overwhelmingly voted in as the Deputy Prime Minister. He served in that position until Mr Chifley appointed him High Commissioner to Canada.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a remarkable tribute to a man such as Mr Forde, who had so many political disappointments, that he never carried any bitterness. He came back regularly to this Parliament full of the excitement and the interest of it. So many politicians are embittered or disappointed people, but that never applied to Mr Frank Forde. He will also be remembered in his home State of Queensland with a great deal of warmth. In 1972 the University of Queensland honoured Mr Forde with an honorary doctorate of laws degree. In that same ceremony the same degree was conferred on another former Prime Minister, Sir Arthur Fadden. Neither served as Prime Minister for very long but they both gave great service. They will both be long remembered even though they might have been on opposite sides of the political spectrum. My sympathy goes out to the members of the Forde family. They had a great father and he will be long remembered. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YF4">Mr CROSS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Brisbane)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to add briefly to some of the things that have been said by those honourable members who have already spoken and with whom I totally agree. Mr Forde was a person of impeccable courtesy and kindness, particularly to young people interested in politics. I first met him after he returned from being the Australian High Commissioner to Canada. He lived at Torwood, the suburb adjoining the suburb in which I live, with his brother who was then a Hansard reporter; I am not quite sure but he may have been the chief Hansard reporter in Queensland. He used to travel on the Rainworth tram to the city to go about his labours. He was working as an organiser for the Australian Labor Party for a short period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He contested unsuccessfully the seat of Wide Bay and then, of course, nominated again in Flinders. He was quite unfortunate-I am not reflecting on his very deep interest in politics-in that, while he served in the Queensland Parliament and in this Parliament from 1922 to 1946, he retired in a period prior to the introduction of the parliamentary pension scheme. He was therefore obliged to campaign in Flinders at an age when most people have retired from politics. I cam- paigned with him. I was intrigued when out door knocking in the small towns of Flinders with Frank Forde. Although he insisted on being introduced as the Right Honourable Frank Forde, he was a very humble, courteous and kindly person, interested in everyone's problems. </PARA>
<PARA> He was defeated in an election when Labor was voted out of office. Unfortunately, a number of ballot papers had not been initialled, as required by law, at the old people's home in Charters Towers. He was defeated and, at a subsequent by-election following that decision of the Court of Disputed Returns, he was unsuccessful. He then devoted the remaining part of his life mainly to his family to whom he was extremely devoted and to the Holy Spirit Hospital in which he died. He was very active in public affairs. In extending my condolences to members of his family, I pay a tribute to them for the way they looked after their father in the closing years of his life. It was a very close-knit family. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other comment I make is the one that has been made before today, and that is that he is principally remembered as being our shortest serving Prime Minister. I feel we should have given greater recognition to the work he did as Minister for Customs in the Scullin Government when he set up that protection of Australian industry that laid the basis of our capacity to fight the Second World War. In 1946 he was defeated because, as Minister for the Army, he was not able to meet the many requests from people who wanted their sons and close relatives discharged straight away. The Government had an orderly process of getting those people into jobs-a new experience for many of them-and he paid the price of carrying out the policies of the Government. He served the people of Australia very well. </PARA>

<PARA> Whereas the Government of Australia has signed the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which in Article 23 (1) states that ''The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to the protection by society and the State'', and</PARA>
<PARA> Whereas the terms of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women would violate the above Article 23 (1).</PARA>
<PARA> We humbly pray the Government to refrain from ratifying the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women; Believing that its implementation would result in:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Undue cost to the Nation at this time.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) 'The elimination of any stereotyped concept of roles of men and women at all levels' as described in Part 3 Article 10 (c), being a disruption of traditional parental roles, is likely to result in emotional disturbances of childhood.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The strong encouragements to mothers to join the work force, with the provision of networks of creches and child care centres as outlined in Article 11 of the convention is likely to result in maternal deprivation and psychological disturbances among children with an increase in childhood psychiatric illnesses.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The sexual role changing as recommended in Part 3 Article 10 (c) is likely to contribute to further marriage insecurity and breakdown.</PARA>

<PARA> The Australian Aircraft Manufacturing Industry has suffered serious setbacks since its creation, because of the lack of a coherent Australian Government policy for the Industry, as illustrated by:</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. I am asked to have a guess. We have had enough of guesses from people on the other side of the House. We had the guess, or was it a deception, as to what the level of the deficit would be in 1983-84. We have had enough of these guesses. In the regulation of this economy it is about time we had a serious discussion and a serious analysis of what is likely to happen. I will proceed to do so. In the latter part of this year there will be in place, as a result of the deliberate decisions of this Government, an apparatus whereby the claims upon the resources of this community, not only by wage and salary earners but by all sections of the community, will be related to the capacity of this economy. As a result of what has come out of the National Economic Summit Conference, by the end of the year we will have a prices surveillance mechanism which will cover claims by a wide range of people upon the resources of this community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we have that situation in which we are able to look with confidence at a lessening of the rate of inflation and by which at the latter stage of this year wage and salary earners will have already suffered a very significant reduction in the levels of their real incomes, I believe that an increase of the order of 3 per cent to 4 per cent and no more by the end of this year will be consistent with a situation in which the Australian economy will be able to move into 1984 best placed to take advantage of the gradual improvement in the rate of economic recovery which will mark this economy by the end of 1983 as a result of the following factors: Firstly, growth in confidence in the business community associated with the election of the Labor Government on 5 March, which is already evident; secondly, the recovery that will be associated with the relief of the drought; and, thirdly, the recovery that will be associated with what is happening in the United States of America. In the context of all of those developments and because all claims of the community will be subject to surveillance in the public interest, I think that an increase of the order which has been referred to will be consistent with a significant increase in economic growth and the growth of employment opportunities as we move into 1984.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="81" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="EMPLOYMENT & INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for this question. The Government is concerned about this strike, which arose as a result of the variation of the federal pastoral industry award by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission some five weeks ago to allow the use of so-called wide combs. The strike, which has been going on for all that time, has had adverse effects on the pastoral industry, including endangering stock in some areas. There have been some reports of violent confrontation between striking and non-striking shearers and some reports of intimidation of graziers. All of those matters are of considerable concern to the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member asks what action has been taken. We have conferred with the Australian Workers Union, the union involved, and with the wool growers to try to find ways in which to end this strike. We supported the AWU executive's proposal some two weeks ago to take a so-called section 59 application to the Arbitration Commission and for the members of that union to return to work. A section 59 application enables the Commission, if it agrees with the application , to suspend an award or part of an award.</PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the members of the union disregarded their federal executive's recommendation and decided to stay out. The Government condemned that decision of the members. Since then we have continued to try to find a basis for settlement. We believe that will come only with the involvement of the Arbitration Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> In view of the unwillingness of either of the parties, the growers or the union , to take the matter back to arbitration, I took the very unusual step-it has not been done for many years-of notifying an industrial dispute to the Arbitration Commission under section 25, to try to get this matter back before the Commission. I did that a few days ago.</PARA>
<PARA> On the same day the Australian Workers Union initiated action in the High Court to seek a re-hearing of the matter before the appeal bench of the Arbitration Commission. Today I should inform the House that there have been further developments. I understand that the Australian Workers Union now intends to lodge a section 59 application in the Arbitration Commission, today or tomorrow, and to withdraw its High Court action. The Government will intervene in that section 59 hearing and support the Australian Workers Union's right to have a full hearing of the matter, a right which the union contends it was denied in the previous arbitration hearings.</PARA>
<PARA> Our support for the union's right to have that hearing will be conditional on two provisos. They are that there is a return to work by the striking shearers, and that the union agrees to abide by the Arbitration Commission's decision. We believe that provides a real basis for settlement of this difficult dispute.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Treasurer. I refer the honourable gentleman to paragraph 18 of the National Economic Summit communique.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Council of Trade Unions has made it quite clear that it is prepared to exercise restraint in the area of incomes, and it has delayed that claim. The Government, as a result of the decisions of the National Economic Summit, has determined to go back to a basis of centralised wage fixation. That proceeding will be before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. There has been a lot of speculation about the adjustment of wages towards the end of this calendar year, but that is now in the hands of the Arbitration Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One thing is clear, and that is that the former Government, of course, is now beating its breast about the wages pause when, in fact, we should remember that it grew out of a party room discussion in which someone said-I think it was the former member for Macarthur-'We should be seen to be doing something'. If the former Treasurer wants to jawbone here about wages, he should go back to the result of 1980-81, when his Government destroyed the basis of wage fixation and moved to a decentralised basis of wage fixation, which kept up the inflationary surge that we have seen.</PARA>
<PARA> We have made it quite clear that the basis of the ACTU-Australian Labor Party accord is an adjustment of wages over time. Indeed, as late as yesterday, Mr Fitzgibbon, the vice-president of the ACTU, made it clear that in his view a wage increase of about 3 per cent would be appropriate towards the end of the year.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that Mr D. A. Kearney, the Chairman of the Royal Hobart Hospital Board, resigned yesterday afternoon in protest against the standover tactics of the State Health Minister-standover tactics which are becoming increasingly common in the Tasmanian Government. Because we have an intimate cost-sharing arrangement with the Tasmanian Government, I am deeply disturbed by the evidence presented in the letter of resignation about the condition of health services in Tasmania. Mr Kearney makes it quite clear that, firstly, over the last 12 months there has been a decline in the quality and quantity of health services in that State; secondly, there has been an undermining of staff morale; and, thirdly and most importantly, there has been a decline in the standard of patient care. Because we have this intimate cost-sharing Budget arrangement with the Tasmanian Government, any Federal Health Minister must be disturbed when an impeccable source-Mr Kearney is a man of unimpeachable integrity who has a long record of service to the Tasmanian community-makes statements of this kind about the budgeting process provided by the Tasmanian Government:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was amateurish and naive and resulted in a shambles insofar as the Royal Hobart Hospital and, I am sure, many other hospitals were concerned.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kearney further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> To summarise, the initial provisional budget exercise was a farce; it was ill- conceived, incapable of being implemented and accompanied by threats and intimidating statements.</PARA>
<PARA>Only 10 days ago we provided advance funds to help the Tasmanian hospital system . Honourable members will understand the alarm I felt when today I read in this letter:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the financial and other harassments to which it-</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Royal Hobart Hospital-</PARA>
<PARA>has been subjected, particularly in the past ten months, and the untold damage which will be caused to the Tasmanian public hospital system if the present policy of ad hoc and unco-ordinated reductions in services is not replaced by . . . detailed definition of hospital roles within that system.</PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear that, because of the arrangement with the Tasmanian Government , any Federal Government must be concerned, particularly in these economic times , about this record of mismanagement. It is quite clear that all public hospital systems need to have close and cost efficient systems of expenditure. What seems to have happened in Tasmania is that the Government has used intimidatory tactics to force on hospital boards useless and futile methods of cost cutting rather than working out a definition of hospital roles and then applying funding in relation to that. The Hawke Government will offer co-operative relationships with all State Governments in dealing with their difficult hospital problems. We regret the turmoil in the Tasmanian system, which is one further product of the jackboot attitudes of the Tasmanian Government.</PARA>

We have made it very clear that we do not think that system can be brought in at this time. We say that it has to be brought in over time. The appropriate time at which it should be brought in is a matter for final determination not by this Government but by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. We simply do not have the power. We will have an attitude on that but it will be decided by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see reports in the newspapers today, following announcements that I made yesterday concerning the Government's decisions about the introduction of the source deduction of withholding tax. First of all, I point out that this tax was first announced by the former Government in the 1982-83 Budget and it was one of 16 measures which contributed to the legislative chaos which this Government inherited in relation to taxation measures. If the previous Government had been more interested in getting on with the business of running this country and less interested in trying to conspire a propitious electoral circumstance, we might have had those matters brought into law instead of their confronting this Government with the prospect of having to make detailed decisions about measures which the former Government had already announced. The former Treasurer in fact had not settled important issues concerning the source deduction of withholding tax and therefore it was for this Government to try to settle those questions quickly, having first consulted with the industries concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the last four weeks, on at least four occasions, I have had discussions with the building industry about the detail of that particular proposal, and indeed with other industries to which that system will apply from 1 September. As a result of those discussions we did take notice of some of the points that were made to us by the industry. Instead of imposing a tax of 25 per cent of the gross payments, which was the apparent intention of the former Government, we decided to impose the tax at the level of 10 per cent. That will not pose a cash flow problem for the industry. It will not be disruptive of traditional work practices within the building industry and other industries. Yet at the same time it will have the effect of bringing in revenue of about $300m in 1983-84 which was the prospective amount which had been built into the revenue estimates for 1983-84.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as going soft on this matter is concerned, I give an unequivocal commitment that this Government will carry into effect the spirit and indeed the direction of the communique of the National Economic Summit Conference at which we were instructed by the Summit--</PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We were instructed unanimously by the building industry-by the builders, by the Housing Industry Association, by the Master Builders Federation of Australia Inc. and by the Confederation of Australian Industry-and we are required as a result of the communique to act against tax evasion and tax avoidance. That is precisely what we intend to do. I also mention that apparently the pretext for saying that we are going soft relates to the question of whether the reporting mechanisms which will apply to householders have been liberalised. The point is that whatever are the reporting mechanisms in relation to householders, they will have absolutely no effect on the amount of revenue in 1983-84. Let me refer to the extent that it will affect the revenue in the following year. If the limit had been in terms of what the former Government wanted of work involving $3,000 or more the amount of revenue collected would have been about $17m. As a result of extending the limit to $10,000, the amount will fall to $14m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think, and the Government thinks, that we do not want to use this particular procedure as a means for harassing householders in the way in which the former Government intended. We think that the important objective is to stamp out tax evasion wherever it exists and the amount of $3,000 or $10,000 bears no relationship to whether we collect the $300m which we intend to collect in the forthcoming year. The point is that we are serious about the question of evasion . The former Government was absolutely paralysed in relation to making decisions about this measure because of the emerging controversy and scandal about bottom- of-the-harbour schemes late last year. The former Treasurer delivered us with a completely unsettled, undertermined provision. We have moved to settle those matters and we will be bringing them before the House in order that they may be legislated for in the current session and the tax implemented as from 1 September.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We can expect some intelligent questions from this side of the House. This Government took particular pleasure in the visit of Premier Zhao in 1983 because it marked the end of the first decade of the cordial relations which were established with the People's Republic of China by the Whitlam Labor Government. These were in marked contrast to the relationship between our country and China that marked the previous administration before the Labor Government came to power at that time. It was perfectly appropriate that the Premier of China should pay this country the great credit of being one of the first Western countries to which he paid a visit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Premier's visit was of considerable benefit to the Government and will be of considerable benefit, in the future, to this country. Our talks were wide ranging. In addition to the top-level talks which were held in the Cabinet room, we also had individual discussions between my Ministers and officials and Ministers and officials travelling with the Chinese Premier. Those discussions were very wide ranging. They covered the Chinese Premier's analysis of the global situation, the regional situation and the bilateral relations between our countries. We had the benefit of an exposition by the Chinese Premier of the detailed developments that were taking place in his country which would be of significance to us in terms of developing the already firm bilateral relations</PARA>

I trust that the essentially bipartisan nature of the approach which has marked our relations with China since 1973 in this country will continue and that the attitudes that we expressed and the basis for future co-operation which was firmed up in those discussions will be accepted and acted upon by the Opposition in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AV4">Mr HURFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that one of the many benefits of the National Economic Summit Conference was an initiative taken by the Prime Minister to call together the summiteers, as they are now called, who were interested in and involved with housing. It is true that last Thursday I had the privilege of chairing a mini- summit on housing. I was pleased that the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance were able to be with me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make the point first of all that those present recognised that this was the first occasion, over the last seven or eight years anyway, on which there had been true consultation on housing matters prior to a government making decisions. We need go back only to the 'great' announcements of March 1982 when a housing package was put forward. On that occasion the package was determined by government and the so-called consultation took place as all of the various parts of the great housing industry were called into the Cabinet room and told what the package was.</PARA>
<PARA> In this case the consultation is real. It was most heartening to have the sort of response that there was from bankers, permanent building society chiefs, people in the non-traditional areas of housing finance as well as people from housing industry associations, master builders organisations and the rest. The purpose of the meeting was, as I have indicated already to the House, that we should have the views of all those present as to how we could get the housing industry moving from the woeful levels to which the previous Government had allowed it to sink.</PARA>
<PARA> The expected levels of commencements this year are down to about 106,000, and that is nothing less than appalling. I am glad to say to the honourable member for Petrie and to the House that, arising out of that meeting, I have already been able to put submissions to the Government. I am hopeful that the package will be of great benefit not only to the industry but also to the whole of this country. I hope that the package will be of benefit not only for economic reasons to help the economy to get moving again but also for social reasons because of the importance of housing to the level of our standard of living.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="86" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think honourable members will appreciate that in a sense this question is related to the first question asked today by the Leader of the Opposition. Let me make it clear what the general position of the Government is in regard to wages policy and then, if I may, in that context, answer specifically the question of the honourable member. The position of the Government, in a sense, is very much reflected by statements made by the Leader of the Opposition in another capacity in 1982. I would, in terms of saying exactly what our policy is in answering the honourable member's question, remind you, Mr Speaker, of the statement that was made by the Leader of the Opposition in 1982 on this matter. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unless the Government adopts a coherent wages policy, unless it delivers its promise of tax cuts, unless it develops a working relationship between government, employers and employees in industrial relations, there is little hope that inflation be contained and the condition set for growth in our economy . It is understandable that the employees should seek to maintain their real income after tax.</PARA>
<PARA>The policy of this Government is essentially the same as that expressed by the Leader of the Opposition in that capacity. What we have been about in the prices and incomes accord and in the National Economic Summit Conference is to establish the setting within which this legitimate claim, which the Leader of the Opposition then recognised and which we recognised, has the best chance for success. So what we are aiming to do in conjunction with the trade union movement and with the support of other elements in our society is to get the position where the wage increases that occur through time reflect the capacity of the economy as a whole and where there are not sectional wage increases reflecting some perceived particular capacity in those areas. It is in that sense that we are having discussions now, particularly through the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, with the unions in particular and with the Australian Council of Trade Unions to see that there is adherence to that principle.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe, on the basis of the discussions which are taking place, that there will emerge in the building industry a situation not of a pressing first of all of the claim for the reduction of the working week to 36 hours. I say on behalf of the Government that that claim in the current and immediately foreseeable circumstances is not on. Secondly, I say, in regard to the question of wage movements, that there should be no increases in normal wages in the building sector which go beyond increases which will flow from national wage case decisions. Because of the particular circumstances of the industry and because there could emerge agreement between the employers and the unions in respect of allowances which are specific to that industry and not capable of generation beyond that industry anywhere else, something may occur in the non-wage area.</PARA>
<PARA> I repeat, on behalf of the Government, that in accordance with the prices and incomes accord and the communique of the Summit, which communique reflects that prices and incomes accord, there cannot be in the building industry wage increases relating to the capacity of that industry beyond what may come out later this year in any national wage case decision. That is the clear commitment of this Government, it is the clear commitment of the ACTU and I believe it is what will happen within the building industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I have seen those articles. We have been in communication both with the authors of those articles and with the Queensland Government. We have expressed our concern to the Queensland Government about the substance of the allegations. There has been a series of arguments going on about some of the statistics contained in the articles. Certainly, from our point of view, we have made it clear to the Queensland Government that we do not want to reduce this very important matter to an exercise in arguing about statistics. The fact is that there is an uncommonly high rate of disease and mortality on Queensland reserves. That has to be a matter of concern to all members of this House. It is certainly a matter of concern to the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have indicated to the Queensland Minister that in our view Aboriginal ill health in Queensland is not simply a matter of living conditions; it is related to the whole question of social dispossession and to the breakdown in tribal patterns that has occurred. Of course, that is not just the view of the Government; it is also a view which was put forward in a joint parliamentary committee report which examined the question of Aboriginal health throughout Australia. This situation highlights the need for more concerted action both at State and Federal level. We are providing very significant funds to the Government of Queensland. While we are concerned to co-operate as fully as possible, we will certainly ensure that that Government discharges its responsibilities in respect of its Aboriginal citizens, just as it has to discharge its responsibilities in health to all its citizens.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr Speaker, I wish to make a full report to the House on the National Economic Summit Conference, as foreshadowed by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on 21 April when he tabled documents which had been submitted to the Conference. The National Economic Summit Conference which assembled in this place on 11 April 1983 was, by any standards, a significant and historic event. No such conference of this scale or scope had been attempted before in Australia. It represented a new beginning, a first step towards our great national goals of national reconciliation, national reconstruction and national recovery. It is now possible to reflect thoughtfully on the outcome of the Conference, to identify its key elements and to translate them into an action plan for all of us to follow in working towards recovery. Indeed in the two and a half weeks since its conclusion, important steps have already been taken by the Government and principal participants to ensure that the work of the Conference becomes the basis for continuing and effective processes in the task of national recovery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has already tabled in this House the government documents submitted to the Conference and volume 2-a transcript of Conference proceedings- out of a planned three volume record of Conference documents and proceedings. Volume 1 of this record, a consolidated set of the government papers already tabled in the House, and volume 3, containing submissions to the Conference by other participants and observers, are not yet available but will be tabled shortly. I regret the delay in the availability of the third volume particularly , but would observe that perhaps only the most diligent parliamentarians would by now have fully absorbed the documents tabled already. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, I would like to thank, at the outset, both your predecessor as Speaker of the House of Representatives, Sir Billy Snedden, and the former President of the Senate, Sir Harold Young, for their ready agreement to make Parliament House and its services available for the Summit Conference. I would also like to thank members of parliament for their co-operation in assisting delegates to the Conference with office and other facilities, and for their forbearance in suffering any inconvenience caused. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the main business of this statement. We called the Summit Conference because Australia is facing its gravest economic and social crisis in 50 years. In the words of the Summit communique:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian economy is in deep recession. Economic activity and employment are continuing to fall and unemployment is still rising. Profits are depressed, and wage earners have had to accept deferral of improvements and maintenance of living standards. Inflation and interest rates remain high. There are signs of improvement in the world economy and of an end to the drought in the eastern States. There is wide agreement, however, that sustained economic recovery and significant inroads into the unacceptably high level of unemployment will require a steady improvement in business and consumer confidence and more effective processes of income determination. There is also wide recognition that Australia's economic problems are deep-seated and not amenable to rapid solution . </PARA>
<PARA>The call for a National Economic Summit Conference came from many sections of the community and, most importantly, had the clear endorsement of the Australian people at the 1983 Federal elections. The Conference has been a long time in its genesis. Well before the recent election campaign I had advocated such a meeting . I would remind the House that, even before the election was called, I had had this to say on 30 January of this year:</PARA>
<PARA> We will convene a National Summit Conference with representatives from the employers, the A.C.T.U. and the State Governments . . . to expose all of us together, to the realities of what is happening in the domestic and international economic scene and the problems, dangers, opportunities and challenges of what is involved in those developments. </PARA>
<PARA>At that stage, the envisaged purpose was to:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . attempt to analyse the reciprocal implications of movements in wages, profits, patterns of work and individual reconstruction. This Conference-</PARA>
<PARA>As I said then-</PARA>
<PARA>would clearly occupy several days and provision would be made for an early follow-up if the parties considered it desirable . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The concept and procedures I outlined at that time, and in more detail in the course of the recent election campaign, were faithfully followed in arrangements for the Conference. The Government made every effort to ensure that those invited were as fully representative as possible of Australian industry, the Australian work force and the Australian people through their elected governments. The letters of invitation were sent immediately the Government was formally sworn in on 11 March of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The 100 participants who accepted my invitation included representatives of all State governments and of the local government sector. The union movement was represented by the full Australian Council of Trade Unions Executive. Business was represented through two avenues: Through the representative business organisations the whole structure of business, large and small, was covered; and in addition, many individual businessmen from some of the largest individual enterprises were invited. The Australian Council of Social Services was invited as the major umbrella organisation in the social welfare sector. In addition, the Government recognised that community organisations had a valid role to play in the process and 18 such organisations were invited to send observers. </PARA>
<PARA> Understandably perhaps, some fears were raised that the Conference could not succeed and that it might simply become a forum for partisan position taking and disputation. There were some, perhaps, who thought that the spirit of conflict and confrontation has become irrevocably entrenched in this country. But the Conference was never envisaged in any way as a point-scoring exercise, let alone a partisan political affair, nor did it turn out to be. That it did not is a high tribute indeed to the responsibility shown by all participants. </PARA>
<PARA> In seeking consensus on Australia's economic and social problems from the Conference, the participants were not intent on simply settling for the lowest common denominator, the bare minimum of agreement on an approach to a solution to the current crises. Throughout, the proceedings were marked by a combination of responsibility and realism, practical commonsense, and a sense of common interests. All participants agreed that every section of the community, excepting only the impoverished, should share the burden of restraint. Further evidence of the constructive spirit in which the Conference was approached by all can be found in the proceedings and in the many worthwhile results that emerged, particularly through the Summit communique. </PARA>
<PARA> I must stress that never at any stage did we of the Government regard the Conference and its outcome as some means of shirking, or shedding the responsibilities of governments, and particularly the national government, to take decisions. We recognise and reaffirm that we, as the elected representatives of the people of Australia, have the primary and fundamental responsibility for the economic and social policies of this nation. But as I said in my closing address to the Conference, effective policy cannot be made in a vacuum. The Conference made a very substantial contribution to filling that vacuum, to bringing out clearly the economic and social realities which must form the context for government decisions. We are now all better equipped, and all have a clearer perception of the prospects, possibilities and plain hard work that lies ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> In the deepest sense, the Conference was a key step in bringing Australia together. I deeply believe-and I am now doubly reassured that the overwhelming majority of the Australian people believe this also-that Australia can no longer afford to go down the path of confrontation which characterised much of the past decade. What we sought was genuine consensus on the path forward towards national reconciliation, recovery and reconstruction, and the co-operation of all in setting the nation upon that forward path. </PARA>
<PARA> Specifically, we set the following objectives for the Conference. They were: To secure broad agreement on the role of an incomes and prices policy, in our efforts to promote employment and to achieve recovery and growth; and to ensure that the benefits of recovery are not lost in another round of the wages-prices spiral; to devise machinery for achieving the necessary restraint, including methods of wage fixation, influencing non-wage incomes, and price surveillance; to secure a better and wider understanding of the broad economic framework, within which we have to operate; to seek broad agreement on the relationship between a successful prices and incomes policy and the implementation of policies on industrial relations, job creation and training, taxation, social security, health, education and the other major community services; to examine the competitiveness and efficiency of the Australian economy; and, finally, to reach agreement on arrangements and machinery to monitor and continue the work of this Conference, especially in regard to continuing the process of consultation and co-operation between government, business and unions, initiated by this Conference itself. The objectives and the problems addressed by the Conference are encapsulated in the question of unemployment and the restoration of sustained economic growth which avoids a new bout of destructive inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> As all honourable members know, the Conference ran from Monday, 11 April, to Thursday, 14 April. It was well reported in the media, giving many in the community the opportunity to read, view or listen in, and to discuss amongst themselves the important issues raised here. The sharing and acquiring of knowledge and information which was an essential feature of the Conference itself was extended, in a very real sense, to the community at large. This process of information-sharing is one to which my Government is committed in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, perhaps the most satisfying feature of the Conference from the Government's point of view was the outstanding spirit of co-operation, frankness and willingness to respect the integrity of differing points of view that prevailed throughout. In particular, there was a willingness on the part of all participants to acknowledge that we all bear some responsibility for our current economic malaise and that all have a part to play in overcoming our current difficulties. I believe this augurs well for the implementation of a successful and effective prices and incomes policy, which is a cornerstone for our strategy for economic recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the more specific achievements of the Conference. At the broad level, I think there were three of about equal importance:</PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, the degree of common understanding reached on the nature and source of Australia's economic problems-an achievement due in no small measure to the frank and detailed information and analysis put before the Conference by the Government and by many of the participants and observers themselves;</PARA>
<PARA> secondly, the degree of consensus reached-as expressed in the communique-on the basic framework and approach required to begin to arrest the decline in our economy, to arrest the expansion in unemployment levels, and, in an ongoing sense, to put our economy on a path of sustained non-inflationary growth; and</PARA>
<PARA> thirdly, the recognition on all sides that the consensus reached at the Conference is only the first step and commitments have been given, again on all sides, to translate that consensus into effective action. </PARA>
<PARA> The main specific conclusions of the Summit are set out in the communique which was tabled earlier in the House along with other documents submitted to or emerging from the Summit Conference. The communique was virtually unanimously adopted; only the Government of Queensland, from the multitude of participants, formally reserved its position, though even the Queensland Premier by no means rejected entirely its main thrust and conclusions. Naturally not every conclusion and every piece of information shared in the Conference could find expression in such a document. What it had to cover was the principal message of the Summit, the main points of the framework within which we must all now follow up in setting about tackling the serious economic problems facing this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like now to point out to honourable members some of the more significant points made in the communique. I will necessarily be selective, but would commend the document as a whole for close study by every member of the Parliament and indeed by every Australian who is interested in this nation's welfare. The key elements of the communique, as I see them, are:</PARA>
<PARA> First, in paragraphs 2 to 5, recognition of the nature and sources of the serious economic problems facing the Australian economy, the need for a co- operative and innovative response to those problems, and, particularly, the recognition that to achieve recovery will require restraint in expectations and claims from all sections of the community except the impoverished;</PARA>
<PARA> second, in paragraph 12, recognition of the importance of tackling the problems of unemployment and inflation simultaneously, and that an effective incomes and prices policy is essential if an expansionary fiscal policy is to be pursued without adverse consequences for inflation;</PARA>
<PARA> third, in paragraph 18, recognition by the trade union movement that the maintenance of real wages will be an objective over time, during a period of economic crisis;</PARA>
<PARA> fourth, in paragraph 20, consensus on a return to a centralised approach to wage fixation and recognition that a suppresson of sectional claims is essential except in special or extraordinary circumstances;</PARA>
<PARA> fifth, in paragraph 26, recognition that the Government has a mandate to establish a price surveillance mechanism and agreement on an examination into the most appropriate form of functioning of this mechanism;</PARA>
<PARA> sixth, in paragraphs 24 to 28, agreement that if restraint is to be exercised then such restraint should be exercised universally, including in respect of dividends and non-wage incomes;</PARA>
<PARA> seventh, in paragraph 31, acknowledgment that increased aggregate public expenditure may require increases in taxation or less than full tax indexation. </PARA>
<PARA> eighth, in paragraph 33, recognition that priority in the social security area should be on real improvement in entitlements to those in genuine need;</PARA>
<PARA> ninth, in paragraph 34 acknowledgment that, in the next session of Parliament, the Government would introduce a Bill abolishing the Industrial Relations Bureau and facilitating the amalgamation of unions;</PARA>
<PARA> tenth, in paragraphs 43 and 44, agreement that the basic rights of women should be recognised and protected and on the need for imaginative policies to assist young people severely affected by the recession;</PARA>
<PARA> eleventh, in paragraph 48, recognition of the importance of stable health policies and reaffirmation by unions that they will accept an offset in wage increases on account of the introduction of the Government's proposed health insurance scheme;</PARA>
<PARA> twelfth, in paragraphs 50 and 52, stress on the importance of continuing the sharing of information to aid understanding of Australia's economic problems;</PARA>
<PARA> thirteenth, in paragraph 53, general agreement that a small independent representative Economic Planning Advisory Council-EPAC-should be established to continue the process of consultation begun at the Conference; and</PARA>
<PARA> finally, in paragraph 54, expression of hope that the Summit marks the beginning of consensus, not the end, recognition of the enormous amount of work that still remains to be done and commitment to that task. </PARA>
<PARA> All in the community have a part to play. For its part the Government has already taken a number of concrete steps to follow up the success of the Summit Conference by setting off firmly on the path to recovery to which the Summit pointed. The representative working party foreshadowed in the summit communique has already met under the chairmanship of my colleague the Treasurer, and has made substantial progress in mapping out the most appropriate form and functioning of the proposed Economic Planning Advisory Council and Prices Surveillance Authority. The Government intends to introduce legislation to establish the Economic Planning Advisory Council in this parliamentary session. Work towards that has taken precedence over work to establish the Prices Surveillance Authority, but the Government intends to introduce legislation to establish the latter in the Budget session. The Government is also moving to establish a tripartite advisory committee on the prices and incomes policy. Central to the conclusions of the Summit was the recognition that the degree of restraint exercised in expectations and claims is absolutely vital to Australia' s prospects of recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as wages are concerned, the Government will participate in the conference on wage fixation scheduled to be held in the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. We will base our approach to that Conference on the conclusions of the Summit and on the prices and incomes accord. In that context, I would point out again that all at the Summit agreed that if a centralised system of wage fixing is to work, there must be an abstention from sectional claims except in special and extraordinary circumstances. Let me say that my Government's interpretation of what constitutes such circumstances is the common -sense interpretation and leaves no room for selfish claims from maverick sections of the trade union movement. Participants at the Summit Conference recognised that if restraint in incomes is to be exercised, then it should be exercised universally. In that spirit of equitable sharing of the burdens of recovery the Summit also stressed the need for restraint in non-wage incomes such as dividends, professional fees and the like. </PARA>
<PARA> I have written to the chief executives of larger public companies and through the media have addressed the boards of all public companies in Australia seeking their co-operation in exercising restraint in dividends and non-wage incomes, such as directors' fees, over which they have an influence. It is important that such incomes do not increase faster than movements in wages. My colleague the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Willis) has also written to major national organisations representing non-wage income earners drawing their attention to the Summit outcome and seeking their support in achieving income restraint in their areas. The Minister will also be writing to the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission drawing attention to the Summit communique in regard to non-wage incomes, and seeking his support in having fees voluntarily reviewed by Commission members.</PARA>
<PARA> There was widespread opinion at the Summit that strong expansion of housing construction from recent depressed levels must be an important part of any general economic recovery. My colleague the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Hurford), last Thursday in Sydney, chaired a post-Summit meeting of building unions and firms involved in housing finance, construction, trade and materials supply. The Treasurer and the Minister for Finance (Mr Dawkins) also participated in the meeting. The Summit and the post-Summit meeting both contributed substantially to the ideas that are being developed within government to ensure that housing construction returns to its proper role in the Australian economy. The details of a new housing policy package will be announced soon. In this context honourable members will be aware that there will be a special statement of economic measures later this month, announcing a package of relevant economic fiscal measures. These measures will follow up the Summit and build on the new spirit of confidence already evident in the economy since the Summit. Some major elements of the Government's recovery program will be announced, aiming to get the economy moving and to create jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Summit was a first step. By itself it has already helped to restore confidence, and in that way helped in getting a recovery under way. But its real contribution over the period ahead will fall far short of what is required unless it is effectively and consistently followed up. There is a responsibility on every member of the Parliament and every member of the community to see that the opportunity opened up by the success of the Summit is not frittered away. The spirit of shared sacrifice and restraint and the determination to take the steps needed to achieve recovery must be carried into effect in all areas: In wages and industrial relations; in the policies of business throughout the economy; and through the policies of government. I commend this vital national enterprise to each honourable member and the nation we represent. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Conference did more than establish the basis for confidence in the recovery of the economy. I believe it helped-as a first step-to restore confidence in ourselves as a people and as a nation, confidence that we can talk together and work together, that we can co-operate to seek solutions for our common problems, in the knowledge that what unites us is infinitely more important and enduring than the things that divide us. The revival of that sort of confidence in ourselves is essential if we are to overcome our present grave economic problems. But even beyond these problems, this new spirit of confidence and co-operation, if it can grow and strengthen, can be made an enduring basis for an even better and stronger future for all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that all Australians have recognised that the National Economic Summit Conference was a valuable opportunity for Government Ministers, trade union leaders and the leaders of industry to exchange views, and I am certain that all participants found that that aspect of the Summit was of great value. I also acknowledge the many thoughtful, pertinent and useful contributions made at the Summit by a number of participants; in particular, some of the employers. It was unfortunate that the tone and substance of many of these contributions were not reflected in the final communique.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia's fundamental economic and social problem is unemployment. It is a problem tearing at the very fabric of our society. One of the most substantial achievements of the National Economic Summit was its recognition of that reality and the truism that one man's or one woman's pay rise is another person's job. Not only did the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the employers recognise the crisis of unemployment but it was given the highest priority in the rhetoric of both the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the New South Wales Premier. Mr Wran said there were only three issues at the Summit-jobs, jobs, jobs. The Prime Minister highlighted what I have always regarded as the degrading and demoralising effect of unemployment, and he told the Summit:</PARA>
<PARA> The raw statistics do not show what unemployment means in terms of the loss of human dignity and self-respect, what it means in terms of the break-up of families and the social alienation of one-third of the best and brightest generation we have ever produced, what it means in terms of the defeat of human hope and the crushing of the human spirit. </PARA>
<PARA>I could not agree more with these sentiments. But are these words matched by Government actions which demonstrate a genuine concern and genuine compassion for the unemployed? The fact is they are not. If they were, the Government would have placed before the Australian people a program which maximises the prospects for a sustained reduction in unemployment. I challenge it to place such a program before this Parliament. It is clear that the Government has not given the problem of unemployment its highest priority after all. Its words at the Summit were like the sound of the orchestra on the deck of the Titanic-sweet to hear, good for morale but of no practical significance whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's own Summit figures show that the quickest and surest way to reduce unemployment is, first, to extend the wages pause at least into 1984 and, secondly, to relate future wage increases to the capacity of the economy to pay. Even the New South Wales Premier, the Government's pseudo-Whip at the Summit, supported capacity to pay as the major criterion for wage levels. That policy would help make Australian industries competitive again. Had reducing unemployment been the Government's highest priority, the Government would have argued for the maintenance of the wage pause and it would have continued the wage pause at least until 1984. But we now know that, for the Government, a deal with the unions has a higher priority than a deal with the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth reflecting on the reasons that have been put forward for not adopting a responsible wages policy. It was said by the ACTU leaders that an extension of the wages pause was 'unrealistic'; that it was likely to lead to industrial disputation. I have a great deal of faith in the Australian workers. They have shown time and time again that when given an honest, frank and complete picture they are willing to make considerable sacrifices in the interests of their fellow workers. They have on occasions taken pay cuts and worked a four-day week rather than see their fellow workers lose their jobs, and the vast majority of Australian workers embraced the wages pause. They knew the pause would not only help them stay in work but also help the unemployed get jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has had a unique opportunity to put to Australian workers the undeniable truth that, according to the Government's own calculations, an extension of the wages pause and part indexation in 1984 would bring down unemployment to 8.7 per cent in 1985-86. That would have been the caring, compassionate thing to do, but of course that would have required leadership and this Government would not do it. Instead, it chooses to pay its political debt to the ACTU. Instead, it chooses to condemn over 100,000 more Australian workers to the dole queue, to demoralising inactivity. Unemployment is not just a statistic, not just an exercise in semantics, it is harming people-people with families, with hopes and with the will to work. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only has the Government apparently waved the white flag to the ACTU now the Summit is over; it has allowed the ACTU to take the initiative in the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. This is not just incompassionate and insensitive; it is plainly inept. The Prime Minister has acted more like a barometer than a leader. He has a habit of saying one thing and doing another, increasingly looking like a misleading practitioner of mellowspeak. The Government's idea of consensus it to compromise with the ACTU. The price of that compromise is the jobs of hundreds of thousands of Australians, and the Opposition will not support that kind of compromise. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is not advocating a responsible, realistic wages policy because it wants to make things harder for the working man and his family. We appreciate that with current levels of inflation it is difficult to make ends meet on average weekly earnings and we know that more than half the work force earn less than that, but it is a great deal more difficult for those whose only income is the dole. For the Opposition, if not for the Government, they are of the highest priority. Let this Government match its rhetoric with action; let the Government show it really does care; let this Government bring into this House a sensitive, responsible wage policy. What is so ironical about the new Government's wages policy is that it represents the abandonment of consensus, not its creation. All eight Australian governments recognised the need for a wages pause. Every government in this country and the vast majority of Australians, including the trade unionists, knew that the wage pause was the only way to put Australians back to work. Now the pause and that historic consensus have been destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA> The country will judge this Government not by how it talks about compassion but by how often it demonstrates it. When will the Government shift the focus from politics to policies? It plays with semantics and Australian lives. A 'deficit of despair' suddenly becomes a 'deficit of hope'. The shift from rhetoric to reality seems just too tough for this Government. It was not surprising that the Government disregarded the interests of the unemployed at the Summit. After all, the unemployed were not at the Summit. The representative of the Australian Council of Social Service said:</PARA>
<PARA> The interests of all Australians cannot be represented by unions, business or government. We are concerned that ACOSS is the only voice here for the unemployed and the three million people receiving a pension or a benefit. Many other disadvantaged and alienated sections of the community feel locked out and unable to contribute to these discussions about their future. </PARA>
<PARA>ACOSS said that because it was a Summit dominated by big business, big unions and big governments. It is not just the Opposition which has said that; others have said it as well. It is summed up in those words of ACOSS. It was a Summit where the strong, the powerful, closeted together to plot the future of Australians. Big business, big unions and big governments are not the Australian community. The community consists largely of small businesses, farmers and unorganised groups without a power base-people such as the young, the aged, the unemployed and women. These are the very people who are vulnerable to the whims and the decisions of unions, of government and of big business. Who was at the Summit to represent pensioners when means testing of their hard earned pensions was discussed? Who was at the Summit to represent those affected by the Government's flirtation with high tax on lump sum superannuation payments? Who was at the Summit to defend the right of mothers to the family allowance introduced by the Liberal-National Party Government?</PARA>
<PARA> Remember that this unelected, unrepresentative Summit was supposed to be deciding what the future level of unemployment in Australia would be. In fact it aimed at deciding whether the unemployed and future school leavers could look forward even to having a chance of getting jobs. Yet the very people most severely affected by unemployment-the young and women-were not even directly represented. Today the Prime Minister has painted a glowing picture of the consensus in the communique. However, the real test is whether the unions, the Government and employers live up to their commitments, general as they are, or whether in fact they understand the commitments in the first place. For example, the crux of the communique is the commitment to wage restraint. The communique states:</PARA>
<PARA> The trade union movement also recognises that while the maintenance of real wages is a key objective, in a period of economic crisis, as now applying, it will be an objective over time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Confederation of Australian Industry interprets this to mean that there will be no catch-up of consumer price index increases during the wage pause. The ACTU interprets it to mean that the catch-up will definitely occur. Again, the CAI interprets it to mean that future wage setting will be based on capacity to pay. The ACTU now interprets it to mean increases in line with the CPI. This is despite Mr Kelty's having said at the Summit:</PARA>
<PARA> The catch-up and continued maintenance of real wages is an objective over time.</PARA>
<PARA>It is small wonder that the average Australian is confused about the Summit. A further example is the statement in the communique that centralised wage fixing requires a suppression of sectional claims except in special or extraordinary circumstances proved before the centralised wage fixing authority. Does this not suggest that the current campaign outside the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission by building workers for higher wages and shorter hours breaches the communique? But no, we find that the ACTU fully supports the campaign. Another example of a failure to understand the communique was a statement made recently by Mr Ivan Hodgson of the Transport Workers Union. Mr Hodgson's words were:</PARA>
<PARA> I don't recall agreeing to wage restraint at the Summit. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to describe the Summit as 'a public relations exercise'. They are not my words, but Mr Hodgson's words. Insipid as the communique may be, I hope not all Summit participants will interpret it as Mr Hodgson has. I hope it has some meaning because without any wage restraint the fight against unemployment is lost. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one further disturbing feature of the Summit to which I wish to refer. In his election policy speech, the Prime Minister promised 'immediate reductions in income tax for almost six million Australian taxpayers'. He spoke of 'a major concession to the small businesses of this nation'. The Labor Government was given a mandate by the Australian public to grant those tax cuts. Most Australians will be horrified now to see the Government using the Summit to abandon its promise. In other words, this Government has used the Summit to get a so-called fresh mandate, a mandate to increase taxes and it thereby regards the mandate of the Summit-a mandate of big unions, big business and big government-as more relevant than the mandate given by the Australian people. That challenges the whole basis of democracy. I am sure that Australians will remember for many years the Prime Minister's words in his policy speech when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I offer no fistful of dollars to be snatched back after the election. </PARA>
<PARA>They are not my words but the words of the Prime Minister. I hope that, if there are future summits, the Government will never again use them in such a cynical and arrogant way. The Summit communique is replete with platitudes about the economy but what Australians are now looking for is substance. This afternoon the Prime Minister has revealed what the Government will do as a result of the Summit. In his speech this afternoon he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has already taken a number of concrete steps to follow up the success of the Summit Conference by setting off firmly on the path to recovery to which the Summit pointed. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at the concrete steps which are taking us so firmly down the path to recovery. They consist of the following: First, the working party foreshadowed in the Summit has had a meeting and the Government is going to establish another body, an advisory council. Second, the Government is to establish yet another body, a tripartite advisory committee. Third-these are the concrete steps-the Government has indicated that it will say something to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission at some stage. Fourth, the Prime Minister has written letters to the chief representatives of large companies. Fifth, the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Willis) has also written a letter, this time to representatives of non-wage income earners. Sixth, the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Hurford) has had another meeting at which the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Dawkins) were also present. Seventh, there will be some sort of statement later this month on some economic measures. For goodness sake, by no stretch of the imagination could these eight measures be called 'concrete steps', setting us off firmly on the path to recovery. Rather, they represent inept and irrelevant shufflings of an indecisive and to date directionless government. </PARA>
<PARA> In making these remarks I do not wish to be confrontationist, to be partisan or to play party politics. That may be the way the Prime Minister characterises my remarks, just as he did when we on this side of the House did not agree with everything that was laid down by Labor spokesmen at the Constitutional Convention. We should bear in mind that the only people who voted en bloc on every item-on every resolution-at that Constitutional Convention were those in the Labor Party. Who played party politics? The Labor Party did. Let me make it clear on behalf of the Opposition that we do not regard this country as a one- party state; nor is it a corporate state, so fashionable in the 1930s, run by big bureaucracies for big business and big unions. This is still a democracy and we still have every right-indeed a duty-to put our views just as vigorously as the Prime Minister and the Summit participants put theirs. We still have a right to be heard expressing our views in the best interests of the Australian people and, above all, we retain the right to speak for those many millions of Australians who were unrepresented at the Summit. </PARA>
<PARA> We intend to scrutinise closely all of the Government's policy proposals. Indeed, it is clearly in the national interest that we should do so. Where the Government is right, I will not hesitate to say so and neither will my colleagues. Equally, we will not hesitate to criticise the Government firmly and loudly where its policies are not soundly based. It would appear to me, in the early stages of this Government, that to this Prime Minister consensus apparently means uncritical docility, and that we will never accept, that we can never accept. This country does not need, as the Prime Minister seems to need, this side of the House to be a cowering clone of the Government. This Government pitched expectations very high indeed. Through its rhetoric at the Summit and during the election campaign, it raised the hopes of Australians for a quick return to better times and it is with a great deal of regret that I conclude by saying that there was little in the Summit communique, or indeed since, which leads me to believe that these hopes and aspirations will be realised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) and his crocodile tears for the unemployed. It is a pity he has not been crying for some years because in February 1976 5.4 per cent of the work force was unemployed. In February 1983 that figure had grown to 10.7 per cent. A lot he did about unemployment when he was a member of a Cabinet presiding over Australia's fortunes and the fortunes of those in and out of work in those six to seven years. Now he comes into this chamber and talks about the performance of this Government, which has been in office for only a few weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the miserable, pathetic level of economic growth that the so- called economic managers on the other side of the Parliament were able to produce. There was a growth of 1.6 per cent in gross domestic product for the period of six years up till 1983. We have seen that simply to hold the line of unemployment we must have a growth rate of something like 3.5 per cent. I think the question that the Opposition should first ask itself is who does it think it represents? I can assure the Opposition that it did not represent the people at the National Economic Summit Conference. The business people at the Summit seemed to have no truck with the Opposition and no interest in it because business people realise that the Opposition is incompetent and that it has failed. I recommend to the Opposition that it sticks with the rhetoric of looking for the best interests of the nation. I consider the Summit the most important meeting that I have witnessed in my political career. People interested in the national welfare of Australia came together to look at the problems, to talk about them, to analyse them and to do something about them in a spirit of co-operation. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the Opposition should not talk to us about a wages policy. The Opposition has never had a wages policy. It destroyed the only wages policy we had, which kept wages at least near the inflation rate and below it in the period up to 1980. The Opposition went for a decentralised basis of wage fixation. Then it talked up, for its own political ends for the 1980 election, the so-called resources boom which spawned inordinately high wage increases of 1980 and 1981 and which led to a surge in inflation and ultimately, in part, to unemployment. That is the Opposition's record on wages policy. It has never had a wages policy. The Opposition should not come into this House suggesting that it may have had a wages policy if it had been returned to power. </PARA>
<PARA> I will tell honourable members what would have happened if the Opposition had been returned to power. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), the former Treasurer, made it clear a couple of weeks ago. It would have introduced a highly contractionary Budget. It would have tightened down the monetary aggregates and it would have tried to do the same old tired number that it has tried so many times before, that is, to deal with inflation first. That would have been the cry. The Opposition would have said that we could have a non- inflationary recovery, that unemployment and inflation could not be dealt with at the same time and that inflation would need to be dealt with first. We would have seen all the old Fraser rehetoric and all the old boring tory shibboleth brought out again to drag down inflation, and we would have been back to contractionary Budgets and high interest rates and waiting for the day for the much vaunted non-inflationary recovery. This nation has waited and this nation has got very tired of waiting, and it put the Opposition on the other side of the Parliament where it belongs. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us make this clear. The Opposition has never had any possibility of talking to organised labour in Australia. It has not even talked to business, it turns out. The Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Hurford) made the point by way of interjection to the Leader of the Opposition when he, not so eloquently, attacked the prospect of both myself and the Minister for Finance (Mr Dawkins) being at a meeting of the housing industry. Let me tell honourable members that at least an accolade was paid to us at the meeting of the housing industry representatives. They said: 'This is the first such meeting where we have had a meeting with Government before something was decided.' The Opposition takes the view that business has nowhere to go but to it. I can assure Opposition members that business is not turning to it now and will not in the foreseeable future and labour, of course, would never have anything to do with the Opposition. Labour would not have a bar of the Opposition because of the policies it pursued . </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make this clear. We have turned our backs upon the failed strategy of inflation first and we believe that the only way to approach the economy is on the basis of dealing with both inflation and growth and therefore unemployment simultaneously. We not only believe that; the Summit communique also expressed it. It was expressed very eloquently by the late Sir Keith Campbell, who made it very clear that companies were watching their businesses and the lives of their employees being destroyed while the Opposition fiddled around with its monetary aggregates, believing that it could actually stay closeted up in this building and pull some sort of monetary lever and push some sort of fiscal lever and then , somehow, all of the problems of income determination would simply be solved outside. They were never solved outside in that way and they will never be solved in that way, as honourable members well know, and we simply have to get down to talk about the way in which income shares are determined in this country . That is what the Summit process was about. We got a very generous response about restraint in respect of prices and incomes. Business representatives volunteered restraint upon dividends and directors fees and in fact in the area of non-wage incomes. I refer also to what the Australian Council of Trade Unions said concerning the catch-up matter which the Leader of the Opposition mentioned . That is the sort of response which was engendered by the Summit Conference. I go back to some words of the Leader of the Opposition on 29 January 1982. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> We must re-establish a feeling of trust and a good working relationship between the Government, employers and unions, so that the conciliation and arbitration process is the foundation of our industrial relations, and not confrontation. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask him where is that view, then expressed, at difference with what this Government did in the Summit process? In the same speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Unless the Government adopts a coherent wages policy, unless it delivers its promised tax cuts, unless it develops a working relationship between government, employers and employees in industrial relations, there is little hope that inflation will be contained and the conditions set for growth in our economy. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, what he was implying was that the Government to which he belonged less than a year ago had an incoherent wages policy, which of course it did. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> That policy must contain a procedure to guarantee orderly wage adjustments. There are major pressures on Australia's economy and if we have no national wages policy and inneffectual communication between the Government and the trade union movement we will have problems in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>I see that very much at difference with the sorts of noises coming from the Leader of the Opposition today. I would have thought that those expressions of opinion when he was out there in the boondocks of the back bench trying to be heard, trying to say something relevent and useful for a change, were very much in accord with the sorts of reasons why the Government set up the National Economic Summit Conference and why, in the process of the Conference, we saw the spirit of co-operation engendered therein. I think it is fair to say, and I do not think I am overdoing it in saying so, that as a result of that Conference a feeling of confidence has swept this country through the areas of business and organised labour which I think provides the basis for a national recovery provided it is backed up with sensible government approaches to the problems and sensible economic policy. To return to the wasteland of inflation first and not to deal with inflation in the process of dealing with employment at the same time is, of course, the cruelest policy which can apply to those hundreds of thousands of Australians who have borne the brunt of the failure of coalition policies for years and years. We reject those policies. It is now, of course, a matter of record that the participants at the Summit Conference reject them as well. </PARA>
<PARA> I make it clear that we saw at the Economic Summit representatives of major companies, the AMP Society, the banks, the major industrial companies and the major mining companies. When has the Opposition ever been able to assemble a group like that which took it seriously. It never has because it was never interested to ask their views and never interested to achieve a co-operative result in terms of the management of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> We have turned our back on the Opposition's policies. We embrace the policies of expansion which are, at the same time consistent with our inflation objectives and to achieve, over time, an improvement in the problem of unemployment, to see a restoration of growth and to get back to dealing with the root core problems in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the major objective of the Summit was to establish a common understanding on the part of labour and of governments as to the nature and extent of those problems. The documents prepared for the Conference provide an unprecedented amount of information. Again, I hasten to add that never before has any government taken the Australian public into its confidence by revealing as much public documentation or as much information as we did to give all and sundry an idea of the state of current economic conditions. Interested people, businessmen, representatives of labour and academics were, for the first time, given information which previously had been kept private. These papers are publicly available. </PARA>
<PARA> The full proceedings of the Conference will be published shortly. I will also be making a detailed statement on the economy in late May. There is no point in the Leader of the Opposition again trafficking in derisory comments about the Economic Planning Advisory Council, the Prices Surveillance Authority and the meeting with the housing industry because these were the ongoing commitments which the Government made at the Summit to see that the Summit process did not die with the ending of the Summit. It was a commitment of the Summit to establish an Economic Planning Advisory Council so that this Government could sit down with the States, with business, with labour and with other bodies such as the Australian Council of Social Service and in these high level discussions look at the broad parameters of problems, be in a constant and useful advisory role and, over time, look at the establishment of growth targets for the economy and take an active part in the development of economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, that is a totally strange concept to the coalition which had a business advisory council made up of its friends. It would ring it from time to time to get confirmatory advice of what it was doing. This is a totally different approach. The commitment in relation to the Economic Planning Advisory Council and other commitments which were given at the Summit to which the Leader of the Opposition referred have been continued and will be continued in the spirit of the Summit. I will introduce a statement on economic measures in late May which will give early effect to the Government's election commitments and to those commitments expressed at the Economic Summit. Again I dismiss, as I can, out of hand the foolish comments of the Leader of the Opposition in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the Conference succeeded in getting very substantial agreement on the nature and extent of our current economic problems. It recognised that economic activity and the level of employment are continuing to fall and unemployment is rising; profits are depressed; wage earners have had to accept deferral of improvements and maintenance of living standards; inflation and interest rates remain high, and there are tentative signs of improvements in the world economy which is now strengthening. I believe that the modelling process- the scenarios-which the Government provided to the Summit indicates that, over a three-year period which was the study period there will be a substantial growth in employment and that the Government's stated objectives throughout the election of creating half a million jobs will be met. I reject out of hand the derisory comments of the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suggest that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) go back to getting the Department of the Treasury to write his speeches. After that pathetic, unrehearsed and almost incoherent defence of the Government's grasping for an economic policy at the present time, I think all of us hope that he might at least go back to getting some professional advice on how to present arguments . I believe that the one great legacy-I use that word quite deliberately because I think it is-of the National Economic Summit Conference is that perhaps more conclusively than any other event or any other bringing together of a group of people it has focused the attention of the Australian people on the central economic problem of our time, that is, the link between excessive wage rises, unemployment and inflation. To that extent, all of us should be indebted to the Government, to the trade union movement and to the business people who attended the Summit because I think, better than anybody has been able to achieve before, that meeting focused the public's attention. I think that is something that we ought to be grateful for. That is a great legacy of the Summit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The great tragedy of the Summit is that the Government has not heeded the lesson from the meeting. It brought those people together. Information was provided. That and the sheer logic of argument resulted in the realisation that so many of the things that had been said by the former Government about wages, and which were derided by the likes of the Treasurer when he was in Opposition, were after all true. Despite the public recognition of that fact, the Government is not following the logic of what was so clearly revealed at the Summit. That is the great tragedy. Having brought these people together and having brought about this realisation, the Government is not following up the sorts of policies that are required to check an inevitable further growth in the number of unemployed in Australia over the next 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has welcomed a number of aspects of the Economic Summit. Despite the wordy protestations of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Opposition wished the Economic Summit well. Most of the people who went to that Economic Summit, whether they came from the trade union movement or whether they came from the business community, attended with the wish to do a good job for Australia. I belive that many of them, when their comments are analysed, gave a very, very remarkable contribution to a discussion of a very, very serious economic and social problem. I think the Government was very wise to broadcast the proceedings. I agree with the Prime Minister that more frequent televising of these proceedings is desirable. I welcome the provision of so much information. I think the former Government perhaps could have provided more information in some of these economic areas. I have said that before and I do not mind repeating it in this debate. But, more than anything else about the Summit, of course I welcome the way in which the Government embraced so many hitherto elusive economic realities. I remember debate after debate about the economy when I sat on the other side of this place last year. The Treasurer and the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Willis), as they now are, came in here and said: 'Well, it really has nothing at all to do with the state of the world economy. It has all to do with your inadequate domestic economic policies'. Yet I sat and listened to the Treasurer say at the Economic Summit that the most important thing we have to understand is that the main reason for our economic difficulties at the present moment is the impact of the world recession on the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA> Then we had to hear from the Treasurer and we had to read from the three economic scenarios that were presented by the Government to the Economic Summit one undeniable fact. It stood out in every presentation, it stood out in every analysis and it came out in every speech. I believe that it was most eloquently expressed by the person referred to by the Treasurer, and that was the late Sir Keith Campbell. I acknowledge that he did say certain things about the need to fight unemployment and to fight inflation at the same time. I do not wish to have an argument with the Treasurer on the issue of words of a deceased person, but let us remind ourselves of some other things Sir Keith said. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer presented, in his expose, three economic scenarios. He warned us correctly of the deficiency in econometric models and asked us to concentrate on the broad messages. The broad but very clear messages were: The longer the wage pause the lower the wage adjustments, the lower the rate of inflation, the higher the rate of growth and the lower the rate of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>They were the words of Sir Keith Campbell at the Economic Summit. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> For the jobless and I suggest for the whole economy, scenario C--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the wage pause scenario, the much derided wage pause scenario-</PARA>
<PARA>Offers the most hope. But it still predicts, its deficiencies accepted, an unemployment rate on average in 1985-86, little different to that in 1982-83. Surely that is not good enough. If we genuinely care about the jobless and genuinely wish to incur discipline and sacrifice, we need to put together a scenario D. Unless the broad messages from the scenarios are meaningless we must clearly extend the wage pause to the end of 1983, we should clearly agree that there should be no catch-up at that date and we should agree further to review, on behalf of the employed and the unemployed, this vital community matter during the first quarter of 1984 having regard to our then progress and circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>I am happy to rest my argument today on those words of a distinguished Australian who was prepared in a totally unselfish manner to serve governments of different political persuasions at both State and Federal level over a very long period. I believe those words express very eloquently both the legacy of the Summit and the tragedy of the Summit. Having been given the facts, having received such goodwill-I admit that the Government generated a great deal of goodwill for itself out of the Summit and it deserves praise for that-and having been presented with that evidence the real tragedy is multiplied and is more manifest because the Government then failed to implement the right policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that despite all the words of concern about the unemployed that were uttered by the Government over the last few months, despite the mountain of material and despite the overwhelming weight of economic evidence, the Government still finds itself unable bluntly to state the obvious, and that is that the only way in which a significant reduction in unemployment can come about in Australia in current circumstances is for the entire Australian work force to accept the necessity for a reduction in its standard of living. It is no good sugar-coating the pill; it is no good using obscure words; it is no good trying to bluff people with a mountain of paper and a mountain of words. The situation is so serious at the present time that we have to accept that there has to be a reduction in living standards. Unless the 90 per cent of the work force in Australia who have jobs at the present time are prepared voluntarily to accept a reduction in living standards they will through that refusal thrust upon some of their fellow Australians an involuntary and far more catastrophic reduction in living standards through throwing those people out of work and adding to the lists of the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not the propaganda of the Liberal Party. It is not the propaganda of Andrew Peacock or Doug Anthony or John Howard as it was described by the Labor Party during the election campaign. That is the upshot of the Labor Government's own economic material presented to the Summit. This material flies in direct contradiction to a prediction and an undertaking that was given by the Prime Minister on 1 March, two days before the Labor Government was elected. That is what he said on an A.M. interview-the final interview before the electronic blackout on 1 March. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I made my position quite clear before and that we would expect that no movement would take place in the wages area prior to the calling of the Economic summit conference and what we would do in the area of wages would then depend upon the assessment of the economic situation-</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat that. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . What we would then do in the area of wages would then depend upon the assessment of the economic situation, arising out of that economic summit conference. That is the position that has been made quite clear by Mr Dolan on behalf of the ACTU. That is my position and there is no difference between us and the oil industry would come into that category. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the statement of Mr Hawke on 1 March. He said: 'We will make a decision about wages according to the economic analysis presented to the Summit'. The overwhelming economic analysis that came out of the Summit was that the more we restrain wages the better the outcome on employment, on inflation, on growth-on all the sorts of things that are important to us on both sides of the House. The clear unmistakable, unambiguous message coming from the Economic Summit was that if the Government really were concerned about unemployment, if it were really serious about economic growth, if it were really serious about inflation it would try to follow the tightest possible wages policy, it would at least extend the wages pause until the end of this year and it would at least thereafter gear wage increases according to the capacity of the economy to afford. </PARA>
<PARA> When I put down a notice of motion this afternoon about the cavalier approach of the new Government to the promises it made during the election campaign I was not only talking, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) mentioned, about taxation cuts-as my colleague the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) has said , a promise of a tax cut from the Labor Party in an election campaign means the guarantee of a tax increase after it has been elected-but also and far more importantly and far more fundamentally I was talking about the way in which the Prime Minister has repudiated the commitment he made on 1 March about how he would respond to the meeting of the Economic Summit, of how he would respond to the analysis presented to that Summit. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks by saying again that the great legacy of the Economic Summit is that better than ever before the focus of the Australian people has been drawn to the link between the rate of growth in wages, unemployment and inflation. The great tragedy of the Summit is that despite the overwhelming evidence the Government does not have the political courage to embrace the option that would do more than anything else to give real hope to the unemployed of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. On page 12 of the National Times of 13 March, which I think in fact was published on about 11 March, appears the statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . according to one report, Hayden told Hawke in Bowen's presence that one of the consolations was that he would no longer have to work with-</PARA>
<PARA>Instead of 'Bowen', an offensive term was used--</PARA>
<PARA>as deputy. </PARA>
<PARA>I make the point that no such statement was made to me or in my presence. Mr Hawke confirms that no such statement was made to him or in his presence. My Press secretary contacted Mr Geoff Kitney and Mr John Hurst, who were the authors of the article. They made the surprising admission that they did not write that part of the article but that it was inserted by the editor. It would be uncharacteristic of me even to have accepted such a statement without making some reply. As you would know, Mr Speaker, in Caucus on 8 February I supported a motion applauding Mr Hayden's efforts on behalf of the Australian Labor Party. I would not have done this if Mr Hayden had made the alleged statement. Surely the editor could have checked that situation. Further, neither Mr Kitney nor Mr Hurst nor the editor contacted me at any stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I asked my solicitors to get an apology from the chief editorial executive of John Fairfax and Sons Ltd. I sent that company the appropriate evidence from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that no such statement had been made. My solicitors received a reply from Stephen Jaques Stone James stating that, according to them , they had information that might have given some validity to this anonymous informant. They did say that, if I wanted to send them a letter setting out a denial and quoting the Prime Minister, they would publish it. On 6 April I sent a letter prepared by my solicitors in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> In an article 'The Unmaking of Bill Hayden' in the issue of your paper dated March 13 . . . you referred to a reported remark by Mr Hayden to Mr Hawke in my prescence during a meeting held shortly before Mr Hayden announced his resignation as party leader. By the remark, as reported, Mr Hayden was expressing criticism of me. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that no such remark was made and nothing was said at that meeting which could be taken as critical of me. Not only am I able to say this, but I hold written confirmation of that fact from Mr Hawke and from Mr Hayden. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also of some note that I was not consulted by the authors of the article at any stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Please publish this letter in a position of comparable prominence to the article. </PARA>
<PARA>I have to report that following that letter my solicitors received further advice from the solicitors for John Fairfax and Sons that, if I were to sign a release to say I would not take any action, they would publish the letter. I think this is an outrageous bit of blackmail. I want to make the point in public that I thought John Fairfax and Sons would have some standard of ethics. In the past the editor of this paper has expressed views about me which clearly show a malicious intent. This report was conceived in a lie and published with malice. I am disappointed that John Fairfax and Sons has aided and abetted him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. On 17 November 1982 the Melbourne Age reprinted a document tabled in the Senate on 16 November 1982 showing domestic travelling allowance for 1981 for certain office holders. That table incorrectly records my home base as Albury. My home has always been at Wagga Wagga and any claim submitted by me for travelling allowance purposes has been made on the basis of Wagga Wagga being my home base. Further to this, it has been my practice never to claim for travelling allowance whilst in my electorate of Farrer and to claim only when I have been away from my home at Wagga Wagga and outside my electorate on parliamentary or ministerial duties. I have done this even though during the period I was a Minister there were many occasions when I was entitled to be paid travelling allowance when I was absent from my home at Wagga Wagga and within the Farrer electorate on ministerial duties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The error concerning my home base was made in the then Department of Administrative Services when the information was being extracted on the day it was tabled.

<PARA> I refer to your letter of 7 March 1983 addressed to Sir Peter Lawler, O.B.E., Secretary of the Department of Administrative Services, concerning a document tabled in the Senate on 16 November 1982 which contained an error in that it listed your home base as Albury instead of Wagga Wagga. </PARA>
<PARA> I confirm for the record that your home base for travelling allowance purposes has always been Wagga Wagga and that the error was made in the Department of Administrative Services when the information was being extracted in some haste on the day it was tabled. </PARA>
<PARA> The files show that you have not claimed, or received payment, for overnight stays in Wagga Wagga, Albury or in any other place in the Farrer electorate. There would, of course, have been occasions when you would have been entitled to claim the allowance, in your capacity as Minister of State, for certain overnight stays in your electorate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition has the unexpected pleasure of now finding out that the Government, by the arrangement of business, has in fact complemented the matter of public importance that the Opposition has decided to raise today. I welcome the opportunity to develop further the argument that was being developed by the Opposition during the debate on the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). During my remarks a few moments ago I placed considerable emphasis on the economic data and material which had been presented to the National Economic Summit Conference. I indicated that one of the great advantages of the Summit and one of the areas where in the past I have had reason, as I do again today, to compliment the Government regarding the Summit, was the provision of so much of value in terms of economic material and economic data.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The House would be very well aware that the basis of the Summit discussion was the preparation and publication of three economic scenarios. Basically the first of those economic scenarios assumed an outcome on wages which could be regarded as extremely permissive-if one likes-and extremely expansionary. Another was an outcome in wages which involved a continuation of the wage pause at least until the end of the year and a very tight approach to wages thereafter. The third and final one-scenario A, the one to which the Government is clearly committed, if indeed it even gets to that particular barrier-was somewhere between the other two scenarios. </PARA>
<PARA> It was perfectly clear from all the material presented and from all of the debate-this really does bear repetition because it lies at the heart of this matter of public importance, it lies at the heart of the debate that has just concluded on the Prime Minister's statement and it will lie at the heart of economic debate in Australia over the next 12 or 18 months and even beyond that, because it really is the central economic issue which is facing us at present- that scenario C, which was presented to the Conference by the Treasurer (Mr Keating), had the lowest of average weekly earning rises, gave the best results for the consumer price index, real household disposable incomes, real private consumption, private capital expenditure on both dwellings and business, real domestic demand, gross non-farm product, gross domestic product, employment, unemployment, and finally, gave the lowest money supply. In other words, the scenario was based upon a continuation of the policy of the wage pause, which we introduced, which we continue to advocate and which almost alone the Federal parliamentary Labor Party and the Australian Council of Trade Unions derided and opposed at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. A scenario based upon a maintenance of that policy produces-not according to me, but according to the Labor Government and its Treasurer-the best possible outcome on inflation, employment, economic growth, disposable income, and control of the money supply. What more eloquent testimony could there be for the correctness of the policies that were advocated in the wages area by the former Government and so strongly derided and criticised by the Labor Party federally and by the Australian Council of Trade Unions at that particular time?</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, one of the most instructive things in which a really objective observer of the Economic Summit would be able to indulge would be an analysis of the statements made by Labor spokesmen during the election campaign with many of the statements made, particularly by the Treasurer, in the course of the Economic Summit. I was reminded that during the election campaign the Prime Minister exhorted us all to throw away our calculators. Whenever the then Government said : 'But you cannot afford to promise tax cuts; we have already had some', the Prime Minister would say: 'Whenever you talk about spending some money those conservatives get out their calculators and start adding up the cost of it'. He said that it was about time we all threw away our calculators. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, that was the exhortation that came from the Prime Minister in the course of the election campaign. But when we came to the Economic Summit there was much wringing of hands about the difficulties facing the Government. There was much wringing of hands about problems that it faced and the problems which had been inherited. But the most important thing was, as I said in my earlier remarks, that more than anything else the Economic Summit demonstrated that, unless a wages policy markedly firmer than anything which has been advocated by any member of the Government since its election on 5 March is adopted by the Government, the outcome must unavoidably be that more tens of thousands of Australians will be thrown out of work. The material that was presented at the Summit demonstrated that even the best scenario-that was scenario C-predicted an unemployment situation in 1985-86 which is little better than that which obtains at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the core of our charge against the Government. Despite all the evidence and the overwhelming consensus-if I can use the great buzz word-at the Summit, the Government still refuses to embrace a wages policy that will prevent further rises in unemployment. The material presented at the Economic Summit made it perfectly clear that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in the long term, a return to strong employment growth requires a substantial and sustained increase in the rate of growth of output, perhaps to a rate of 5 per cent per annum. Only one projection (C) envisages a growth rate of non-farm product of much more than 5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, having said that the only way to get a strong rise in employment is to have a rise in output, the Government's own economic material says that we will only get that rise in output if we adopt scenario C. The Government has made it perfectly clear that, if there is one scenario it will not adopt, it is scenario C. The material went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>All cases involving payment of catch-up whether paid in 1983 or 1984, involve continuing high rates of inflation througout the projection period. </PARA>
<PARA>That cold fact is relevant to the answer, or perhaps the non-answer, that was given by the Treasurer at Question Time earlier today. It is perfectly clear that when the expression, 'over time' was inserted in the Summit communique, the participants had vastly different views as to what it meant. It is perfectly clear that the Confederation of Australian Industry believed it to mean that in present economic circumstances real wage maintenance simply was not on. That is an understandable view because in present economic circumstances real wage maintenance will only result inevitably in more people being thrown out of work.</PARA>
<PARA> But it is equally clear that when it was inserted in the communique it meant a vastly different thing to the representatives of the ACTU. That has become increasingly apparent since the Summit concluded. The other morning on the AM program the Vice-president of the ACTU, Mr Simon Crean, made perfectly clear what he believed the expression 'over time' referred to. It merely referred to the time at which a catch-up was paid in relation to wage adjustments that have not occurred since the last community round. There is a very clear difference of opinion and a very strong position is being taken by the ACTU. When it talks about making concessions and about real wage maintenance over time, it is not talking about the overwhelming economic reality that at present real wage maintenance will put people out of work. </PARA>
<PARA> It means that it might be prepared to negotiate-that was Mr Crean's word-the time at which a catch-up in relation to the 9.1 per cent of consumer price index increases that have occurred since the last community round takes place. That represents a vastly different point of view. If anyone believed that arising out of the Summit we had a clear idea of where the Government was going on wages policy, let alone whether the Government had an adequate wages policy, any hope of that disappeared earlier today. When the Treasurer was asked what the expression 'over time' meant, he evidenced his inability to answer by talking in very vague and nebulous terms about the nature of the Government's case to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Willis), who has been more talkative on this matter in the media than has the Treasurer, would be kind enough to explain to me and to many members of the public precisely what the expression 'over time' means. Does the Minister adopt the interpretation that I believe many ordinary people in the community adopt, or does he adopt the interpretation which has been placed upon it by the ACTU, namely, that the only thing that they are prepared to negotiate about is the timing of the payment of the wage increases that have been forgone during the wages pause. </PARA>
<PARA> As days go by it becomes more apparent that the great single lesson that came out of the Economic Summit is the unbreakable link that exists between excessive wage increases, unemployment and inflation. That is an acceptance that has been subscribed to by a very wide cross-section of the Australian community. It is no longer just the rhetoric and the assertion of the Liberal and National Parties as claimed by our political opponents. It has been embraced by the economic evidence of a national Labor Government. It has been accepted by all reputable economic commentators around the country. It has been recognised by both sides of the political argument. The overwhelming evidence, out of the mouth of the Government's own Treasurer, and as advised by its own public servants, is that unless the Government has the courage to pursue and adopt at least Scenario C, as presented by it to the Economic Summit, the inevitable result must be tens of thousands more Australians unemployed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; We have just heard a speech from the man who presided over the economy of this country for more than five years. He stood here seeking to lecture us about unemployment although, during the period for which he presided over the economy, we saw an enormous increase in unemployment. Indeed, he presided over the worst unemployment situation in the Australian economy for 50 years. What credibility has this man to stand here and lecture us or anyone else on matters of unemployment and wages policy, or indeed economic policy generally. He has no credibility in that regard. I suggest that it is incredible hypocrisy for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) to stand up in this Parliament on the first full sitting day of the session and presume to lecture us or anyone else on matters concerning which he has been shown to be such an appalling and abysmal failure. The Opposition has an incredible gall to bring such a matter before the Parliament today. One would have thought that its supporters would have gone away and hid under a tree for six months rather than comment on wages, employment and the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reality is that the former Government came to office in 1975 proclaiming that it would provide jobs for all who wanted to work. In fact, during its term in office, unemployment increased by almost half a million to the present rate of 10.4 per cent. What sort of record is that on which to lecture others about unemployment? Over the last 12 months that the former Government was in office unemployment increased by more than a quarter of a million or, to be precise, 271,000. I repeat, Australia now has an unemployment rate of 10.4 per cent or three quarters of a million unemployed. All of this is totally attributable to the previous Government, certainly not to that which has been in office for less than two months. Surely the previous Government must bear the responsibility for that. That being the case, I suggest that honourable members opposite have an incredible effrontery seeking to lecture the Government about the policies that are best suited to the reduction of unemployment. What an incredible gall they display. Clearly, when in office, they had no answers concerning unemployment. Surely they should be the last to attempt to lecture anyone about means of reducing unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, who are they to lecture another Government about wages policy? From the time that they got into office, on a lie, they had no wages policy. Of course, lots of lies were told but in regard to wages policy in particular they said prior to the 1975 election that they would support wage indexation. Immediately they came to office they broke that promise and for the next six years set about bringing down wage indexation. They were successful in 1981 when finally they brought that wage fixation system to an end. The only policy they had for controlling wages during that period and since has been to use the bludgeon of unemployment to reduce wage claims. That was a deliberate act of policy. The former Government pursued budgetary and monetary policies designed to make it more difficult to advance wage claims. As we saw, under such policies an unemployment rate of 10 per cent was needed to bring wage claims down to their present state, one in which virtually no increases at all are taking place . </PARA>
<PARA> Until recently we saw a continuance of this policy of using massive unemployment to reduce the level of wage increases. That was the only policy that the former Government had. It is totally inhumane and inappropriate if other policies are available. The Government strongly believes that there are, and has for years set about providing the basis for their introduction. I have described the previous Government's wages policy, insofar as it had one. After it destroyed the wage indexation system it had no basis for fixing wages except a totally decentralised system, one of fixing them at company or industry levels rather than on a national level; the national wage fixing process had been destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA> The former Minister for Industrial Relations who now happens to be the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) said in April 1982 that the previous Government had no wages policy. He recognised the reality when he saw it clearly from the back bench. In an article which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald on 10 April 1982 he is reported to have said:</PARA>
<PARA> In industrial relations, the most critical element is wages policy. Regrettably , there has not been a wages policy. When indexation was knocked out by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, no long-term plan was put down, and no interim policy was put down while you were working to a long term-plan. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the present Leader of the Opposition said about a year ago in regard to the previous Government's wages policy. He should have known. He had been Minister for Industrial Relations, the Minister who was supposed to be in charge of wages policy, yet he said after he resigned from that portfolio that the previous Government had in fact had no wages policy. Therefore, there is no doubt that that Government was bereft of the ability to provide any answer in regard to unemployment and bereft of a wages policy, yet it now presumes to lecture the Government, to tell it what is the best wages policy to follow, what is the best policy to reduce unemployment. I do not believe that, for a very long time, we should listen to, or take notice of, what members of the former Government say in that regard. They have a long learning curve to follow before we can regard their remarks as having any credibility whatever. They have shown that they learned nothing during their seven years of abysmal failure in office.</PARA>
<PARA> The former Government destroyed the wage indexation system and had no wages policy. What happened? Naturally, there was a big increase in wage levels. The whole matter was left to the market and in 1982 wages increased considerably; that is an undoubted fact. The former Government deplored that and said that it was a terrible thing to have happened. Why did it happen? It happened because the former Government had no wages policy. It destroyed wage indexation, the one system that it had going for it. Properly organised, wage indexation could have produced a sensible wage system but, that destroyed, the previous Government had nothing going for it. Its supporters threw up their hands in unholy horror when their non-wages policy produced a wages outcome that they regarded as terrible. It certainly created considerable problems for the Australian economy. Supporters of the previous Government said 'it is not our fault; the terrible unions are to blame', but as a government it had a responsibility to produce a clear wages policy. As the present Leader of the Opposition has said, it had none. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I believe that on the wages front supporters of the former Government totally lack credibility. The only policy that they had, apart from unemployment, was that of introducing a wage freeze. Such a freeze relied very much for its effectiveness on unemployment. A private sector wage freeze would not apply at present but for the presence of unemployment; that is the reality. Even though the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has imposed a wage freeze with regard to arbitrated decisions, the freeze would not hold if there were not also massive unemployment. Therefore, such a policy as the former Government had at the end of its term of office depended on its basic underlying concept of creating more and more unemployment. That was its only basic policy in regard to wages. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that kind of record on both the unemployment and wages fronts, we need not pay too much regard to what its supporters now tell us our policies should be. The Government has the confidence that it can produce policies of its own, policies that will be infinitely more successful than those pursued by the previous Government. They will enable Australia to have a strong wages system, one that will be compatible with economic recovery and employment growth. They will not produce a disastrous wages shambles such as occurred under the previous Government. Equally, they will not be accompanied by a deliberate policy of creating more and more unemployment as the only real means of controlling wages.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we are able to make that assertion because years ago when in opposition realising the enormous importance in this area we set about developing a policy which would be credible and usable in government and which would enable us to pursue policies which would start to produce economic recovery in this country and start to get employment growth going again. That is what the prices and incomes accord was all about. It took a long time to negotiate, but it was a policy which broke completely new ground; it had never been attempted before in this country. That accord, which was finalised in February of this year, in a very large respect though not completely, has been endorsed by the National Economic Summit Conference which was held in this chamber. Large segments of representatives at that Conference agreed to it, particularly on the need for a centralised wages system. It was endorsed by the Summit Conference. The employers stood in this chamber and said that they supported the centralised wages system-not the kind of mess which they have had before. The employers did not say that they supported the prices and incomes accord in every respect, but I expect that, when the matter comes up before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission for decision, they will not support wage indexation. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot expect unanimity of view on everything. There was a large degree of unanimity of view at that Conference. In respect of both the accord and the Summit Conference, there is a tremendous amount of unanimity and of agreement. I believe that enables us to say to this Parliament that we are now in a position to pursue a wages policy which will be credible, which will hold and which will be compatible with economic recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> I say that despite the assertions which are being made that there are all sorts of breakdowns in the accord and so on. There is no such breakdown. Overwhelmingly, the trade union movement supports the Government's policy in this regard. That policy is that we will introduce a centralised wages system, that that system will provide for real wage maintenance and that it will be introduced some time later this year. When that system is introduced, it will provide a basis on which sectional wage claims will not be able to be pursued except in special or extraordinary circumstances, as was agreed at the Summit Conference and as was said in the accord. There is no problem about that. That is the agreement of the trade union movement. It is specifically said in speeches in this chamber including the speech by the Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions as well as in the communique. We have every reason to believe that that remains the position of the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> The trade union movement realises the importance of wages policy in respect of economic and employment growth and it, as much as anyone, wants to see employment growth in this country. I say that as a generality. Some areas of the trade union movement may not fully agree with every aspect of it. All I can say is that the Government intends to pursue its policy-the policy in the accord and the policy in the communique-and that policy does not provide for sectional wage increases. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader of the Opposition spent much of his time in both of the speeches which he made here this afternoon talking about the desirability of pursuing scenario C as set out in the working paper which was put before the Summit Conference, that is, projections of the Australian economy to 1985-86. There were three scenarios. Scenario C provided for no wage increase at all this year and then for about 80 per cent wage indexation in the ensuing two or three years. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that this was the scenario which we should pursue because this gave the best outcome. Let me say two things about that: Firstly, it is a fact, which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition should realise, that there were different budgetary assumptions in respect of each of the three scenarios. In respect of scenario C, a more stimulatory budgetary assumption was made than in respect of the other two scenarios which, of course, accounts for a substantial part of the difference in terms of economic and employment growth. Secondly, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition should have regard to what is stated on page 12 of the document. In regard to these matters it states:</PARA>
<PARA> Fulfilment of all of the various assumptions on which any of the projections is based would be an unlikely outcome. In particular, the three wage-price outcomes are not regarded by the Committee as equally feasible. Projection B assumes continuing strong increases in wages, notwithstanding that economic activity remains weak. Projection C assumes an extension of the wage pause until well into 1984, then very modest increases in wages throughout the remainder of the three years, notwithstanding that the rate of growth of activity is accelerating fairly strongly. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, what this document is saying-it was produced not just by bureaucrats but by people from the trade union movement and employers-is that projection C is of doubtful validity in terms of its feasibility. That is the whole point which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition missed, that is, that scenario is simply not feasible. </PARA>

The best that the unemployed can look for is the same number of unemployed in 1985-86 as there is today. That is what the Labor Party is offering the unemployed. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie would be well advised to look at what the Government is offering before he shoots off his big mouth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we are talking about is not the previous Government's policies but the present Labor Government's policies. The Minister said that he believed that there are other polices. Every one of those policies implies an unemployment level of about what we have now. If they are the sorts of policies which the Labor Government wants to introduce, what has changed? Where is the benefit to the unemployed from the policies that have been put forward by the Labor Party? That is the reason why the Opposition brought forward this matter of public importance for discussion today. The Opposition seeks to make it clear to the electorate-that is, the people of Australia-that the Labor Party in Government has accepted that unemployment in this country will remain at around the 9 per cent or 10 per cent level. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party, in exactly the same way as it is going to determine what the level of the deficit will be this year, will determine also the policies which will set the level of unemployment in this economy. The Labor Party has accepted a set of scenarios. We do not know whether it likes scenario A or scenario B. We know that it does not like scenario C. The Government put aside the suggestion that the late Sir Keith Campbell raised that perhaps there should be a scenario D. The reality is that the policies of the Labor Party are being framed around the acceptance of an unemployment level in this economy of 9 per cent or 10 per cent. That is the reality. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened since the National Economic Summit Conference is that things have become even worse. Since the Summit, the call is now clear, understood and accepted, as we see it, from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) who in the House this afternoon said that later this year there will be, supported and granted, a wage rise of around 4 per cent and maybe even higher. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VI7">Mr LUSHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. What I am saying is that it will be even higher because the pressures are coming on as a result of the consumer price index being higher than anticipated when the Summit was going on. An increase of 3 to 4 per cent was agreed upon in the lobbies behind this place when it was thought that the unemployment figure for the last 12 months would be around 10 per cent. We now have the reality that it is over 11 per cent. It is my suspicion that when the trade union movement gets together and determines its submission for the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission later this year, it will be going for higher than 4 per cent. Let us see whether I am wrong. The pressure is coming on the Government. It is coming on the policy which came out of the Summit communique and the accord between the trade union movement and the Labor Party. Already the building unions want to go back to the accord. They do not want the communique because the accord allows for more increases in wages than the Summit communique might have.</PARA></TALK.START>

Paragraph 18 talks about real wage maintenance. These sorts of things will put on all sorts of pressures, because the Australian Council of Trade Unions has its outs. What we must continue to return to and not to forget is that what the present Government is doing is, as we say in the wording of this matter of public importance, pursing a wages policy which will not prevent a further rise in unemployment. Unemployment will still be out of control in Australia as a result of the policies being followed.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VI7">Mr LUSHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has put down the scenarios and has told the country what will happen under those scenarios. Let us look at them. The Government cannot even get inflation down under the scenarios, let alone unemployment coming down. Growth will be unattainable under those scenarios, given a recovery in our economy as a result of overseas improvements and the breaking of the drought. Scenario C provides the only real way in which this economy can move. It is the only way. Scenario C is the scenario which goes for growth. The only way in which this economy will get out of the sorts of difficulties it is in, which are largely caused by drought and by overseas conditions, and by high wage policies, is growth. Growth must be the only answer to the problems. If we do not follow policies that will get maximum growth, which will ultimately lead to the best level of employment, there is no justification whatever for pursuing the sorts of policies wanted by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have seen at Question Time this afternoon and in the discussion that has gone on over the last few days that the Government does not know where it is. It does not know where it is on what real wage maintenance means. It does not know where it is on whether there is to be a catch-up. But if there is a catch-up and if there is real wage maintenance, all that is clear is that the scenario's results will be worse than those laid down by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) when he put them before the Summit Conference. That is what needs to be understood. There cannot be any catch-up because there is nothing to catch up. The only thing that needs to catch up in this economy is profits. If profits are allowed to catch up, then there will be growth, then there will be investment and then there will be jobs. But that will not happen under the Labor Government's policies. That is why there will be increasing unemployment, unemployment continuing at high and unacceptably high levels under this Government's newly announced policies. </PARA>
<PARA> It needs to be understood, and the House needs to understand, that the policies that have been introduced and followed by this Government, the framework within which the Budget and this country's economy will be drawn up in the next couple of months, is predicated on unemployment of 9 per cent or 10 per cent for the next few years, with no signs of improvement. That is what it is about, and that is the reality of which people ought to be aware. I find it absolutely depressing that after all the rhetoric, all the election promises, all the hype of the Summit and all the expectations that have been raised by the present Prime Minister and those who support him, they have put all that to one side within a couple of weeks of achieving office and they have said: ' Nothwithstanding all that, and notwithstanding that we still hope to be able to create half a million new jobs over the next couple of years, here is our scenario as to the way in which the economy will move over the next three or four years'. All those scenarios-with the exception of scenario C, of which the Government will not have a bar-imply unemployment at 9 per cent or 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, that must be unacceptable, under the Government's own definitions, because Labor members kicked us around the electorates over the last couple of years on exactly the same sort of thing, as they did during the election campaign. They walk into office and they accept it. They are saying to the unemployed in Australia: 'We cannot do any better for you than what Mr Fraser and Mr Howard did for you'. What the Opposition is saying is that we must adopt policies which will provide the maximum growth and the maximum chance for business to restore its profitability and its investment and to restore the jobs that the community will need. That is why we have brought forward this matter of public importance. That is why we think it is important. The people of this country need to understand what Mr Hawke, Mr Keating and Mr Willis are putting forward. They are putting forward unemployment at 9 per cent or 10 per cent for the next so many years. If that is not a failure to pursue a policy that will reduce unemployment, I do not know what it is. That is why this matter of public importance has been brought forward and it is why it ought to be supported. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House has before it a matter of public importance, the terms of which state:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Government to pursue a wages policy which will prevent a further rise in unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>The hypocrisy of the coalition never ceased to amaze me when it was in Government and it has carried that on into its Opposition days. This matter was brought on by the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). He came into the House with this proposition for debate even though he was part of the Government that for seven years pursued policies which put inflation and unemployment through the roof and allowed a no growth situation to occur at the same time. Let us not forget that the former Treasurer was part of the Government which brought in so many policies that were rejected by the Australian public only a matter of weeks ago. He was aided and abetted by the former Prime Minister, Mr Fraser. Let us not forget either another member of the Cabinet for most of that time-the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock). That Government brought in tight fiscal and monetary policies time after time to screw down the economy. It had no wages policy whatsoever, and yet the former Treasurer today asks about the Government's policy on wages. He asks why it has not presented a cure-all for our ills. He was a main instrument in bringing Australia to the economic ruin from which the present Government will extract it in the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA> What did the now Opposition achieve with its policies over the last seven years ? Inflation is still at 11.5 per cent, only a fraction below what it was in 1975 when the Fraser Government came to power. As I have said, there has been no growth in the economy whatsoever and unemployment is still going through the roof. Let us look as some of the statistics on unemployment, as released only a couple of weeks ago by the Commonwealth Employment Service. Of course, such figures were suppressed by the previous Government for two years because it thought they could be a little embarrassing for it. As at March 1981, which is when publication of the figures was stopped, 457,000 persons were registered with the CES as looking for full time employment. In March 1983, two years later , 822,000 people were registered as looking for full time employment. That is an increase of nearly 400,000 people. In fact, as the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Willis) said earlier today, nearly 300,000 of those have been placed in that situation in the last 12 months. That is an incredible rise in the number of registered unemployed. If we took into account not only the registered unemployed but also people who are not registered but are looking for full time employment, Australia would have, conservatively, over one million people looking for employment. That is a disastrous situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The former Treasurer, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, helped cause the ruination of the economy and yet he has the gall to talk about the failure of this Government's wages policies and its failure to present a cure-all for the national economy. We also had the delight of seeing the honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher) waltz in and present a speech that did not accord too much with the facts. He had scant regard for the facts. He mentioned growth but forgot to mention that he was a member of the Government parties for many years and did not say anything at that time about the fact that there was no growth. He ran away from the facts of the last seven years. He did not want to talk about them when they were raised by members on this side of the House. He did not want to talk about the last seven years; he wanted to talk only about what is happening this very second. He disregarded everything that had happened. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Hume did not do his homework at all. He referred to the National Economic Summit Conference and especially the paper entitled ' Projections of the Australian Economy to 1985-86'. He said that he wished the Government would follow scenario C because scenario A would not reduce inflation . Page 26 of that paper, in part (ii) under the heading 'Prices, Wages and Factor Shares' shows that he did not do his homework, because it clearly states:</PARA>
<PARA> The restrained way in which wage increases resume after the wages pause, and the Medicare impact on the CPI, set wages and prices growing on a fairly low track from 1983-84 onwards, so that in terms of the CPI, inflation moves down from about 11 per cent in 1982-83 to 6 per cent in 1983-84 and to 5 per cent in 1984-85. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope the honourable member for Hume does not get the facts askew over the next couple of years. I assure him and his colleagues that they will be sitting on that side of the House for a long time to come if today's effort is to be the standard of their operation. </PARA>
<PARA> During the gimmickry that went on late last year the former Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, decided that, not having any wage policy whatsoever, he would have to think up something to save the bacon. So he thought of the wage freeze. However, he said it could not simply be called a freeze; it would be better to call it a wage pause as it sounded a little better and did not give the impression that he was ripping off the Australian people. But the pause was not the only matter of concern; the Prime Minister had no policy for the period following the pause. The Fraser Government never talked about what would happen when we came out of the pause. The Opposition does not talk about it now because honourable members opposite have never had a policy for coming out of the pause. Mr Fraser thought that a quick gimmick backed up by a public relations exercise would hoodwink members of the public and that before they realised what was happening the Government would dash off to the polls and win another election. It thought ' Blow the Australian people and the economy; we won't worry about little things like that. We will run to the polls, win another election and Bob's your uncle'. I do not know about 'Bob's your uncle', but Bob is now the Prime Minister and Mr Fraser is no longer a member of the House. That was the cynical approach of the former Government and the Opposition has not done itself any credit whatsoever by raising this sort of MPI. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to some of the things said today about the Government. The Government has stated, through the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, that a number of policies will be brought forward over the next few months in an attempt to rectify the situation in which we have found ourselves, which was the fault of the Government of the last seven years. I have a copy of the prices and incomes accord. The former Prime Minister had a copy, too, during the election campaign but he ripped out a few pages and so the document did not quite make sense. That document states:</PARA>
<PARA> The principles of wage fixation should be such as to provide wage justice to employees whilst seeking to ensure that wage increases do not give added impetus to inflation or unemployment. The maintenance of real wages is agreed to be a key objective. It is recognised that in a period of economic crisis as now applying that this will be an objective over time. </PARA>
<PARA>It is that last sentence that honourable members opposite usually forget to quote. The disgraceful performance this afternoon by the honourable member for Bennelong and the honourable member for Hume in bringing this matter forward for discussion has been put to rest. I am quite sure that honourable members will see this Government bring forward effective and productive policies in the next few months which will fix and eradicate the problems that we have. Over the next few years we will see growth, reduced unemployment and increased employment so that a better life can be had by the vast majority of Australian people. </PARA>

I have obtained from the Acting Chief of the Air Staff the following information: There were three F111 flights on 24 March; two were over Queensland for training purposes. One operated out of East Sale. It was a recategorisation flight for a RAAF instructor, Squadron Leader L. D. Boyd of No. 6 Squadron. It was operated out of Sale. It flew an established training route which was registered and is contained in the Department of Transport manuals dated 6 October 1977. It flew that route exactly.

<PARA> That the following Address-in-Reply to the Speech of His Excellency the Governor-General be agreed to:</PARA>
<PARA>MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY:</PARA>
<PARA> We, the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, desire to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency for the Speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>I am deeply honoured to move this motion on behalf of the Government and my party, the Australian Labor Party. I thank my colleagues for the privilege. In opening this debate, Mr Speaker, may I first congratulate you on your appointment to the high office which you now hold. I wish you well in the years ahead. The Governor-General's Speech, to which we are replying today, is the parliamentary expression of the commission given to a government by the people at a general election. It outlines in some detail the legilsation the Government will present to the Parliament and the administrative action it will take to discharge the clear authority given to it by the electorate on 5 March. The debate on the Governor-General's Speech gives members of this House the privilege of speaking on a broad range of issues. It allows me, in my first speech, to identify the subjects to which I have a deep and long-standing commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> I will first speak about the reasons why I decided 12 years ago to work towards a parliamentary career in this place and what I hope that career will achieve-a career entrusted to me by the electors of Canning in Western Australia who have given me the honour and responsibility of being their representative. After spending my formative years in a struggling rural community, I moved to the city of Perth where careers were limited because of the few opportunities open to young women. I chose to join the nursing profession and I remain today a registered nurse, actively interested in the future of that profession. In the mid-1960s the Vietnam war, which shaped the political consciousness of many Australians, made me decide to become politically involved. That war became very real to me when, as a young wife and mother, I lived in Malaysia and observed at first hand the effects on the men who spent time in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA> On my return to Australia I became active in the moratorium movement and the women's movement, and it was during these years that the inequalities, the violence and injustices in society influenced me enough to think of a political career. I came to believe that my commitment to people could best be fulfilled in a democratically elected house of parliament, a parliament where the government had the commitment and the power to bring about social, economic, political and legal reform. I proudly stand here today as a member of a government which has that commitment, a government of consensus, conciliation and concern, a government which I consider has begun to turn the tide of public thinking about politics and politicians for, in recent years, the esteem of politicians and the esteem of the institution of parliament itself have slipped far in the eyes of many Australians. But I believe the electorate now perceives a change occurring and, many would say, not before time. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, I am addressing you today as the first woman to represent Western Australia in the House of Representatives. As such, I am acutely aware of my responsibilities not only to the electorate of Canning but also to the women of Australia. Since Federation, only nine women have been members of this House and six of those nine are here today, all members of the Government. I look forward to the day when 50 per cent of the population, the women, are far better represented on all sides of this House. </PARA>
<PARA> The last decade has not been easy for women as they struggled to define and articulate their position in Australian society. There have been many milestones , many firsts, and I am proud to add mine to a growing list. Women have come a long way but can now see more clearly than ever that the road ahead is long and arduous. This Government is acutely sensitive to this situation and, as pointed out in the Governor-General's Speech, a legislative program is planned which reflects this sensitivity. As an example, legislation will shortly be introduced into the Parliament which will deal with discrimination on the basis of sex or marital status. </PARA>
<PARA> Discrimination exists in almost every facet of women's lives but it is particularly obvious in the area of employment. At the National Economic Summit Conference, in an information paper on the economy prepared by the Office of Status of Women, the following points were made: Women are concentrated in a relatively narrow range of occupations; unemployment levels amongst women have been and continue to be consistently higher than for men; there are far more women than men in part time employment and in less secure jobs; women's responsibility for the care of children and other dependants and the inadequacy of support services such as child care hampers their fuller participation in the labour market; the education system has contributed to occupational segregation; and, job creation and training schemes have discriminated against women in terms of both the quantity and quality of the programs offered. Anti-discrimination legislation will address itself to all these problems. At the same time, the Government will ratify the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, an action which is long overdue. This Convention was first introduced at the United Nations in 1945 and it will be another great landmark for this Government when it oversees Australia's ratification during this term of office. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, we in the Government place great significance on the fact that the agreed communique of the Economic Summit Conference stresses that the basic rights of women should be recognised and protected and that the move towards greater equality and independence for women should be encouraged, for no economic recovery will occur without full participation by women. My personal hope is that at any future conference we will see more than one woman joining in the deliberations and debate which shape our economic future. I know of many women who are more than competent to participate in high level economic debate and I look forward to business, unions and government ensuring that they do so. </PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia I represent the outer urban and partly rural electorate of Canning, an electorate of over 2,000 square kilometres and with a total population of 125,000 men, women and children. That I was returned on 5 March with the second highest swing in Australia is, in my view, a clear indication of the mood of the electors and the direction they want their Government and, therefore, their society to follow. In the 12 months from March 1982, unemployment in Australia soared from 6.5 per cent to 10.5 per cent, and these figures were certainly reflected in Canning. Men and women in their thousands were thrown out of work. Many lost more than their jobs. They forfeited their friends and their dignity along with their incomes and personal possessions. The social disruption caused by unemployment is pervading throughout our society. Families are daily being shattered by the tragedy of unemployment and many live in fear of losing their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> These are not exaggerated statements. Much of my work since taking office has been in areas of social welfare and social concern. Many people in Canning are finding life almost impossible to cope with as they struggle to adapt to falling and changing living standards. The problem is magnified all over Australia. As the Governor-General's speech indicated, this Government is committed to arresting the serious economic decline in Australia and to placing the economy on a path of sustained, non-inflationary growth. In addition, the Government intends to develop job creation programs which will stop the unemployment spiral . We in Canning desperately need these programs and I already meet regularly with individuals and groups throughout my electorate to discuss ways in which we can create the work which will dignify the lives of the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> I am particularly concerned about the young men and women in Australia, for today's youth are the citizens of the future. Thousands upon thousands of unemployed young men and women are convinced that our society has nothing to offer them. When we stop and listen to these disillusioned young people, we find that a large new subculture of angry, dispirited youth is emerging in Australia. We as a Government, we as a nation, cannot and must not let this critical situation continue. We must develop ways of drawing these young people into our communities as full participating members. If they cannot find jobs we must create them. If traditional jobs no longer exist we must develop and exploit new industries and promote rapidly developing technologies. If we cannot find enough work for our young people we had better quickly realise that to retain our existing work ethic is not only foolish but also dangerous. We must create a situation in which people not in paid work are able to feel that they are contributing to society just as much as an employed person. We need to put our minds to how this can be achieved because if we do not we are allowing a situation to continue to develop which I believe is potentially destructive of our society. As the Governor-General's Speech clearly indicated, this Government is committed to implementing policies which will lay the foundations for a more equitable and compassionate society, a society without exploitation, without discrimination, without victims. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, I have not yet mentioned the gravest crisis which threatens society today. I refer, of course, to the increasing threat of nuclear war and environmental devastation. Powerful men urge the building of brutal and lethal weapons to stock their arsenals of destruction. They justify their actions with the astonishing claim that this will stop war. They are now able to destroy every man, woman and child on this earth dozens of times over and yet they continue building their stockpiles higher and higher. World-wide demonstrations are increasing against this rapidly growing threat, yet governments seem to be unwilling to respond to the demands from their people to stop this madness. Australia may be only a middle level world power but I believe that we are, nonetheless, morally obliged to speak out in every possible forum against nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> International commentators suggest that Austraia is a likely target for a first strike nuclear warning. I suggest that this is a threat which we should take seriously and the implications of living and working within a few kilometres of one of Australia's prime nuclear targets are not lost on my electorate. We must recognise the gravity and urgency of the need to halt the arms race and the need to pursue policies of peace. The men and women in Canning, as elsewhere in Australia, have asked through the ballot box for stability and security to be returned to their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> On the international stage, Australians see fear, violence, deprivation and greed. At home they see long dole queues, angry and bitter youth and falling living standards. They look to this Government, to this Executive, for new, competent, caring leadership. The days of authoritarian, patriarchal government are over. The Australian Labor Party promised reconstruction, reconciliation and recovery. It promised to pursue these ends through consultation and co-operation . On 5 March, the people of Australia overwhelmingly endorsed the new consensus approach. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few weeks that the Labor Party has been in Government, we have already seen how effectively politicians, business people and unions can work together. But the bad times are by no means over. I believe that we, the Government, must now work to expand the concept of consensus. The only way we will come through the social and economic crisis in Australia is by promoting an atmosphere in which every person is prepared to participate in the process of recovery. We, as the Government, will be asking people to make sacrifices but we intend also to promote understanding and encourage involvement throughout the community. We are looking for an active commitment from all people to bring about an equitable and just society. The challenges facing our nation are monumental. Governments, business and unions cannot be expected to have all the answers. The time has come for a real commitment and experiment in participatory democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I wish to express my deep gratitude and thanks to the Australian Labor Party for its confidence in me and its encouragement and help over the past years. The Western Australian branch of the party and hundreds of party members assisted me in winning the seat of Canning. I consider that my success was due, in great part, to the co-operative efforts of many dedicated people. I must thank also the many women throughout Australia who have supported me over the past 10 years and encouraged me to work towards the fulfilment of my wish to enter this Parliament. Their continued support over recent months indicates to me that women want more women in Australian parliaments. The recent State election in Western Australia followed by the Federal election finally put to rest the myth that women cannot win difficult seats in elections. I extend my thanks to all my colleagues here. I look forward to working with them all in a long and productive parliamentary career. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion. I am honoured to second the motion moved so ably by my colleague the honourable member for Canning (Ms Fatin ). I join with her in congratulating you, Mr Speaker, on your election as Speaker of this House. I am sure that you will perform the duties required of your high office with impartiality, with dignity and with fearless independence. I express my gratitude to my wife and family and to my brother, Richard Anthony Lindsay, for their understanding and assistance during the long campaign to win the seat of Herbert for the Australian Labor Party. I record my appreciation for the assistance given to me over the years by a distinguished Australian historian, Professor Henry Reynolds. I am indebted to my campaign supporters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am conscious of the inestimable favour the electors of Herbert have conferred upon me. I thank them. I pray I shall be worthy of their trust. Above all, I have been elected to serve Australia, a nation whose people are fiercely proud of what has been achieved and of what can be achieved. It is instructive to recall the words of the eighteenth century English parliamentarian, Charles James Fox. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> What is the end of all government? Certainly, the happiness of the governed . . . The country, when we came into office, bore not a very auspicious complexion: Yet, sir, I do not despair of seeing it once again resume its consequence in the scale of nations, and make as splendid a figure as ever. </PARA>
<PARA>To that end, on 5 March the people of Australia elected Bob Hawke and other members of the Australian Labor Party to lead our nation with a government of reform, a revitalised government, a government which offers a renewal of hope, of integrity, of competence and a government of stability. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal electorate of Herbert was established in 1901. The first member, Frederick William Bamford, represented the seat as a member of the Australian Labor Party from Federation until the latter part of the First World War. The seat has benefited from 52 years of Australian Labor Party representation. I am the ninth representative. I express appreciation for the work of my predecessors . I look forward to serving my electorate with honesty and vigour for many years . </PARA>
<PARA> I am honoured to serve as the Federal representative of an electorate which hosts the capital city of north Queensland-Townsville-a city with a population of about 103,000 people. It is a thriving urban centre. Industry, learning, shipping, tourism, transport services and regional administration combine to create a modern and progressive city in the tropics. Townsville is a city of the future. Goods from all over northern and western Queensland are brought to Townsville for despatch to the world. We supply resources such as coal, silver, lead and zinc, refined products such as copper, nickel and cobalt and primary products such as sugar, beef, rice, bananas and dairy products. </PARA>
<PARA> Townsville's educational facilities rival those of any other Australian region. It hosts a university, a technical college, the Australian Institute of Marine Science, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, training hospitals and colleges. Townsville now has an international airport through which travel thousands of tourists from all parts of the globe. Qantas Airways Ltd has established direct services to New Zealand, to Europe and to the west coast of the United States of America. North Queensland has gateways by the score to the Great Barrier Reef. Labor's plan to classify the whole reef as a national park will ensure that generations of Australians will share with us the experience of a splendid and magnificent offering of nature. </PARA>
<PARA> Herbert is an electorate of diverse peoples, economies and environments. The Ingham district which is located to the north of Townsville is home to nearly 16 ,000 people. Victoria Mill, situated some five kilometres from Ingham, is the largest sugar mill in Australia and one of the largest in the world. To the north of Ingham is Cardwell. Further north along Rockingham Bay is Tully, my birthplace. Dunk Island lies eight kilometres off-shore. The electorate extends north through rainforest country to include El Arish, Silkwood, South Johnstone and Mourilyan. All of these communities are engaged in the production of sugar cane on a large scale. The estimated total value of sugar produced in the Herbert electorate in 1981 was about $157m. All of these communities contribute significantly to the national income of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The story of north Queensland's growth and development is both dramatic and fascinating, influenced as it was by early struggles to develop vast tracts of pastoral land, to work the rich goldfields, to establish cane farms, to provide educational facilities and to found permanent communities. To the shores of north Queensland came immigrants from Ireland, Europe, Britain and China. They were men and women who brought new growth to this ancient land. Ministers of religion, religious brothers and nuns toiled ceaselessly in the Queensland outback and tropics, often under conditions of extreme privation, to bring spiritual guidance and support to these pioneering families. Their legacy is rich. </PARA>
<PARA> Development of north Queensland over the past 120 years has been enormous, but the continuation of this development can be accelerated only by the direct involvement of government. The development will gain force with the aid and encouragement of the Hawke Government, a government which recognises north Queensland for its boundless opportunities. This recognition was asserted in a policy document prepared by the Australian Labor Party-a document which offers well researched, sensible policies for the accelerated development of North Queensland. It is a regional policy designed to contribute to the national benefit. I will now deal with some of these policies. </PARA>
<PARA> First, I refer to sugar. The Government is committed to give sympathetic consideration to a loan to the Queensland and New South Wales sugar industries. This Government will not grant an export licence for Ord sugar. The Government has promised to work to improve the domestic price formula to allow for international prices and variable costs to be taken into account and is committed to investigate the structural problems relating to the size of sugar farms. Since those policies were formulated, there has been a major cash crisis in the sugar industry. Federal financial assistance to the industry is now urgently required. </PARA>
<PARA> The current downturn in the sugar industry has been principally brought about by two factors. First, there has been a dramatic decline in the world free market sugar price; and second, there has been a significant reduction in income for the sugar industry. The industry has also suffered major natural disasters. There was widespread flooding in far north Queensland in 1981 which caused heavy cane loss in the Innisfail and Tully districts. In other districts, very low rainfall led to unusually low harvests in the 1982 season. The recent drought has reduced cane production in the Ingham district by some 20 per cent. The sugar industry, therefore, enters the 1983 season in a perilous state. </PARA>
<PARA> Low production and continuing low prices combine to erode confidence in the long term future of the industry. It is estimated that, for the whole of the 1983 season, the cane growers' cash deficit will be in the region of $100m. Banks in Queensland have indicated that 90 per cent of their cane grower clients are seeking assistance. Clearly, a great number of cane farmers will be denied access to future bank funds. Inevitably, there will be a tightening of credit facilities. Tragically, there will be many bankruptcies. This crisis of confidence will be experienced not only by the cane farmer and the miller but also by the machinery dealer, the small businessman and, most of all, by the employee who sustains the sugar industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The sugar industry seeks financial assistance from this Government to provide some of the funds necessary to meet the cash deficit of the industry in the first half of the 1983 season. It needs help to ensure that the 1984 season is a reality. It is essential that the Federal Government give financial assistance to the sugar industry to ensure that cane farmers maintain production and that banks maintain confidence in the industry. This aid will ensure the presence of an industry which has served the nation, unassisted, in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to roads. The Bruce Highway plays an essential role in communications and supply. North Queensland has a tropical environment, the heaviest Australian rainfall and major rivers and streams, all of which contribute to a higher than normal cost of road construction and maintenance. The Bruce Highway from Brisbane to Cairns has achieved notoriety with the motoring public of Australia. The population of north Queensland is nearly 500, 000. About the same number of visitors travel to north Queensland each year and 74 per cent of those visitors travel by car. The road is inadequate for present- day traffic volumes. The road surface standard is below that required to achieve national highway objectives for safe, reliable and efficient motoring. Our policy ensures that the upgrading of the Bruce Highway from Brisbane to Cairns will be completed by 1988. Funds from the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program must be spent on this national project. The Government's planned 'Jobs on Local Roads' program will create employment opportunities for some of the Herbert electorate's jobless people. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the Burdekin Dam. The future expansion of industry and population in the Townsville region cannot take place without an adequate water supply. The recent drought forcefully reminded north Queenslanders that the only secure and adequate water storage for development in the Townsville-Burdekin region is the completion of the Burdekin Dam, construction of which has been promoted by the Australian Labor Party for years. The estimated cost of the dam wall is $127m. It will take six years to build. Already millions of dollars have been spent in providing an access road and other works. Its construction has been economically justified by the Government. Decades of government dithering on this national project are, thankfully, behind us. In March of this year the Queensland Minister for Water Resources and Maritime Services announced that tenders for the construction of the dam wall are scheduled to close in August this year, with work to begin in 1984. More than 120,000 people who live in the Townsville- Burdekin region can depend on this Government to complete the Burdekin Dam, which will provide their water needs at least until the year 2020. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to defence. The Third Brigade of the Australian Army is based at Townsville. These fine Australians are a welcome presence. From airfields in the Townsville region allied aircraft took part in the crucial Battle of the Coral Sea and the people of north Queensland will always acknowledge their debt to a great ally, the United States of America. Thousands of kilometres of north Queensland's coastline is uninhabited. This affords an easy access to smugglers, to Asian fishermen keen to trawl our abundant coastal fishing grounds, to illegal immigrants and to potential invaders. North Queenslanders demand, and deserve, protection. </PARA>
<PARA> The next matter with which I would like to deal is regional health. This Government is committed to the establishment of a post-graduate research institute of tropical medicine at James Cook University. It is an urgent need. The detection and control of tropical diseases are vital community rights. Above all, the role of Aboriginal health and nutrition would be a high priority in the work of the institute. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to Aboriginals. More than 10,000 Townsville citizens are of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent. They have not always shared our traditional Australian mateship. Consultation and self-determination are commitments of this Government so that Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders may determine programs for their needs and priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Further policy initiatives provide that sales tax will be removed from the freight element of goods delivered to north Queensland. This will provide substantial relief to our industries, our small businessmen and, ultimately, the whole of the north Queensland community. As a measure of additional stimulus to business confidence and investment, the Hawke Government will provide a new Commonwealth centre at Townsville to house staff of Federal Government departments and agencies servicing north Queensland. The need for this centre is long overdue. Its early completion will enable government administration to provide an even more effective service than before. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, the policies announced in His Excellency's Speech are designed to restore confidence and vigour in all sectors of the Australian economy and to ensure that basic human rights are available to all. No longer must this nation tolerate colonies of unemployment. High unemployment must be banished from our midst. The Government's plan to revitalise the Australian housing industry, to provide low cost rental accommodation, public housing and financial assistance to bridge the deposit gap, will be applauded by the Australian people. Policies designed to modernise the Repatriation Act to include the removal of anomalies in the appeals system will lessen the burden on our veterans. We have long recognised the basic rights of women. We will encourage the move towards greater equality and independence. His Excellency reminded us all that the Hawke Government has 'pledged itself to the pursuit of national reconciliation, national recovery, and national reconstruction'. We must never surrender our duty to honour that pledge. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, it is fitting that I conclude this, my maiden speech, with a quotation from the late President John F. Kennedy:</PARA>
<PARA> Let us go forth to lead this land that we love joining in the prayer of General George Washington in 1783 that God would have you in His holy protection, that He would incline the hearts of the citizens to entertain a brotherly love and affection one for another and finally, that He would most graciously be pleased to dispose us all to do justice, to love mercy and to demean ourselves with the characteristics of the divine author of our blessed religion, without a humble imitation of whose example we can never hope to be a happy nation. </PARA>
<PARA> A guiding principle and prayer of this nation has been, is now and shall ever be . . . </PARA>
<PARA> In God we trust. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker and honourable members, as I rise to speak for the first time in this House I am conscious of the short list of only six members who have represented Gippsland since Federation. I am particularly conscious of the outstanding contribution my immediate predecessor made to the welfare of Gippsland and to this Parliament. The Honourable Peter Nixon served his electorate and this House with complete integrity and dedication. In doing so he won the respect and admiration of not only the people of Gippsland but also of members on both sides of the House. The achievements of the Honourable Peter Nixon will be of lasting benefit to this nation as well as his electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, you would be aware that Gippsland is both a diverse and a rich region which has produced enormous wealth on behalf of Australia. Its industries are numerous, with the major ones being dairy, beef, sheep, coal, oil, gas, timber, fishing and tourism. Gippsland produces 70 per cent of Australia's oil requirement and 75 per cent of its gas. In addition the huge brown coal resources that can be mined by open cut generates at this stage 90 per cent of Victoria's power supply. This growth is directly attributable to the endeavour and skill of the people of Gippsland, a people who have a proud sense of the history of their region and a determination to secure the future for following generations. </PARA>
<PARA> Gippsland places great faith in its youth. There is a realisation that most young people have a great desire to take their place at the forefront of Gippsland's continued growth. For this reason I, together with other Gippslanders who have employment, am disturbed by the unemployment figures. We simply cannot allow unemployment to sap the confidence and dignity of our youth. It is nonetheless increasingly apparent that the Gippsland community is not adequately compensated for the wealth it produces. In fact its cities, towns and shires are often out of pocket providing an infrastructure for development projects, new citizens and tourists. Greater efforts must be made to lighten the very heavy financial burdens on such responsible authorities. Furthermore, my electorate is concerned that its plans for improving the state of the arts throughout Gippsland receive insufficient assistance. I share with my electorate a great interest in the arts which must be further encouraged amidst the industrial development of Gippsland. </PARA>
<PARA> I should now like to address myself to what I believe ought to be the principles which guide this nation and what I believe are the great issues which face the people of Gippsland and the people of Australia. I embrace wholeheartedly my party's philosophy, which first and foremost stands for freedom-freedom of the individual to pursue his aims and aspirations, a freedom limited only by the requirements of a society to ensure the maintenance of law and order and the preservation of dignity of the society as a whole. It is a political philosophy which demands respect for institutions, for parliamentary democracy, for the family as the basic unit in society, for the judicial process and the rule of law, for Her Majesty the Queen, the Sovereign of Australia, for the structure of federalist government and the maintenance of States' rights. It is a political philosophy which recognises the importance of these institutions in preserving the fabric of our society. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some who peddle the myth that this is a dying and reactionary philosophy-that the whole social, political and economic development of society leads inevitably to a Marxist system, that out of the decay of feudalism grew capitalism and then imperialism and out of its decay will come communism. I reject utterly that view of a society's development. History has shown that the political beliefs of societies tend to oscillate. When disillusionment sets in with one system society looks for another. It ultimately settles on that structure which best serves its needs. When the political pendulum stops swinging it rests over democracy and over a philosophy which embraces liberty. </PARA>
<PARA> I fervently believe that the greatest instinct in man is the desire for freedom . No other cause has been so singularly and vigorously pursued in the history of mankind than the quest for freedom. It is this instinct that destroys the myth that societies progress towards Marxism. I also believe that our philosophy elevates this desire to its right and proper place. Totalitarian ideologies of the far Left and the far Right continually battle against their people's quest for liberty. The Berlin Wall after all was not built to keep Westerners out. People's pursuit of freedom will make parliamentary democracy the end point in political development. </PARA>
<PARA> I now propose to turn to the major issues facing Australia and outline the principles which I believe ought to guide this great nation in addressing itself to its problems. One of the very great achievements of the previous Government over the past seven years was to bring a sense of realism to the economic problems that we face. There is indeed a consensus in Australia today that the role of government is a limited one. There is indeed a consensus that governments cannot solve all problems. And above all, in terms of economic approach, there is indeed a consensus that governments, like individuals, cannot spend their way out of difficulty. But I think that, so far as the mainstream political parties are concerned, that is where much of the consensus ends. </PARA>
<PARA> There still remains healthy and vigorous debate about the relationship between the private and public sectors. I want to state without qualification that I believe that the private sector is the backbone of our economy. It is with the fortunes of the private sector that our economic well-being rests. In order to ensure a strong private sector there needs to be a very real restraint on the size of government, on the growth of bureaucracy, on the levels of government expenditure and on the taxation revenue collections of the Government because, as we all know, growth of government is at the cost of growth of the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Taxation, while obviously necessary in a society, must be kept at an absolute minimum. Every extra dollar taken by the Government in taxation is a discretionary dollar lost by the taxpayer. Increased taxation is an effective undermining of the economic freedom of individuals. A dollar spent by a government is a dollar that the taxpayer loses control of. It is for that reason that excessive taxation eats away at incentive. Why should a person work hard to earn an extra few dollars if those few dollars are grabbed by the Government for no noticeable reward. I add that Australia is presently labouring under a taxation system which already acts as a great disincentive to enterprise and hard work. The proportion of direct taxation to indirect taxation is one of the highest in the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. We must look at moving in the future to reduce levels of direct taxation by way of redressing this imbalance, mindful of the need to move slowly so as to avoid the unnecessary inflationary consequences of such a change. </PARA>
<PARA> We must also look at reducing levels of Government expenditure and cutting back on the size of the Public Service, though I am realistic enough to understand what a difficult task that may be. I believe that one of the sad consequences of the present recession is that Australians have strayed from some fairly basic principles that have helped build this country into the great land that it is today. I speak of the need for an honest day's work for an honest day's pay and of the importance of reward for enterprise, initiative and risk. It saddens me greatly that some of the entrepreneurial spirit which has permeated Australian society since the days of the early settlers seems to be lost. Australians settled this tough continent with little more than a dream in their eyes and determination in their hearts. The spirit of growth, development and enterprise has taken us to where we are today. Unless we rekindle that spirit, unless governments allow the great potential of all Australians to be unleashed, and unless they offer a greater recognition of the role of the entrepreneur we can expect no more than a slow, sluggish crawl along the path to recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the major economic issues facing Australia, I believe the most important concern wages, unemployment policy, inflation, levels of expenditure and the Budget deficit, and tariff policy. I share the concern of all honourable members for the massive social tragedy that is so blandly represented by unemployment figures. Unemployment, particularly amongst young people, is something which will scar the growth of Australia for many years into the future. It is encumbent upon not only the members of this House, but also all members of the community to direct their energies to achieve the earliest and most effective growth in job opportunities. I am indebted to the Government for providing three models of the options available in dealing with issues of unemployment, inflation and wages in their publication entitled 'Projections of the Australian Economy'. The models, or scenarios, presented to the recent National Economic Summit Conference showed something that we all know, namely, that the creation of real job opportunities and not just artificial short term ones will only come with maximum wage restraint. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth while to note that on the Government's own figures, unemployment and inflation will both be best reduced with maximum wage retraint. The difference, according to the Treasurer (Mr Keating), between an increase in wages of about 3 per cent later this year followed by full quarterly wage indexation and a continuation of the wages pause until April 1984 and then half- yearly partial indexation will be up to 100,000 jobs by June 1986. For 100,000 young Australians that will be the difference between a future of hope and a future of utter despair. The entire community-politicians, businessmen, trade unionists, farmers, self-employed, professional groups and public servants-must all answer the call of the unemployed. For their sake and for the sake of our nation's future they must exercise self-discipline in not pursuing wage increases. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government must also be determined in its resolve to attack inflation with equal if not greater vigour. Inflation is not just an economic statistic. It erodes the savings of families, threatens the security of the investments of the elderly, undermines business confidence, and is a major contributor to high wage demands. It also diminishes the attractiveness of Australia for investors. More importantly, it erodes the living standards of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most disturbing trends in Australia has been the acceptance by many that large Budget deficits can solve our economic problems. It is true that during periods of economic recession, especially when the money market is highly liquid, the funding of large deficits is not as dangerous to the well-being of the economy as it would be in more prosperous times. I believe that we must be ever vigilant to ensure that the deficit does not go out of control. Projections of likely Budget outcomes do and must compel governments to take the necessary tough decisions about the levels of expenditure. We must never let short-term expediency allow us to impose a lasting debt on future generations. When Australia finally starts on the road to recovery a very large Budget deficit will ensure that we take one step forward and two steps back. </PARA>
<PARA> The final economic issue I touch on this evening is that of tariff protection. Australia's total trade is equivalent to 30 per cent of its gross domestic product. By international standards that is a very high proportion. It is also a country with a large manufacturing industrial base and for Australia the issue of levels of protection is an absolutely vital one. The complex issues which surround the protection debate have often been canvassed in this House. Suffice to say that there is a widely held view that Australia should look most seriously at seeking reduction in its levels of protection. </PARA>
<PARA> High levels of protection cause excessive costs to downstream industries, diminishing their internaional competiveness, reducing the ability to grow and provide job opportunities and have a marked inflationary impact. They also greatly weaken Australia's ability to argue for the reduction of overseas trade barriers. They certainly ensure the short-term survival of some industries, most specifically manufacturing industries, though sometimes at the cost of bolstering what may be, in essence, inefficient operations. I believe that Australia must go down the road of reducing levels of protection, though I equally believe that this should not be done with excessive haste or unilaterally. </PARA>
<PARA> Unilateral reduction in levels of protection would cause enormous harm to manufacturing industry without any real benefit in exchange. The most worthwhile approach is that taken by the previous Government, particularly by the Leader of the National Party (Mr Anthony) last year. Australia must continue to seek support for a commitment in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for multilateral reductions in trade barriers. The importance of this is highlighted particularly in my electorate where the products of dairy farmers face the trade war of the European Economic Community. The dangers of going the other way-as one State Premier suggested, of building a wall around Australia-are all too obvious and all too great. A repeat of the world trade war which occurred during the 1930s would cause irreparable harm to Australia's export markets and the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I regard it as a great privilege to have been elected to serve in this Parliament by the people of Gippsland. With this privilege comes a very great responsibility. Throughout my parliamentary career I will endeavour to live up to that responsibility and to serve Gippsland to the fullest extent of my ability. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I congratulate you and Mr Speaker on your elevation to such high positions in this House. My presence here representing the electors of Grey owes a lot to the valuable help and advice I received from my predecessor and wonderful friend, Laurie Wallis, who retrieved the seat for Labor in 1969 and held it through six elections and 10 difficult years in opposition. I wish him and his wife, Val, a long and happy retirement. I also wish to record my deep gratitude to my wife, Mary, my family and the hundreds of magnificent supporters who worked so hard to have me elected. Also, I thank the electors of Grey for showing confidence in me by giving me the opportunity to represent them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a distinct privilege to be able to make my first speech in this House as a member of an incoming Labor Government in which the people of Australia have so positively invested their confidence during what the Governor-General described in his address as 'a time of Australia's gravest financial crisis since the Great Depression fifty years ago'. And it is an honour indeed to serve in that Government under a leader who had already contributed significantly to Australian political, economic and social history a fortnight before this Parliament opened. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) did so by convening, in this chamber, the National Economic Summit Conference which, as the Governor-General has said, successfully laid the foundations for Australia to begin to arrest the serious economic decline and place the economy on a path of sustained, non- inflationary growth. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has already been said and no doubt much more will be said about the value of the Summit in this regard. But there is another side to its achievements which I find very relevant to the times we live in. This aspect is harder to define than are economic and industrial realities. There are no clear cut hallmarks of proof. But I am quite sure, from my close association with the people of a predominantly working class area, the industrial cities making up the Iron Triangle on South Australia's Spencer Gulf, that the Labor Party's stated goal of bringing Australia together was responsible for this Government being given a strong mandate in human terms, one which was quite separate from the mandate to use its policies to restore this nation to a state of material prosperity. I believe that a significant part of the support that Labor received on 5 March derived from the promise to provide a neutral workshop where enough differences of class and financial interest could be tossed into the melting pot to produce a new sense of national identity, of common purpose. People showed that they were fed up with the divisive and deliberately confrontationist policies of the past seven years. Migrants, perhaps more than most, seemed to foresee in Labor's aims a prospect of feeling more Australian in a united country that knew where it was heading. The concept behind the Summit meeting will not be forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA> When Australia holds it bicentenary celebrations in 1988 it will be just 87 years since the signing of the Federal Constitution. There may be a portent in the coincidence that when President Abraham Lincoln delivered his Gettysburg Address in 1863 his first words were:</PARA>
<PARA> Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia still lacks an inspirational parallel to this speech, which has been quoted wherever democracy has been fought for. I believe that the ideals expressed in it are basic to the concept that produced the Summit Conference. Perhaps in our own fourscore and seventh year a Labor Prime Minister will put into words a distinctively Australian ideal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Governor-General's Speech expressed this Government's intention to preserve a viable and efficient steel industry and to work towards a long term development plan. In my electorate there are more than 30,000 people whose livelihoods are either totally or in some degree dependent on the steel industry . The electorate takes in much of Australia's relatively remote and often relatively neglected areas. It covers 90.4 per cent of South Australia, ranging from the fishing industries of the south west coast, through huge tracts of dry- land farming and grazing land, for many years debilitated by drought, up to the Northern Territory border. It is 89,000 square kilometres larger than New South Wales but its secondary industries are few and therefore all the more urgently in need of consolidation in this era of rapid change and rationalisation. The Iron Triangle cities of Whyalla, Port Augusta and Port Pirie owe their industrial basis to what might be called organic rather than planned decentralisation. Whyalla steel originated from iron ore deposits of the nearby Middleback Ranges. Port Augusta was the original heart of Australian National Railways and Port Pirie smelts lead from Broken Hill, just over the border. But the relentlesss process of change, whether national or international in origin, whether recession based or technology based, is now threatening, in the cause of rationalisation-which must be one of the most dehumanised words in the English language-to keep on paring down that collective industrial base at a stage when some expansion is needed just to allow this group of decentralised urban outposts to hold the line. Unemployment is running at well above the national average and, because the options open to the unemployed are fewer than in metropolitan ares, the trauma of insecurity is greater. </PARA>
<PARA> On this score I would like to quote the Premier of South Australia, Mr John Bannon, who, speaking at the Summit Conference, said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is important to remind ourselves that the national economy is made up of a number of interdependent regional economies. It should not be forgotten that many millions of Australians choose to live outside the major urban centres of the eastern seaboard. While we share in the national wealth and aspirations, we often share special regional problems which demand special recognition and attention. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Bannon went on to quote Australia's wartime Prime Minister, Mr John Curtin, who, speaking at a conference on regional planning in Canberra in 1944, said:</PARA>
<PARA> From a national point of view we cannot afford to have areas that are vulnerable, undeveloped, or neglected. Some regions have a direct impact upon the strength of our economy as a whole, and in dealing with them it is imperative we have regard to local knowledge and the knowledge of State officers . Both for reasons of defence and development, special attention must be given to certain parts of the Commonwealth to enable us to minister more effectively to the total strength of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA>I cannot think of any better, immediate example of vulnerable regions than is provided by the cities in which Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd steel making is carried out. Apart from the importance of the industry to the nation, it must be taken into account that each of these branches of the steel industry is the life blood of a separate urban centre rather than forming part of the conglomerate industrial base of a capital city. This means that any reduction in the work force of each branch must have the maximum impact on the general economic and social superstructure of each of these cities. There are no shock absorbers in a one industry town. Any shock wave from loss of jobs in manufacturing is felt immediately in other sectors of the local economy. And the loss of jobs in smaller enterprises outside the main industry but dependent on it can be greater in a regional centre because there are no alternative outlets. The domino effect that followed the loss of the Whyalla shipyard in 1978 gave drastic evidence of this, both in goods producing and service areas. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been acknowledged that many factors have contributed to the present crisis in the Australian steel industry, both global and national. But one overall lesson does emerge. It is that in the production of basic commodities such as steel there can be no exemptions from the technology race. No country is an island in this respect. Sooner or later the choice becomes one of get with it or get out. The proper role of government protection is to provide a breathing space so that an industry which has fallen behind can reinvest, retool and catch up with world standards of productivity. Protection merely for the sake of maintaining corporate profits without placing any burden on investors leads inevitably to a day of reckoning as the industry discovered in the United States . Any protection given to Australian steel must carry with it an absolute commitment to the necessary reinvestment and the long term security of the industry and its work force. In a highly competitive industry innovation as well as high technology is necessary to ensure survival. BHP has carried out this obligation in the case of two products of its Whyalla works-a particularly rugged type of railway line, at least equal to top world standard, and an ingeniously designed steel sleeper which is now under test both here and overseas. However, the hoped-for minerals boom which would have helped assure a healthy local market for these products did not materialise and Australian sales will now have to depend largely on upgrading and expansion of our national railway system. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad to note that the Governor-General's Speech forecasts measures to improve the efficiency of national rail services and to upgrade designated railway routes of national importance. Because South Australia had the foresight some years ago to have its main railways incorporated into the national standard gauge system, its technical capacity, including that of the Port Augusta works, is well geared to contribute to such a project. I hope that the budgetary restraint dictated by this Government's unfortunate economic legacy will not enforce too much delay in such a vital and long overdue national enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to be characteristic of our society that changes foreshadowed in the means of production are ignored for as long as possible by those who should be planning ahead in the hope that they will go away. Then, almost overnight, the inevitable is accepted as imminent, and something like panic sets in. The spectre that now haunts wherever people are employed on routine process work is that of high technology. The vision is of a work force displaced by robots and computers. We are sometimes warned by well-intentioned people that we must ration the onset of such technological change so that social changes required to cope with it can keep pace. This would be ideal but it has never happened yet. </PARA>
<PARA> In our system of competitive free enterprise, it is the producers who decide the means they will use. They do not have to ask anybody's permission as to when they will exchange workers for automatic machines. Even companies cannot hold up the chain reaction indefinitely. Government protection can only slow it down. Nor can workers' organisations do any better. Ultimately they are faced with a no-win situation. In any company that has been driven to the wall by competitors using labour-saving technology employees face either the prospect of a good many of them losing their jobs if the company decides to increase productivity by automation, or all of them losing their jobs if it does not, and shuts up shop. If workers had any choice in this it would be Hobson's choice. </PARA>
<PARA> The big danger here is that the most efficient technology, because it is the most expensive, will become concentrated in ever fewer hands. Productivity and worker redundancy will skyrocket at the same time. When that happens either something will already have been done about increasing the purchasing power and safeguarding standards of displaced workers or we will face economic and social upsets that will make today's troubles look like a hypochondriac's headache. I prefer to think that, under Labor, this country will see progressive measures taken to anticipate future developments in industry. </PARA>
<PARA> We should establish measures such as regional planning to maintain existing industrial centres which are affected by change. This can be achieved by means of decentralisation incentives for craft-based or otherwise labour intensive activities, such as a continuing program, wherever needed, of job creation by public works of real community or national value, and by progress towards a goal of providing opportunity for education of any kind for anyone at any time of life. It is not enough to have such education and training available to those who can afford to buy it or those who are in specially disadvantaged circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> If structural unemployment is to become a part of life for the future, alternative scope for self-advancement must be freely accessible to all. In relation to this, I commend the undertaking given in the Governor-General's Speech that encouragement will be given to developments designed to equip young people to engage in innovative enterprises. Attention will be given to possibilities of providing fulfilment in life for some of the people alongside the conventional production system. The kind of lateral thinking that has produced what we now refer to as alternative lifestyles will need not only the stamp of approval but also some real material assistance. Coming from a high unemployment area, I am sure there is endless scope here for gaining a community contribution from lives that would otherwise be largely wasted in frustration. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also room for government as well as corporate backing in another kind of alternative enterprise; that is, research into alternative energy. For example, Australia used to be a world leader in solar energy innovation. It is not now. The experience of a team of researchers at Sydney University some five years ago gives more than a hint as to why. This team had developed an advanced solar heating technique to a stage where commercial viability was in sight. Then it ran out of funds. In the absence of any Australian interest, it sought and received $5m from Saudi Arabia in return for the marketing rights covering most of the world. When the team had further developed the product to a commercially viable stage, it tried again for manufacturing outlets. Again, it had to look overseas. A Japanese company was licensed to cover the remainder of the world, except Australia. Finally, two Australian companies agreed to collaborate in local production, but only with massive support from the New South Wales Government. That, I understand, is the end of the story so far. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the notorious timidity of Australian investors in the area of risk capital, Australia not only has lost an incalculable amount of export revenue but also may never see another home grown invention. It is an old and sad story. I am particularly interested in it because I believe there should be a national research effort-perhaps joint government and corporate-into solar and wind energy, at least. I am even prepared to suggest that the semi-arid zone in the near north of South Australia, with an abundance of sun and wind that would be hard to rival, would be an ideal site. There is Federal assistance for solar energy research through the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council. Last year it made $1.5m available for research into solar energy and related fields. There were enough applications to use 20 times that amount. </PARA>
<PARA> The Governor-General's Speech predicted a significant Australian contribution to the world communications year of 1983. This is a key subject. There is no field of human endeavour that cannot gain by better communication or lose by the lack of it. We live in an age in which the gathering, processing and distribution of information has become a major industry in itself. The machinery and techniques are there. The trained people are there and all are gaining rapidly in scope and potential. The only flaw so far has been that often the sources of information were restricted, censored beyond usefulness, or completely sealed off to the public at large. Where accurate and complete information is denied there are always misleading rumours, fabrications and floods of trivia to fill the vacuum. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Economic Summit Conference set a new standard in public access. This is only a start. Broadening of the Freedom of Information Act and rejuvenation of the rundown Australian Broadcasting Commission are just two of the projected measures that must make for a better informed and, therefore, more responsible nation. Only responsible nations can help preserve peace in this world of ours. If it were possible to make the whole truth freely and objectively available to all people all the time, there would be no wars. I commend the Governor-General's Speech to this House as a basis on which sound administration and creative effort can combine to set this nation on a new and constructive course. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I now refer to the famous Tasmanian Wilderness Society, which has influenced the schools. Regrettably, most of the teaching fraternity in Tasmania has been influenced by the Wilderness Society. I am afraid that it has indoctrinated many children in Tasmania, who seem to think that that badge, bearing the words 'No Dams', is everything. It has become more than an issue about a works program, about a dam or about providing power for Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The float in the Moomba parade indicates the lengths this group will go to to influence the young people of Australia. It has become more than an issue of a dam; it has become a cause. A few paragraphs from a letter from the Wilderness Society would indicate how well organised it has become and how adept it has become in influencing the Press-the Press which has become so left wing on this issue that it is not funny. I do not care what the Press writes about me but some of the journalists should be ashamed at the way they have distorted the facts about the construction of this dam in Tasmania. They have shown only one side of the story; they have said nothing about the workmen of the Hydro-Electric Commission or what will happen to the contractors who will try to get jobs through the HEC. Mr Hawke said that they will find other employment. Where in Tasmania will they find jobs? What will happen to Tasmania' s future electricity needs if the project is stopped? These matters have not been considered. The dam issue has been seen as an expedient way of gaining votes but it has brought about the loss of seats, and the Government should be ashamed of itself. We need to fight this issue right to the very end.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, may I first congratulate you and Mr Speaker on your election to your high offices. My electorate of Melbourne is one with special problems. It is both the centre of the State's business, social and cultural life and a residential area with difficulties imposed on its suburbs because of their proximity to the city's heart. The people of the electorate have asked me, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, to represent their problems, their needs and their aspirations. For that I both thank them and assure them that I will undertake that task with energy and conviction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take over the seat at a time when the voters of Melbourne have the advantage of a Federal Labor Government following just one year after the election of a State Labor administration. The great humanitarian policies of Labor can now be undertaken without the hindrance of one or other government representing private interests against the public good. The only barrier to our programs is the legacy of mismanagement we have inherited from the conservative and irresponsible regimes of the past. I will say more on that later. </PARA>
<PARA> Melbourne's inner urban communities have many advantages and many disadvantages emanating from their geography. These suburbs have undergone demographic changes , from small beginnings at Fitzroy, as one of Melbourne's early upper class residential areas, through a much longer period of suburbs of working class cottages and manufacturing industry to the massive changes of post-war immigration and the return of middle and upper income earners in recent years. The middle to upper income earners, moving back to escape the problems of transporting themselves daily from outer suburbia and because of the social and cultural benefits, have much to thank the post-war migrants for. The new migrant communities found that the inner suburbs offered two advantages. The communal living style allowed them to share the problems of the new environment and this style was more akin to the buildings and cities they had either lived in or knew in their countries of birth. The changes they made to the demography and lifestyle of these suburbs led in turn to the suburbs becoming valuable residential prospects for the new generation of affluent Australians 30 and 40 years later. </PARA>
<PARA> The sad irony is that the increasing resultant costs of inner urban living have forced out of the area many of the working class and migrants who changed the quality of inner urban life. Today we are left with a unique social mix. However , the majority of inner urban dwellers remain working class and migrant families , with a growing proportion of elderly people who have lived in these areas all their lives. We have a higher than average percentage of migrants-in particular, a substantial Greek population in Richmond, an Italian influence in Carlton, a mixture of nationalities in Brunswick and high rise estates in Richmond, Fitzroy , Collingwood, North Melbourne and Kensington, where past conservative governments have thrown the latest arrivals without any communication with, or consideration for the impact on, the local communities. The Vietnamese community is the latest of these arrivals. Before them we had the Latin Americans, the Turkish community and the Arab-speaking refugees and migrants. The question is not that these people ought not to be there but that Federal and State governments ought not to expect the existing community to meet the costs of special services and facilities required. Past conservative, uncaring governments have ignored local government and communities in these exercises. </PARA>
<PARA> The inner urban community also has a larger than average percentage of welfare recipients and unemployed. This is understandable as the very advantages that the new affluent find in inner urban living also attract the traditional inner urban poor. These people recognise that the public and private welfare network is available to meet their minimal needs, and indeed for many of these people the inner urban suburbs provide the difference between a minimal living and death. Just last week a young girl died in the city square in the metropolitan area of Melbourne. I think that is an indictment on society today. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the special needs of all these groups-the aged, working people, welfare recipients, the unemployed, single and homeless people, ethnic communities and Aboriginals-the inner urban areas have suffered under years of anti-Labor, anti-working class government. ALP local government authorities have attempted to offset the imbalance by a network of services and are to be commended for their caring and humanitarian approach. Naturally they have suffered because of the lack of funds, because of the withdrawal of funds and because of the diversion of desperately needed public funds to greedy private interests and big business friends of the former Liberal-National Party Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Councils are also limited by the levels at which they can rate working class ratepayers. Since 1975 many services have suffered by being abolished altogether or, in most cases, by the real value of grants and subsidies being reduced drastically. Despite the obvious economic problems, it is essential that Labor governments restore these services to a level which allows them to service the community's needs. This matter was covered by the Governor-General when he opened this Parliament. He referred to the Government's deep commitment to eliminate poverty and gross inequality, to raise unemployment benefits for single adults and to undertake initiatives for child care, lone parents, the aged, the widowed, invalids, the disabled and the sick. We must and will co- operate with State governments in providing services and finance and ensuring moneys made available from all levels of government are channelled into the areas of need in the most advantageous manner. These services will be seen as a right and not some charity tossed out by the rich. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some specific needs. The aged, mentioned specifically by the Governor-General, require services allowing them to operate at home and remain at home for as long as possible. Many of these people have never lived anywhere other than the inner urban areas. When they are forced to leave home alternative accommodation must be nearby. It must be located in the community to which they relate. Local and State government subsidies for basic services must meet the real costs of these services. </PARA>
<PARA> Health care is a major problem in the Melbourne electorate. Often the inner suburbs are told they are advantaged because most major public hospitals are located there. But the realities of health care are that few beds are available for long term nursing patients or basic day care services. The beds in the inner urban areas serve the whole community. </PARA>
<PARA> In opening this Parliament, the Government has again committed itself to an Office of Aged Care and to the provision of hostel and community care services. The demolition of the principle of health care as a right by our dreadful, unfeeling predecessors, who served the private profiteers of the health industry , has placed health care beyond the reach of so many people. Thousands of people in my electorate have been unable to seek medical attention for serious illness because they could not afford the high cost. Many others, having sought care, have been unable to afford the medicine prescribed. This suffering and misery is a damning indictment of years of Liberal rule and our Labor policy will alleviate these problems. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there is a need for expansion of the community health program within the electorate. Most existing centres do not have a doctor which one might consider is a major disadvantage in providing adequate and proper health care. The great advantages of community health care over private health care are the cost advantage of salaried professionals and particularly the more caring approach and the benefits of educational and preventive health programs. The former Medibank system was criticised by the Opposition for its costs but an analysis will show the system did not create the costs; it was its abuse by the private sector. That abuse will be controlled under the new Medicare system. </PARA>
<PARA> Housing is another key area. In my electorate the proportion of home rental to home ownership is much higher than in the general community. As so many people are either on low incomes or on benefits of one form or another, rental costs on the private market are prohibitive. This is exacerbated by the arrival of the new affluent, causing housing prices to soar and therefore affecting the market rental values for those who simply cannot afford them. The need for funding to ease these housing problems is acute. This is another area where the combined resources and wills of Federal and State Labor administrations is invaluable. This Government, like its Victorian State counterpart, is committed to increase significantly public housing availability and low cost rental accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> Another network that has suffered under conservative governments has been the public child care services. Once again, the real value of subsidies has decreased alarmingly and once again the previous Government introduced a user- pays principle to what ought to be a basic right. Under the previous Government' s guidelines, working class families were reduced to sub-poverty incomes by child care costs. Children's services development officers employed by local government have provided invaluable service in this area but their work has continually been under unfair pressure by doubts about funding for their positions and continued battles with bureaucracies and Ministers to maintain funding. In this and many other areas where workers service vital community needs, funding must be provided on a programmatic basis, allowing workers to undertake the jobs they are employed to do and not waste so much of their valuable time fighting for their positions. </PARA>
<PARA> Transport is another area of concern within the Melbourne electorate. The inner suburbs, as a channel to the city centre, suffer massive social disruption, pollution and safety problems. Again, these have been exacerbated by years of conservative rule. The voices of Labor voters in safe Labor seats are far less influential on the private profiteers of the Liberal Party than are the voices of the motor industry, the rubber industry or the oil industry. New regions of unplanned car suburbs totally or inadequately serviced by public transport, have spawned around Melbourne since the 1940s. Once again, the Federal Government must assist the State Government to tip the balance of transport finance in favour of the public sector. The large ethnic communities of inner Melbourne will benefit from ALP policies which highlight improved community relations, increased funds for teachers of English as a second language and increase support for adult migrant education services. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Government will support democratically elected ethnic community organisations and migrant resource centres. We will restore adequate translation and interpreter services which were decimated by the present Opposition during its time in government. We will attack specific problems of non-English-speaking people in the work place, including industrial health and safety and the gross exploitation of migrant women by bosses. We will accept political refugees without the political discrimination of our predecessors and we will give priority to family reunions. </PARA>
<PARA> The ALP policy of full consultation with Aboriginals has a special place in my electorate. The questions of land rights, Aboriginal health, housing, education and other areas of interest to the Aboriginal community must be resolved and determined by the Aboriginal people alone. These people have chosen to live within the electorate of Melbourne and I will give them every assistance to receive the opportunities and resources they require. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other areas on which I will take part in debate during the course of this session and the next one. They include world peace and the dangers of nuclear war, the question of unemployment and of employment creation programs, and the accord between the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the ALP. I feel very deeply about the need for a discussion within this Parliament on the future of the youth of this country. As I said earlier, when a young person can die in the city square of an overdose of drugs in broad daylight it tells something about the state of our society. Honourable members opposite, who were led by the Frasers, the Howards and the Anthonys, have a lot to answer for in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe we face an exciting period in Australian history. In the past year, at State and finally Federal level, the people of this country have given Labor a mandate to provide socialist solutions to the great problems of society. They have clearly displayed a preference for the public sector over the private sector. Since 1975 they have seen public resources diverted to the rich and powerful national and international friends of the previous Government. They have seen the public sector stifled and shrunk and basic services removed while billions of dollars are handed gratis to industry. They have seen working people taxed more and more heavily with no returns. They have seen the rich and powerful taxed less and less, while receiving the massive handouts of public funding. They have seen this country financially crippled by mismanagement. They have seen the irony of more and more people thrown on to the economic scrap-heap . Their disgust has been expressed at the ballot box. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian people have espoused a socialist philosophy as the answer to our economic crisis. They have given this Government the green light to redirect the economy in a proper and responsible manner, to use public funds for the public good, to tell the proponents of private enterprise that if they believe in private enterprise there is something incongruous about their screaming continually for assistance from the public purse. Australian and transnational capital has become notable for its desire to capitalise its profits and socialise its losses, to hoard millions and play dog-eat-dog on the stock exchange, while asking the unemployed, the work force, working people, through their taxes, through the public purse, to carry their losses. </PARA>
<PARA> The capitalist system-the system championed by the Liberal and National Parties -is immoral and, I believe, corrupt. I believe the Australian people have recognised that. The political guardians of that system, the Liberal and National Parties, thankfully restored to the Opposition benches where they can remain harmless, have done Australians a disservice for which they ought to be publicly tried. The opportunity for that trial may come about during the Bruce by-election and in the by-election for the crazy grazier's electorate of Wannon. Had these people been responsible for the finances of a public company, they would have been charged and gaoled for their blatant and heinous mismanagement of the Australian economy. They are no better, in my view, than corporate criminals and I hope that at least they will exercise the decency to remain silent in their Opposition foxholes while this Government undertakes the dual task of restoring the economy to equilibrium and restoring the public sector to its rightful role as provider for the basic rights and needs of all Australians. </PARA>

I only wish that it were true of his leadership and his Ministry also to acknowledge their socialism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We should all bear it in mind that the speech made by the Governor-General on the occasion of the opening of the thirty-third Parliament was penned by the Government or, more likely, by the Government speech writers and not His Excellency. It is important to remind interested parties of this because the inconsistencies and contradictions in the speech should not be attributed to a pre-eminent jurist of the stature of the Governor-General. I suppose one can say that the Government's program outlined by the Governor-General is consistent in its inconsistency. </PARA>
<PARA> In preparing a form of words, the authors of the address had the difficult task of marrying four lengthy documented series of undertakings. They had to try not to depart too much from each of the Australian Labor Party's election policies, a prices and incomes accord signed with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the so-called agreement in the form of a communique issued at the conclusion of the so-called National Economic Summit Conference and the Australian Labor Party 's policy platform in its entirety. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is something of a pragmatist and even those who demand strict observance or adherence to ALP policy which theoretically binds the Prime Minister are bound, I suspect, to be disappointed. Whatever is in the Governor-General's Speech which is at odds with policy as determined by the Labor Party's hierarchy may not see the light of day . We already know that policies enunciated by the Prime Minister during the election campaign are not enforceable, nor are many of the more attractive of them likely to be adopted. Other speakers have dwelt and will dwell on that circumstance in the course of this debate and over the life of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Two more recent documents of more immediate interest are the prices and incomes accord and the communique. Inconsistencies and contradictions in these two documents are all the more important because of the determination of a powerful section of the ACTU to see provisions in the prices and incomes accord override alleged agreement by big government, big business and big unions following the so-called Economic Summit. It does not take a Rhodes scholar to work out that the wording of the accord and the words of the communique are not complementary in many respects. Important differences between the wording in the accord and in the communique have already led to chinks in the trade union-ALP axis. </PARA>
<PARA> The accord professed to set out details of policies to be implemented by this Government. Already personal tax reductions promised in the accord have been abandoned. With the abandonment of tax reductions, one could be excused for wondering whether the unions consider themselves released from their explicit and implicit obligations in the terms of the accord. After all, some unions may very well take the view that because the Government has not kept an important- some may say the most important-part of its bargain in relation to tax reductions unionists are not bound to accept their obligations under the accord. Many unionists already realise that this Government has ratted on them by abandoning promised tax reductions. </PARA>
<PARA> The corporate sector, too, may have already noticed that there are some inconsistencies affecting it. The private sector, the predominant employer and creator of wealth, is only just coming to terms with a Labor Government. The private sector is feeling its way, testing the water so to speak. Many who are not numbered amongst the army of employees relying on the Australian taxpayer for their salary or wage are waiting for the promised sense of direction for the Australian economy. They have heard the words and await the substance. They are not reassured by talk about increased taxation, promises to be forgone and talk of more and more government regulation and controls. They deplore the absence of realis- able goals and the substitution of controls. The private sector of the Australian economy is, at the very best, apprehensive. It craves knowledge of the real intentions of the Government. The private sector awaits evidence of this Government's ability to govern and to deliver on the few remaining promises it has said it will now honour. To illustrate the sort of uncertainty that exists I quote the communique which condescendingly acknowledges that:</PARA>
<PARA> Government policies in respect of charges and taxation should . . . be aimed at stimulating the private sector, especially in potential growth areas, to enlarge the opportunities for job creation. </PARA>
<PARA>They are very fine sentiments indeed. But the accord talks also about such things as eliminating corporate tax loopholes, abolishing investment allowances and introducing a resource rental tax. On top of that, company groups will not, after all, be able to consolidate their overall trading results before their tax liabilities are assessed, nor will the promise be kept to remove undistributed profits taxes payable by private companies. So much for any genuine concern on the part of this Government for policies aimed at stimulating the private sector ; so much for genuine commitment to enlarge the opportunities for job creation by stimulating the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The private sector must view with some scepticism a new-found enchantment of the ALP with private enterprise. Let us have a quick look at what it implies it might do in relation to housing. The Government's conversion, or seeming conversion, to support for private home ownership in Australia would be commendable if it were believable. Its new-found friendships with building industry groups is also laudable but will endure only if and when the Government delivers on the expectations it has created and is creating. Nothing gleaned from the Government's rhetoric to date leaves anyone having an understanding of the building and construction industry with grounds for confidence. It is empty rhetoric, for example, to undertake to ensure that adequate funds are available for housing. More than adequate funds are already available. If the Government is talking about funds for public housing it will already know that the previous Government increased funding for the current financial year by a real 15 per cent, to $333m. This year funding for public housing is at record levels as a result of the decisions of the previous Government. To maintain record levels of funding into the next year, the Government must so order its responsibilities. But it is irresponsible to leave anyone under the impression that inordinate funding is not already currently available. If the Government is alluding to ensuring adequate funds are available to the private sector it does not need a series of meetings and months of procrastination to discover that ample funds are available. All that the Ministers responsible for these areas needed to do to establish that fact was to pick up a phone and ring half a dozen responsible people from banks and building societies around the country. </PARA>
<PARA> In speaking to building industry groups, the Government claims a unique initiative. Let me tell the Government that for each year I have been in this place those groups have initiated numerous submissions and discussions with the previous Government. Written evidence in the form of submissions of those initiatives would reach half way up the wall in my office if they were stacked on the flat. So, when this Government claims something new and something wonderful by way of consultation with the building and housing industry, it does so out of a total lack of experience and knowledge. As with so much of its claimed achievement to date in relation to the economy, its only claim to fame in connection with housing is that various Ministers have had a series of meetings and that those meetings will continue. Empty words and endless meetings are no substitute for action. If the Government is convinced it has the answers it should announce and implement them immediately. It should not need two more weeks to present its mini-Budget after seven years of waiting to implement its housing policies. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing is clear: Those who may have been consoled by the repetitious use of the soothing words like 'reconciliation', 'recovery', 'reconstruction', ' consensus' and 'consultation' are bound to be disappointed. A great deal has been said already about the absence of adequate representation at the much- vaunted Summit Conference. We are already aware that consumers and small businesses were seriously under-represented and that the only alternative Government was not even invited to have representatives present. The implications of those omissions for claimed consensus are apparent to even the most naive. It seems that with the passage of time the only durable agreement reached was an agreement to issue a communique. The effectiveness of that document lasted less than 48 hours. </PARA>
<PARA> His Excellency's Speech is dotted with words like 'review' or derivations of the word along with 'inquiry' and 'considering the establishment' of something or other. In other words, in many areas in which the public may have expected the Government to act, its action consists of reviewing, considering or inquiring. Its Ministry being comprised of men who have been in this Parliament for many years, one would have thought the Government would have known where it was going and what it intended to do. That was certainly the impression given to the electorate during the election campaign. It seems that the Australian public can expect more inquiries, procrastination and deferment of decision-making at a time when economic and social factors warrant immediate, although maybe politically unpopular, decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told by this Government in the Governor-General's Speech that there is an undertaking to develop a strong, competitive manufacturing industry. But the Government will not reduce existing protection. How will our manufacturing industry ever become competitive if it is not confronted with competition from imported goods? On the one hand, we will apparently have a strong, competitive industry and, on the other hand, we will finance and featherbed expansion of the Australian shipping industry. We are promised a strong, competitive manufacturing industry at the same time as preserving a viable and efficient steel industry. The Government will encourage competition while it promises to review-there is that word again-temporary assistance and anti-dumping measures. We are told that this Government will do all these things for Australian industries. In the area of trade, it expects to be able to ensure that markets for Australian exports are made secure. Those promised acts are plainly not compatible even to the economically illiterate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Governor-General's Speech acknowledges that better industrial relations are essential in the achievement of national economic recovery. That is something of an understatement because any industrial relations will be better than those experienced over the last 10 years or so-at least I and a great majority of the Australian people hope so although I do not think many of us are particularly confident. In calling for better industrial relations the Government said it will also strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of the Public Service. Despite that so-called objective, this Government intends to repeal legislation which it claims restricts the freedom of Commonwealth employees to exercise what is euphemistically said to be 'their basic industrial rights'. That action will once again enshrine the ludicrous situation whereby the taxpayers of Australia will be required to pay salaries of public servants who may attend their work places in times of industrial turmoil but not work. Public servants will be free once again to be paid while taking industrial action such as sit-ins which, in other days, would be regarded as unpaid strike action. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that, although this Government promised to give the highest priority to measures to create jobs and restore economic growth, it is far from confident of its ability to do so. It gives a clue to its lack of confidence in its plans to see more young people complete their secondary educations and go on to tertiary education regardless of ability thereby effectively passing problems which flow from poor economic performance on to the education system in general and teachers, educators and taxpayers in particular. If that were not enough, this Government intends to examine co-operatively-whatever that may mean-the possibility of providing fulfilment in life for some of our people alongside the conventional production system. Without being too critical, that seems to be saying with buzz words that Australian taxpayers will finance people into alternative unproductive lifestyles. If it does mean that the Government may care to make it clearer than do the form of words it inflicted on the Governor- General. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of things in the Governor-General's Speech which should be canvassed. Among them is the proposed creation of even more statutory authorities-more qangos-signalling the relentless march towards corporate government which is to be centered in Canberra. Another cause for concern is the move away from Parliament as the supreme debating chamber and decision-maker towards so-called consultative councils, committees and groups, not elected by or representative of the Australian people. If we take the example of that now infamous communique on which the Prime Minister relies for back-tracking on election promises, we can reasonably anticipate the political justification to be given for future double-takes. No tame-cat council or body can be allowed to become an acceptable vehicle for extra-parliamentary decision-making. If that is what is meant by parliamentary reform mentioned in the Governor-General's Speech , the Government is on notice that its actions will not go unnoticed or unopposed by either the Opposition parties or the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has properly identified the restoration of economic growth as its number one priority. That should be enough to keep the Government busy. I recommend it gets on with that job and stops chasing every rabbit down every burrow. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to begin by joining the other maiden speakers and other speakers in congratulating you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and Mr Speaker on your elevation to high offices. The Address-in-Reply debate is traditionally a debate in which honourable members have the opportunity of presenting their viewpoints on some subject or subjects which they regard as being of particular significance. I begin by expressing a few thoughts about my electorate of Sydney which, as I am sure most honourable members are aware, is one of the safest Labor seats in Australia. In fact, it is the second safest. In the last election, the Australian Labor Party was returned with a 74.6 per cent two-party preferred vote. I regard that as predominantly reflecting the social composition of that electorate. It is a traditional inner city working class electorate though, like other inner city working class electorates, it has undergone some substantial social change in recent times. In that respect, it is rather similar to the electorate of my colleague, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Hand). For one thing, there has been a substantial influx of people of non-Australian origin. There has also been a significant influx of people of middle and upper-middle class origin. In fact, if one looks at the electorate one finds there are some streets which contain some of the most expensive real estate in Sydney-for example, Louisa Road, Balmain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By contrast, Marrickville in the south of the electorate is a working-class area with a high composition of people of Greek, Yugoslav and Portuguese descent . So it is a very heterogeneous electorate in social, cultural and ethnic terms. The electorate, of course, also retains a fairly substantial component of its former traditional residents. But interestingly enough, despite the much referred to trendification of the area, it still remains overwhelmingly a Labor area. Even in the subdivisions which are most significantly affected by the middle class influx which has been referred to, the Labor Party's two-party preferred vote has in fact undergone only a fairly small decline. That says something about the type of people, commonly referred to as middle class, who have moved into these areas. They are frequently people in the lower white collar bracket-people such as school teachers and social workers, people who work in occupations which have been traditionally regarded as white collar but have become increasingly proletarianised, if I can use that term, in recent years. Their basic position as sellers of their labour power, deriving their income from that activity, is starting to show in an increased propensity to industrial action. So I would expect that, contrary to some projections that have been made, the electorate of Sydney will remain a Labor electorate for some considerable time. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point I would like to pay tribute to the work of the party membership in the electorate. We have an extremely large party membership. I happen to believe that, notwithstanding the fact that it is a safe Labor electorate by virtue of its social composition, the consolidation of the Labor vote that has taken place over many decades and the future consolidation of the Labor vote are largely dependent on the activities of unpaid party workers in that electorate. I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation of their activity. </PARA>
<PARA> It is gratifying to be elected to parliament at the same time as a Labor government which in Australian terms is historically a fairly rare event, unfortunately, at the Federal level at least. I can recall that in the aftermath of the 1977 Federal election, which was a disastrous outcome for the Labor Party , various commentators and various pop-sociologists were predicting the demise of the Labor Party as a significant political force. People like David Kemp, the Liberal Party's leading ideologist at the time, were saying that the Labor Party had become irrelevant because it was a class-based party, that unless the Labor Party were to abandon its position of being the representative of working people in this country, unless it switched its position, it had no political future. People were saying that the Labor Party would have to look at examining public opinion polls to see which particular value preference was prevailing in the community at any given point in time to make sure it appealed to some substantial section. Presumably, extensive opinion polling would be used to find out what the current values of the community were. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, the Labor Party has not pursued this course; it has not done what David Kemp recommended. It explicitly reaffirmed its commitment to the socialist objective at the special national conference in 1981. Despite that we have seen in the last couple of years the strengthening of Labor's position to a degree where it would be difficult to find an historical parallel, with control of both the Federal Government and four mainland State governments. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a statement of the obvious that this Government is coming to power in a period of extreme difficulty, with severe recessionary conditions and a rate of unemployment unparalleled at least since the Depression years, the deterioration of Australia's industrial base and the decline in industrial investment. All of these things are readily apparent and undoubtedly are a real problem for any government coming to power at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a certain parallel between what we are facing now and what the Whitlam Government faced. The Whitlam Government came to power at a very inopportune time. The world recession was hitting, back in 1974-75, at the end of the post- World War II boom which produced unprecedented rises in real living standards. That boom period came to an end and Labor was unfortunate enough to have been elected to power then. The conservative forces were very successful in sheeting home the blame for difficulties which Australia experienced at that time to policies of the Whitlam Labor Government. The present Government likewise finds itself in a period of depressed economic conditions, of severe stagflation, in respect of which conventional economic remedies have shown themselves to be ineffectual. We have had a protracted period of that now. However, this Government has been elected, with a fairly widespread community understanding that it is not possible to turn the situation around dramatically in the short term, and that is undoubtedly an advantage which the Whitlam Government did not enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that this Government is operating under incredible difficulties. It faces a public sector financing problem of unprecedented magnitude, even going back to the Depression years, not just in terms of the magnitude of the deficit that it is currently experiencing, which is predominantly the result of depressed economic conditions, but also in terms of the burden of refinancing a substantial amount of maturing debt incurred to finance earlier deficits. That adds up to an enormously difficult public sector financing problem. It would be dishonest to assert that that does not place significant contraints on the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have seen is the election of a Labor government in an historical period , if we take a global view, when electorates throughout virtually the entire Western advanced industrialised world have been exhibiting unprecedented volatility. In the late 1970s until around 1980 we saw the election of some governments of the radical Right. I am referring to the Reagan Administration in the United States of America and the Thatcher Government in Britain. There was a widespread view expressed that electorates were responding to the difficult economic circumstances of the 1970s by making a decisive switch to the Right. That impression was shattered a couple of years later with the election of socialist governments-left of centre governments-in France, Greece, Sweden, Spain and more recently Portugal. The interpretation that some commentators have put on this whole situation is that the electorate has become more volatile, more prone to throw out whatever government happens to be in power at a particular point in time, whether it be a government of the Left or the Right. Arguably, Australia could be included in that category. Some commentators have constructed what they term a misery index which is the arithemetic sum of the unemployment and inflation rates. They have suggested that any government which is presiding over a figure of 20 for the arithmetic sum of the unemployment and inflation rates is in pretty severe difficulties. Virtually no government in the Western world which has had to face an election under those circumstances has been able to survive. One could argue that this current election is a continuation of that trend. </PARA>
<PARA> But coupled with the increased volatility of the electorate, the searching around for new political solutions, we have also seen a search for different economic approaches. As I have said, conventional economic approaches based on Keynesianism, which has been the predominant view of economics throughout the Western world since the Second World War, have been found wanting. We have been faced with the apparent ineffectiveness of traditional Keynesian remedies of demand management and so on, to maintain full employment; and also the undermining of the traditional view that there existed a trade-off between inflation and unemployment, that one could reduce unemployment at some cost in inflation and the fact that that trade-off no longer seems to apply. These sorts of considerations have resulted in a look for new economical alternatives. Likewise, as there has been a resurgence of the Right in the strictly political sphere, so in the area of economic theory the Right has experienced a resurgence with the emergence of monetarism and so-called supply-side economics and a reaffirmation of the virtue of unfettered market forces and allowing the economy to be run by the free operation of those forces. These approaches, though all emanating from the political Right, are logically distinct and sometimes lead to contradictory economic prescriptions, as shown by clashes between the supply- siders and monetarists over the burgeoning United States budget deficit. These sorts of views have re-emerged and have formed the ideological rationale for an enormous assault-</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We saw a re-emergence of a rightist ideology in the economic sphere and that provided the rationale for the programs of savage cuts in the public sector and in the social wage in a number of countries in the Western world in recent times, for example, in Britain, the United States of America and here. That has clearly acted to exacerbate the already substantial existing pattern of inequality, a pattern that, notwithstanding Australia's egalitarian pretensions, is a very significant factor here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If people have any doubts on that score I would like to refer them to an article by Phillip Rascall, an academic at the Kuring-Gai College of Advanced Education, who published in 1978 in the Journal of Australian Political Economy an analysis of wealth distribution in Australia, which established that the top 5 per cent of people in Australia possessed more wealth than the bottom 90 per cent. He made reference to the enormous lack of data in Australia on this whole question at the moment. That is something that ought to be remedied. There is no doubt that Australia is a very unequal society, notwithstanding its egalitarian pretensions.</PARA>
<PARA> I think it would be true to say that the conservative economic doctrines I have referred to-that is to say monetarism, supply-side economics-the idea that if tax rates for individuals and business are cut there will be an increased incentive to work, to save and to invest and that that will generate an economic resurgence and an increase in tax revenue that would compensate for the cuts in the original tax rates-and the anti-public sector sentiment, have had a pretty good field trial in a number of Western countries in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA> In Britain, under the Iron Lady, Margaret Thatcher, we have seen a rise in bankruptcies and unemployment and a decline in Britain's industrial position going on apace. We have seen in effect the beginnings of the progressive deindustrialisation of that country and the destruction of the real capacity of that economy to produce goods and services. The policies of monetarism applied in the British context have done, I would suggest, irreparable damage to that economy.</PARA>
<PARA> Likewise, in the United States we have seen for a period a reasonably doctrinaire application of monetarism. In October 1979 the Chairman of the United States Federal Reserve Board-Volcker-announced that in future instead of targeting interest rates, that body would be seeking to achieve certain set targets for the rate of growth of monetary aggregates. That became the doctrine of the Federal Reserve Board, which has a degree of autonomy in the operations of the United States economy not possessed by any comparable body here. We certainly do not see the sort of commentary in the Australian Press on the rate of growth of the monetary aggregates that is seen in the United States Press.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result one of the key propositions of monetarism-the idea that the rate at which money circulates in the economy is essentially constant-was fairly decisively refuted by what happened last year. The United States economy went into recession largely because of the fact that, in setting the monetary targets , there was a failure to anticipate a reduction in the velocity of circulation of money. Hence the setting of the monetary targets had a far greater depressive effect on the United States economy than was originally anticipated. There is no doubt that that was a major factor in the recession which occurred in the United States thereafter and which is still continuing to afflict that economy.</PARA>
<PARA> The demise of monetarism has become very apparent in the present year. Earlier this year-a couple of months ago-Volcker, the original architect of the monetarist policies, was forced to acknowledge that henceforth they would not be paying such close attention to the rate of growth of the money supply. In fact he has allowed the money supply to blow out beyond any previously set targets. As a consequence there has been a fall in interest rates which has generated secondary effects. It has produced stock market boom which is partly a mere technical adjustment of people's portfolios as a consequence of the fall. We have also seen a resurgence in certain sectors of the United States economy, particularly in housing, in automobiles sales and in the consumer area where there is some consumer credit involved. We have seen a partial and rather narrowly based recovery in the United States economy which can be causally linked to the abandonment of monetarist policies. That abandonment was explicitly affirmed by the chief architect, Volcker, a couple of months ago. I think we can say that, if an assessment of monetarist policies is being based on the United States experience, it should be noted that in that country those policies have been shown to be well and truly bankrupt. The application of those policies, of course, has had significant ramifications for our position. It has both directly and indirectly depressed the demand for Australian goods and commodities-indirectly via its effect on the Japanese economy. Our current problems are obviously in significant part a consequence of that whole thing.</PARA>
<PARA> We are now seeing headlines in the financial and economic journals typified by one that appeared in the Australian Financial Review on 24 February of this year -'America Dumping Milton'. One can find a number of articles with similar headings and similar themes. I think we have seen a pretty good field trial for the doctrines of conservative economics. If we work on the premise that the orginal adoption of those conservative economic policies was a response to the apparent failure of conventional policies in the 1970s I hope that we will see a progressive and growing rejection of those sorts of policies that have such calamitous effects for ordinary people. I hope we will see those doctrines consigned to the ash heap of history.</PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to Australia. In one sense I think we are fortunate in that the former conservative Government was in some respects rather less doctrinaire than Thatcher and Reagan in its pursuit of economic doctrine. Various interpretations could be placed on that. I would attribute it to political opportunism. I think we have been very fortunate that we have not seen the doctrinaire application of those policies to quite the same extent. We have seen some spectacular examples of the way the conservatives were prepared to toss their own ideology out of the window if it suited them. One would think that on protection policy the conservatives would have adopted a fairly uncompromising stance on free market liberalism but political expediency overrode it. Likewise, in the attitude towards fiscal policies, electoral considerations were quite sufficient to override any monetarist concerns about the size of last year's projected Budget deficit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I say, these issues are of national importance because they involve two persons in very high positions in New South Wales and they involve the administration of justice in that State, the most populous one in the country and the one from which many of the lawyers who have gone to the High Court of Australia and to other high courts have come. If contempt for the administration of justice in New South Wales arises as a result of a failure to investigate these allegations, it can only be expected to spread to other States .

<PARA> What has been the answer of Premier Wran? Premier Wran has done this: First of all he has said that he is innocent. If that is so, there is all the more reason to have a judicial inquiry. Secondly, he has appointed his Attorney-General to examine matters. How in God's name can his own Attorney-General, a subordinate officer, examine in a way which would satisfy the New South Wales public? Thirdly, he has issued a defamation writ and that raises issues utterly different from those that need to be investigated. The issues which have been raised by that program, whether true or false, need to be resolved. The allegations need to be examined and they can be examined properly only by a royal commission of the highest order. If the Premier of New South Wales wants to dispel the allegations that have been made that is the route he should take. This is a matter that should not be allowed to rest until he adopts that course of action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on attaining your office of high distinction. In a recently published article an economist writing about a possible revival in economic activity in the United States of America pointed to the fact that the spate of company takeover bids in the American corporate scene did not represent increased production. Companies become larger and more powerful as they swallow up their business competitors, but they do not provide employment. On the contrary, as the recently attempted takeover bid for an Australian company graphically illustrated, takeovers result in a loss of jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This takeover involved a $48.4m bid by Life Savers (Australasia) Ltd for Allen' s Confectionery Ltd and a rival joint bid by a transnational corporation, Cadbury Schweppes Australia Ltd, Nelson Tobacco Co. Ltd, Rowntree Hoadley Ltd, another transnational corporation, was also involved in the takeover battle. A particularly unsavoury aspect of this takeover battle was the legal action by rival joint takeover contenders Cadbury Schweppes and Nelson Tobacco to prevent an industrial agreement between Allen's Confectionery and the Federated Confectioners Association of Australia from being certified by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. This legal action had been taken because the industrial agreement provided safeguards against the compulsory redundancy and retrenchment of workers of Allen's Confectionery. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened to the pious statements made by representatives of big business at the recent National Economic Summit Conference? At that time the representatives of big business expressed their full agreement with the policies of the new Federal Labor Government which will provide thousands of jobs over the next three years. Now these very same people, these leaders of big business, are involved in a takeover bid which, if it had been successful, would have meant the loss of many hundreds of jobs for the employees of Allen's Confectionery. Lifesavers then attempted to withdraw its takeover bid because of the industrial agreement. It must be asked why this battle for control of Allen' s Confectionery was occurring. It was occurring because Allens is the only national wholesale distributor of confectionery and is an important avenue of distribution to many rival outlets. The attempt to swallow Allens is not because there is an intention to manufacture more confectionery and provide more jobs, but simply because the companies concerned need the Allens distribution network. What has happened to the expressed views on job creation by big business leaders ? It is even more reprehensible that the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures and the Confederation of Australian Industry were also attempting to appear before the Arbitration Commission because they are opposed to the industrial agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> It is commendable that the Federal Government has decided that the proposal by Cadbury Schweppes and Nelson Tobacco to acquire all the issued shares of Allen's Confectionery is inconsistent with the foreign investment policies of the Government. The takeover has accordingly been prohibited. However, the point I am making in this speech tonight still applies. It can be argued-indeed it has been argued by financial commentators-that the purchase of Allens by a larger corporation would result in an increase in economic benefits. I ask: To whom would an increase in economic benefits accrue? Who would benefit from this-the shareholders, the businesses concerned, the workers in the enterprises or Australia as a whole? There is no doubt that there will be benefits for the shareholders of Allen's Confectionery but it is by no means certain that there will be improved economic benefits for Australia as a whole. One thing of which there is no doubt, however, for the workers of Allen's Confectionery is that there would be a loss of jobs. There would be no economic benefits in their case , merely a loss of earning power as the redundant workers are forced to take unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the point that I made at the beginning of this speech. Company takeover bids do not represent increased production. At the present time the media and members of the Opposition are attempting to lay blame on the trade unions for not abiding by the prices and incomes accord and the consensus of the National Economic Summit Conference. Such allegations are false. But why are the business practices of the captains of industry who attended the Summit Conference being ignored by the critics? It is sheer hypocrisy for business leaders to agree on the one hand that job creation is the most important of national aims whilst at the same time involving themselves in business takeovers which result in the wholesale sacking of workers. The behaviour of Life Savers and Cadbury Schweppes in attempting to frustrate an industrial agreement which would have saved jobs is disgraceful and makes a mockery of their agreement with the aims of the Summit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matters that were raised by the honourable member for North Sydney are not disgraceful. What the honourable member for North Sydney is doing is casting no allegations, spreading no aspersions, spreading no smear. The honourable member for North Sydney is simply putting the basic proposition that was constantly put when we were in government by the party of which the Premier of New South Wales is the national president, namely, that whenever an allegation of substance is made against a Minister of the Crown, the appropriate thing to do is to have some kind of independent inquiry. That is the clamour that came from the Australian Labor Party when it sat on this side of the House. Time after time, when an allegation as was made against a Minister of the Fraser Government the then Opposition would say: 'You must have a judicial inquiry; the Minister must stand down'. All I can say is that if the standards applied by the Fraser Government were applied now an independent judicial inquiry would be conducted and the Minister of the Crown involved would stand aside until the results of that inquiry were known.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I invite the attention of the Premier of New South Wales and indeed of the members of the Labor Party in this House, to the practice followed by former governments of Labor Party persuasion in that State when allegations of this kind were made. I well recall an occasion when allegations were made against a former Housing Minister in the Cahill Labor Government of New South Wales. Properly and appropriately the Minister stood aside. The Premier of the day, Joe Cahill, announced an inquiry. The inquiry was held and the Minister was totally exonerated and restored with honour to the Ministry of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for North Sydney was attempting properly to raise this matter of national significance. Nobody denies for a moment the national pretentions of the National President of the Australian Labor Party, the Premier of New South Wales. Nobody for a moment denies that he is a national figure. These were not raised lightly. Obviously, they were raised as a result of very detailed and painstaking research. I have no idea whether the allegations are correct. If they are, they go to the very core of the administration of justice and the good government of the State of New South Wales. Can anybody seriously suggest that it is not a serious matter for an independent national broadcaster- the Australian Broadcasting Commission, hardly a handmaiden of the Liberal Party of Australia-to make an allegation that the Premier of New South Wales telephoned a stipendiary magistrate and said: 'I want somebody discharged; I do not want somebody committed for trial'. </PARA>

We were led to understand that some of their number, especially members of the Federal Opposition, were reasonable; that, notwithstanding the stacked numbers, they would support the propositions to which they had agreed in the standing committee, of the Convention, which met on many occasions. Instead they did the biggest about turn that we have seen for a long time in politics. They abandoned positions that they had agreed to take. In particular, Senator Durack abandoned policies to which he had agreed and which, in fact, he had put forward. Let us look at the kinds of things that they rejected. The first was the fundamental principle of one-vote one-value proposed for incorporation in the Constitution by the Premier of Western Australia. They rejected that fundamental, democratic principle. These are the people who come here and try to preach to us today. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, they rejected agreement on the family law issue, which Senator Durack himself had worked on and about which he had said on many occasions there was need for uniformity. Again they went back on understandings that had been reached. The only exercise that we saw them perform was a blatantly political exercise in the debate concerning the external powers granted in the Constitution. The Leader of the Federal Opposition (Mr Peacock) went back on a position that he had adopted when his party was in government and began to put himself forward as a champion of States' rights. It was not an issue which involved States' rights but one where it was politically convenient for him to take such a stand. He decided that was the approach that should be taken at that particular Convention. The kinds of absurdities in which these people engaged, the kinds of political manipulation to which they allowed themselves to be subjected by the Premier of Queensland and the Premier of Tasmania can easily be illustrated. </PARA>
<PARA> In the debate on the powers of the Governor-General I moved an amendment to adjourn the discussion. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair ), representing the Federal Opposition, said that he and his colleagues would support the adjournment of the discussion and its being referred back to the committee. That was on the Wednesday. By the Friday what had happened? Members of the Federal Opposition had changed their position. Someone had twisted their arm and, to a man, they voted to retain the issue within the Convention rather than refer it to the committee for further discussion and decision. That provides an example of the kind of behaviour that was experienced, although those who attended the Convention were supposed to be discussing matters at the highest level of politics. </PARA>
<PARA> The finest aspects of politics are those which involve Constitutional issues. We should have all attended as people committed to the democratic system and seeking to work out the best ways to progress. Instead, we had a convention that cost the Australian people hundreds of thousands of dollars but merely resulted in people going back on understandings and produced a worse position than had been achieved at the previous Convention. These people went back on things that they had accepted in principle at the previous Convention. These are the people who pretend to lecture tous about principle and democratic practice. If they continue this rightwards lurch towards extreme reaction it suits us because the Australian people will not have a bar of them and they will remain in opposition for many years to come. </PARA>

What were we told by the gentlemen opposite, these men of principle who so recently were rejected wholesale by the Australian electorate and consigned to the political garbage can from which they clearly have not yet emerged? I ask the House to contemplate quietly what has occurred.

They could have called a Press conference. They could have gone on television themselves. They could have demanded an interview. But, no; what do they do? They wait until they are covered by parliamentary privilege. They come into this House and even then they do not have the guts to get up and say: 'We believe it is true' or 'We do not believe it is true' or 'We would not want to say it outside'.

The reason why the honourable gentlemen opposite did not want to say a single word outside this Parliament was they knew that if they wanted to repeat the allegation or make the kind of insinuation that they were prepared to make in here they too could have become involved in the legal process. What we have is one of the squalid political exercises which time after time take place in all parliamentary institutions and do not do the perpetrators of such exercises any credit and certainly do the parliamentary institution no credit. They come into the Parliament and, like Pontius Pilate, say: 'We do not know whether it is true or false. We are not prepared to say it ourselves because we are men of principle'.
