<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 26 March 1997, I advised members that I would make a statement to the House on the content of questions asked without notice, the length and relevance of answers to those questions, and the use of points of order especially during question time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These issues are not new. They have been around for a long time&mdash;during the administration of a number of governments of different political persuasions and the tenure of several Speakers. They have been the subject of inquiry and report by several standing committees on procedure, although the House has failed to act on many of the recommendations made by those committees. It is against that background that I set out my views on some of these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Standing orders 142 to 144 contain provisions in relation to the content of questions. These are clear and generally well understood. However, difficulties arise when members begin their questions with a long preamble, or their questions actually contain a whole series of questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These practices are clearly unacceptable, and I intend to apply a much firmer test to such matters in the future. There will be occasions, of course, when a short preface may be necessary&mdash;but lengthy introductory statements will not be tolerated. Furthermore, as a general rule, questions containing multiple parts should more properly be placed on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> for written response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These views have been formed for a number of reasons. Firstly, long prefaces generally introduce debating points or arguments and have little, if anything, to do with genuinely seeking information, which questions are supposed to do. Secondly, lengthy questions
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> often invite lengthy answers. Thirdly, wide-ranging or multipart questions can result in equally wide&hyphen;ranging responses, the relevance of which may be rather tenuous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although there are quite well defined rules applying to the asking of questions, the only standing order relating to answers to questions is standing order 145, which provides that: `An answer shall be relevant to the question.' Over many years, questions have been asked and statements made by the chair and others on the interpretation of `relevant'. Difficulties with relevance have often&mdash;but certainly not always&mdash;arisen because of the broad ranging nature of the question asked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As is stated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS>, page 522, the interpretation of `relevant' has at times been very wide. In practice, the word has been frequently accepted by the chair as meaning relevant in some way, or relevant in part, rather than directly or completely relevant. Rather than adopting strict definitions for terms which have traditionally been open to wide and differing interpretations, I propose to apply a commonsense approach to these issues. I expect questions to be specific, and answers to be relevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If in my view a question is too long or too wide ranging, or an answer goes beyond what is reasonably appropriate, I intend to intervene. Members will not always agree with my judgment. However, I will endeavour to ensure everyone concerned is treated fairly and impartially.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the practice of members raising points of order during ministers' answers to questions. In my view, many points of order seek to disrupt the giving of an answer and/or to make debating points rather than being bona fide points of order challenging some aspect of proceedings. Genuine points of order have their proper place, but members who persistently raise frivolous or deliberately disruptive points of order should be dealt with firmly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In future, I intend as far as possible, to adopt the following approach when addressing these concerns. In regard to questions without notice: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3930">
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">If I consider that as a preface to&mdash;or in the course of asking&mdash;a question, a member is attempting to debate or respond, as distinct from merely referring, to the substance of an answer to a previous question, I propose to rule the question out of order and proceed to the next question.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">Members should restrict themselves to one substantive question at a time. Multipart questions which in my view are in effect short speeches or statements will be ruled out of order.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept that it has been common practice over the years for ministers to contrast the government's actions and policies with those of the opposition. I am also aware that when an opposition question is long and wide ranging it is not difficult for a minister's answer to satisfy the relevance requirement.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">Bearing these points in mind, I intend to require that a minister does not unduly digress from the point of the question directed to him or her, nor should the response be unreasonably long&mdash;otherwise I will require the minister to conclude the answer and resume his or her seat.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In regard to points of order:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">A member who seeks to take a point of order should confine his or her comments to relevant procedural issues and not attempt to comment on or debate issues of substance. Members who persistently fail to comply with this requirement can expect to be dealt with under standing order 304A.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">Where I have ruled that there is no point of order and/or have directed a member to resume his or her seat, and the member fails to do so immediately and without further comment, that member can also expect to be dealt with under standing order 304A.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Obviously, I reserve the right to take such further or other action as I may consider to be appropriate to the circumstances of a particular situation. I would also like to remind members of the requirement that all remarks be addressed through the chair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I take this opportunity to express my concern that the House is too often far too
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> noisy. Whilst the standing orders remain as they are currently drafted, I intend to be more stringent in exercising my prerogative to take action, subject to&mdash;in most cases&mdash;the usual general warning, if and when I consider the conduct of a member or members to be unparliamentary or disorderly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to encourage a free and robust question time. But there must be rules. My role is to enforce them. In the absence of other direction by the House, I will endeavour to give effect to the proposals I have outlined. In doing so, I trust I can rely on the support of all members.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the European institutions, the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland) and the Republic of Ireland. I was privileged to be deputy leader of the delegation. I am pleased to have the opportunity to present the delegation's report to the House. I hope that other colleagues will have the opportunity to speak as well. The delegation was led by Senator Watson, who has already spoken in the Senate on the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The visit to the European institutions came at an important phase of Australia's relationship with the European Union. At the time of the visit a number of key issues relevant to that relationship were being debated. The visit provided a timely opportunity to put forward Australia's views on many of these issues. During the numerous debates, meetings and briefings we attended the delegation highlighted Australia's desire to strengthen its relationship with the European Union. The delegation reinforced Australia's commitment to formalising and expanding that relationship within a properly established framework. Unfortunately there was disagreement as to how to proceed
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3931"> with that particular framework. I will come back to that issue later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Issues of concern within the Australia&hyphen;European Union relationship were also raised by the delegation during its visit. Time and again the delegation promoted Australia's support for further trade liberalisation, particularly in relation to agriculture. At every opportunity we reiterated the need for further reform of Europe's common agricultural policy. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Ronaldson) especially played a big role in that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the Council of Europe, the delegation represented Australia's interests in the annual debate on OECD activities. We were successful in moving a number of amendments to the final resolution on the OECD activities which were adopted at the debate, including resolutions having to do with the importance of labour market reform in tackling the problem of unemployment, the need for a comprehensive and forward looking work program for the World Trade Organisation, and support for Secretary&hyphen;General Johnston's reform strategy for the OECD. The parliament will be interested to know that Secretary&hyphen;General Johnston is eager to increase contacts between the OECD and parliamentarians. His ideas are discussed in our report and should be given more detailed consideration by this parliament. The delegation also gained a better understanding of the issues currently receiving attention in Europe, including economic and monetary union, European Union enlargement, the future of NATO and the question of NATO expansion. The delegation is hopeful that the information in our report will provide useful insight into those issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, as I mentioned earlier, there was a fundamental disagreement in the delegation on the issue of negotiations with the European Union. It is interesting that Senator Watson in his report to the Senate on 7 May said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the government side, I was pleased to hear today the announcement that the European Union has dropped its insistence on including a human rights clause in the proposed framework trade and cooperation agreement with Australia. Instead, it now will be dealt with in a separate political declaration annexed to the agreement. This accords
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with the position argued for by the government members of the delegation in Europe.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is far from being an accurate portrayal of the situation. In fact, rather than the Europeans having dropped this requirement in relation to the framework, what has happened is that, as a consequence of the insistence on the framework, the whole framework has been dropped and the whole negotiation over the framework between Australia and the European Union has been dropped&mdash;exactly what opposition members of the delegation warned at that time. For Senator Watson to say that this confirms the position of government members is wrong. As a result of that, rather than having a very strong agreement with the European Union, we now have nothing more than a declaration. The shadow minister, Mr Brereton, has made it clear from the start that the Australian Labor Party could not understand why the government kept insisting on taking out the human rights clause and, as a consequence of that, we have ended up with this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report obviously provided good reading. The delegation was divided on the question quite openly. Nevertheless, we did manage to put Australia's case on all the other issues. I think what has happened is very unfortunate. We now have a situation&mdash;at the insistence, in particular, of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) to take out the human rights clause&mdash;where the framework agreement with Europe has now been virtually destroyed. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a privilege to represent the parliament on the delegation to Europe and Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland&mdash;along with Senator Watson, who led the delegation; the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), who has just spoken; the member for Bruce (Mr Griffin); the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson); and Senator Shayne Murphy. The member for Calwell has made reference to lack of agreement on some of the issues, but I think that is what parliamentary delegations should be all about. I was quite proud, even though we could not agree on some very essential issues which he has alluded to, that we equipped ourselves well in a number of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3932"> forums throughout the European Union and showed that democracy is robust, alive and well in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a number of highlights from the visit, and I was very pleased to have the support of the full delegation in mounting Australia's case on the common agricultural policy of the European Union. I acknowledge the active and avid support I had from the members of the Australian Labor Party in the delegation. I am very pleased to let them lead the argument for the constituency that I represent, which finds it very difficult in these days of pursuing a level playing field in terms of world trade to have to compete in a world market with very heavily subsidised commodities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This message was certainly heard by the parliaments of Europe and the assemblies that we attended. We wait with avid interest for progress in that regard. It is interesting to read that the new Prime Minister of Great Britain&mdash;who is on record as saying that he believes common agricultural policy is a rort&mdash;is intent on removing unfair, inequitable world trade practices. So we wait with great interest to see whether the impact of our visit over there has any effect on the momentum in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things I would like the parliament to be aware of is the enormous respect we found right throughout Europe when we visited the many Commonwealth war graves and commemorative assemblies. One of the real emotional highlights for me was an evening visit to Ypres, where we visited Menin Gate. It was a very special privilege to lay a wreath at Menin Gate with all of the members of the delegation. It was a very touching moment for me because, while we stood there, I was thinking of my maternal grandfather who served in the British army and was badly injured in the gas attack at Ypres. I think the most moving thing was the enormous respect that is held for Australians because of the sacrificial contribution that was made right across Europe in the first great war and again in the second. There are monuments everywhere. We found enormous respect from the Belgian, French and the people we met there.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are three buglers who play at Menin Gate and have been doing so faithfully for nearly 50 years in remembering the contribution that has been made by Australian troops. So we&mdash;the whole six of us&mdash;were very proud to represent the Australian parliament at some very special commemorative ceremonies during the busy agenda of the delegation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will refer to the things that the member for Calwell has mentioned. It is true that we have some difficulty achieving any level of consensus on two vital issues. The first is the need to include core labour standards in the new tranche of negotiations that will take place in respect of the World Trade Organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As someone who represents a constituency that has suffered somewhat badly so far in terms of trade negotiations on the multilateral arena, I was very concerned not to have clauses in any new arrangements that can be manipulated. That is the position that I took. I disagreed with members of the government on the delegation, but I am not sorry that we could not agree because it allowed us an opportunity to debate those matters. I think there are adequate forums for core labour standards to be&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to be here today to speak on the report of the delegation which went to Europe and Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland last year. I think the delegation was quite successful. Certainly, from a personal point of view, it was a tremendous opportunity to get an insight into what is occurring in modern Europe. It is an area that is going through a great deal of change with the collapse of the Soviet bloc and with the process of the European parliament and other intergovernmental arrangements looking at a range of different ways to proceed into the future in a way to avoid tension and provide greater cohesion across a number of nation states.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been said, the delegation in Europe had a number of problems with several issues which related to the question of the framework agreement between Australia and the European Union and to the question of core labour standards. However, I would like to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3933"> stress today that in general terms I think the delegation worked well together and put forward a positive face for Australia in those institutions. There certainly were those disagreements. I have some concerns over the question of what has happened since then with respect to these issues, particularly the change in the framework agreement. I think it is a situation where those issues could have been handled a bit differently by the government, but so be it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It certainly gave me an opportunity to better understand some of the concerns that Australians have, particularly those in the rural sector, on the question of trade with Europe. I think it is fair to say that a number of members of the delegation, particularly those representing rural constituencies, very strongly fought the fight on behalf of Australia's agricultural sector with respect to problems with the common agricultural policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As was mentioned earlier by the deputy leader of the delegation, the member for Calwell, (Dr Theophanous) the question of the OECD was also present in our minds. I, too, would concur that the actions by the new Secretary-General of the OECD, Mr Donald Johnston, provide an opportunity for an improvement in the OECD in terms of its relevance to the member states. I think some of the ideas which he has could be picked up by the government and by this parliament in a way which would lead to a situation where the OECD became an even more relevant forum for Australia, providing some information which would be of even greater relevance and usage in the planning and development of our own economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) also mentioned the situation of Menin Gate at Ypres. As an Australian who is very proud of his heritage, I think the situation that we found going through the fields of Flanders and the various battlefields was that there was a disgusting loss of life in those places, particularly during World War I. The circumstances around the ceremony at Menin Gate were extremely touching.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had an added advantage over my colleagues in that I had met with the gentleman who was the President of the Menin Gate
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Committee. He organises the nightly commemoration ceremony. He said to me at a reception in Brussels that, if I would like a memento of the Ypres campaign, he would give me a piece of shell that was from the actual battlefield. I said that would be wonderful and promptly thought that would be the last I would hear of it. When we were at the very touching ceremony, a young man came up to me and presented me with a small package. I opened it to find a shell, which now holds pride of place in my home. The number of names has certainly brought home to me the horrible loss of life that occurred at those times. Hopefully, we will never see that again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I briefly want to touch on Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which I know the member for Calwell wished to but was unable to because of the time available to him. The state of play in Northern Ireland was something which confused the delegation. It was said by some, `If you understand what is going on in Northern Ireland, then you really should just be confused because the fact is that it is incredible and impossible to understand the circumstances there.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am encouraged by some recent developments in terms of the British election result and am hopeful that there will be some improvements there. With respect to the Republic of Ireland and the question of trade and industry policies, I think there are examples there which could be and ought be taken on board by this government in order to get a conscious, coherent industry policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to thank Andres Lomp, the secretary to the delegation, and all those who assisted the delegation in its travels. I think the report provides a basis for some real action that could be taken by government. I hope it will do so. I would also like to note the fine example of concern shown by the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) about swans in Strasbourg. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the time available to me I would like to echo the sentiments of the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) and the member for Bruce (Mr
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3934"> Griffin), particularly in relation to the Commonwealth graves, and also the member for Bruce's comments about Mr Lomp, the secretary to the delegation. I also thank all the officers at a parliamentary level at this end and our hosts overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of matters that I want to talk about on behalf of the member for Mallee. I had the great honour to deliver a speech at the Council of Europe enlarged parliamentary assembly debate on the WTO and the implementation of the Uruguay Round. I was at that time able to say on behalf of the delegation and on behalf of the Australian parliamentary group that was there the deep concern that the member for Mallee and I had&mdash;indeed, all the members of the delegation were of great support to us in this regard&mdash;about the level of support for agricultural producers in Europe as opposed to those in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were able to tell the Europeans at every opportunity the facts of life. Indeed, the latest OECD documentation shows that, whereas Australia has a producer subsidy equivalent of nine per cent and New Zealand four per cent, the European Union has an average PSE of 49 per cent with figures as high as 81 per cent. I am sure the member for Bruce will have vivid memories of how we very firmly and actively pursued that matter in the large number of forums that we were in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleagues have talked about matters that I do not want to touch on as well. I thought it was worth while giving an indication of the great challenges that face the Europeans&mdash;and I think the Republic of Ireland was the only place that I heard this publicly discussed&mdash;that is, the impacts of the changes that will have to take place in Europe in relation to their levels of subsidies. With those other countries wanting to join the union, there is enormous financial pressure on the union. Its present levels of subsidies are unsustainable. I thought it was interesting discussing in the Republic of Ireland the economic and social implications of reduced subsidies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the massive structural changes that this country has had to go through with a shift from country to urban areas, I
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> think that will pale into insignificance compared with what will potentially happen in Europe over the next 10 or 15 years. They do have enormous challenges. I do not envy them the task that lies ahead, but I do stress absolutely that they do have to do it. On behalf of our rural producers, the member for Mallee and I not only urged but demanded that they take those actions. As I say, the members of the delegation, even those without any rural constituencies, were of enormous support to the delegation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other interesting matter raised with us was Europe's perception, especially amongst our parliamentary colleagues in Europe, of where our relationship is with Europe vis-a-vis Asia. I got the distinct impression&mdash;and I am sure that was shared by other members of the delegation&mdash;that the Europeans see us in a bit of a no-man's&hyphen;land at the moment. They do not know whether we are basically still with Europe or whether we have now shifted to Asia. I think it is absolutely essential that we as a nation, if you like, strike our line in the sand in that regard.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report on the fair trading inquiry, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia</EMPHASIS> , is an important report for the future of small business in this country. The committee anticipates that the report may come as a shock to many people who have not been following the inquiry closely. The committee has felt compelled to make strong
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3935"> recommendations to set some ground rules for what constitutes acceptable commercial conduct in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One witness suggested to us that it is war out there between small business and big business. On the balance of the evidence to the fair trading inquiry, the committee has concluded that small businesses are regularly being confronted with combative and unfair commercial conduct in their dealings with powerful companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give one example of the type of business conduct that alarmed the committee. In major shopping centres around Australia, small businesses can be compulsorily relocated away from the shop for which they have negotiated a lease with no rights of appeal and no compensation for loss of goodwill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business did not ask the fair trading inquiry for protection; they just want a fair deal. Over the last 20 years there have been numerous inquiries and reports canvassing business conduct issues affecting small business but little action on the part of governments. The committee outlines this long and sad history of procrastination in its report. The committee concluded that it is high time for action and is recommending that a uniform retail tenancy code, underpinned in the Trade Practices Act, be developed for use around Australia; that the Commonwealth enact franchising legislation covering all franchise operations, including motor vehicle dealerships and the petroleum industry; that the Trade Practices Act be amended to proscribe unfair conduct in trade and commerce; and that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission have enhanced enforcement powers to take action on behalf of small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was argued before the committee that amending the Trade Practices Act to prohibit unfair conduct would lead to uncertainty in commercial transactions. To address this concern the committee has framed a draft amendment to the act which gives a list of factors to which the courts may have regard in determining whether or not business conduct is unfair and thus unlawful. This list of factors clearly indicates what this committee
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> considers to be fair conduct in the commercial environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee also makes recommendations designed to improve small business access to justice, especially in relation to disputes between small businesses and their banks, in the context of evidence that business dealings are biased in favour of powerful companies with access to the best lawyers. The heavy social costs of the unfair business conduct brought to light in the fair trading inquiry are highlighted throughout the report with numerous examples and several case studies. In my view, members of this House will be surprised and saddened by these stories, as were members of the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is perhaps inevitable that in a competitive economic environment many will fail and the personal consequences of failure can be severe. To forestall such devastation the committee is also recommending that there be improved small business education targeted through chambers of commerce, trade associations, local government development units, enterprises shedding staff and paying redundancy packages, and financial institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, education will not address the many cases where business failures result from opportunistic conduct by powerful companies which a just society will not tolerate. Action against such practices should need no justification other than the principles of fairness and decency which the vast majority of Australians would endorse. For this reason, the committee is urging the government to set a legislative framework for fair trading in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to thank the many business groups, small business operators and interested individuals who recognised that there are problems and who provided written submissions and oral evidence.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak on the occasion of the tabling of the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology inquiry into fair trading called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia</EMPHASIS> . This report is a watershed for small business. It addresses issues that are of concern to important sectors of the small business community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate all members of the committee who participated in the inquiry and pay particular tribute to the government members, who have shown great courage in bringing down a report that goes against the current orthodoxy of their government. This is the most significant inquiry for small business since the same committee, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, which I had the honour to chair, brought down a report in 1990 into small business in Australia entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Challenges, problems and opportunities</EMPHASIS>, which became known, modestly, as the Beddall report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report is still referred to by significant sectors of the small business community as the first real blueprint for government action. As the Minister for Small Business and Customs in both the Hawke and Keating governments, I had the honour to oversee the implementation of those recommendations. This report further addresses some of the problems identified by the first inquiry and offers sensible, practical and achievable solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The areas I want to concentrate on today in this speech are franchising and retail tenancy. The 1990 inquiry recommended that legislation be implemented to regulate the franchising industry in Australia. As the Minister for Small Business and Customs, I was convinced by the franchising industry that we should at least try a voluntary code. It is now seven years since the report and over four years since the voluntary code was
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> implemented. It is abundantly clear that a voluntary code is insufficient to protect small business proprietors from predatory practices. The recommendation for legislation is one that the committee reached unanimously. The collapse of the Franchising Code Council in December of last year and the government's inaction since has left thousands of small businesses without any protection whatsoever. It is imperative that a totally independent franchising council be established and that it be legislatively underpinned as outlined in this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Franchising has great potential, but if the government fails to act it will be caught up in a mire of conflicting state legislation. Already the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Bob Carr, has indicated that his government is moving towards a legislative framework to control franchising in that state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area of the report I wish to address is that of retail tenancy. The committee received an extraordinary large number of submissions from small business people operating out of enclosed shopping centres. We heard a number of horror stories where unscrupulous landlords had exploited vulnerable clients. This is an area which clearly stands out for uniform national legislation through the code that is recommended in the report. It is now time to act to impose a solution upon the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recommendations in this report are sensible and achievable. They give small business the opportunity to negotiate with their landlords in a fairer way. The major shopping centre owners, to their credit, have indicated that they have no objection to such an approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can tell you, from three years experience as the Minister for Small Business and Customs, that this is a difficult objective to achieve. With the support of the Property Council of Australia, and if the minister is prepared to take up the fight on behalf of small business, one of the areas of greatest conflict can be addressed. This report clearly recognises that you cannot treat small business the same as big business. For years, advisers to governments past and present have pretended that you can deal with big business and the corner store in the same manner.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3937"> Perhaps this report should have been entitled `Size does matter'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two categories of small business&mdash;the innovative, motivated, focused, born&hyphen;global type company that will succeed without assistance and, on the other hand, the vast majority of small businesses that need the same type of protection as consumers do. Unless the government recognises the difference, it will continue to fail to meet the aspirations of small business. There is a need for government intervention on behalf of small business and this report reinforces that need. There are many members of the government who are confused by the anger they face in the small business community. The reason for this anger is that this government has yet to grasp the true needs of the small business sector. Unless it accepts and implements the recommendations contained in this report, the Howard government will suffer the consequences at the next federal election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within this report there are many criticisms of the ACCC. I hope that, when the ACCC gets to this report, it will realise the committee feels that it has not done enough on behalf of small business. I note today that the ACCC is now off chasing the banks again. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join my colleagues in talking about the fair trading report, which is a significant report to be tabled in parliament. I would like to congratulate and thank my colleagues from both sides of the House who contributed to the report. I would also like to thank the secretariat&mdash;Mr Paul McMahon, who is the secretary, Lee Boldeman, who was an adviser from the department, Gillian Gould, who is in the gallery, and Susan Johnston and Frances Wilson. I would also like to mention that there were over 200 exhibits and nearly 200 pieces of evidence that came to the committee, showing some courage in certain respects by those business proprietors involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also came to this particular inquiry with some experience. I have been a shopping centre manager for some years. I was also in small business, owning two small businesses, and I was also consulting to small business. I have been involved in retail, and I have also
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been involved in franchise operations as well&mdash;successfully because I guess that the mark of success is that you actually sell your business, and I have been able to do that. But from all that and from the evidence provided, I can say to you quite clearly, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the party really is over for those business operators in our community who think they can take advantage of small business operators&mdash;in particular, retailers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Business in Australia is very tough at the moment. It is tough for everybody. It is tough for the big end of town and it is also tough for the small end of town, but it should not be made tougher by unscrupulous methods and unscrupulous schemes that people put into place. In particular, in shopping centre development, there seems to be a view that shopping centres are good for the community when in fact what we are doing is creating monopolies. We are getting rid of the corner store now. We are getting more and more into monopolies of the major regional centres, and once you have retail congregated into one spot you then have an opportunity for people to take advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Local councils, for instance, are very keen to develop shopping centres. One of the reasons that they want to do this is that they will have an increase in their rates earned. By developing these larger shopping centres, they are denying the opportunity for small strip shopping centres or the corner store to be developed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frankly, the rents in these shopping centres are much too high. I think that they are above the market view at the moment and one of the reasons I can refer to is that, when I was a shopping centre manager, there was a scheme in place to increase rentals throughout the community. The way they do that is by getting one tenant to increase their rent at the same time as offering them some rent&hyphen;free period. This inflates the base rental and also the variable outgoings and, from that particular rent negotiation, they are then able to increase rents within their own shopping centre based on that particular increase. At the same time the valuers reviewing rents from down the road at a shopping centre refer back to this shopping centre, increase rents based
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3938"> upon that shopping centre and then the circle develops. It is not collusion&mdash;`collusion' is a strong word&mdash;but there is some way of developing these rents that we need to look at. I noted that, in the top 10 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">BRW</EMPHASIS> top 200 richest people, two people&mdash;and it is fantastic that they were in it&mdash;were shopping centre developers. So there is a lot of money in shopping centres and we must look at a way of protecting small retailers in these particular shopping centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a fine line between hard&hyphen;ball business and fair play. One of the reasons why there is a fine line is that there is the pressure of performance on those working for those people who in fact deal in these areas. Stepping out of the line of ethics is very easy to do if there are not guidelines set out. What this report is asking for is an increase in education, especially for lawyers and accountants who give advice to small business&mdash;they must have some sort of duty of care. We are also asking for standard leases to be held throughout Australia. We are also asking for truth in rent reviews, not these silent, free rental periods. We are also asking for the ACCC to be more proactive in acting against cases of unfair negotiations. We are also asking for section 51AA of the Trade Practices Act to be reviewed and acted upon. We urge the government to look at our recommendations and to apply them if it can.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last message I would like to give is that there is a feeling within the community that there is goodwill associated with any business. In fact, goodwill lasts only until the end of the lease. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report does provide a vehicle for small business and government and community to discuss, negotiate and, hopefully, change the environment that exists. The fact is that we have landlords and we have tenants and the disproportion of power between those is in many cases quite tragic and has quite tragic consequences.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, it is with great pleasure and with a very strong sense of the urgency of the issue involved that I present the Trade Practices (Better Business Conduct) Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure seeks to protect small business operations from harsh and oppressive market behaviour by larger corporations. Its objective, in other words, is to fill a dangerous vacuum left by this government in a significant area of the economy: to kick&hyphen;start a policy which the government promised
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3939"> before the election but which it has refused to deliver, even though it has been in office 15 months and even though there is no effective opposition to it in the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, for reasons far removed from the wellbeing of small business, is seeking to create an atmosphere in which the unfair dismissal law is seen as the number one impediment to small business. This is the government's own law, by the way&mdash;the law described by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) in this House last November as `a workable system for dealing with unfair dismissal on the basis of a fair go all round.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the evidence suggests that, whatever else the government is trying to make of it, for small business unfair dismissal is not the first order issue. According to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages Small Business Index</EMPHASIS>, for example, only five per cent of small business enterprises are concerned about it, as against 84 per cent who complain about the lack of government action on the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What small business really wants above all else is a law which protects them from the misuse of market power by big business. Mr Rob Bastian, chief executive of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, described the need for it more than year ago as `critical' and surpassing such matters as `deregulation and reduced paperwork'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business representatives made this clear to us when we were in government. We responded by introducing amendments to the Trade Practices Act in the parliament in November 1995. Those amendments are basically the same as those proposed in this bill. Honourable members will recall that the coalition held up those amendments in the Senate until the election was called and the parliament prorogued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's entire action on the issue so far has been to shift it to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, even though the committee had already examined it seven years ago and had favoured solutions similar to those which we are proposing by this measure today. In other words, the coalition has done what it can to ensure that, on
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this critical issue, small business just goes round in circles. The opposition and small business everywhere are left to assume that, when the heat comes on from the big end of town, it is all too hard for this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business is entitled to be frustrated and concerned that, in 15 months of office, the government continually promises big bang solutions to small business problems, but only produces, at best, damp squibs. The process leading to and including the Bell report last year is a case in point. If the boasts of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) were to be believed, his government's response would ensure and entrench the status of small business as absolutely central to economic advancement. After a year of talk about his plans for small business and another six months of office, however, the response to the report has been deeply disappointing to the sector. The Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants reports that 50 per cent of small businesses still think, a year later, that the response will not help them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, on the issue which small business leaders describe as critical, the government has done nothing. Even on elements of small business policy which it says are important&mdash;those issues raised by the Bell report&mdash;it has responded in the most limited, timid and mediocre way. In such a policy vacuum, the need for the proposals contained in the bill is ever more urgent and critical. They provide realistic and effective protection&mdash;better business conduct&mdash;without imposing unacceptable compliance costs on business and without containing any financial implications for the government. They fill a need which is accepted as critical but which the government has so far refused to acknowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I therefore commend the bill to all honourable members who have the interests of the small business community at heart. I also seek leave to present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The objective of the Workplace Relations (Unjust State Legislation) Amendment Bill 1997 is to make absolutely certain that workers and their representatives who exercise their rights under the Commonwealth government's Workplace Relations Act, or who seek to exercise those rights, cannot be penalised as a consequence by the industrial relations legislation of the Western Australian government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 21 November last year, when reintroducing the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill after its passage through the other house, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) said that the bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . provides that employees and employers should have the right to choose whether they wish to be covered by an award or agreement in the state or federal jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On 12 December last year, the minister welcomed the Victorian government's action to refer its industrial relations power to the Commonwealth as a very substantial step forward in micro&hyphen;economic reform. For too long, he said in this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Australian community has suffered from the collision of the federal and state industrial relations systems. This rivalry has been at the expense of the efficiency of those systems with consequent costs not just for the national or regional economies but also for individual employers, workers and members of the wider community.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Since he spoke these fine words, the Western Australian government has brought in legislation which directly takes away from workers in that state rights accepted as lawful even under this current government's Workplace Relations Act. For example, it penalises employees under state awards and their unions who seek to transfer to the federal system, in contradiction of the specific assurances given by the minister which I have just quoted. It penalises workers who take industrial action even when it conforms with the Workplace Relations Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is reasonable to expect the government to react by defending its own law; to defend the rights of employees, provided by the Commonwealth parliament, to choose between federal and state coverage, and to protect the national and regional economies, the individual employers, workers and members of the community&mdash;to use the minister's own words&mdash;from the consequences of this attack on Commonwealth law by the state of Western Australia. It is reasonable to anticipate some leadership from the Commonwealth government, in other words. But, as with so many other current urgent issues, we have been anticipating that leadership in vain. The government is refusing, for whatever reason, to defend federal law and federal rights. Accordingly, we have decided to act in its stead. Somebody has to stand up for people who are exercising their legal rights. This is why the Labor Party has drawn up this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I shall explain briefly its three basic provisions. Firstly, the Western Australia legislation provides that, when a federal union notifies the commission that a dispute exists, procedures may be triggered which penalise the related state union and its members. The effect is to stop employees from exercising their right to transfer to the federal system. This bill proposes to amend the act to prevent this attack on employees' legal rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the bill seeks to prevent the Western Australian legislation from penalising employees from taking action for which the act specifically provides immunity. Thirdly, it proposes to make sure that members of federal unions may pursue rights to industrial action protected by the act without being
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3941"> persecuted by fines and injunctions under the state legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Western Australian government has brought down a law which takes away from employees in that state rights which have been given to them by this parliament. In doing so, it has deliberately brought on a collision between federal and state systems. I shall leave honourable members to speculate on why the government has found it so hard to defend the law of the land&mdash;its law. Whatever the reason, its inaction is inexcusable. If the government will not or cannot show leadership on this crucial and pressing issue, the opposition will. I therefore commend this bill to the House.

We are not going to proceed down the path of unilateral disarmament on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we announced this plan we called for a bipartisan approach, because industry needs the certainty that goes beyond the single term of the parliament. So far the government has delivered the industry anything but certainty.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said that there would be no slash&hyphen;and&hyphen;burn policy on the car industry, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has been known to ask, over port and cigars at the Commonwealth Club, `Why don't we just let Mitsubishi go?' It is that sort of confusion which is bad for investment in the industry and bad for jobs. And the federal government is the only major player not to have responded to Labor's plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill, which encompasses the key elements of Labor's car plan, will force the government to respond. That response should be for this House to back the bill, because the Australian automotive industry isn't just Ford,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3942"> Holden, Mitsubishi and Toyota. The industry includes over 200 components manufacturers across the country, such as BTR Engineering, which employs 600 people in the electorate of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government which has hidden on every major industry policy issue. The Prime Minister has hidden rather than go to Newcastle to see the damage caused to the lives of 2,500 steelworkers. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) hid at the Crown Casino on its opening night instead of going to Newcastle to address a public meeting on their future. And now the government is hiding the final report of the Productivity Commission rather than releasing it to the public. Without the introduction of this bill the government would be in hiding forever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill gives the House a simple choice&mdash;a vote for the Australian automotive industry or a vote against it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note the comments the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) made in the House in moving his motion on 24 March. I believe that he made some quite valid observations about the damage anti&hyphen;social behaviour can do to the school learning environment. I also noted, but with less agreement, his remedy, which is more authority and tougher penalties in the school environment. This seems to replicate a mood that is in the public arena.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that we need to go beyond questions of short&hyphen;term knee&hyphen;jerk remedies in this area and look at some of the social causes of these anti&hyphen;social behaviours and the loss of trust and order in our society. It is certainly true that it is a feature of a low trust society, a society that has been drained of social capital and connectedness, that if there is a problem of this nature the call is always for more authority, for tougher penalties. That seems to be the case, ranging from the law and order debate in most parts of the country to the motion that was moved by the member for Riverina. I think that we need to examine the whole question of social trust and connectedness, and that we need to try to build new avenues for social capital, because it is certainly a feature of high trust societies that they do not have these problems in the first instance. I believe that that is an important point to make. There is no doubt that the best school learning environment comes from a close relationship, a high trust relationship, between parents, teachers and students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note that the member for Riverina has called for government support for teachers. I welcome that call. It is certainly a message
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3943"> that should be conveyed to the absurd and sinister Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Dr Kemp, who is always trying to scapegoat teachers rather than give them the support they need in the difficult school learning environment. I will provide some instances to the House. I notice that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Tony A, is scoffing on the opposite side, but he needs to look no further than an AAP news report from 11 March this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Dr Kemp took a swipe at teachers, saying they had lost focus on what was important in education.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A further AAP news report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schools Minister David Kemp today laid the blame for falling literacy levels on teachers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We have as the minister for school education in this place someone who is always criticising teachers, running down their status, running down their confidence. I certainly hope that the motion that has been moved by the member for Riverina is conveyed to the minister and that the minister starts to change his rhetoric and his policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The House should appreciate that because this is a government which fails to value education, it is also a government which fails to value the important and honoured role of educators in our society. It seems to me to be an absurd set of priorities for a government, in two budgets now, to be quarantining defence expenditure in Australia but making education spending its main target for fiscal consolidation. It is a sad day for Australia when we have a Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, who seems the wear the size of education funding cuts as a badge of honour. She is someone who presents herself much more as the minister against education than for education and the important role of educators. So the government really does need to take stock and support some of the aspects of the motion before the House by the member for Riverina.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is critical for Australia, across federal and state government levels, to upgrade the status, rewards and professional development available to teachers. We must try to build a high
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> trust relationship in the school learning environment, to bring teachers and parents closer together, to use new forms of information technology so that they are in regular contact and communication on a daily basis, to ensure that students recognise the honoured role of education in our society. I believe that in 10 to 20 years from now, Australia will look back and see the lasting damage of Vanstonism in education&mdash;running down the opportunities for young Australians, running down the place of education in our society and running down the place of educators, abetted in that sad task by the member for Goldstein, Dr Kemp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Right around the world countries are saying, whether it is in West Europe or North America, that the three main priorities for government are&mdash;and they literally say this&mdash;education, education and education. This is a government that has a peculiar set of priorities in quarantining defence spending while trying to run down the quality of our education system at this critical time in the nation's development. It should be doing much more to support teachers as educators in our society and much more to support our education system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the member for Riverina to continue his call to that effect within the government, but most importantly to re-examine his remorseless call for more authority as the only answer to these questions of anti-social behaviour in the school learning environment. Perhaps we need to look at some of the longer term trends in our society and make a much greater effort to rebuild social capital and trust. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support this motion on teachers not merely because I was a teacher in a past life but also because I am a parent of school age children and a long-term supporter of several schools' parents and citizenship associations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been a full member of no less than nine school communities across the state of Queensland over a period of 22 years or more. Having a past life as a teacher has given me an insight and personal experience of the day-to-day pressures of planning, coordinating, administration, implementation,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3944"> reflection and review of all business associated with getting kids to school, coping and dealing with the learning experience for the school days, monitoring homework and dealing with the successes and failings of my own children and others as they pass through the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mostly, teachers want to teach. I have watched and experienced over a few years the gradual erosion of quality teaching time through school based management practices that have placed a greater administrative burden on teachers than they really need. I have seen the growth in erosion of teaching time by tasks teachers really do not need to perform, like counting and collecting money for excursions, supervising and performing tasks for other specialists and sitting through professional development time and thinking, `Why am I here?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the years, professional development time has really been eroded to a point where very little is carried out at all. It should be a compulsory component built into any teacher's professional development timetable to keep in touch with new and up-to-date methods, ideas and programs available for use and application in schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The curriculum for teachers has broadened, so teachers now can be expected to teach aspects of current popular demand without necessarily having any previous training in that field: for example, environmental studies, personal development, human sexuality, computing, information technology, behaviour management and life skills. Professional development needs to allow teachers to keep abreast of all these changing and growing demands for time and space in a shrinking teaching day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a need today, I feel, to explain the length and breadth of a teacher's capacity to cater to the needs of 18 to 35 individuals in one class&mdash;or more, depending on the setting. Teachers have for a long time been the last to raise a cry of concern or move against actions and changes to them within the system. That is why I believe they do need to have their voice heard, but not as stridently as we have recently witnessed in Queensland with strikes and dislocation to the community. I feel that
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> goodwill has been lost by a too uncompromising stand by a union on the recent leading schools issue. Many of the details of this change in Queensland can be worked out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Teachers do need to be better paid, as they are the primary cause of our many experts, heroes, managers, workers, scientists and students achieving the successes of our time. Without teachers we could not have put a man on the moon, built rocket ships or been responsible for our greatest and noblest feats of human endeavour. Our teachers supported and guided every one of us here in this House, no matter what duty we perform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There would be few people today who would not thank one or more teacher for giving them something no other person, including their parents, could give them: that is, the opportunity to gain and use, to the best of their personal ability, an education to see and understand life through the skills taught to last a lifetime&mdash;skills such as sharing, reading, cooperation, patience, humour, physical challenges, determination, perseverance, keeping on task, pride in effort, success, dealing with failure, overcoming inabilities, fulfilling and achieving personal goals, time management and how to have fun.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Teachers take individuals and, over 12 years, accompany them on one of life's greatest journeys of becoming&mdash;moving from childhood through adolescence to adulthood. Parents and peers accompany them on this journey, but the teacher has the greatest impact through their planned programs of learning. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister must show courage and leadership because, if he does not, extremist elements, who parade themselves under the banner One Nation, will make great use of it when they hold a meeting in Newcastle on the day after Mr Howard meets the Newcastle workers. Fear and insecurity about jobs and the future can play into the hands of shrill extremism. The Prime Minister can either act on Thursday to stop the spread of extremism or capitulate in the face of extremism by not coming up with brave and dramatic visions for supporting the people of Newcastle and the Hunter region in this current crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time after time the Prime Minister has been wrong footed when it comes to facing the challenge put before him by the One Nation extremists.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, you will have noticed that the tax cart is running again, after losing a wheel in 1985 and being derailed in 1993. As the ALP drafts its new economic policy, new guidelines require that it be internally consistent and not contradict other policy reports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and his deputy have not yet caught up with their own guidelines. Last week the Leader of the Opposition was reported as saying that a GST would impose a very heavy burden on middle Australia and it would be very confusing and very difficult for small business. At the same time his deputy, last Monday, said that if people can come up with some proposal that makes some sense, of course they will have a look at it. On Tuesday he said that he was not leaving the door open for a GST&mdash;this from a man who, according to Ian Henderson, commands within the party legendary status with respect to policy drafting skills!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, inconsistency on tax is nothing new for the ALP. We have all heard of the tax summit of 1985 and Paul Keating's famous option C&mdash;the 12&half; per cent consumption tax. What is more interesting is that the only supporters in cabinet for option C were Bob Hawke, Susan Ryan, Kim Beazley and Gareth Evans. Was the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) any purer? According to John Edwards, Crean and Kelty agreed with the Treasurer's diagnosis and felt that there was no other way to go than a broad based consumption tax.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This government claims to be the champion of small business. If so, why is a small business in my electorate facing insolvency because of the inflexibility of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act? This local business, through no fault of its own, fell behind in its superannuation contribution payments. Thinking they were doing the right thing, the firm paid the outstanding amount of $13,000 directly to a fund after the cut-off date allowed by the law. Now the Australian Taxation Office is demanding the same $13,000, plus interest, plus the guarantee charge, plus an admin charge&mdash;totalling a grand sum of $21,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ATO is bound to collect this amount and, because of the voucher system used to distribute these funds, it is impossible for the super fund to credit the employer for this double payment. Furthermore, the fund cannot release the amount already paid to the ATO unless certain, and very strict, hardship criteria are met. My constituents, quite harshly, do not qualify. The result is that the firm is now being forced not only to pay the penalty in the form of charges and interest but also to effectively pay their employees' superannuation contribution twice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is absurd. These people are indeed caught in a catch-22 or, as they put it, `between a rock and a hard place'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Much as I regret the dismembering of the Department of Social Security, its dealings with one of my constituents, Mr Michael Visciglio, do it no credit. In 1995 when Mr Visciglio applied for the age pension he ticked the `No' box regarding managed investments. His payments commenced shortly afterwards. A year later Mr Visciglio was advised by his financial adviser that the department had mistakenly assessed some $16,000 of his rollover fund investment, an error which had cost him $1,400.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">DSS acknowledged the error but only paid the higher pension rate from late 1996. His request for a review of the decision was refused on the grounds that it was outside the three&hyphen;month period when full arrears become payable. DSS claims the information it sent back to Mr Visciglio after his initial application displayed their mistake and he should have identified the mistake then and there.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3949"> What DSS does not appreciate is that older Australians applying for benefits do not necessarily understand the increasingly complicated arrangements for pensions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The moral of his case appears to be that all pensioners, whenever they are sent any advice from DSS relating to their pensions, should not trust the department and should have the matter examined thoroughly by a financial adviser, regardless of the cost and inconvenience.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the House expresses its deep regret at the death on Wednesday, 21 May 1997, of the Honourable Sir William John Aston, KCMG, a Member of this House for the Division of Phillip from 1955 to 1961 and 1963 to 1972, Deputy Government Whip from 1959 to 1961 and 1963 to 1964, Government Whip from 1964 to 1967 and Speaker of the House of Representatives from 1967 to 1972, places on record its appreciation of his long and significant public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their loss.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Sir William was born on 19 September 1916 at Sydney, New South Wales. His service to this nation began early. As a young man during World War II, he enlisted in the Citizen Military Forces, transferring soon after to the Second Australian Imperial Force. He served in New Guinea and rose from gunner to the rank of lieutenant with the 82nd Australian Mobile Searchlight Battery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before entering federal parliament, Sir William was already active and successful in local politics. He was an alderman of the Waverley Council from 1949 to 1953, during which time he was Mayor from 1952 to 1953.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir William became a member of the House of Representatives in 1955 when he won the New South Wales seat of Phillip for the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Liberal Party. He held that seat until the election in 1961 and he returned as representative for Phillip for two years in 1963, holding the seat again until his defeat in 1972.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His maiden speech in the House in March 1956 was characterised by his concern for the issues then facing Australia in the Cold War era and the difficulties confronting the wheat and wool industries. He also spoke on the need for the government of the day to communicate and explain its policies to the people and the need for streamlining the country's industrial relations system&mdash;issues which are, perhaps not surprisingly, equally pertinent and important today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During his 15 years in parliament, Sir William contributed extensively to the work of a range of parliamentary committees, including the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Joint Select Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned before, Sir William also served as Deputy Government Whip from 1959 to 1961 and from 1963 to 1964. The pinnacle of his political career came when he was elected Speaker in 1967. The six years that he occupied the Speaker's chair saw some colourful episodes and turbulent debates in this parliament, which tested his mettle and his impressive parliamentary and political skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir William's public service was recognised both overseas and at home. In 1969 he was awarded the Korea Order of Distinguished Service Merit, 1st Class, for his contributions to the promotion of friendly relations between the Republic of Korea and the Commonwealth of Australia. In 1970 he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The passing of Sir William will be mourned by those who knew him well.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife, Lady Betty Aston, and his daughters, Margaret and Anne, son&hyphen;in&hyphen;law, Edward, and grandchildren, William, Elizabeth and Catherine, our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3950"> Minister (Mr Howard) in this motion of condolence and extend the condolences of the opposition to the Hon. Sir William Aston's surviving relatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has canvassed pretty well the career of the former member for Phillip, the Hon. Sir William Aston. Of course, its peak was his assumption of the chair which you now sit in, Mr Speaker. He was in the chair in probably one of the most difficult periods of Australian parliamentary history. It became even more difficult about three years later but it was still pretty difficult. It was a period of time of very considerable community bitterness and concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that once or twice during the period of time that he was Speaker he felt himself clothed with insufficient power to conduct the affairs of the parliament, sought additional powers and, at one point of time, I understand, he suggested that he might feel obliged to vacate the chair. So if you think you have a tough time, Mr Speaker, there are others who have had a tougher one than you, as the years have gone by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anybody who has risen to the position of Speaker in the parliament can only have done so because of a very distinguished parliamentary background. There is a requirement that a person who is the Speaker is a person with an absolutely thoroughgoing understanding of the processes of parliament, its traditions, the richness of those traditions and a concern that the whole parliament should be capable of delivering of its best to the entire nation. For a couple of terms Sir William Aston was entrusted with holding that most senior position in parliament and was adjudged by his peers, in order for him to get there, as a person who held that parliamentary tradition close to himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He did not do it in all the best of electoral circumstances. He held a marginal seat and, as a result of that, he kept in communication with his constituents. Those constituents honoured him from time to time. As I look through his record, I see that he was in receipt of a large number of community honours. That also speaks well for his contribution to parliamentary life. Above all, it is not so much in that role he had as Whip but
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in that role he had as Speaker that I think all members of the parliament will honour him and honour his memory, and all will join in the condolences to his family.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support this motion of condolence on the death of Sir William John Aston, a former Speaker of this House, as you have heard, from 1967 to 1973, and a former Government Whip for periods varying from 1959, including the years 1964 to 1967.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although he was a member for an urban Sydney seat, he did take a close and abiding interest in regional Australia. Indeed, in his first contribution in this place, his maiden speech, he made mention of the vital contribution to the national economy of wool and wheat exports and reflected on their role in improving this nation's balance of payments performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He raised, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has referred to, the need for an improved approach to industrial relations. In terms of the concerns of the day he spoke of the need for an arbitration and industrial system which would contribute in a fair and just way to surmounting what he saw as the nation's economic difficulties at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He vigorously opposed the stirring up of racial hatred. He warned against isolationism as a nation in the advent of modern times and modern science. He urged Australians to cherish their heritage, their country and their democracy. As an accountant by training, and with a distinguished wartime service record, Sir William Aston contributed much to this parliament and to the Australian nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can, as he suggests, be very proud of our national heritage and we would do well to meet the challenges that Sir William Aston lay before us: to be a nation which shows global leadership; to be a nation giving a lead in the trade of commodities and services; to be a nation tolerant of the views of others while proud of our own heritage; and to be a nation committed to peace, stability and democracy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am the only member, I think, who was actually here during the period that Sir William Aston served here. There are several things that are worth comment. Firstly, Bill Aston took over as Speaker after two very long tenures; people may have heard of Archie Cameron, a fairly redoubtable figure, who was succeeded by Sir John McLeay. Bill Aston took over at the end of those two fairly significant periods of speakerships.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting part about his period was that while he was only Speaker for five years, he was there during the period of the Holt prime ministership, the McEwen prime ministership, the John Gorton prime ministership and the Bill McMahon prime ministership. In fact he saw quite a span of Prime Ministers. The interesting part about it, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has commented, was that it was a fairly willing time within the House. It was certainly a time when the conservative government was losing the support of the people and quite apart from the arguments&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, no, not all. We are on the ascendancy now, my friend. The difficulty that I think people need to understand is that under Sir Robert Menzies there was a very pronounced feeling of stability. But then that period ended, Gough Whitlam took over as leader of the Labor Party, there were the difficulties about Vietnam and when, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) commented, there were problems in the House, it was as much a reflection of the considerable turbulence in the electorate at large as in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bill Aston was a very significant figure. The electorate he represented was not an easy electorate. It was an area that, apart from the occasional influx of New Zealanders, had had a political swing that meant that one could never be sure which way it was going to go. Of course, Jeanette McHugh took over from him. He certainly made a significant contribu
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion as government whip and, before that, as deputy whip. Although he was defeated in 1961, when again it was a very narrowly hung parliament, he re&hyphen;won the seat in 1963 and from thereafter retained it until his retirement in 1972.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was one of that post World War II generation who served in the war, who served with distinction, and who remembered well the contribution that the armed forces made to the nation at large, as well as to the good government of this country, in those post&hyphen;war years. I regard him as a significant parliamentarian. His contribution as Speaker in those turbulent days was quite exemplary and I and my wife would like also to offer our sympathy to his family.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the current speaker of the House of Representatives I want to speak briefly in the context of this condolence motion about one of my distinguished predecessors, Sir William John Aston KCMG. Although I did not serve with Bill Aston during his period in the House of Representatives I was privileged to meet him after he left the parliament. From that acquaintance and from speaking with those with whom he worked, as well as having studied his remarks in the House and his rulings from the chair, I feel that I knew him quite well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bill Aston was elected Speaker on 21 February 1967, following the retirement of the longest&hyphen;serving Speaker, Sir John McLeay. He had enormous respect for the institution of parliament and was determined to preserve the dignity and the authority of the chair. It was a time of considerable change and challenge: Gough Whitlam's leadership was revitalising the opposition, the community was greatly divided over our role in Vietnam, and the tragic drowning of Prime Minister Holt led to sudden changes in the prime ministership. They were not easy times for a Speaker&mdash;they rarely are&mdash;but Bill carried out his responsibilities with strength and dignity, reinforced by a staunch commitment to upholding the role of the chair and the traditions of the House. His determination to apply the proper parliamentary processes and procedures is evident from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record of his
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3952"> exchanges with prominent members of the House at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were two particularly difficult incidents during his term as Speaker. On one occasion a group a women protesting against Australia's involvement in the Vietnam war chained themselves to the metal railings in the public gallery and really disrupted proceedings. Speaker Aston suspended the proceedings and ordered the chains to be cut with bolt cutters. After the Serjeant&hyphen;at&hyphen;Arms had cut through the chains and removed the protesters from the gallery the Speaker calmly resumed the proceedings. On another occasion, a member, who had been named and suspended, refused to leave the chamber; the sitting was suspended. Eventually the Speaker's authority prevailed. The member apologised and left the chamber. As I said, these were indeed difficult days for the Speaker, but Bill consistently demonstrated his determination to maintain the dignity and authority of the high office he held.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were many such successes and highlights throughout his distinguished parliamentary career and, as always, some frustrations. A known disappointment was his inability at the time to establish a system of House of Representatives standing committees, which he believed would do much to improve the processes of the House. Such a system came later and his views about the need for and effectiveness of it have been well and truly proven correct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bill was a warm, kind and friendly man, respected by his parliamentary colleagues and political opponents alike. He had left an indelible mark on the pages of our Australian parliamentary history, and he will be remembered with deep affection by those with whom he was associated. He will also be remembered by his good friends at the Watsons Bay Hotel where, during his retirement years, he spent many a relaxed hour discussing the relative merits of Tooheys Old beer compared with their new brew. Bill was quite proud of the fact that he travelled to and from the hotels by Mercedes, even if the local bus provided the service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Among his friends, he always fondly referred to his wife as the duchess, and when
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> asked about the letters after his name he explained them to mean `Kindly call me God'. Bill Aston was a fine man and will be greatly missed. He leaves behind his beloved and devoted wife of 55 years, Lady Betty Aston; their two daughters, Margaret and Anne; son-in-law Edward; and his grandchildren, William, Elizabeth and Catherine. Tragically, his son Raymond, who had a promising political career ahead of him, died suddenly shortly after becoming a minister in the Greiner government. To the members of his immediate and extended family, we offer our deepest sympathy. They should be immensely proud of his achievements and his legacy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been disturbed today to hear reports that some of the banks are going to pass on the full effect of the official cut of half a per cent to big business whilst small business may have to wait around another six weeks and even then may not get the full amount of the cut. I say to the honourable member for Bowman, who has taken a very consistent interest in the concerns of small business in her own electorate, and to all members that this government would regard it as absolutely unacceptable if
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the banks were to discriminate against small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is already a mountain of official complaint from people in business about the fact that they do not get a fair enough deal from the banks so far as small business is concerned. I want to say on behalf of the government that small business should receive exactly the same deal as big business. The idea that there should be any discrimination is unacceptable and ought to be unacceptable to all members in this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point out that, if the large banks were to pass on the full 0.5 per cent cut in official interest rates to small business, the interest saving on the average small business loan would be about $2,500 a year. It is very important that these official interest rate cuts are followed as soon as possible by cuts in the marketplace. Small businesses have benefited enormously from the cuts that have occurred already, but that is no reason why they should not get the full measure of the benefit of the cut in official interest rates that took place last Friday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am on my feet, I remind the parliament that that cut last Friday would not have occurred had it not been for the very responsible budget brought down by the Treasurer. That budget tackled the savings problem. Those who sit opposite left us with a $10.5 billion deficit and, at the end of year three, we will have it in surplus.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing that this raises is the question of whether the competition between banks is as high as it should be. Today I have spoken to the Chairman of the ACCC who has commenced an investigation in relation to the major banks to see whether there has been any price collusion which is contrary to the Trade Practices Act. The Chairman of the ACCC will report to me, I hope, by early next week on the basis of his investigations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third point that this raises is whether or not the government can ensure that there are structural changes in the Australian finance industry to improve competition which will ensure that consumers get the full benefit of reductions in official interest rates. The financial system inquiry has recently reported to the government. It found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulatory framework proposed by this inquiry is founded on the premise that the financial system should be more strongly competitive and efficient.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not think that it is well enough understood that a number of the recommendations that were made in the Wallis inquiry were designed to enhance competition to banks, first, by  opening up the payment system to non&hyphen;bank financial institutions and, secondly, by creating a single prudential regulator which would facilitate the new entry into deposit taking markets and the growth of new entrants as competitors to the banks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the banks have opposed these recommendations. It is highly interesting to note those banks that have opposed them. One of the reasons why they may be worried by these recommendations is the degree to which they would enhance non&hyphen;bank financial institutions competing directly with banks. These are recommendations which are designed to enhance competition. They appeal to the government for that reason. This may, in fact, be a very clear case study of the need for new non&hyphen;banks to get into the market and to compete with banks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen in relation to the events of last week that it was the non-bank institutions&mdash;Aussie Home Loans, RAMs and now Priority One&mdash;that were able to pass on, in full, the benefit of cuts in official interest rates. Only the banks have lagged the game and they have all lagged to the same degree. As far as the government is concerned, there should be no price taking in response to this. This reaffirms the government's resolve in relation to any recommendations that it can pick up to enhance competition against the banks through the new regulatory system to provide the best deal for consumers.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, the homebuyers in Australia and small business in Australia are now beginning to see the benefits of good economic policy. Since this government was elected, standard variable mortgage rates have reduced from 10.5 per cent to 7.2 per cent&mdash;3.3 per cent in the year since the election of this government. If you want to compare the standard variable rate to average rates, they are the lowest rates in 24 years. If you compare them to the ceiling rates which were charged back in the 1960s, they are the lowest rates since 1964. Mr Speaker, there is no better benefit you could
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> give to homebuyers in Australia than reducing their interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How has this been done? This has been done firstly by locking in a low inflation environment. This was the government that entered into the 14 August monetary agreement with the Reserve Bank. We set out quite clearly an inflation target. We gave the bank independence in the conduct of monetary policy, and not only did we set the targets but also we stuck to those targets. We are now facing up to an Australian economy where you have underlying inflation at two per cent and the consumer price index at one. This is territory which Australia has not been in since the 1970s. And who opposed us in relation to that statement on the conduct on monetary policy? The Labor Party. They opposed the changes to put in that monetary policy. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition, who was pushed out by Prime Minister Keating to oppose it, threatened to sue us over putting into place those monetary arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing that we did is that we sat down and we took a $10.3 billion deficit&mdash;the legacy of years of neglect of the Labor Party&mdash;and we turned it into a surplus over the first term of our government. And who opposed our doing it? Who voted against all of those measures? The heroes of the high deficit policy themselves, Beazley and Evans, opposed all of those fiscal consolidation measures; they said it should not be done. Mr Speaker, the benefits of that fiscal consolidation are now flowing through to homebuyers. In relation to wages, what did we say? We said it was important, if we were going to preserve that low inflation goal and to get interest rates down, that there be a sensible safety net adjustment. And who was down in the Industrial Relations Commission trying to argue against it, because the last thing the Labor Party wanted was lower interest rates in this country?

The first thing is that if there are some inadequacies in the taxation system&mdash;and I wonder if he really thinks there are any inadequacies in the taxation system&mdash;then quite a lot of those inadequacies can be sheeted home to the fact that he ran the show for 13 years and he allowed the Australian taxation system to become more and more inadequate.</PARA></TALK.START>

That allegation is that in some ways our savings rebate is unfair. He is against the savings rebate because it is not means tested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the parliamentary recess, I saw an analysis done by I think it was BT&mdash;which is not noted, might I say, for its uncritical endorsement of Liberal&hyphen;National Party economic policies. In fact, when the former government was in power, it had a fairly strong record, if I remember correctly, of making some very warm remarks about the former government's economic policy. So, in the interests of broad&hyphen;mindedness and in the interests of being open&hyphen;hearted and bipartisan, let me draw on a study made by BT, published last week, which indicated very conclusively that the proportionate benefits to be gained under the savings tax rebate were overwhelmingly for low income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It stands to reason that, if you are on an effective tax rate of 20 per cent and you get a 15 per cent tax rebate, you are proportionately a lot better off than somebody who is on an effective tax rate of over 30 per cent and gets a 15 per cent tax rebate. Let me say to those who sit opposite and let me also say to the Australian Democrats: you are talking about means testing a rebate that is going, for the first time, to really reward saving. For the first time, we are going to give incentive across the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very interested to note, incidentally, while we are talking about the attitude of the Australian Democrats, that in their election policy the Australian Democrats proposed a savings initiative that did not have a means test. They proposed a savings initiative that would give exactly the same amount of money without a means test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proud of the fact that the savings rebate announced in the budget goes beyond what we offered during the election campaign. I say again that it is a remarkably new definition of a broken promise to say that, when you deliver more than you promise, you have broken your promise. This is an extraordinary definition: if you deliver more than you promise, you have broken your promise. If
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that is the new definition of a broken promise in Australian politics, then you had better get used to the fact because in so many areas we are delivering more than we promised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We delivered more with our savings rebate, we delivered more on capital gains tax and we have cut interest rates a lot further than we said we would at the time of the election. In fact, if I remember rightly, the statements made about interest rates at the time of the election were very restrained, very conservative and very responsible, yet in a bare 14 months the Australian battler is seeing his or her mortgage fall by $225 a month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Deputy Leader of the Opposition talked about people on low incomes. Can I remind him that the average loan in Australia, particularly in the metropolitan areas, is around $100,000. Those people are $225 a month better off. The battlers who are getting the benefit of that will remember the 17 per cent and 18 per cent that Keating and Beazley gave them. They will remember the unaffordability of housing, they will remember the pressures that are on families, and they will say, `Thank heaven we have now got a government that is worried about the mainstream interests of mainstream Australia and is delivering genuine reductions in interest rates.'</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question. I know he is interested about those who are in Townsville and access to the savings rebate. The first thing I would say to the people of Townsville in relation to the savings rebate is that only a coalition government could deliver it. After 13 years of Labor Party government,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3960"> Labor had never reduced taxes on savings, and it is clear from the attitude which the Labor Party has taken to the budget that it is against reducing taxes on savings. Nothing could be clearer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one big difference between the two sides of this House. The coalition government believes in reducing taxes on savings and encouraging savings and the Labor Party does not. That is the point here. The coalition government took 13 months to deliver tax incentives to save and the Labor Party took 13 years to do nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the people of Townsville, who now have the opportunity of these savings rebates, that is the big difference. Of course, for the people of Townsville as well, the self&hyphen;funded retirees would never been given a look&hyphen;in by Labor, because Labor did not care about the self&hyphen;funded retirees.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="HOWARD" NAMEID="ZD4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr Howard</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Never.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They were never going to give any access whatsoever to self&hyphen;funded retirees. Nor were they going to give access to those in Townsville who might have been minding children at home and were not in the work force. They would have never had any access to a savings rebate if this government had not delivered it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said on budget night that distributional analysis indicated that 66 per cent of the cost of the savings rebate would go to taxpayers on an income at or below $40,000, with 34 cent going to wage and salary earners with incomes below $40,000, 11 per cent going to self&hyphen;funded retirees with incomes at or below $40,000 and 19 per cent going to self-employed individuals with incomes at or below $40,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bankers Trust research, which the Prime Minister has just referred to, comes to a similar conclusion. According to its research, the savings rebate is more redistributional. According to Bankers Trust, drawing on work done for NATSEM, the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling at the University of Canberra, 79 per cent of the benefit of the savings rebate is delivered to people with incomes below $40,000&mdash;that is, 21 per cent to those with incomes from $5,400 to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $10,000, 29 per cent to those on incomes between $10,000 and $20,000, 17 per cent to those on incomes between $20,000 and $30,000 and 10.8 per cent to those on incomes between $30,000 and $40,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rebate, as a percentage of tax payable, is strongest for low income earners. If you happen to be on the marginal tax rate of 20 per cent, three&hyphen;quarters of the tax payable on your savings is abolished. For those on the 47 per cent tax rate, it is one-third. It is strongly redistributional because, firstly, it is rebate and, secondly, it is capped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because the Labor Party did nothing for 13 years, the Labor Party now runs around and says, `This should be means tested in some particular way.' Why was it then that the l-a-w tax cuts were never means tested? Under the l-a-w tax cuts a person on $200,000 per annum got a $1,250 tax cut. A person on a $20,000 annual income got nothing, got zero, under the l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w tax cuts. The Leader of the Opposition turns his back at this point because he knows what a fraud this argument that the Labor Party is now running is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the real measure to improve the fairness of superannuation was introduced, the surcharge, which said that if you are on an income of $85,000 instead of getting a 33 per cent reduction you would only get a 17 per cent reduction, it was the Labor Party that came out to oppose it. The Labor Party voted against it in the Senate. The Labor Party voted against the measure which was designed to prevent the unfairness of the superannuation system and which was open to salary sacrificing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is where they stood on the superannuation surcharge. That is where they stood on the l-a-w tax cuts. When you get a universal measure, which is strongly redistributional, where according to BT 79 per cent of people below $40,000 get the benefit, where it is redistributional, one, because it is a rebate and, two, because it is cap, the Labor Party tries to engage in this furphy and pretend that it is interested in means testing. It is an absolute furphy. The Labor Party is not interested in means testing at all. The Labor Party is stung because it could never do anything to encourage savings in this country.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3961"> It never reduced the tax rates on savings in 13 years. This government manages to do it in 13 months and they are stung.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the people in Townsville, the people whom the member for Herbert represents in this parliament, this is a benefit which is universally accessible, gives them an incentive and gives them choice.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. It is a very important one for a lot of Australians. I well remember the commitments that we took to the last election and they did indeed focus on creating an improved economic environment in which farmers might have the opportunity to recover and prosper. They were very appropriately
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> directed policies given the mess the primary industry sector was left in by the previous administration. We are delivering, we will continue to deliver and it is very important that we do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has been reminding people of the interest rates that housing borrowers suffered under the previous administration. The farm sector remembers paying even more. They remember paying interest rates in excess of 20 per cent for around 20 months getting on to two years at the worst. The damage that that did is almost impossible to estimate. You know, there was a total farm debt left behind when we came to power of $18 billion. We will never really know, but I reckon a very large proportion of that was nothing more and nothing less than capitalised interest. They had to borrow to pay their interest under you. So bad were things that for many there was no choice. If they wanted to continue, they had to go back to the bank and say, `We have to borrow more money to pay your interest bills.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Friday's interest rate cuts, assuming they are passed on in full&mdash;there is a challenge&mdash;by this nation's financial institutions, could slash a further $80 million from farm costs in this country. That would take us to something in the order of $350 million in savings to the farm sector since we came to power as a result of better economic management and declining interest rates. It is reaping the benefits of sound policy. Those benefits are enormous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already there is evidence that that farm sector debt is being wound back, particularly in the cropping sector. Profitability&mdash;albeit that we would all like to see it happen more quickly&mdash;is at least now starting, to some extent, to be restored, with huge numbers of our farmers now finding that they are in a better position to extract some sort of return from their operations. Nothing helps that more than an improvement in interest rates. Furthermore, cuts in interest rates for the farm sector stimulate investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This vitally important sector has remained internationally competitive only by cutting costs and boosting investment traditionally, but there is now a desperate need out there
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3962"> for investment in new capital equipment, in new technology, in order to ensure not only boosted productivity but also&mdash;this is a very important point&mdash;to substantially improve the sustainability of what is happening on our farms. This can be done, for example, through the purchasing of sometimes quite expensive conservation tillage equipment. In that regard I note that environmentalists everywhere should be delighting in better economic management producing better results for farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting too that that other great investor and employer in rural Australia, the mining sector, also sees its future improved through lower interest rates together with low inflation, because that helps it to create a better investment climate and a greater confidence. So I think it is very important indeed that the banks register the urgent need for them to pass on quickly and in full the latest reductions in interest rates.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

It is important to understand the context in which this decision was announced.

It is on that basis, on the basis of research that has been undertaken in this country, that we have made these adjustments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The research that was undertaken in the longitudinal study shows you that if you enter people through the family stream they have
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lower skill levels and they have a less satisfactory employment experience as a result. Their unemployment rate 18 months after coming to Australia is twice the Australian average.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you enter people through the skilled streams, we know that they have a higher participation rate. We know that they are able to get employment. We know that, if they come through the employer nomination and the business skills stream, they have a three per cent to four per cent unemployment rate 18 months after arrival in Australia. If they come through the other aspects of the skilled migration program, we know their unemployment experience is no worse than the Australian level of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in that context that I would like you to focus upon the economic benefits that can be achieved through a properly structured immigration program, particularly the business skills category. What we have now is a report that shows that, three years after arrival in Australia, the average employment per new business started by those who come through the business skills program is 4.5 jobs for each new business established. What we find is that 82 per cent of arrivals are in fact engaged in a business. We find that, on average, slightly more than $500,000 has been invested and $1.5 million has been transferred to Australia. We find that three&hyphen;quarters of the businesses that have been established under that part of the program are involved in exports.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. It gives me an opportunity to say that the honourable member has a very real interest in Australia's international relations, and in particular Australia's relationship with China.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian government warmly welcomes the visit by Zhu Rongji, the Vice Premier of China. The visit by Zhu Rongji is the most senior visit by a Chinese official since 1994. It is a visit that follows on from the Prime Minister's very successful visit to China earlier this year. During the course of that visit, the Prime Minister made it clear that he would like to see more high level visitors from China. So we are delighted to see Zhu Rongji here so soon after the Prime Minister's visit. Already Zhu Rongji has visited Western Australia, and he has visited my home state of South Australia where he was welcomed last night at a very successful reception at the Hyatt Hotel in Adelaide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trade and investment relationship with China will obviously be the centrepiece of the visit, and there will be extensive discussions about that trade and investment relationship. I am absolutely certain that as a result of this visit we will see that overall economic relationship taken forward. Obviously at the end of the day that is not just a matter of rhetoric or, from the opposition's point of view, just a matter of some amusement, but it is a matter of growing living standards and more jobs for Australians. It has to be understood that so much of foreign policy and trade policy at the end of the day is not an esoteric exercise; it is about strengthening job opportunities for Australians and, of course, advancing their living standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This visit though will also cover wider issues. It will be an opportunity to discuss with China's fifth ranking official the agreement between Australia and China to establish a human rights dialogue. It is also very importantly a great opportunity for us to reinforce the view we hold in this country&mdash;almost all of us hold in this country&mdash;that we have a very deep partnership with countries such as China in the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For Australia's part, it is quite untrue that we see China as a threat. We see nothing of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3966"> the sort. We totally repudiate suggestions by those who argue that Australia is part of some containment strategy of China.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the visit by Zhu Rongji is yet another step forward in developing Australia's very broad and deep relationship not just with China but with Asia generally. We have had, just in the last three months, the visit by Prime Minister Hashimoto which was a most successful visit, amongst other things, leading to an agreement between our Prime Minister and the Japanese Prime Minister to hold annual summits. We have had the signing of the Australia-Indonesia development agreement. We had the signing of the maritime boundaries agreement between Australia and Indonesia. This is a government and this is a country which is moving forward in its policy of engagement with Asia&mdash;and doing so very successfully.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

I know how interested she is in ensuring that young people in her electorate have access to excellent vocational education programs. There are some excellent programs at Banyo High School and Nudgee College.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's policy for vocational education, and particularly the establishment of the new national apprenticeship system, strike directly at the root causes of youth unemployment which became so deeply entrenched under the failures of the previous government. It was under the previous government, of course, that the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships, as a proportion of the work force, reached the lowest point for three decades. It was under the policies of the previous government that one in three 14&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds could not read adequately after 13 years of Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the first time, as a result of the decisions and the initiatives of this government, Australia is putting in place the first national apprenticeship system since Federation. I am very pleased to report to the House that in Adelaide last Friday the state and territory ministers agreed with the Commonwealth to lock in the vital decisions that will allow this new national apprenticeship system to come into operation. The decisions that were taken last Friday will be immensely encouraging to small business and medium size businesses which are looking to take on young people.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Friday last week the ministers agreed, first of all, to greatly simplified regulatory arrangements for apprenticeships and traineeships, including a significant reduction in the paperwork that will be necessary to take on an apprentice. Under the decisions taken under the new national system, in place of an existing 12 forms in the states and territories only one form will be necessary to hire an apprentice or a trainee throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, there will be national recognition of training providers. A training provider recognised in one state will be recognised in every state and the qualifications gained by young people in one state or territory will be recognised throughout Australia. This, again, will expand their employment opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, there will be new funding arrangements for off&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training for apprentices and trainees, allowing employers, for the first time, to choose which provider will provide the off&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training for the apprentices. For the first time we will have a demand&hyphen;driven system, not a system which is subordinate to the interests of the Labor Party's union supporters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As these complex bureaucratic processes&mdash;which have held up the development of the apprenticeship system, demoralised so many young people and entrenched youth unemployment&mdash;are addressed by the policies of this government, we will see many new opportunities coming through for young people to get the kind of quality training that will lead them on to real jobs.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a minister who does love to be bull-headed. This is a minister who likes to slide through parliament. We had him when he was dealing with railways slip sliding around the issues of the alleged costs that were in front of him&mdash;half-truths, little bits of light shown here and there, and a half&hyphen;smart smile when
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3974"> one or two or us got up and pointed out that he was misleading this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is a minister with a great sense of invention when it comes to people who relate to him. I have never seen a new minister in office get into such trouble with the people who ought to have his trust and the people he ought to be dealing with in a forthright and decent fashion. He has developed a reputation as a slip slider around the truth and a slip slider around propriety, always leaving himself with a small out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have not left yourself with an out here, Minister. There is no back door for you. You have sought a back door by trying to blag the opposition for its concerns about whether or not the rules that you have approved for safe operations at Kingsford Smith are in fact appropriate. It is a little problem that we happen to share with a large number of pilots, I might say, in this community. They are making amply clear for you, Minister, in correspondence to the newspapers the safety that they think those operations now contain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But you are personally hostage to it, old son. You are the one who has invented a system of air traffic control at Sydney airport over which anybody rationally looking at air safety would put a question mark. You will carry the consequences of it were anything to happen with this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not content with your political manipulation of safety recommendations associated with the operations of that airport, you seek to use your position to bully air traffic controllers at Sydney airport. What an extraordinary thing that you seek to protect yourself from here. What an extraordinary outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here you are coming into Sydney airport in a propeller plane&mdash;I might say in a type of plane we excluded from Sydney airport because they mussed up the operations at Sydney airport for the more serious commuter operations from the bush and elsewhere. Not content with the fact you have made a mess of the air traffic regulations in the area and not content with the fact that you have decided to fly in in a plane that the previous government excluded from the airport, you decide when you get up there you are going
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to have a conversation with the air traffic control tower.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a normal thing, he says. Yes, it happens every day! The passengers sitting on Ansett flights consult the pilot and say, `Do you mind if I ring air traffic control and get taken out of this holding pattern that I am in at the moment?' Why not. In case you had not noticed, generally speaking, people are quite careful about the use of mobile telephones on aircraft. Whether it actually happens to be permitted or not, you do find in a passenger plane that there is some sort of question mark placed over that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`I am just an ordinary bloke,' says the minister, `just your little battling minister. I am just a battler among ministers out there just trying to get a bit of speed out of the air traffic control system so I can get myself into Mascot a little bit earlier than anyone else.' So what do I do? Three times I ring the tower. Three times I ring them to give them heaps. Three times you argue with the air traffic controller.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> `I am the minister,' you say once. `I am the minister,' you say twice. `I am the minister,' you say a third time. Then the cock crew on the third time of asking and they finally say, `Okay, Barleys, we are going to let the minister in. We are going to have him dissatisfied if we do not.' Then what is put forward by the air traffic controller is that he believes that all this behaviour has been completely inappropriate. You would have to say that any rational person sitting down and taking a look at that and anyone else who happens to use the skies around Sydney, like myself and everybody else here, would be a bit worried about that I would have thought. There is some character of a minister rocking in, having conversations with the air traffic controllers on the way down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the air traffic controller said in the first instance was that it was corrupt and then he provides an analysis to say that it is inappropriate. Under pressure from his superiors he withdraws the expression `corrupt', but he withdraws nothing else from the proposition that he put forward. He withdraws nothing about what he had to say about inappropriate behaviour. He withdraws nothing of his
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3975"> surprise that a minister would come on and three times identify himself and ask for these particular favours. He withdraws nothing of his surprise that, `Yes, such a service is available, but is a service that is availed by pilots.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You ask us to believe that your pilot on the way in said, `Minister, would you come up the front here, old son. Get that phone out. Give them a call at air traffic control.' You can see how it is that bull-headed minister. He would have been up with the pilot: `Why can't you get in faster? Why can't you get your plane down quick? Don't worry about all these other aircraft. Get yourself in. Why can't I ring the tower?' In the end the pilot says, `Yes, you better ring them.' Any pilot responsible for the safety of an aircraft knows when he has a madman on his hands and he knows when the fellow has to be placated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you have done, Minister, is diminish your office. What you have done, Minister, is produce from a dishonourable piece of conduct by yourself a dishonourable performance by you in this House. You have sought under privilege to attack people and, having attacked them, you refuse to table their defence. You can protect yourself in here, old son, but the air traffic controller cannot protect himself in here. You owe it to the House and he is owed a tabling of the totality of your correspondence and not your miserable little effort to conceal it from this parliament and to conceal it from the people of this country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion. Today we have a minister in this House who cannot front up, who cannot acknowledge the fact that he has gone in an aircraft to Sydney airport, which is in confusion already because of the policies that he has put in place and which has enormous safety questions hanging over it, and sought to get priority over 13 other aircraft that could have been carrying 1,000&hyphen;plus passengers. This Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) was a passenger, and he said that he was a pilot. Yes, he was a pilot&mdash;he had a licence that was current in
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the early 1980s. That licence apparently gives him the right as a passenger&mdash;not the pilot of the plane but a passenger&mdash;to get on and say not `It's VKSLS' or whatever the call sign was but `It's John Sharp here'&mdash;not just any ordinary name&mdash;`and I'd like to know how long the delay is going to be and I'd like to know whether something can be done for me.' He asked this three times, and that is what the transcript will show. That is why he has not given us the transcript attached to this letter, because that transcript shows that three times, politely but persistently, he asked air traffic control, `Can't something be done for me?'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately, the two air traffic controllers who heard the conversation&mdash;one the participant, one the monitor&mdash;were a bit worried about this conversation because they interpreted it as the minister attempting to put pressure on them to get him in his small charter plane, which should probably have been at Bankstown and not Sydney anyway, at the head of the queue, ahead of commercial travellers on the other aircraft in the queue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He sat there and said, `Can something be done for me?' The air traffic controller complains, he does an electronic memo, and it has a bit of flamboyant language in it because he was concerned, and he accuses the minister of being corrupt. He also accuses the minister of acting inappropriately in seeking to obtain preference for himself as a result of his position. On Friday of last week, when he discusses the matter with his superiors, he withdraws the term `corrupt' but explicitly stands by the accusation that was in his original memo. That is why we have not seen today from this minister either the transcript of the conversation or the memo that was put forward originally or the statement that has been signed by the air traffic control employee where he retracts one phrase but maintains the substance of his allegations. We have seen none of those things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what does he table? He tables the one thing that suits him, the one thing that happens to benefit his case, and that is the letter from the Airservices Australia head, Bill Pollard, saying, `Don't worry, sport, it's all right.' But this letter refers to those other
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3976"> documents. The minister is quite happy to table the letter that suits him, but he will not table the other documents that demonstrate quite clearly that he has been caught out in yet another exercise of the born to rule mentality of this government and the whole group of people he stands for&mdash;the born to rule mentality that says, `I might be on a plane with two or three people but I should take precedence over thousands of people who are queuing waiting to land. I'm the minister, I should take precedence over other people who are waiting to land at Sydney airport because of my own policies.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If he wants to debate runway configuration issues, then let's go back to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> of a couple of weeks ago and see what the Australian International Pilots Association had to say about parallel runway issues and see what they had to say about the fact that in March alone there were 250&hyphen;odd occasions when pilots were asked to land major jets&mdash;jumbos and the like&mdash;in cross winds greater than the international standard of 15 knots. That was in March alone. If you want to debate those issues then, fine, we will debate them any time you like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is about a minister who cannot lie straight in bed, who comes in here time after time and gives us half the truth. When we debated Falcon Airlines and David Killen he sought to demonstrate a connection between the crash of a plane and the fact that there was a conflict of interest accusation. What he never told the House or the media was that the person concerned had been required to sign a declaration that he would not engage in any supervisory activity with respect to the airline that he formerly had an interest in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Australian National, he would throw around figures with abandon but, when there were explanations that might be relevant, no, the explanations&mdash;the issues that might be relevant in understanding what had happened with Australian National&mdash;were never once put before this House or the Australian people. And it is once too often, Minister, because three times in this instance you stood before air traffic control and said, `Let me have a go.' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had a complete farrago of fabrication here this afternoon, and the chief fabricator was nobody other than the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), who, for example, made up a complete load of codswallop in his presentation to the House this afternoon. If you listen to what the Leader of the Opposition said, he obviously knew nothing about what he was talking about. For example, and I draw on one of many inaccuracies in the Leader of the Opposition's presentation speech to the House this afternoon, the Leader of the Opposition said that I rang Airservices Australia three times. He repeated it several times. He said, `The minister rang Airservices Australia three times.' In fact, I rang them once, not three times. It goes to show how inaccurate and how badly briefed the Leader of the Opposition is in regard to this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition also said in one of the many inaccuracies that he made in his speech to the House this afternoon that these types of aircraft&mdash;the light propeller driven aircraft that I was flying in that day&mdash;were banned by the former Labor government. In fact, they were not. They were never banned. That is why airlines like Country Connections, who fly precisely that type of aircraft, continued to fly right into Mascot airport throughout the period that you were in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what the Leader of the Opposition said in his speech to the House this afternoon&mdash;that this type of aircraft had been banned under a Labor government&mdash;was completely and utterly false, as are the allegations made by the Leader of the Opposition and by the opposition spokesman for transport, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). Indeed, Mr Deputy Speaker, if you go back to the core of this, you will find that there is no substance, none whatsoever, to the accusations made by the Labor Party in the House this afternoon. They accuse me of hiding something when I did not table an attachment to the letter that I had tabled earlier this afternoon. I have looked at what that attachment was. I could not see why it was so important. I will table it. Do you know what  it is?  This
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3977"> is the only thing that I have got that says there is an attachment. In fact, it says in the letter from the head of Airservices Australia that `a copy of the relevant page is also attached'. That is the only reference to anything attached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also about to table the thing that the head of Airservices Australia referred to there, which is the published phone number that is available on a free&hyphen;call basis. I shall shortly also table a transcript of the phone conversation I had&mdash;a transcript which, of course, the Labor Party already has. It is a transcript of a conversation that Airservices Australia gave to the journalist who wrote the article on Monday of this week. In the transcript, you will see, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I sought no favour and that I only gave my name because the person who answered the phone gave his name. To go back to the farrago of fabrications made by the Leader of the Opposition when he said&mdash;and I think it was also said by the member for Melbourne&mdash;that I did not give the call sign of the aircraft&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="TANNER" NAMEID="YU5">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I didn't say that.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, the Leader of the Opposition said it, if that is the case. Indeed, I gave the call sign of the aircraft, as is the appropriate thing to do. The Labor Party's spokesman on transport said that the reason these types of aircraft are not allowed into Mascot airport is that they add to the confusion already created by this coalition government since it came into office 16 months ago. I suggest that the opposition spokesman for transport should go and speak to the people who use Mascot airport. He should go and speak to the people who live under the flight paths, particularly his Labor supporters in places like Marrickville, Sydenham, Petersham, Leichhardt and Glebe&mdash;all Labor strongholds where the Labor government put 50 per cent of all aircraft movements over their heads while we have got it down to 26 per cent today and will get it down to 17 per cent under the long&hyphen;term operating plans proposals. These are the sorts of people who could have been given relief by a Labor government, but who were denied that relief by the Labor government and who are being given it by a coalition government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One sees a fair bit of hypocrisy in political life here in Canberra, but nobody has reached the zenith of hypocrisy that we saw this afternoon from the Leader of the Opposition. He was talking about me seeking some special favour to be given priority into Mascot airport. Who is the champion of VIP aircraft travel in Australia today? Who was the champion of it when Labor was in office? None other than the now Leader of the Opposition! Who is given priority over all other aircraft arrivals at an airport? Who is given that priority? None other than people who travel in VIP aeroplanes, like the Leader of the Opposition. Here he has the gall to stand up in the House this afternoon and say, `Fancy the minister for transport seeking to gain some advantage by getting priority access to Mascot airport,' when it is he who travels more in VIP aeroplanes than certainly I and most others on this side of the House, and it is he who gets the priority access to the airport. Talk about the kettle calling the pot black! My goodness, you are a beauty, fella!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If ever there was an attack that was destined to backfire, that was destined to be seen as incompetent and that was destined to be seen as a hollow attempt to try and make some political capital out of nothing, it is this attack here by the Labor Party in the House this afternoon. As the head of Airservices Australia points out in his letter, the phone number that I used is available as a free&hyphen;call number. It would not be made as a free&hyphen;call number if Airservices Australia did not intend it to be used. Indeed, Airservices Australia informs me that 50 calls a day, on average, come in to that number. The reason why people ring in on that number&mdash;about 50 of them a day&mdash;is for the same reason that I rang in: I was flying in in a light aeroplane and wanted to know what time we were going to land. I wanted to be able to determine whether we would land at Bankstown and avoid delay there or persevere and land at Mascot. This is a common practice. I am sure many people use it and that is why 50 people, according to Airservices Australia, phone that number each day to seek that sort of information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The substance of the attack made by the disaffected Airservices employee was with
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3978"> drawn. The Leader of the Opposition and the Labor spokesman for transport referred to the fact&mdash;and I am glad they raised it and not me&mdash;that this person accused me of being corrupt. That was the basis of his attack. The basis of his attack was that I was corrupt in trying to seek this advantage. He withdrew it because, when he saw the transcript, he knew he had got it wrong. So when they cast aspersions on the basis that somehow or other he did not withdraw the substance of his attack, that is wrong and they have proved it here today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real reason is that we know by this example today&mdash;and Sydney be warned by this&mdash;that Labor intends to revert to parallel runway operations at Mascot airport. That is the basis of this campaign. The person who made this complaint&mdash;the person who is supporting the member for Melbourne and the Leader of the Opposition in their attempts here today&mdash;is opposed to the runway operations we have made at Mascot airport that have given so much relief to so many people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion put forward by the Labor Party is hollow, hypocritical and has no substance. It should be totally and utterly rejected by this House. I table the transcript of the conversation.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for `active service'. The fourth,  for `military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore request the Senate to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby restoring justice and recognition of honourable `active service' with the Royal Australian Navy in direct support of British and Malayan forces during the Malayan Emergency between 1955 and 1960.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House the fact that there is only one exclusion from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable overseas `active service' by Australians.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that under the Quarantine (Animals) Regulations of the Quarantine Act 1908, approval is given for the importation of freeranging exotic animals such as lions, tigers, bears, elephants and non&hyphen;human primates to be used for entertainment purposes in circuses and mobile displays. The issue of circuses using animals is very complex and includes: Transportation of animals, where the animals are kept in tiny cages, often travelling in extremes of temperature over long periods; stressful training techniques, often based on fear, deprivation and brutality and often inhumane living conditions, which do not allow any display of instinctual behaviours. We also believe that inappropriate messages are put forward by forcing wild animals to perform circus tricks. It is certainly not consistent with the focus on environmental awareness for people, especially children to learn that it is acceptable to exploit wild animals for human entertainment. We therefore humbly ask that the House prohibit the importation of all animals including those listed under CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) for use in both international and Australian circuses. We ask this based upon the inhumane conditions that the animals are kept in. The conditions under which the animals are transported, the often cruel training procedures, and the inappropriate messages conveyed to children by forcing wild animals to perform circus tricks.</PARA><PRESENTER.BLOCK>by <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="6V5">Mr Eoin Cameron</NAME><FROM>(from 2,859 citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER>and <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="EK6">Ms Jeanes</NAME><FROM>(from 27 citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER></PRESENTER.BLOCK></PETITION>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> recognises the unnecessarily and dangerously low rate of immunisation of children in Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> welcomes the initiatives announced by the Minister for Health and Family Services as a positive step to reversing the low levels of immunisation, and preventing the unnecessary ill health and deaths of children which can be prevented.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the next few weeks I will become a grandfather for the second time, something which we are all looking forward to very much. One thing I will stress to my daughter and my son-in-law is the importance of immunisation for that child for its protection and wellbeing. Immunisation protects children and adults against harmful infections before they come into contact with them in the community. Immunisation uses the body's natural defence mechanism to build resistance to specific infections. Vaccines work by mimicking the very disease they are meant to protect against and essentially trick the immune system. Immunisation is a simple, safe and effective
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> way of protecting children against harmful diseases, eight of which can be prevented by routine immunisation. They are: diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, rubella and Hib.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1900 when vaccines were unavailable, more children died from whooping cough and diphtheria alone than from all causes of death today. While immunisation levels are at 90 per cent for newborn babies, the rates fall away rapidly as children get older. A child has to have six sets of injections between two months and four years of age to be fully immunised against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, poliomyelitis, Hib, measles, mumps and rubella. Children aged between 10 and 19 years need to have booster shots for measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis and hepatitis B.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, there has been a considerable lack of concern from too many parents, and the result is that Australia has poor levels of immunisation. I think it is frightening that parents have not, when the children can be immunised, provided this necessary precaution from various diseases which cause death. I realise there are arguments made against immunisation. However, I believe the benefits of immunisation far outweigh those. Given that the chances of illness and death from not immunising are worse than any side effects of immunisation, the need to immunise and educate about the benefits of immunisation is paramount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1995-96 budget the Commonwealth allocated funding to trial the Australian childhood immunisation register in an attempt to improve immunisation coverage rates. In a foreword to a report on the implementation of this scheme, it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the United Kingdom, the recent measles&hyphen;rubella campaign has interrupted measles transmission in school children, and may have stopped the circulation of the virus throughout the population. In March and April 1995, only four cases of measles were confirmed in England and Wales. Three had recently arrived from overseas; the fourth case involved an unvaccinated boy of 15 months. In Australia, during that same period, there were 229 notifications of measles.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As the foreword stated, despite our nation having a high standard of living and generally
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3990"> adequate nutrition, significant illness and death still occur from diseases such as pertussis and measles which can be prevented by immunisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to be a trend in society that so many people neglect their responsibilities at times and expect the government to take on the role which is normally the responsibility of the individual and, in this instance, the parent. I acknowledge there are a number of parents who do not immunise for medical reasons. For example, I know of one parent who did not immunise her son because his sister was epileptic and there was a chance the vaccine could have caused some kind of brain damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, there are also those parents who simply neglect their responsibility to provide this important health requirement for their children. I find this attitude&mdash;where the parent simply does not care&mdash;totally irresponsible and almost akin to child abuse. It also places not just their child at risk but also those children who are in contact with that child. As stated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Doctor</EMPHASIS> of 4 April, 1997:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is not informed resistance which leads so many parents not to have their children immunised, but apathy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is little wonder, therefore, that Australia, with its poor immunisation levels, has a higher incidence of vaccine preventable diseases compared with countries which have addressed the problem, including some Third World countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 25 February this year reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The death of three infants from whooping cough in the past few months highlights the growing crisis over Australia's falling childhood immunisation rate. Last year, there were 1142 cases of whooping cough in Victoria, up from 353 the previous year.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  of 20 February reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are an estimated 44,000 children in child care in New South Wales who have not been fully immunised against pertussis (whooping cough), 19,000 not immunised against measles, and 17,000 babies in child care remain unprotected because they are too young.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Indeed, between 1978 and 1993, 227 babies and children died from diseases such as
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> whooping cough, measles, polio and tetanus that could have been prevented if their parents had immunised them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Babies who are too young for immunisation are at greater risk because of those children who are not immunised. As the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) pointed out in his speech to the House on 25 February this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the four children who died of whooping cough in New South Wales in 1996 all picked it up from older kids who were not immunised.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These reported statistics are frightening in that a country as advanced as Australia can let its children down by failing to provide basic health care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Research shows that, while around 98 per cent of Australians support immunisation, currently only 53 per cent of children aged zero to six are vaccinated. The only logical reason one can put for such low rates of immunisation is apathy. I do not believe that so many parents are not immunising because they choose not to, but because they do not care to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other than acknowledging the importance of immunisation and recognising the dangerously low levels of immunisation in Australia, this motion welcomes the initiatives announced by the Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, as a positive step to reversing the low levels of immunisation and preventing the unnecessary ill health and deaths of children which can be prevented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 25 February the minister announced a seven-point plan aimed at increasing the rate of immunisation in Australia to at least 90 per cent. I note and welcome the support the plan received from the Australian Labor Party, as well as professional bodies such as the Australian Medical Association. This issue is too important to become a political football, and it is important that the opposition has provided its support to the plan announced by Dr Wooldridge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When there was first talk of the government considering financial incentives to increase immunisation, I did have some calls of protest to my office saying that people should not be
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3991"> paid to have their children immunised. I could not disagree with that; however, I also do not believe in legislating against apathy and complacency. I note that in the United States it is compulsory for all children to be immunised when they start school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the plan announced by the minister is that the maternity allowance will be restructured so that it is paid in two instalments: the first at birth; and the second 18 months after birth, with evidence of immunisation. Further, there will be changes to the child-care assistance rebate and the child-care cash rebate, with the necessity of providing proof of age&hyphen;appropriate immunisation in order for the benefits to be paid. I think this is a more suitable option than an outright payment for immunisation. I am sure that parents are not as apathetic about claiming the maternity allowance as they are about immunising, so this initiative will make them as determined to immunise as they are to claim the benefits that accrue from childbirth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">GPs are another important element in the plan. Following the birth of a child, parents tend to see their local doctor quite often. Also, I note that around 60 per cent of all immunisations are undertaken by GPs. So it is important that they be consulted and be part of the plan to increase the levels of immunisation. Using Medicare data and the Australian childhood immunisation register, GPs will be given feedback about the success of immunisation of the children visiting their particular practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to monitor the targets. We all set ourselves goals and, by monitoring immunisation targets, we can ensure that we reach our goals to make sure we provide and maintain good health for our children. A 90 per cent target is an ambitious but achievable and very necessary target and one that we should attain. With the support of doctors and parents alike, with an education campaign, this should not be a problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can think of no objective more important than protecting our children. The initiative announced by the Minister for Health and Family Services is aimed at protecting children from potentially fatal diseases. It is an initiative that no Australian could not support.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I congratulate the minister on his dedication to this cause and on a positive and determined plan to immunise as many children as possible, so that we can prevent the types of epidemics of yesteryear and ensure that we never again have such dangerously low rates of immunisation in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I second the motion of the member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron). I think the current Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) is to be congratulated for his initiatives. However, these initiatives must be seen in the context of a highly desirable growing emphasis on immunisation. Between 1992 and 1996 the former Labor government spent some $80 million on immunisation programs which, of course, lead up to the introduction in January 1996 of the immunisation register. I understand that by April of that year some 450,000 children had been registered. I have not seen more up to date figures than those, but I would hope that they are even more substantial than the ones I have mentioned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The significance of the immunisation register is not only that it assists medical practitioners and providers, together with parents&mdash;who are entitled to request the information from the Health Insurance Commission which administers the register&mdash;to identify which children have been immunised, but it also enables those who are involved in treating an outbreak of a preventable disease to identify children who are at risk as a result of not having been immunised. So this is a particularly desirable trend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker, the member for Stirling, indicated that the fact that it is still the case that some 47 per cent of children between the nought and six age group remain unimmunised is perhaps an indication of apathy, and that may well be the case. I suppose in this day and age it is more frequently the situation that both parents are working, and a number of events can occur that make it difficult to keep track precisely as to which child has had which injection.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3992">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With my three children I think my wife has it under control. But then again, if I were to ask, `On what dates were they immunised and with what needles?' I am sure she would not be able to tell me. Obviously, in the case of our children, this immunisation register would have been of assistance because it would have provided the mechanism whereby their injections would have been recorded. With this register, it will be very easy to check up just what they have had and when they have had it. So as times goes on, I think that is going to be a particularly useful measure and one which deserves full support, and is obtaining full support, on a bipartisan basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current minister's program is designed at that end of the spectrum, substantially. It encourages and induces parents to pay greater attention to immunisation&mdash;and, hence, the incentive which has been offered. We are a bit more concerned about the issue of whether some coercion needs to be applied; namely, whether there should be some prevention of children entering schools and preschools without appropriate immunisation records. We are not sure whether that element of coercion is necessary. It may, in fact, detract from the willingness of parents to allow records to go through to the child immunisation register. It is not an easy issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the focus, however, is appropriately one of increasing awareness of the situation. There is no doubt, as the member for Stirling indicated, that where immunisation programs have been applied, they have been very successful indeed. In 1958 the World Health Organisation introduced its smallpox eradication program; by 1977 it had been virtually eradicated from the world's population. Polio has been virtually eradicated from most of the more affluent countries, and the World Health Organisation is looking at developing a polio immunisation program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Stirling also gave an excellent example of recent experience in the United Kingdom where there was a wholesale campaign to address rubella and measles, and that had phenomenal success. The reality is that it is a tragedy when any child dies; it is so much more of a tragedy when that child's death could have been prevented&mdash;and that
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> most certainly is the case with respect to immunisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As the former speaker indicated, only some two per cent of the population is against immunisation because of some conscientious objection to it or because of some belief that it presents harm to children. All the available research indicates that the harm is so minimal that it pales into insignificance when compared with the risk of contracting diseases. There is no doubt that, with simple practical measures, lives could be saved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that part of the minister's program is to introduce greater immunisation in the schools. As a result of a World Health Organisation recommendation last year, which has been endorsed by the National Health and Medical Research Council, hepatitis B vaccinations will also be introduced from the start of next year. The plan is, as I understand it, to implement that policy through schools. I can understand why it is being done through schools. The evidence is that adolescents are less likely to go to established general practitioners or clinics. Nonetheless, I think there is a way of doing this so that parents are not scared off from immunisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall when I was in primary school&mdash;in the bad old days before the national health scheme&mdash;when immunisations were done at these public inoculations. We lined up outside an assembly hall and, greatly relieved at having time off from the classroom, we frolicked and mucked about outside. We then entered the assembly hall and a very angry looking matron rolled up our respective sleeves. We went down the wall of the assembly room until we got to the door of the clinic, which was shut. I knew I was in big trouble when the toughest kid in the school&mdash;I will not mention his name&mdash;came out wailing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All in all, it was quite a traumatic experience and one which probably accounts for the phobia that I have about needles. I note that my colleague the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) is in the House; he and I have discussed a similar phobia. I am pleased to say that my children have not had to experience that trauma. There is really no need for parents in this day and age to be fearful of the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3993"> consequences for their children or the trauma that they will face. There is obviously a need for parents to be very concerned about the consequences of not having their children immunised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the member for Stirling for moving this motion. The fact that it is being debated in the national parliament will go some way to raising the awareness of parents to the vital need for immunisation. From the legislature's point of view, I think child immunisation could legitimately become a sacred cow. It is something which should be nurtured by all governments. Quite clearly, on a simple cost benefit analysis, it is much cheaper to prevent than it is to cure. For all reasons, including the essential one of protecting the lives of our children, I strongly endorse the motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to support this motion put forward by my colleague the member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron) on the very crucial issue of immunisation. As a mother of eight and a grandmother of four, it is a subject that is very near to my heart. I am proud to be part of a government that is working towards raising Australia's appalling immunisation levels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that, at the time our plan to tackle immunisation was announced, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) commended us on this initiative. We certainly welcome that bipartisan support. It is, however, surprising to me that for the 13 years that Labor was in government they were aware of our declining immunisation rates and did absolutely nothing to rectify the situation. To my mind this is sheer neglect, for nothing can be more important to our society and our nation than the welfare of our children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems incredible to me that any government could let  immunisation rates in this country fall to such a shocking level&mdash;just 53 per cent of our children fully immunised, fewer than in many Third World countries. That is made all the more incredible when you consider that just two per cent of parents have a conscientious objection or serious contra&hyphen;indications to immunising their children. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's plan will provide incentives for the 45 per cent of parents who, for various reasons, are failing to complete their children's immunisation. Our plan is very practical. It is a broad based approach which involves greater participation for general practitioners, increased community education programs, incentives and awards for state governments which raise immunisation levels and the incorporation of the maternity allowance and child&hyphen;care assistance to focus parental attention on the need to immunise. What is more, parents will get an extra $68 as part of the new two-stage maternity allowance when their child is fully immunised up to 18 months of age. So parents are financially better off under our plan and, most importantly, our children are protected from harmful diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let there be no mistake about it: this is a serious matter. These totally preventable diseases can kill. That is the whole point of this plan: it is not just about attaining a percentage figure for the sake of it; it is about saving children's lives and protecting them from unnecessary suffering. As a mother, I know too well the anxieties that many parents feel when they take their child to be immunised for the first time. We have all heard stories of severe adverse reactions. It appears that they always attract an inordinate amount of media coverage. The fact is that immunisation is important, it is safe, and there is only a very minute risk involved which is far outweighed by the benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a mother, I have also seen how tragic it is when a child is struck with one of these diseases. My second youngest daughter contracted whooping cough at just a few weeks of age&mdash;before she was able to be immunised. It is a heartbreaking thing to watch a tiny baby struggling for breath, and her fight to regain her health took many months. I am pleased to say that she made a full recovery, but the memory of just how sick she was and how much suffering she went through is very vivid for all of my family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whooping cough outbreaks have been occurring quite regularly in Australia in the past few years&mdash;with tragic results in a
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3994"> number of cases. I note that just last week the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) issued a warning that a measles outbreak may be on the way, following a serious outbreak in New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian medical experts predict that if a large measles epidemic took place in Australia we could expect to see about 250 cases of middle ear infection, 400 cases of pneumonia, up to 10 cases of inflammation of the brain and at least one death for every 10,000 children affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be no greater argument as to why it is vital that we increase the immunisation levels of our children. I join with other members of this House in congratulating the Minister for Health and Family Services on the range of initiatives to address immunisation. As I said before, I am proud to be part of a government that is taking decisive, practical action to tackle this important health problem.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a father of a good sized family and the grandfather of six, I rise in this important debate proposed by the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron) to support the proposal contained in the motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like many others, I can well remember the devastating effect on our fellow schoolmates and family members who were struck down by diseases that to young parents of today are only names on paper. I can recall as a young child suffering from whooping cough. I can remember seeing people with withered limbs who were victims of polio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The success of the Australian immunisation program can be judged when you consider that no cases of polio have been reported in Australia since 1986. The previous Labor government was very well aware of the need for immunisation. In fact, during the past three years of the previous federal government, child immunisation was made a major public health priority, and some $80 million had been allocated for immunisation initiatives since 1983.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can recall hearing about a St George footballer coming from Fiji who cut his foot on an oyster shell and died of tetanus. I can
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> recall a niece who was born with multiple disabilities due to her mother suffering from rubella during her pregnancy. The niece died before her first birthday. I can recall one of my own sons suffering from encephalitis but, thank God, there were no permanent side&hyphen;effects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The magnificent effect that immunisation has had on the health of the children of our nation is hard to quantify but, in financial terms, it must reach into the billions. In mental terms, both for children and families who have been spared the rigours of a debilitating illness because of immunisation, it is impossible to quantify the distress that would have been suffered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And yet many people in Australia are again slipping back and are not having their children immunised against these diseases. I shudder to think of the effects on our children if polio ever again swept through our nation. Do people really understand the real horrors of diphtheria, whooping cough and other diseases that can now be immunised against? But these diseases and many others are going to take charge of the lives of children if we do not succeed in educating the young parents of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should become as automatic to immunise our nation's children as it is to renew our driver's licence. Some might say that licences should not be renewed unless drivers with children can produce proof of their children's immunisation. Of course, the scheme must be flexible enough to cope with the few children who unfortunately may be allergic to some vaccines. In these cases, parents should consult with their family doctor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This should not, however, deter us from the main opportunity or responsibility of educating those who can only be described as ill&hyphen;informed people who have not had their children immunised. It is not only a responsibility to these small children who might otherwise suffer the most excruciating pain and illness; it is a responsibility to the whole health of the nation and of the finances of the nation to ensure that children are immunised as a protection to themselves and to fellow Australians.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3995">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The education program that is needed is indeed a sad reflection on the state of affairs we face today. But, whether or not it is any type of reflection, it is vital that a massive education program is undertaken as a matter of urgency. In fact, one of the most effective methods of succeeding in an education program is for children to come home from school and ask why they have not been immunised and when they are going to be immunised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is sad to think that we may need to educate parents of today in a very confronting manner to ensure that they accept the responsibility of parenthood and protect the health of their children and those with whom they come in contact. It is a fight worth fighting and we should all be in it together. This is one occasion when we should be proud to say to today's parents: `In my day, when we were young we were all immunised. Why aren't your children?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am therefore pleased to support the motion before the House which acknowledges the importance of immunisation of children against harmful infections, recognises the unnecessary and dangerously low rate of immunisation of children in Australia and welcomes the initiatives announced by the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) as a positive step to reverse the low levels of immunisation.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There could no more reasonable or responsible proposition than the one I am asking the House to support today. The Quarantine Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 seeks to amend the Quarantine Act 1908 no further than is
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> necessary to place firmly in the hands of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) the power to approve or deny applications to import agricultural food products into this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The drafting of this bill was motivated mainly by my concern over the government's support for the applications by Thailand, Denmark and the United States to import cooked chicken into this country, but its scope is far wider than that. This is a bill designed to protect all our agricultural industries, for example, our apple and pear industries and our salmon industry. This is a bill that seeks to keep out of our island continent all those diseases, like Newcastle disease, which are present in many overseas nations. On that basis alone, this is a bill deserving of the support of every member of this house, whether they are representing the Liberal Party, as is the case with the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin), whether they are representing the National Party, the Australian Labor Party or, indeed, sitting in this place as an Independent member. All this bill seeks to do is place the power to make these decisions in the hands of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the person who is accountable to this parliament and, consequently, accountable to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I await with great expectation the contribution of the member for Paterson. He did indicate in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Maitland Mercury</EMPHASIS> on Friday that he will not be supporting this bill. He will not be standing up for the chicken industry, in particular. I hope that he has a very good explanation for the 3,000 people in the Hunter region who are directly employed by the chicken processing and growing industries; for the many more people in the Hunter who are indirectly employed; for the more than 45,000 people Australia&hyphen;wide who are employed either directly or indirectly by this industry; and, in addition to those, for the tens of thousands who are employed directly or indirectly by other industries such as the apple and pear industries and the salmon industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say this: his colleagues in the Senate support my bill. The all&hyphen;party Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3996"> Affairs and Transport unanimously supported the proposition that the final decision on these matters should rest squarely with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Although I might say this about the member for Paterson: maybe his constituents will excuse him. Maybe they will decide, having watched Minister Anderson's performance throughout the chicken issue over the last year or so, that the decision is best left with the bureaucrats. Maybe they will decide that they would rather run the gauntlet with the obscure bureaucrats than have the inept Minister Anderson handle the issue. So he may be excused&mdash;he may be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Minister Anderson will never be excused. His performance certainly has been wanting, or probably I should say has been appalling. The saga began when he was shadow minister for primary industries and energy. In those days he was really gung ho. He was appalled by the prospect that we might allow the importation of cooked chicken meat from countries such as Thailand, Denmark and the United States, and he told the industry so. He told them so in writing. In a letter to an industry representative dated 14 February 1996, as shadow minister he said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you know, the federal coalition has for some time expressed concerns about the adequacy of Australia's quarantine arrangements and, in particular, the import risk assessment process used by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our concerns have been confirmed by leading members of the scientific community.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Indeed they have and they continue to be confirmed by `leading members of the scientific community'. Not a day goes by when another expert does not come out and restate the risk involved in importing chickens into this country. We have now seen that Newcastle disease survives in Antarctic conditions, yet AQIS want us to accept their proposition that somehow half cooking chicken meat can eradicate Newcastle disease. Indeed, the member for Paterson himself took on his minister by proving, via a letter from the UK expert, Dr Alexander, that his scientific evidence had been misused. This is the same scientist the minister is now using to undertake what the minister describes as his
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> `confirmatory' round of testing. In other words, the minister has not changed his view; he has only sent the issue off for another `confirmatory' round of testing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened? He became the minister and we saw some sort of metamorphosis take place, but it was not a man into the Incredible Hulk; it was the Incredible Hulk back to the man. We saw the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS> factor come in and suddenly we had a new person in John Anderson. Suddenly we had Australia's greatest supporter of the importation of cooked chicken meat in our Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. AQIS were fairly frustrated under the former minister, Bob Collins. They failed to gain his imprimatur for the import of these products, so they rushed very hurriedly to the new minister and within two months they were in his office saying: `Minister, you must sign this, our international reputation as a free&hyphen;trader is at stake.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did Minister Anderson do? He immediately gave it the tick&mdash;and, of course, the industry went ballistic. Why wouldn't they? His National Party colleagues went ballistic. Why wouldn't they? Ron Boswell went ballistic and, of course, that surprised no&hyphen;one. What was John Anderson's response? He tried to blame the former minister, Bob Collins. When that started to run a bit thin he ran around the country telling everyone that he did not have the power to deny the importation of cooked chicken meat even if he wanted to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here is a chance for the member for Paterson, for the member for Page (Mr Causley) and for all those members who represent rural and regional constituencies to stand up for the 900 small business operators that are involved in this industry; to stand up for the 3,000 people directly employed in the industry in the Hunter region; to stand up for the 45,000 people employed either directly or indirectly&mdash;</PARA>

It is an issue which, if got wrong, poses to absolutely destroy the chicken industry&mdash;and, indeed, our native bird life&mdash;in this country. Lord help us to think what it might do to our apple and pear industries if the minister or AQIS gets that wrong. The minister seems to have some blind faith in AQIS. It is not a faith shared by me, it is not a faith shared by those on this side and it is not a faith shared by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that these decisions should be made on a scientific basis. But, in the same way that we have economists advising the government on Treasury matters, we have scientists advising the government on quarantine matters.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we should stick to quarantine, but we should have the minister who is accountable to this parliament and accountable to the Australian people making that decision. It is incumbent upon people like the member for Paterson and the member for Page and all of those representing rural and regional Australia to support this bill.

In this whole debate, in the rock solid public stance I have taken on this issue, I have been arguing and have been attempting to secure the science&mdash;of what the science says&mdash;of hearing nature call and paying due respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr John Anderson, is very clear on that. To his credit, despite criticism from various quarters, he has made some very crystal clear judgments of his own&mdash;a judgment to support the Senate inquiry into the importation of cooked chicken meat and then a commitment to meet the findings head on and then further a commitment to seek independent testing on infected chicken meat and to continue to assess, with the industry, measures of protocol and industry assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But when you read the findings of that very inquiry&mdash;despite the very good intentions of Senator Bob Collins, the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, who worked together with Senator Winston Crane in that matter, to make it all happen&mdash;you see that page 3 of the inquiry report really said it all when it comes to the Labor Party. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This process culminated in a "in principle" decision by AQIS, in mid-1995, to admit cooked chicken meat that had been processed in accordance with specified time and temperature parameters, the details of which were subject to final confirmation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That decision clearly occurred under the former government. Where was the activity, the consultation and the concern for the chicken industry from people like the member for Dobell? If we were to believe the former member for Paterson&mdash;who, in the lead&hyphen;up to the last election, had the temerity to take out ads in journals like the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Land</EMPHASIS>  newspaper to say that the issue was dead&mdash;where would the Hunter chicken industry and the $2 billion national industry be today?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No-one had thought of the science. It was for that reason that I directly contacted by phone and fax world leading British avian virologist Dr Dennis Alexander. He is the virologist whose time temperature parameters for eradicating viral diseases from cooked chicken were for interpretation only by AQIS in their final analysis to reach their decision in 1995. Not once did anyone from AQIS directly contact Dr Alexander up to and during their 1995 findings and&mdash;even as this debate raged during the middle of last year to see if they actually got their findings right when the chicken industry was screaming&mdash;quite correctly, they had not dotted all of the i's and crossed all of the t's.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Evidence I presented to the Senate inquiry in sessions in Maitland on 13 September last year, from Dr Alexander, in answering my queries raised genuine questions about the exhaustiveness of testing and of matters of risk management analysis which had not been taken through to the nth degree. The response from my government was a response to the science, not the politics, and more formal testing and, amongst other things, the inspection of commercial cooking premises in Thailand led by AQIS officials&mdash;including, amongst others, Dr Margaret Mackenzie from Inghams Chickens. She gave keynote evidence to the inquiry, and I have spoken to her at great length on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My search for the science now extends further&mdash;something that this bill will fail, for all its merits, to achieve. Just last week I had great pleasure in speaking with Professor Barry Boettcher, now a semi&hyphen;retired academic from the Newcastle University, on where we turn from here. He has drawn an example to me of the infectious bursal disease outbreak amongst the emperor penguins near Australia's Mawson base in the Antarctic, which, in a pure quarantine environment, makes for disturbing reading. Their infection with the virus came, as one can only presume, from chicken eaten at the base, presumably uninfected. Of even more concern is the fact that the human inhabitants were scientists, and strict regulations on food consumption and disposal are adhered to in practice.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3999">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Boettcher is challenging that chicken meat, heat inactivation or no heat inactivation, imported from countries with Newcastle disease will most likely enter Australia. Why? Because nature has a funny way of changing its course. But, also on a pure scientific basis, because heat treatment of tissues infected with viruses, such as Newcastle disease, does not destroy or even damage the viral nucleic acid. It is viral nucleic acid which remains potentially capable of initiating the production of complete infective viruses and disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Boettcher asserts that the proposed heat treatment of chicken meat will not damage the nucleic acid of the Newcastle disease virus. In other words, given the appropriate conditions, viral genomes, as they are called, may come to infect commercial or native bird life. Whilst I am not an avian virologist, it does not take a rocket scientist either to assess that playing with infectious disease is not a game, especially a political one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The poultry industry in 1996 in the lower Hunter had a wholesale value of production of $147 million, producing some 33 million chickens on 110 farms with 333 sheds under the Steggles and Inghams chicken processing groups. It is an industry which directly and indirectly employs around 3,000 people in the Hunter&mdash;employing more people than BHP's Newcastle steelworks, even before its work force restructures at the end of 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an industry that has experienced a quantum leap growth in capitalisation in meeting skyrocketing domestic consumption of nine per cent per annum. Today Australians consume a staggering 350 million chickens and the industry's development of a clean, green and Newcastle disease free status stands it in tremendous stead to reap further growth on both the domestic and, importantly, overseas front for the lasting benefit of the Hunter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the record, I do not support the importation of cooked chicken meat from Thailand, Denmark and the United States where the threat of Newcastle disease entering our shores and ravaging our industry and native wildlife is real. That view is based on science,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not on the political rhetoric that comes from the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes to leadership on this issue, let us get one thing straight and for certain: it has been this government and not the former one that has at least had the courtesy and, better still, the commitment to listen, liaise and sit down and break bread with the chicken industry and try to act in their best long-term interests given the scenario they have been left with by the former government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bread is still being broken, the disease is still being tested and actions not words have emanated from this side of the political fence, not the other. This bill, as worthy as it is, is an act in smoke and mirrors and does not address the main game in town, and that is to get the science right once and for all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard a lot of rhetoric delivered on this. Let me foreshadow that, if this motion ever comes to a vote, it should be amended. I will move such amendments to ban the importation of chicken meat, whether it be cooked or uncooked, from countries that have Newcastle disease present on their shores.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw the statement. I stand by what I said previously. The point I wish to make is that, as a result of the government putting this industry at risk, an industry worth $500 million in wages in the economy and an industry that purchases a lot of grain through electorates right around Australia, that $500 million in wages circulating out there in the community is at risk and the loss in purchases of grain is going to severely damage Australia's grain industry. For what? Because this government is trying to allow AQIS to do its dirty work for us. This government is refusing to take the constructive advice offered by the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) in trying to make sure that a politician makes the final decision as to whether there should be imports of cooked chicken meat into Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want to make sure that a politician is held accountable for this decision. The reason we want to make sure that a politician makes the final decision is that a lot is at risk if Newcastle disease is introduced into Australia. If Newcastle disease is introduced, not only will Australia's chicken growing industry be severely damaged but all of the research shows that large numbers, almost all, of our native bird life are going to be at risk. They carry no antibodies for Newcastle disease. There is a 100 per cent fatality rate within six days for eastern rosellas. Massive environmental damage is going to be caused if Newcastle disease is introduced into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great difficulty that the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) has is that his government in the next few weeks, as we all know, is going to allow the importation of cooked chicken meat. It did not happen under Labor. In spite of years of lobbying by Thailand, the United States and Denmark, it never happened under Labor. I had the honour before the 1993 election of leading one delegation to the minister responsible lobbying against the importation of cooked chicken meat. That is why I stand by the statement I made during the honourable member for Paterson's address.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason why we have been strongly opposed to the importation of cooked chicken meat is that you cannot guarantee that the cooking process in Thailand, the United States or Denmark will kill off the virus. That is the one correct point which the member for Paterson made. The reason why you cannot guarantee that the virus will be killed in the cooking process is that you do not know what the deep meat core temperature is. It depends on how the chickens are placed on the belt. It depends on what temperature is applied to the chickens during the cooking process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All it takes is one small mistake by AQIS or one mistake by a company in Thailand and it results in our native wildlife being placed at risk, it results in the jobs in the chicken industry being placed at risk and it also could result in Australians' health being placed at risk because there is no guarantee as to the levels of residues of such things as antibiotics in imported chicken meat. We have got very tough protocols for these things in Australia. You certainly cannot maintain the same high quality standards if you are allowing imports of chicken meat from some of these countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia benefits from our clean, green image for food exports. How much is that worth? We get a 20 per cent premium for the export of clean, green salmon. That is why this government decided not to allow the importation of Canadian salmon. Why is the poultry industry not as important as the salmon industry? Why not try to maintain that clean, green image by saying no to the importation of cooked chicken meat and by trying to make sure that a minister can be held accountable and pressured into not allowing these imports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are trying to get a minister to listen to these letters from over 5,000 residents of the central coast who have individually written to the minister and asked him not to allow the importation of chicken meat. I have been asked to present these 5,000 letters to the minister. I am waiting for an answer. I look forward to having the opportunity to speak to John Anderson personally and to making him aware of the views of the 5,000 local residents of the central coast who are totally opposed to this government's decision to

We have to take a few steps backwards to have a close look at this particular position at the present time. Those steps need to go back to the negotiations that went on for a world trade agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the members of the opposition are trying to step away from the decision that might or might not have been taken on cooked chicken meat importation, they cannot get away from the fact that they negotiated the conditions and the protocols in the world trade agreement. The reasons for those negotiations were fairly clear. Australia has been locked out of many markets around the world and we needed to negotiate some reasonable access terms if we were going to achieve some of the objectives that we needed for many of our great export industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I can accept some of the arguments put forward by  the members of the Labor Party about the risks involved&mdash;and I am sure we are all concerned about those&mdash;we cannot lose sight of the fact that Australia needs to have access to these markets, not just in chicken meat but in other products that we produce and that make a very valuable input to our balance of trade and the income that we derive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that under the world trade agreement an agreement has been signed to give products access to other countries, including Australia, and that the tariff and non-tariff barriers put in place by countries over the years will be reduced by some 30 per cent by the year 2000 and eliminated in industrial countries by 2010 and in developing countries by 2020. What we need to do here is not so much address the politics and the pedantics but make sure that&mdash;not just in this industry but also in other industries&mdash;the protocols put in place to protect our industries are in fact effective.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) when he says, `I believe that the information given to the minister from AQIS was defective.' I happened to be in his office the night he rang England and spoke to Professor Alexander. In his statement to us Professor Alexander said that he did not disagree that the conditions that were outlined by AQIS on heat treatment and the period that was needed to kill the infectious diseases&mdash;not just Newcastle disease but infectious bursal disease&mdash;might be possible. He did say that the research had not been done. He said that he could do that research and give some definitive answers to the minister and to us because we were concerned that the disease could be brought into this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing that we need to look at very closely in the opening up of trade around the world is that there are protocols put in place to ensure that diseases are not brought into this country. It is not just the heat treatment. You have to go to the factories as well. You have to make sure by some method that if in fact the treatment does destroy these diseases it is done effectively in the factories. We have to have a slightly broader view on this because anyone who has closely watched the development of Asia in recent years knows that there are huge markets opening up in those countries. The standard of living is increasing in those countries. There is an opportunity for Australia to get into some of those markets. Asians are big eaters of chicken. If we get our protocols right and the world trade agreement works, then opportunities will be opening up for Australian industry in those particular markets. That is the most important thing we should be looking at.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prime Minister Howard and his Treasurer, Mr Costello, have started a new debate on tax. We can safely call this debate the `political flatulence debate'. I enjoyed reading the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> 's economic commentator, Alan Mitchell, last week telling the story of former Prime Minister William McMahon's reminiscences of the Billy Hughes tactics. He suggested that Mr Hughes confided to Mr McMahon&mdash;one of the mentors of the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard)&mdash;that to get attention away from a problem, `Just let off a bit of political flatulence and then run like hell.' That was the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> advice to the former Prime Minister Mr McMahon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Curiously, Australians were being asked to concentrate last week on a new issue just as the budget was being ridiculed by the public, and ridiculed it was. For example, I refer to such radio commentators as Alan Jones. He and others were making fun of the budget savings measures, appropriately pointing out that it was savings only for the rich. Mr Prime Minister, how is the budget one of keeping faith with the battlers? Is that not why the political flatulence went off? It gave up a huge stink. In essence, it was about getting people to forget about the budget and wonder what the hell the new smell was about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a huge smell. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith), for example, let off his own stink bomb when he had the gall&mdash;and I suggest it was real gall&mdash;to go on Jon Faine's ABC program in Melbourne last Monday and accuse working people of not paying their fair share of tax. Yes, the battlers were accused by the Minister for Industrial Relations of not paying their share of taxes. Yes, that is what he did, though he did try to hide it by suggesting that it was not workers in general but only union members skipping out on tax. More importantly, he went out of his way to libel people in the trade union movement when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some people in the trade union movement, who live in the cash economy, the last thing they want to do is pay their fair share of taxes, and they would use their political muscle within the labour movement to make the Labor Party use it as a scare campaign so they can go on skipping on paying tax.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the same minister who was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS>  on 7 May 1996 as wanting to talk about battlers. I do not know how many battlers and trade union members, among them construction workers who built the new casino in Melbourne, Mr Reith was referring to, but it is interesting to note that in that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS>  of 7 May 1996 there was a report about a huge discount of $43,500 given by one Mr Ron Walker, the treasurer of the Liberal Party, to the Minister for Industrial Relations for the purchase of an apartment in that Hudson Conway development in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4003"> Melbourne. So we know who has got friends out there in the community and who is getting  benefits. It is certainly not the working people who built the casino, the owners of which gave the Minister for Industrial Relations a huge discount with respect to the project that they had going in St Kilda Road for some new apartments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will never condone tax avoidance, but for the Minister for Industrial Relations to imply that working people hurt our tax base more than the rich who worm out of paying their proper taxes shows someone who is completely out of touch with the reality of our tax system. This government can have no real commitment to tax reform when time after time it is prepared to delay and avoid making the reform of the taxation of trusts. The taxation of trusts! Remember that? If Minister Reith was being fair dinkum, he would have attacked the wealthy who fund the Liberal Party&mdash;the type of people who give him discounts in St Kilda Road and use their political muscle to make sure that they skip out on paying tax. We have all got long memories about who protected them previously prior to 1983 with respect to the bottom of the harbour activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last election, in reaction to the Labor government's plans to pursue the rich who were using trusts to minimise their tax, the coalition went around saying, `Me too.' That, after all, was the `me too' election. We had the then Leader of the Opposition, the current Prime Minister, trying to be non&hyphen;threatening and promising to be just like Labor&mdash;no different, `me too.' So the coalition was `me too' on taxing the rich. It promised to go after trusts, but what has happened since then? It is big on rhetoric, little on action; it reminds me a little bit about its performance on the unemployment issue. We have had promises of discussion papers and more discussion papers and now we find that the discussion paper has been delayed until later in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No real tax reform can happen in this country, I suggest, until this government is prepared to front up to the promises it made in the lead&hyphen;up to this term of parliament and to face up to the issue of tax minimisation by the rich using trusts. They are the same
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people who are going to rort the savings initiative put in place by the current budget. It will not be $450 for those households. It will be $450 a couple of times over because of their capacity to rort trusts and to minimise tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But why have there been delays in moving against trusts? Let me suggest one reason. The power of the trust tax avoiders reaches right into the Howard cabinet room. The majority of those in the cabinet have good parts of their personal wealth tied up in trusts. And they dare to suggest that working people are tax minimisers! Only nine out of 28 Howard government ministers do not have any trust funds listed in the register of members' interests, a public document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the reputed wealthiest members of the Howard government have some of their money tied up in trust funds: the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan), the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) and, interestingly enough, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser). He is not just an expert; he is the prime expert on how to use trusts to minimise tax to his own personal advantage. How can the Howard ministry make an intelligent assessment about the tax debate and about real tax reform with so many of their ministers caught up in tax trusts? The Australian Taxation Office's high wealth individuals task force has informed this government that one of the biggest tax rorts is due to the use of complex trusts. That task force has argued that, if we can improve the compliance of high wealth individuals who use aggressive tax planning and minimisation arrangements with their trusts, we could recoup tax revenue estimated at $800 million a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes to discussing the role of trusts in the tax reform debate, will there be 19 ministers involved in trusts standing outside the cabinet room and refusing to participate in the debate? I think that is a fairly relevant question to the issue of the tax debate at the moment. Will they sit outside the cabinet room while trusts&mdash;an essential component of the tax debate&mdash;are being debated by the remaining nine ministers? I
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4004"> will bet they are not silent: there is too much to lose. That will be a great press photo: 19  ministers waiting outside the cabinet room while they wait and wait to find out how their remaining colleagues have treated the issue of tax and the issue of their trusts and their wealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where could the tax system collect more money more efficiently from? Not from the ordinary working people and their families who are taxed so ruthlessly, as suggested by the Minister for Industrial Relations on the John Faine show in Melbourne last Monday. The working people in unions are not the wealthy people who use unit trusts. They are not the wealthy people who minimise their tax and rip off the Australian public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I suggest that no amount of stink bombs will cover the fact that this government has its hand in the till. It has its hands tied when it comes to moving against the big tax avoiders who use trusts. It is these ministers&mdash;not the people suggested by the Minister for Industrial Relations on the Faine program on 3LO&mdash;who skip out of paying tax. If you want a tax debate, then the responsibility of this government is to deliver on the promise of taxation reform which was given prior to the last election&mdash;not to continue to produce discussion papers while it sits on its hands. The tax system needs some reform: the reform spoken about before the last federal election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More than one&hyphen;third of this parliament is over. When will this government produce the goods on taxation reform? When will they start ensuring that the wealthy in this country who  use trusts to minimise their tax start to pay their fair share, instead of attacking working people and their families? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4004"><TITLE>Taxation</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We sure did. You knew a few of the blokes who used to sink everything to the bottom of the harbour because they used to come to your ACTU meetings. But the reality is that John Dawkins, as your minister, carried on just as the shadow minister just did. It is all in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> . You should go and read some time about just how their family trusts worked, how it minimised their tax and how they capitalised interest in a deal. I have since talked to the bloke who purchased the land. It was all very tax effective. So do not think there are people in the community who behave any differently to some of your own.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality of family trusts is that they are not, in general terms, tax avoidance measures. They are made by some extremely wealthy people. You were going to get the $800 million; the tax office was going to get the $800 million&mdash;but nobody has got anything yet because it is not there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you something about a family that might have more than one trust. They transfer a few losses around the place. The fact is that they are making losses&mdash;there are plenty of people making losses at the moment&mdash;because business is not travelling too well, and when they do they do not pay tax. If that is a crime, get up and say so. The reality is that, if one of your businesses does not do well, it is reasonable that you can bring those arrangements together and make it a single figure, whatever it turns out to be. That is not tax evasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister was at some pains to talk about tax minimisation. It is apparently your view that, if a family has one business doing well and one that makes a loss, they do not sack all their staff and they carry on and carry those people, they should pay tax on one and carry the loss on the other. Of course they do not&mdash;and neither should they. But
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4005"> keep it up: all those views that have just been expressed are a nice message that I am going to circulate amongst the small business people in my electorate. They want to know what  you really think. There is still this attitude of hatred.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fringe benefits tax is a joke. That is the tax where Keating got up and said, `It is a very bad tax.' It is a silly tax because there are better ways of doing it. Do you know who invented it? The ACTU. Your candidate in Kalgoorlie, at the last election&mdash;an ex&hyphen;leader of the opposition in Western Australia, Mr Taylor&mdash;got up and said, `If I am elected to the federal parliament, I will move to get rid of the fringe benefits tax.' Your bloke. Your candidate, who tried to beat Graeme Campbell. Do you know why? The union movement has suffered dreadfully from the FBT in all remote areas because it has created a thing called `fly&hyphen;in, fly&hyphen;out'. Your union organisers hate you for your fringe benefits tax. It has
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> driven members away from them in their hundreds because it is all fly&hyphen;in, fly&hyphen;out and you cannot keep up with them. That is an interesting little bit of education for you. It is your invention; furthermore, it is a highly inefficient tax. But it is like so many other taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are worried about employment in the car manufacturing sector&mdash;and so you should be because we have a tax system that puts thousands of dollars on the manufactured cost of a motor car. And that is considered smart! We put lead in the saddlebags of our own manufacturers who are trying to employ people, and you think that is a good idea. It is no good waiting until the next election to try to work out a tax policy. For you or for us? The time to do it is now, in the national interest, instead of making silly speeches like the shadow minister has just made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why not look at the tax system and say, `What is in the national interest?' If you want to say what is in the national interest then say it. Do not just stand up in here and tell lies and carry on. You go on with a fear campaign because you think it might get you re-elected and it does not matter. There are so many aspects to the Australian tax system, whether it is income tax or any other tax. Because we have a high dependence on income tax you wonder why we have people paying accountants millions of dollars to find their way around the income tax law. Businesses ought to be paying accountants to tell them how to run their business and be more profitable so they can employ more people. All of these things can be attended to.</PARA>

The reality is that you could sit down and look at all the problems and collectively try to come up with a good idea.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to talk today about one change the government has made and one that it is proposing to make which affect some of Australia's lowest income earners and affect them very directly. I am talking about Australia's authors and Australia's visual artists, both of whom are unquestionably amongst the lowest income earners in Australia and both of whom have been adversely affected by conscious initiatives taken by the government, in part reversed, but still, in the main, operating to the detriment of these groups or continuing to be speculated about and which are causing concern amongst visual artists. With regard to authors I refer to the public lending rights scheme and the education lending rights schemes and in the case of visual artists I refer to the continuing speculation about the proposal to sell Artbank. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will talk first about the public lending rights scheme and its sister program, the education lending rights scheme, which was initiated by the previous government but never implemented by this one. By way of background, the public lending rights scheme is an internationally recognised concept of compensation paid to authors to compensate them for income lost by the free multiple use of their books in public lending libraries. It has been in operation in Australia since it was initiated by the Whitlam government in 1974. It has had legislative form since it was introduced by the Hawke government in 1985. In the intervening period there was significant uncertainty and concern about the viability and certainty of continuation of the scheme because it did not have a legislative basis. It operated merely on the basis of appropriations to the relevant departments responsible for the arts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme operated modestly. It did not make anybody very rich, but it did make
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4007"> important contributions to the income of a number of our authors, our retired authors and their descendants. It operated uncontroversially with bipartisan support until last budget when there were some publicised and unpublicised changes which have undermined  the bipartisan support for this scheme. Simultaneously the government announced its intention not to proceed with the education lending rights scheme introduced by the previous government in Creative Nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first thing the government did&mdash;and this was announced&mdash;was to reduce payments for authors under the public lending rights scheme in a number of categories: to eliminate all payments under $50, to remove the capacity for payments to be made to the descendants of deceased authors and to take away the capacity for authors to get payments beyond 25 years after the publication of their book. Those changes were, individually and collectively, grossly unfair. And they led to the most remarkable upsurge of protest from authors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Authors are very solitary people. I do not think there is a collective noun for authors, because they never act collectively. They are by their nature individualists. But they did rally together, including in quite substantial numbers here in Canberra before the budget. They were incensed by these changes, not just because of their monetary implication&mdash;which was serious&mdash;but because of the direct reflection on the recognition of them by the government, with the government giving a clear indication that they did not respect the contribution of these people to Australian life, to Australian cultural life, to Australian social life, to the values of a decent Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately, the worst of these changes&mdash;taking away the eligibility of authors to get payments beyond 25 years&mdash;was reversed in conjunction with this budget. That reversal will mean that some of our most distinguished senior writers, many of whom have retired, will continue to receive the modest payments they receive under the public lending rights scheme. It will keep some of them off the pension. It will probably not have a net adverse effect on the budget.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what was not announced was that the government continues its policy not to increase the pool of money available under the public lending rights scheme, so the increase to those senior writers is funded by every other author in Australia. The total pool of money stayed the same. As the government generously said, `We will allow these payments to be made,' as they should, `to very many of our most distinguished writers.' I was very moved by the speech made by Judith Wright at the rally which I had the pleasure to attend here in Canberra. With the total pool of money staying the same and the number of books and writers eligible expanding, the payment to each author will fall. One of the poorest groups in our country&mdash;the writers, the authors&mdash;have to fund the modest increase to those senior and distinguished writers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How much money are we talking about? In 1995&hyphen;96, in the last annual report to which I could get quick access, we are talking about many payments totalling $4.8 million for the whole scheme. We are not here talking about something that has any significant impact on the budget bottom line. If you halve it or double it, it would not be noticed in the debate about the budget bottom line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most serious concern I have, notwithstanding the unfairness of the changes of 1996, is the continuing failure of the government to have a growth factor in this scheme. Since the scheme has operated there has been an agreement between the Department of Finance and the arts departments to continue a growth factor, until it was removed by the Department of Finance in 1996&hyphen;97. The scheme is condemned to shrink and its parallel scheme&mdash;the education lending rights scheme, which could be administered under the Public Lending Rights Act, and which was guaranteed $1 million a year under Creative Nation by the previous government&mdash;was eliminated last year on the bizarre basis that there was not enough funding in the budget to conduct the scheme properly. So, after saying, `There is not enough money,' they had a simple solution: they eliminated it all. Of course, writers would have liked more,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4008"> but I do not think their preferred solution was to eliminate the scheme altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many more things I would like to say about public lending rights, but in the time available I simply want to bring that together and say that there is a disturbing, emerging pattern that the changes that are  being made by this government continue to disadvantage those weakest in our community, those with least bargaining power in our community, those with least market power in our community, amongst whom are our authors and our visual artists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want briefly to comment on the resurgence of the rumours that the government is proposing to proceed with the sale of Artbank. Artbank is an outstandingly successful public institution, which is why I think so many conservative politicians hate it. It should not succeed, it should not be profitable, it should not flourish, because the public sector is supposed, by its very nature, to be inefficient. Unfortunately, Artbank is efficient. It has not made a call on the budget for years. It operates profitably, buying works of art by contemporary Australian visual artists and leasing those works to public and private sector clients. Its collection is valued at about $11 million. At this stage, all the information that is available suggests that no-one is prepared to pay that amount, and the minister has said, `We will not sell it for $2 million or $3 million.' That is encouraging, that is welcome, but there is a long way between $2 million or $3 million and $11 million. But I am concerned about whether it is sold at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Artbank is the biggest purchaser of new work by contemporary Australian artists in Australia today. Many artists&mdash;thousands over the years&mdash;have had their work purchased by this scheme on a commercial basis&mdash;not as an act of charity, not as a grant, but as a commercial, profitable purchase by an Australian government agency saying, `We can buy this work and lease it out and make a decent return for the taxpayer on it and a decent income for Australian artists.' If Artbank is sold that underpinning of the market will be pulled away.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One is concerned that, more importantly, the whole collection of Artbank might come onto the market and undermine the entire capacity of public and private galleries to operate, to purchase at a decent price, to gain decent prices for Australia's artists. There is little enough support already. This government's attacks on the Australia Council and other agencies caused too much threat to artists for this sale to be allowed to go ahead. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4008"><TITLE>Firearms</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would know only too well, we recently marked the anniversary of the tragedy that has become known as Port Arthur. But, on a more positive note, since 10 May last year each state and territory in Australia has instituted the most comprehensive reform of firearms' laws in the history of this nation. Australia is now, 12 months later, a much safer place for its citizens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australasian Police Ministers Council made the historic 1996 nationwide agreement on firearms and set us on a path to better firearm regulations after decades of failed attempts to implement uniform and effective national laws. The Attorney-General (Mr Williams) recently observed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While work may still be needed to complete some details of uniformity, governments have delivered a uniform firearms registration and licensing system for all Australians. The last 12 months has not only seen nearly 400,000 firearms removed from communities across Australia and nearly $200 million paid to gun owners in compensation, it has seen unprecedented legislative action.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We know that governments have banned self&hyphen;loading rifles and shotguns and pump action shotguns and introduced comprehensive registration systems for all firearms, a universal requirement that people must establish a genuine reason to own or possess or use a firearm, a requirement that a permit be obtained to acquire a firearm with a 28&hyphen;day waiting period, a requirement that all first&hyphen;time applicants undertake training, agreed grounds for refusal and cancellation of firearms licences, regulation of mail order and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4009"> transport of firearms, and minimum standards for security and storage of firearms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Attorney-General said, the removal of dangerous firearms from our communities and the establishment of uniform registration and licensing, together with the introduction of comprehensive conditions for firearms ownership, mark a significant turning point in our nation's approach to firearms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Agreeing with all that, there is a matter nonetheless which I wish to raise which is outstanding in terms of the regulation in this area and one which has caused particular problems for a constituent of mine, namely, Mr Colin Green. Mr Green is the owner of a valuable museum quality collection of historical guns. In fact, he has many extremely valuable guns which, in effect, seem to have been caught by the new legislation. Their value is related to their condition, so to deactivate the guns will destroy their historical significance and hence their value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give you an indication of the value of these guns and their historical significance. I will give examples of the semiautomatic rifles he has put together in this collection. There is a Farquhar&hyphen;Hill experimental rifle dating to 1910. It is a handmade model made for the British military trials prior to World War I. This rifle is 86 years old, 14 years from being considered antique, and the only example in Australia and, therefore, irreplaceable and priceless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a Vickers Pedersen rifle dating from the 1920s. It is one of the small batch made for British military trials with ammunition only ever made in limited quantities. It was never successful due to the fact that the ammunition had to be specially lubricated so that the semiautomatic action would function correctly, the very reason that it was never adopted, even though it was a superb design for a rifle, in those early years of experimentation. Again, it is an extremely rare and valuable gun.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a model 1936 gas trap type Garand dating from the mid&hyphen;1930s. These rifles were the forerunners of the United States M1 Garand used extensively in the defence of Australia by US forces during the Second
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> World War. These rifles cannot be fired now due to the fragile nature of the internal working mechanism, which would disintegrate upon doing so. Mr Green has three variations of these rifles, and all three were actually used in the defence of Australia, not just later imports. They, too, are extremely rare and the most valuable in his collection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a 1941 model gas port type Garand dating from the early 1940s. These rifles were the standardised form of Garand gas trap types and are extremely difficult to find in their original form as most were refurbished and upgraded. Again, the rifles are almost impossible to find in original condition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are MI carbines dating from the early 1940s. Mr Green has many early original issue, standard production and experimental types including an example from the first week of production. Then there are various other original examples including sniper rifles, many of which are experimental by design or type or telescopic sight fitted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One in fact is a Winchester rifle which is No. 3 in the production run. In a recent catalogue from the United States, No. 1 in this production run was valued at $US37,500, to give some idea of the value involved. In fact, of the value of this collection of rifles he has put together over some 30 years, Mr Green says it could well be in excess of $2 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raise this because the difficulty is that, even though it is a museum quality collection, the fact that it is held by a private individual who has been collecting these items for some 30 years means that they are caught unless some exception is made in the provisions of the regulations relating to gun laws in Australia. Obviously, to dismantle them and make them unable to be fired destroys the historical value of the rifles concerned. It is something which Mr Green has raised with me on a couple of occasions. In a recent letter, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of these semiautomatics in my possession are rare, historically important, extremely valuable, irreplaceable and must be preserved at all costs. Many of those rifles are the only examples of their respective types, never seen by most firearm collectors in the world. Collecting circles and no
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4010"> Australian museums have them in their reference collections or have even seen examples of them.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In fact, in relation to some of the rifles, he has the only extensive collection dating from the first production year of some rifles which are held in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was borne out by a letter from Mr Robert Courtney, the Curator of Military Heraldry and Weapons at the Australian War Memorial. Without quoting the entire letter, the pertinent paragraph says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I agree that the majority of the weapons are very rare and they represent some of the most valuable military long arms available to collectors in Australia, especially the Farquhar Hill and Vickers Pedersen trials rifles. It would be a disgrace to have these historic weapons destroyed when handed in to the Police.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Having said that, in brief summary, my plea is to urge the Attorney-General, and through him the officers of his department, if necessary in conjunction and in association with the Attorney-General or the police minister in Victoria and officers of his department, to try to look at the regulations to see if there is some way to preserve this particular collection, because, if there is not, when the period for the amnesty finishes at the end of September of this year, Mr Green will be facing the legal option of having to take these rifles to the nearest hand-in point where they will be collected and no doubt crushed, having some small amount of compensation paid for them that may not in any way represent their true historical value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that the Australian War Memorial has indicated the true historical value of these rifles, I would hope that in the national interest something can be done to preserve the collection. Mr Green wants to do that, and he is willing to do it in some way which obviously compensates him not only for the amount of time he has put into collecting these rifles over a period of some 30 years but also in terms of the amount he has expended in putting the collection together. In conclusion, my plea is for the Attorney-General to look at this matter and see whether some steps can be taken to preserve what is a historic collection for Australia.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4010"><TITLE>Immigration: Labor Party Policies</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to correct the misrepresentation which has been made of the Australian Labor Party's immigration program as it was run particularly in the last four years under the prime ministership of Paul Keating. Here at question time today the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) continued to misrepresent Australian Labor Party immigration policy particularly of those last four years. That misrepresentation commenced immediately upon this coalition government taking office and has continued since.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister for immigration and the Prime Minister argue that their immigration program brings the program back into balance by putting the emphasis on skills&mdash;particularly, increased business skills. They argue that cutting the immigration program, and particularly the family program, is redressing the balance of Labor's program, which did not have enough of a skills base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the last four years of the Hawke&hyphen;Keating government, when Paul Keating was Prime Minister, immigration levels in this country were at their lowest since large scale immigration started after the Second World War; they were at their lowest in response to the recession that we had in 1990-91. In Australia's national interest Paul Keating, as the then Prime Minister, and the ministers for immigration running Labor's program ran an immigration scheme with low numbers in recognition of the fact that Australia had been in recession and was coming out of it in a long, slow recovery. They moderated that immigration program and its numbers to reflect the economic facts of life that faced the government&mdash;and they did that absolutely in the national interest. But they did so without bringing into play a series of criticisms that were brought into play by the opposition during those years and which the opposition, or members of it, used to effect during the last election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor ran a tough, strong immigration program. It did so in the knowledge that the people of Australia would need, and demand, an immigration program that changed over time to reflect the economic circumstances we
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4011"> faced. If there was one fault in putting that program into place, it was the fact that the people of Australia were not told loud and long that we had a very tough, very forceful, very strong immigration program dedicated to seeking to meet the economic interests of the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister and the minister for immigration depict that program as being unbalanced. The fact is that during the period of our program not only were the numbers of successful applicants low but also, in the  concessional family program, in order to be successful in getting into Australia&mdash;because of competition being so high&mdash;those applicants needed to be very highly skilled. A person who was successful because of their high level of skill was then able to bring in their immediate family members, their wife and children, under the family reunion program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ours was a balanced program. It was a program that met the needs and demands of the Australian economy. That program has been criticised extensively by the minister for immigration and the Prime Minister&mdash;and it has been criticised extensively not only over the past 14 months but also during the period Labor was in office. So I wish simply to restate the point that we had an immigration policy that met the needs of this country's economy: it was skills based, and it reflected the broad and diverse nature of this community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For an immigration program to be successful, it needs to acknowledge and underline two things. The first is that immigration has brought great benefits to this country and that, for it to continue to bring great benefits to this country, it needs support within the community. The second is that in running an immigration program we need to have an end goal in mind. That end goal in a country of migrants, as Australia is, is to create a richer, more diverse and more unified new Australia; to create, out of the very diverse groups of people that post-World War II we brought into this country, a stronger and more united nation, and one that is divided neither on the basis of the content of the immigration pro
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> gram nor on the basis of the culture that we have as our blessing in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a great deal of debate in the past about the nature of not only the program but also the society in which we live. In the last election campaign, Labor was swept from office and the coalition gained a great majority&mdash;and that occurred as a result of the coalition campaigning on a number of fronts. That majority achieved by the coalition was achieved, in part, because of a long campaign it waged over more than 10 years vilifying the changes that had occurred in Australia. In fact, it took more than seven months from the time the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) made her maiden speech for the Prime Minister of this country to come out and actually say that she was wrong on a number of points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister did that recently at the Australia&hyphen;Asia Society in a speech entitled `Australia and Asia: an enduring engagement'. He simply made five points that she was wrong to suggest that Aboriginals were not disadvantaged; she was wrong to say that Australia was in danger of being swamped by Asians; she was wrong to seek scapegoats for society's problems; she was wrong to denigrate foreign investment, because its withdrawal would cost jobs; and she was wrong to claim that Australia was headed for civil war.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He did not go on to analyse where she was wrong on all of those points. Instead, he threw up this comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The political campaign mounted by the member for Oxley seeks to exploit fear and instability without offering solutions or hope.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The difference, I would suggest, between the approach taken by the member for Oxley and that which the Prime Minister sees as being most appropriate is that she did not offer either solutions or hope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a very telling comment, he underlines his approach to the last federal election and what he thought really happened. Arguing that she had reflected concerns about the pace of change and the pressure that parts of the community are under, and long smouldering resentments about attitudes which had been
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4012"> imposed on the majority of the Australian community about the feeling that they had the opportunity to debate that, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In part, the 1996 federal election result represented a repudiation of the stultifying political correctness which had afflicted so many areas of the Australian polity during the previous decade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many Australians resent the negative view of our history and the Australian achievement which has become so standard in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He then speaks about the black armband view of history. His last point was that Australians resent the plaintive way in which so many  people have encouraged us to approach our association with the nations of the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my belief that in those seven months since the member for Oxley first made her statements&mdash;wrong as they were and condemned by a number of speakers from the coalition&mdash;the Prime Minister made no effective comment and no effective attack, he was pursuing his own agenda; an agenda that he had pursued previously. It is my contention that he was happy for the member for Oxley to act as his agent&mdash;an agent provocateur&mdash;in stirring up trouble, in stirring up confusion, in stirring up the mountain of reasons that people felt there was something wrong with society. I think he did so on a deliberate basis with absolute intent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When finally the polls showed that the coalition was in danger in terms of their electoral position, while a number of ministers ran around like headless chooks and made condemnations of the member for Oxley, the Prime Minister was dragged kicking and screaming to finally make this speech. He made five points about where she was wrong without giving an explanation, but he came back to the core of what he was on about: the fact that under Labor he considered there had been repression of people's opinions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He ran his code that under Labor people were oppressed and were not allowed to say what they thought about immigration and a whole range of social issues and that he saw his solution as simply providing a new coalition government. So, until she went rogue,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> she served his purposes. Until that time, she had effectively been his agent. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4012"><TITLE>River Murray</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1838 Major Thomas Mitchell, the Surveyor&hyphen;General of New South Wales, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Murray, fed by the lofty mountains on the east, carries to the sea, a body of fresh water sufficient to irrigate the whole country, and this is in general so level . . . that the abundant water of the river might probably be turned into canals, for the purpose either of supplying natural deficiencies of water at particular places or of affording the means of transport across the wide plains.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He saw in the River Murray a resource that gave great opportunity for future development of the nation. By the 1880s the Chaffey brothers had at least partially taken up his challenge and turned the Mildura area into an irrigation area modelled on California.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By 1997 the popular view across Australia is that the River Murray is dying. One hundred and ten years after Major Thomas Mitchell pronounced those words, in the 1950s, one-third of the River Murray flow was diverted into irrigation activities. After 160 years, in 1997, without intervention, we would be diverting more than the river's flow. It has only been the recent decision by the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, encouraged by the federal government and the state governments, to engage capping that has guaranteed that the river's entire flow will not be diverted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rise in this grievance debate because I want to put the case for the River Murray. I, frankly, do not believe this is a dying resource. I believe this is a resource that is currently being very well managed, and I must say that the evolution to better management occurred just as successfully under the former government as it has under my own. The decision by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to establish a fund to be known as the Natural Heritage Trust fund to be used for environmental rehabilitation across the nation is great news for the Murray, because it gives the resources that are necessary to further take up the work initiated by the former government as part of the Murray-Darling Basin upgrade.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4013">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a major resource. Eighty per cent of the nation's irrigated properties are in the Murray-Darling Basin. The total agricultural product produced in that basin returns something like $10 billion to the nation. The irrigated portion of that product returns about $6 billion. In its natural course, the River Murray runs in drought about five in every 100 years. But, as a result of the diversion that has been particularly pronounced over the last 40 years, the River Murray now effectively has what I will call a diversion induced drought in six out of every 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has meant a dramatic change in the way in which the river operates and in its  management. This was once a major artery flowing to the sea. But, in order to have it available for irrigation, for recreation and for major cities, particularly in South Australia, locks were created which have made the river into a series of dams.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the dinner suspension I was reflecting on the River Murray and on the popular view that exists in the community that it is a dying river. In fact, I was making the point that over the last decade or so there has been quite a dramatic change in river management, a change that the parliament ought to be aware of and a change that Australians should celebrate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is widely felt that much of the problem with the river is the result of irrigation, and there is some truth in that. But what needs to be borne in mind is that much of the problem facing the River Murray basin is the result of natural saline drainage inflows that existed long before white man and possibly well before any human beings roamed this continent of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of these natural inflows, which have existed, as I say, from time immemorial, have now been tapped and that water diverted. The work that is now needed on the Murray&hyphen;Darling     Basin is the interception of drainage inflows that result from irrigation. A good deal of work has already been done in drainage inflows resulting from irrigation, but some of the need for the work is solely the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> result of what has been the historic style of irrigation in New South Wales, Victoria and in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past, a number of irrigation schemes&mdash;and I now talk specifically about my own state of South Australia&mdash;were built during the early part of this century, using open concrete channels as a way of getting water to each of the land&hyphen;holders' properties. These were schemes that were under the government's administration and provided a very successful and low cost way of getting water to each property.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dilemma with these schemes was that because the water came via open channels it was assumed that all of the growers would use a flood irrigation technique to meet the water demands of each plant. The end result of that was that in every case the plant did not simply receive the amount of water it needed, nor was the soil simply taken to saturation point; the reality was that the water was taken well beyond saturation point through flood irrigation and this excess water then ultimately found its way back into the river channel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, particularly since the 1970s, there has been a progressive upgrade of the government irrigation schemes throughout the Riverland area. As a result, in government irrigation areas, the open concrete channels in those sandy soils&mdash;which were themselves cracked and as a result had irrigation water running out through the cracks, not going to any particular irrigation task but simply being wasted&mdash;have now been replaced by sealed pipelines, ensuring that every grower simply gets on demand the water he or she needs for their irrigation property.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This means that modern techniques such as low throw sprinklers or drippers can be engaged so that the amount of water used has nothing to do with soil saturation but relates only to the amount of water that the plant is going to require, and drainage is all but eliminated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make these points in this grievance debate tonight because, while there has been an upgrade of government irrigation schemes across South Australia, there is one govern
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4014"> ment irrigation scheme for which the Commonwealth has responsibility, and this is the irrigation scheme in the Loxton area. The Commonwealth has responsibility for it because it was established as a war service land settlement scheme. It was set up, obviously, post the Second War, and returned service men and women were encouraged to take up plots in the Loxton irrigation area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is therefore the only Commonwealth irrigation property along the Riverland area of South Australia. Unless the Commonwealth takes action, it will also be the only irrigation scheme in South Australia that will not have been upgraded. I therefore rise to plead with the Minister for Primary Industries and Ener gy (Mr Anderson), who has been sympathetic to this call, to accelerate the process by which the Loxton irrigation area may be rehabilitated. I would find it intolerable not only as a member of the Commonwealth parliament but particularly as a member of this government to have a non&hyphen;rehabilitated irrigation area in my electorate which was in fact the responsibility of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that this government has already established its credentials as an environmentally sensitive government, given that money has already been allocated to the rehabilitation of irrigation areas, given that the interception schemes for saline inflows have already been funded in order to keep down the drainage in the River Murray basin, it is appropriate that the program for intercepting drainage water at Loxton and the program for rehabilitating the Loxton irrigation scheme be brought forward and accelerated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should make the very pertinent point that this is not a plea for the Commonwealth to spend money. The state government of South Australia stands prepared to match whatever the Commonwealth is doing, and the growers of the Loxton irrigation area have already voluntarily established a water rate which is higher so that they can build a fund by which they can make a contribution to area rehabilitation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We therefore have the growers, the state government and the Commonwealth recognising this need. What is now needed is
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Commonwealth dollars being allocated to the purpose. A study is in hand to find the most efficient way of rehabilitating Loxton. The good news is that the rehabilitation will almost certainly save 30 per cent of the water that is currently being used in irrigation in Loxton and that will be able to be reallocated to promising crops such as grapevines, olives or almonds. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4014"><TITLE>Steel Industry</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance tonight concerns the determination by BHP in recent weeks to reduce its steel making in Australia, which in turn will lead to reduction in exports and a worsening of our balance of payments. In speaking about it, it is important that I give the whole context of what has been occurring, and one needs therefore to go back to the early 1980s. In 1982 BHP announced a reduction in its work force in Newcastle by some 5,000 people and was clearly intending to shrink its production at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The change of government in March 1983 saw the introduction in June&hyphen;July of that year of an agreement between BHP, the government and the work force as to a future relationship. That was based on the offer by the government of a bounty to people who bought Australian steel. It also required an investment by BHP in their works. It also involved a substantial contribution by the Commonwealth to the three steel regions that were affected. In Newcastle, in particular, the Commonwealth contribution was around $45 million, equivalent nowadays to about $58 million. Those funds were aimed at helping those regions to diversify their economies and helping them to become broader in their applications and less dependent on a single industry like BHP. During the life of that steel plan, BHP did invest in its Newcastle plant. In particular, it installed a new caster, which is still operational and in very good shape.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Between then and 1995 BHP went through a series of reviews of its steel technology and its future plans. It examined, with various managers and various fads, if you like, a range of options. There were numerous
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4015"> rumours, half&hyphen;reports and half&hyphen;leaked ideas about what may or may not happen. They culminated on 30 June 1995 with the announcement of the investment of half a billion dollars in new steel making capacity at the Newcastle works. That announcement was made by both Mr Prescott and Mr Kirkby and was a national announcement. It was not some minor issue but a major announcement made to the Stock Exchange, and on that basis I took it as being absolutely genuine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That, in turn, gives the lie to those people who say they have known for years that BHP was going to terminate steel making in Newcastle. If that were the case, it would clearly mean that Mr Prescott and Mr Kirkby misled the Australian Stock Exchange and, as you  would understand, that would be a very serious offence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision on 30 June 1995 was to give enough time, enough certainty, for people to plan, and it also meant a reduction in the work force. It also meant that contractors would stay on site and that there would be a continuation of steel making and, hence, steel science and downstream industries would be positively affected. That decision was made and broadcast in some detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In July&hyphen;August of last year BHP announced a review of its steel division. There has been a series of leaks since then of one kind or another. There has been a series of commentaries by financial analysts and by stock market consultants or whatever, many of whom have suggested that the Newcastle plant was no longer viable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that there has not been an argument about the Newcastle plant in itself. The argument was always about how BHP managed its investment to maintain its production. I have taken the view that BHP was committed to not just making steel but making enough steel to continue its export sales. The fact is that we currently export about three million tonnes of steel, worth about $1&half; billion in foreign earnings. Therefore, any decision to reduce production would have national implications of some substance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision on 29 April then was effectively a reversal of that decision of June
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1995&mdash;less than two years ago. It is of some merit&mdash;and I suggest members might find the time amongst their other duties&mdash;to read the history of BHP's decisions and announcements. One gets the feeling that every year BHP have had a complete change of attitude or a change of values because, when you look through the 1995 statements and see how positive and how confident they were and then look at what they are saying now, it is really hard to find what has changed. It is very hard to find out why they were so wrong. How can a company that is so important and such a major operator get it so wrong such a short time ago? In less than nine months when their quarterly reports came out before the second half of last year BHP were seen to be very wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that steel profits did drop in 1996. They dropped for a number of reasons: the surplus sales into Asia and the Asian marketplace, for a variety of reasons; the extra production capacity being installed in Asia; and, of course, as BHP are now saying, because of the capacity available they could not maintain their market share or they could not sell their steel into Asia at a profit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Effectively they are saying that they will no longer invest in the future of steel technology. Nowhere in that statement made on 29 April was there any indication of the technological future of their steel making division. Nor did they decide to include their iron making capacity at Port Hedland&mdash;currently being constructed&mdash;in the steel division. However, they did say that they would in future be investing in the steel division at a rate below the depreciation charges, which would lead to a significant reduction in their capital base. They are virtually the words that were used. In other words, they are going to run down their steel division assets over time. That is not the sign of a company looking strongly to the future and seeing a big future in both steel making and steel exporting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that BHP is saying that resources are more valuable and more worth while. In the fortnight following the announcement we saw two other statements from BHP, each involving over half a billion dollars, one about diamonds and one about
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4016"> copper&mdash;both offshore and both about resources only. So what BHP is effectively saying is that steel is just too tough for it; it cannot hack it and therefore it will not further invest in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This country needs investment in metal. It needs investment in adding value to our iron ore exports. We currently export 130 to 140 million tonnes of iron ore for about $40 a tonne. If that were converted to steel and exported as steel, it would be equivalent to about 100 million tonnes of steel worth more than $400 a tonne. In other words, it would wipe out in one go our balance of payments deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are we doing as a country? We are actually going to export less steel and more iron ore. In other words, we are doing the reverse of what this country needs. This country needs a new steel plan&mdash;one that is current and one that is appropriate to encourage investment by BHP and/or others in the steel industry again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such a plan would need to cover at least the following five points. It would need to explore the option of BHP separately corporatising its steel division and selling all or part of it to people who are prepared to invest. It would need the government to explore the competitiveness of the Australian investment environment to try to establish appropriate mechanisms to ensure investment in manufacturing. For example, BHP accessed the development allowance for both the Port Hedland development and the No. 6 blast furnace at Port Kembla. Do we need to have appropriate instruments to ensure that we get investment? Our investment community happily invests billions in office blocks in Sydney and Melbourne and loses money every five or six years, but it will not invest in steel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A plan would need to look at the more direct involvement of government in new iron and steel technology. It would need to take into account the integration of our ore policies and metal policies so that they are harmonised. It would need to also look at bilateral negotiations with other countries. Japan, Korea and Taiwan want us to import their manufactured goods, but they should also allow us to export our steel to them. Those
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are at least the five key elements that we need to have, and there are probably more. This government needs to understand that. Newcastle, Kembla and Whyalla have a great future in steel making if the government&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Another redistribution of federal electorates has begun in Queensland. This will be the third redistribution in three parliaments, and there is certain to be another one in the next parliament and probably one after that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that the Commonwealth Electoral Act, which suggests that electorate boundary change should be kept to a minimum, produces precisely the opposite result. Its prescriptive requirements in relation to numerical representation guarantee continuing change and uncertainty. Boundaries, particularly in fast growing areas such as southern Queensland, are always changing. That is unsettling for members of parliament but, more importantly, constituents often have little knowledge of what electorate they live in and, if they wait long enough, there is bound to be another change. I frequently get calls from people whom I have not represented for four years, and they are not aware of the fact that there have been regular redistributions which have changed the boundaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth Electoral Act, in section 59, lists the three triggers which can result in a redistribution. A redistribution is held when the number of parliamentary representatives to which a state or territory is entitled has changed, when the number of electors in more than one-third of the divisions in a state or in one of the territories deviates from the average divisional enrolment by more than 10 per cent in three consecutive months, or if seven years has elapsed since the last redistribution.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4017">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A redistribution was triggered in Western Australia in 1996, as seven years had elapsed since the previous redistribution in 1989. In 1994, redistributions were triggered in the ACT, Queensland and Victoria, as population changes had altered the entitlements. Now in 1997 there are redistributions again because of changed entitlements in the ACT and Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act is fundamentally based on the single fixed obsession with having equal numbers of voters in every electorate in each state. The voting population must be within 10 per cent at the time of the distribution, within two per cent 3&half; years hence, and again within 10 per cent seven years from the date of the redistribution. Section 66 of the act makes it clear that there is no flexibility allowed in those 10 per cent tolerances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in this country really give extraordinary expression to the popular catchcry one vote, one value. There is no electoral weightage permitted in this country to recognise the difficulties associated with representing vast rural areas, so we have the nonsense situation where the 10 largest electorates in Australia contain about 90 per cent of the area of the country, and over half the members of this House represent less than five per cent of the area of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the city electorates, where you can walk to the members' offices, are compared with some country electorates, where it is two days drive to visit your member's electorate office, there is no doubt in my mind that we do not have anything like equality of representation in this country. The person who lives two days drive from his member of parliament certainly does not get one vote, one value equal representation with the member who is within sight of his local member's office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is one of the few countries in the world to place such priority on equality of numbers in electorates, yet ours is a vast country. If ever there were a land where there ought to be some recognition of the difficulties of representing vast areas, it ought to be a country like Australia. I know that some extra facilities are provided, but they are poor
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> substitutes for the ability to be able to readily access your local member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other democracies around the world give weightage for distance, even a little country like the United Kingdom has up to nine to one tolerance in the voting numbers between electorates. The USA and European countries all recognise the need for some kind of tolerance. Even in Australia the rigid adherence that we have to equal numbers is not required by our constitution. The High Court ruled accordingly when dealing with the appeal by the Western Australian Labor Party. We had a referendum to try to entrench one vote, one value, and that was defeated in 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that we have electoral weightage in Australia, but the weightage is against rural areas. The strict numerical requirements of the act basically mean that rural electorates almost always will have larger enrolments than the small city electorates. Because of the requirements to meet that strict numerical criteria seven years out, slow growing electorates must have above quota enrolments to ensure that they do not fall below quota by the end of the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In states like Queensland where you are having redistributions every three years we never actually get to the stage of equality of representation. The rural electorates continue to have overly large numbers. The country electorates in Australia, therefore, not only have large areas but also have the largest enrolments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the 1993 election the largest enrolment in Queensland was not one of the small city electorates, it was Maranoa. Kennedy had the sixth largest enrolment. In Western Australia in the same election O'Connor had the second largest enrolment. In South Australia, the largest seat, Grey, had the second largest enrolment. In New South Wales, Parkes had the third largest enrolment. The biggest seats have also got the biggest enrolments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because we are relying not on actual growth figures but on a prediction, there are often errors in the projections. When the redistribution in Queensland occurred in 1994, Moncrieff on the Gold Coast, one of the seats
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4018"> thought to be a fast growing electorate, was set 8.6 per cent below quota. Here we are almost three years on to the midpoint and Moncrieff has slipped back. It is 9.7 per cent below quota now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the act should be changed to bring more stability and fairness to the boundaries and to end the gerrymander that is designed to concentrate even more power in the cities. I am not saying that alone. In the submissions made by the political parties to the Electoral Commission for this Queensland distribution, the ALP and the Liberal Party both called for changes to the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP said that the legislation should be amended so that `no redistribution occur within two electoral cycles'. They go on to explain how it is unfair that the current arrangements are so reliant on numbers, and they outlined four principles that should be  followed. The Liberal Party, incidentally, has six seats which do not meet the criteria. The ALP makes this point very strongly in their submission when they say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As such, the possibility of extending, within reason, electoral populations beyond these margins of allowance should be considered, where possible, to avoid unnecessary disruption to the community.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I agree entirely. The Liberal Party have actually suggested that the 10 per cent deviation should be allowed also at the midpoint. The National Party in a submission three years ago suggested that the midpoint variation should be five per cent. But certainly those variations should be used in full.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another option would be to allow one large electorate in every Australian state to have a quota, say, 20 or 30 per cent below the average to ensure that there is fair and equitable representation. There is a need to review the act. The Labor Party indicated prior to departing government that they were interested in making changes. I think it is important that the incoming government act in that regard. The Liberal Party as part of their submission to the commission made this point:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is clear the best interests of electors will continue to be subordinate to the demands of, at best, speculative mathematics.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great pleasure that I support this initiative by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Educa tion and Training (Dr Kemp) and the government to bring this measure before the House. In fact, approximately 10 years ago I called for a similar measure in this House. I am pleased to see it has come to fruition here today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To kick this off $21.6 million has been set aside in the budget. Of that, $15.5 million will be used to set up in the first instance 70 pilot projects around Australia and $6.1 million will be put towards administration and towards monitoring and assessment of the initiative so that we can get it right and expand it in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government intends that the pilot projects will be largely supervised by community organisations. A modest amount of money is also set aside for child-care costs of those who are married with children participating in the program. Also the participants will get an extra $10 a week over and above what is colloquially known as the dole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first instance there will be only 10,000 participants in this scheme. Once the program is bedded down and running well, I would like to see another nought, at least, added to that number. But we have to start somewhere. I would like to see the modest
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> element of training that will go into this program expanded as the program develops over the coming years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first instance also it is restricted to those between the ages of 18 and 24. Eventually, I would like to see it extended to other unemployed people in the community, particularly those over 40, because I believe they can also participate to their benefit in these programs. It is also in the first instance limited to those who have been unemployed for over six months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be a small element of compulsion in the program for those who do not want to participate. We are told that these people are out of work, that they are seeking work and that they want to be paid for the work. That is what the government is doing. We are going to offer them work and we are going to pay them for it. I do not think there is anything remarkable about that. If you are in the work force and do not turn up for work, you do not get paid and nobody even bats an eyelid at that. So why should it be any different for these people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first instance the work done will be for the community benefit. There may be some room in the future for these people to be employed in the private sector, but that is something for further down the track. We have had various job creation programs over the last decade or so. The new work opportunities program was the most spectacular as far as spending taxpayers' money goes. In some instances it was costing, in the end, $143,000 for every person placed in the work force. Much better was the wage subsidy scheme, which was only costing a little over $4,000 for every person who found a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The frustrating thing with this legislation is that we have to wait until September before it can be implemented, even though it was announced earlier this year. That is because we have to change the social security legislation to make it legal for these people to be paid. The reason for the delay is not so much getting it through the lower House&mdash;we are in agreement on that&mdash;but the delays that will take place in the Senate. The Labor Party are against this even though they are forced to go
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4020"> along with it because it appears that well over 90 per cent of the population are in favour of it. They will do everything in the Senate to delay it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What? A pilot scheme for an intractable problem?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MF4">Mr COBB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just seen from that interjection the sort of hostility towards this program despite the lip service the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has given to it. They would love to oppose it outright but they dare not because they know the Australian population are in favour of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first instance we are going to have 70 community based pilot programs. What I particularly like about the scheme is that it will have a regional and rural focus, particularly in towns with high youth unemployment. The community groups that can supervise the programs include bodies like Apex, Lions and Rotary as well as chambers of commerce and charity groups such as the Salvation Army.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dole, if I can use that colloquial term, is roughly equivalent to two days pay for unskilled labour. Those in the age group 18 to 20 will be required to do two six&hyphen;hour days a week, and those between the ages of 21 and 24 will be required to do two 6&half;&hyphen;hour days a week. They will receive the dole payment plus an extra $10 a week to cover the cost of incidentals. They will still have three working days a week left over in which to go out and look for work. If they participate in this scheme it will help them greatly. It will give these unemployed people a sense of self&hyphen;worth. In many cases it will restore their dignity and pride. When they receive their cheque at the end of the week they can hold their heads up high. It will look a lot better on their CV when they knock on an employer's door looking for work. It will help break the cycle of unproductive activity and isolation that particularly young people can sometimes fall into.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  work that they will be doing is worthwhile work&mdash;projects on the environment, projects on the restoration of community buildings, various community services work and charity work. This sort of work would not
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> otherwise be done. It will not be displacing anybody from a job at all, so those in jobs need not fear these sorts of schemes. It is work that the community badly needs doing. There are many simple things that could be done. Charitable organisations and community groups can have people mowing pensioners' lawns, attending to hospital gardens and even doing simple things like going along to people in nursing homes and sitting down and spending a bit of time with these lonely people that the busy staff do not have time to spend with. There are simple things like reading the sporting pages of the paper to someone who may be interested in sport, or telling them about various things that they might have questions about. It would help those elderly people immeasurably as well as give young people a sense of what it is to care for elderly people in our community. Projects like that&mdash;and I only mention one or two&mdash;would be very valuable in our community and would give the participants on both sides a great sense of satisfaction about what they were doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the Australian Institute for Health and Welfare, the health status of people who are out of work is often not what it could be. Young males out of work are 64 per cent more likely to report fair or poor health than people in work. Amongst young females it is even higher; the percentage there is 82 per cent. So we are even helping the health of these people by getting them out into the community and involving them in a way that has not been done before. The community benefit from this is immeasurable. We have, tragically, over 800,000 people in this community unemployed&mdash;looking for work. So we can see the potential of these sorts of schemes in the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I stress that this is only a first step, and it is only one of many steps that we have to take. One thing I would like to stress with this scheme is that I understand we will not be counting the participants in the scheme when it comes to doing the unemployment figures. These people will still be counted as unemployed. We will not be doing it in any way to fudge the figures, as has been done in the past where we were spending hundreds of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4021"> millions of dollars of taxpayers' money in a desperate attempt to get the figures down in an artificial manner. There is not a set amount of work out there in the community to be done: there are virtually unlimited amounts of work to be done and these people can participate in that sort of work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to spend a minute or two talking about the deferred pension bonus that was announced in the budget brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) only a couple of weeks ago whereby people do not have to retire at the age of 65 but can continue to work on to the age of 70 and receive a deferred lump sum payment because they will not be drawing on the taxpayer by drawing a pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is said by some critics that those people will be displacing young people from going into the work force. That is not an opinion that I happen to agree with, because a person of 65 is often at the peak of their working life with all their decades of accumulated experience. A great example of that is one that I came across when I was going through uni versity. I studied at university with Sir John Eccles's son. His father had won the Nobel Prize for work on the mechanism of nerve transmissions. Sir John turned 65 and he had to be retired. He wanted to continue in the work force but could not do so in this country. It was a great tragedy. The Yanks snapped him up in a flash and off he went to America. He worked there for another five or 10 years, contributing greatly to our knowledge in scientific physiology. That is probably a dramatic example, but it is these sorts of people whom we are losing from our work force and they are not displacing young people from the work force at all. So I think it is a very commendable initiative, and in no way is it threatening the jobs of the young people at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the time remaining to me, I would like to talk about a particular initiative in my electorate called the Barwon-Darling Alliance formed by three councils in my electorate&mdash;the councils of Brewarrina and Bourke, and also those of Wilcannia, Ivanhoe and Menindee which are called the Central Darling
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Council. They have put together a proposition to the government to run shire council&hyphen;supervised projects for unemployed people in their electorates. I think this work for the dole scheme and also the CDEP scheme, which is run out of the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio, have great application in what they are proposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In effect, they are saying that in these remote rural communities there is very little work at the end of the day for unskilled people, and I think we have to recognise that. In Brewarrina, a town of about 1,500&hyphen;odd people, 50 per cent of the population is Aboriginal. In Bourke, it is probably only about half of that in proportional terms. But, of the thousand people who live in Wilcannia, about 80 per cent are Aboriginal. Let's face it: there are no jobs as things stand at present for those Aboriginal people, and I do think that there is a case for some significant element of government subsidy to give these people some sort of pride and dignity and to get them doing something. We have to recognise that the outcomes for them at the end of the day, as far as getting a job goes, are not good, but at least this will give them some chance. When we assess these programs we have to realise one central factor: that the social benefit that will flow from getting these people into work programs is well worth the taxpayer's dollar and it just cannot be measured out of one portfolio. We just cannot go to Senator Amanda Vanstone's portfolio and say, `We are going to spend $30,000 on taking an unemployed person and putting them through one of these job programs for 12 months,' while expecting to get a high job outcome at the end of it. If you got one in 10 into a job at the end of these programs, it would be a miracle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to realise that that cost to the taxpayer is repaid manyfold if you look at the full equation&mdash;what I call the whole social benefit equation. I am talking about the benefit that would flow to other portfolios. For example, the state Department of Community Services would save a lot of money from getting these people off the streets and into some sort of job training program. With the state Attorney-General's Department or
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4022"> the state Ministry for Police, you have only to prevent one court case and you have probably saved something of the order of $50,000 or more. If you looked at when these programs in new work opportunities were actually conducted in Wilcannia, you would find the crime rate in that town dropped in some instances by 80 to 90 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I realise that new work opportunities programs were very expensive to the taxpayer in other areas of Australia. I have acknowledged that, and I do believe that they should be changed, as the government is doing, but in remote rural communities, particularly with a high Aboriginal population, these sorts of programs have their place. Whether you call it new work opportunities, work for the dole or a CDEP scheme, these programs have great merit because they get the crime rate down, they stop vandalism in the towns and they give a great sense of morale to the towns. I have seen the results of these programs in Bourke, for example, where they were doing up the local cemetery, planting trees, doing painting and putting in guards around trees in the town whose branches were being broken  off. Those programs alone, if continued, do more for reconciliation amongst whites and blacks in a community than virtually anything else. When the Aboriginal people can participate, get some dignity and get some ownership of these programs, they do not then go on to vandalise the projects that they have participated in. That in itself is a worthwhile consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I would like Minister Vanstone, Minister Herron and other relevant ministers to consider these things and to take them into account perhaps while talking amongst themselves. I know it is difficult to get two departments to talk together, such as the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. That is difficult enough, but even more difficult is to get a federal program to talk to a state program. You could get the state Attorney&hyphen;General's Department and the state police minister's department and the state Department of Community Services together and say, `Let us look at the full social benefit equation and let us put together
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> who will benefit from it.' Perhaps there could be not just a financial input from Amanda Vanstone's department&mdash;if she is going to run these programs&mdash;which is a high cost to her&mdash;but also a contribution from other federal departments and other state government departments. I am talking about New South Wales here, but this would apply right across Australia in remote areas in some instances. If we pretend to call ourselves a Christian community, we cannot let Aboriginal people having rates of unemployment in these towns in excess of 95 per cent in some instances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend my suggestion to the House. I take my hat off to General Manager John Page and Mayor Angelo Pippos in Brewarrina, to Alan Valey and Wally Mitchell in Bourke, and to Peter Hee and Robert King in Wilcannia for the submission that they have put forward. I hope that it will be looked at in a positive and favourable light. I commend the work for the dole project and the government for bringing it forward. I can see it expanding even further and being married into other programs and doing something for the genuine unemployed people in this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think everybody in the House would agree that unemployment, and especially long&hyphen;term unemployment, is the most serious issue facing Australia today. It not only has a very devastating impact on the unemployed themselves and their families but also represents a major loss to the wider community&mdash;whether it is ideas, enthusiasm, energy, hope, as well as the loss of direct productive contributions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No measure which might assist unemployed Australians, therefore, should be dismissed without consideration. The debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill provides us with an opportunity to examine the government's proposed work for the dole scheme against these concerns and to see how they measure up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us make it clear right from the start that, in our view, the scheme does not measure up. The government, in putting this bill before us, seems to assume that people are unemployed because they do not want to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4023"> work and that they will not join the scheme unless they are forced to. I would have to say that in my view this is nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Late last week a man from my electorate who had been unemployed since February last year came to see me. He had applied for 400 jobs in that time. He was a distribution manager, about 50 years old and extremely frustrated with the fact that he could not get work. This scheme pays no due regard to the trials this man has had to go through in not being able to get work which he desperately wants. Unemployed people like this man know that under this government there are fewer and fewer jobs to get, and employers and job placement organisations know of the overwhelming response to the jobs that are advertised. As I said, this man had applied for 400 jobs himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community at large holds many misconceptions about unemployed people. This government, instead of providing the leadership that people need, is feeding those misconceptions and prejudices by using unemployed people as scapegoats for the problems that it seems incapable of fixing. Unemployed people, in my experience, want  to work. They are not dole bludgers. What we would have hoped is that the term `dole bludger' and all of its associations had gone into history with Mr Fraser. But, unfortunately, the party which gave us Fightback&mdash;which, I might remind those present, promised to cut off benefits for the unemployed after nine months and which introduced the dole diary&mdash;has found a new approach to dealing with unemployed people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While superficially different, this scheme has all the hallmarks of previous coalition approaches to unemployment. It is an expression of this government's ideological view of the world which is, basically, to get governments out of people's lives, including dealing with the unemployment rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The activity test for the newstart allowance already requires people to provide fortnightly proof of their willingness to undertake suitable work and of the steps that they have taken to find that work. Arrangements already exist which allow unemployed people to volunteer their time, within certain limits. One
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the very good things that the government has done in the last 18 months since taking office is to recognise one of Labor's policies and allow older unemployed people to undertake additional voluntary work without penalty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at the vast gulf between the rhetoric that is used by the government in relation to this scheme and the reality of the bill that is before us tonight. On 19 March this year, the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regions with highest levels of youth unemployment would be the focus of the pilots . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But there are no location restrictions in this legislation. Work for the dole schemes could operate anywhere in the country. On 19 March, he also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Participants in the work for the dole pilots would primarily be 18&hyphen; to 24&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who have been unemployed for at least six months.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But there are no age restrictions in this legislation. People aged from 18 to retirement age could be compelled to participate in the scheme. There is no duration of unemployment requirement in the legislation. A person could be compelled to participate in a work for the dole scheme from day one of receipt of the newstart allowance. Again on 19 March, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is expected that participation in work for the dole projects would be largely voluntary . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But the legislation gives the secretary&mdash;or it is likely to be the new Chief Executive Officer of the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency&mdash;the power to require any newstart recipient to work for the dole as a requirement of meeting the activity test. The only exemptions for participating in the legislation are if there is evidence that a medical condition would be aggravated by the work or if the work, as it is said to be performed, would be a risk to health and safety. They are the only exemptions. Again on 19 March, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . work for the dole projects would be for a minimum of three and a maximum of 12 months duration.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But there are no time limits in this legislation. A person could be compelled to participate in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4024"> a work for the dole scheme for a week or for as long as they are unemployed. A person could be required to work for the dole until they found a job&mdash;moving from project to project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 11 March this year, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) is reported as confirming that `participants would be protected under workers compensation schemes'. But this legislation is silent on how this protection might be assured. In fact, the legislation goes even further because it says that people who are participating in work for the dole schemes are specifically not covered by Commonwealth workers compensation, occupational health and safety, superannuation or workplace relations protections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 10 February this year, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said, `Award rates will be payable.' He went on to say, `When I talk about awards, I mean the rate that is prescribed in the case of people under 21&mdash;the relevant junior rate in the award.' But the only requirement in the legislation is that people not be required to work for more than 24 hours a fortnight if they are under 21 or 30 hours a fortnight if they are 21 or over. The number of hours does not vary with the kind of work being done. The award is the national training wage award where rates of pay are reduced by 20 per cent because a person is supposed to be in training for at least 20 per cent of the time. Of course, under the government's scheme, no training is to be provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 12 March the member for the Goldstein (Dr Kemp) said, `The projects will all have to meet very stringent quality criteria.' But there is absolutely nothing in the legislation which sets out what these very stringent quality criteria might be. On 12 March, the member for the Goldstein said that the scheme will `lift young people's self-esteem and hopefully they will be better prepared for a job a bit further down the track'. But, by the government's own admission, the work for the dole scheme is not a labour market program. There is no requirement for the organisation sponsoring the project to provide any training. The government has provided no
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> evidence  that participation in their work for the dole scheme will do anything to enhance a person's self-esteem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 12 March this year, the member for the Goldstein, when asked whether or not participants will have any choice about the kind of project they participate in and whether they will be able to work in areas they are actually interested in, replied, `Well, hopefully that will be the case.' But there is nothing in the legislation which gives newstart allowees any choice about what work they will do, where they will work or who they will work for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have as a community and irrespective of our party affiliations a responsibility to unemployed people. We have a responsibility to treat them with dignity and not to blame them for something that is totally beyond their control&mdash;just like the man who came to see me last week. We should not blame them for their unemployed status and use them as a justification for cheap labour. More importantly, we have an obligation as parliamentarians to provide our unemployed people with the education, the training, the work experience and the skills that they need to take up the opportunities that are available in the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor met these obligations and, I would to have say, we were rightly proud of our reciprocal obligation. We met our end of the bargain with labour market programs. But that is not what this government is doing. The work for the dole scheme is being peddled by the government under the guise of not reciprocal obligation, not an obligation on the part of the government, but mutual obligation. This means that people provide their labour in exchange for the newstart allowance. This shift from reciprocal obligation under Labor, which meant that the government actually had an obligation to provide training and opportunities for people who are unemployed, to mutual obligation under the coalition is a radical departure from the philosophy behind unemployment payments that we have had in this country since the postwar period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unemployment benefits are an entitlement that exist to provide income support where
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4025"> work cannot be provided for those who want it and need it. Labor does not think it is fair and reasonable to expect a person to work in return for an unemployment benefit. We do, however, consider it is fair and reasonable to require people to participate in structured labour market programs, and we will be amending the object clause of the bill to reflect our view that this bill should be about setting the conditions under which people receiving newstart allowance might be required to participate in approved programs of work, when approved programs of work are in fact proper labour market programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know from past and overseas experience that work for the dole schemes such as this one have very little chance of success. We have known since at least 1984, when we had the major Kirby committee reporting on labour market programs, that those programs which provide only work experience are the least effective in improving long-term employment prospects. When in government the Labor Party used this knowledge and experience to develop a range of labour market programs which did not exploit the participants but rather provided them with adequate conditions and wages, with training and with links to the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Far from meeting its end of the bargain, this government abolished these programs in its first budget&mdash;in clear breach of its election commitment to retain them. This government has made it even more difficult for unemployed people to take up or stay in education. This government has presided over job losses, not job creation, in its first 18 months in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This concept of mutual obligation is a very satisfying one for this government. It is satisfying because it places no obligations on the government. Mutual obligation is an arrangement between unemployed people and the community, and the government has no role to play. That is what this government seems to want. It is not going to add a training component to these work for the dole programs so that they might become proper labour market programs. The scheme will do nothing to reduce unemployment, as the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government itself has acknowledged. The member for Goldstein said in his second reading speech, `The so-called work for the dole initiative is not a solution to unemployment.' At least, I would say, he is honest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 10 February the Prime Minister described the same scheme `as part of the armoury of policies the government is employing to attack the problem of youth unemployment'. Well, we are waiting to set the rest of the armoury. But this scheme will not expand the total supply of jobs and could in fact reduce it by substituting unpaid for paid employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question facing us on this side of the House is: can the legislation be amended to overcome its worst deficiencies and even perhaps to contribute something positive to the lives of participants? We do believe that this is possible and shortly I will be moving a series of amendments to the bill when we consider it in detail to ensure that the government's work for the dole program provides unemployed people with the training and other assistance that they need and to ameliorate the worst aspects of the work for the dole scheme that we have before us&mdash;its compulsion, its removal of the protections afforded to every other worker in Australia and its removal of people's rights to appeal decisions that they think are unjust or inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our primary concern is that unemployed people, especially our young people, be provided with accredited training that they need to participate in today's labour market. We will be seeking to include a number of restraints on the secretary's power to approve a program of work for unemployment payment. What we will be wanting to do is turn this into a decent labour market program. We will be seeking to require that the secretary cannot approve a program unless he or she is satisfied that the program: does not displace existing workers; pays people for the hours they work at the relevant award rate; provides people with accredited training; allows people to take leave for education, training and employment opportunities, without any penalty; is funded to cover costs associated with
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4026"> supervision, materials, workers compensation, essential clothing, equipment and so on; and will run for at least six months, as has been promised. If these conditions can be satisfied, then it is our view that these programs are proper labour market programs, with all that that currently entails in the Social Security Act. It is reasonable to make it compulsory, to require people to participate in a labour market program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under a Labor government people were required to participate in proper labour market programs as a condition of fulfilling the requirements of the activity test and as an essential component of their newstart agreements. If these conditions are not met, then it is my view that it is unconscionable to make participation compulsory and to take away people's rights to appeal the processes of government. So we will be moving amendments to the bill to remove the compulsion and to give people rights to appeal. In either case, it is wrong to take away the protection that people have under workers compensation, occupational health and safety, superannuation and the workplace relations legislation protections, even though they are much reduced. We will also be moving amendments to restore the existing situation as far as those issues are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, let me give notice that we will be also moving to insert a sunset clause in this legislation. The member for Goldstein has acknowledged in his second reading speech that the scheme will be evaluated to assess its impact on young people `to assist consideration of expansion of the initiative beyond the pilot stage. A first report of the evaluation will provide a basis for discussion making in the 1998-99 budget.' The sunset clause that we will be seeking to move will ensure that the provision of the bill before us ceases to have effect on 30 June 1998, well after the program has finished and the government announces its intention.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the final speaker for the government, I will sum
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> up the debate and respond to some of the points that have been raised by the opposition. I think it is regrettable that they are unable to understand the real benefits of this measure as proposed by the government and that their energies seem to be going to be put into attempting to make this scheme another one of the labour market programs that they put into place when they were in office and which were such an abysmal failure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This scheme bears no relationship to the sorts of labour market programs that the Labor Party put in place. Let me assure the Australian people on this point: we are not about to establish schemes like new work opportunities, which cost the taxpayer $500 million, had a four per cent success rate, and cost $143,000 per net job. The government believes that the work for the dole program is going to have a very substantial positive benefit for the participants and the wider community. It is necessary because of the deeply entrenched unemployment problem which the Labor Party left Australia in after their 13 years in office. If anyone is responsible for unemployment it is, of course, the Labor Party, particularly because of its high tax policies, which destroyed small business. But of course it needed those taxes to fund its labour market programs, which failed to provide jobs for young people&mdash;indeed, for most of the participants&mdash;and proved to be such a cruel hoax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This initiative is based firmly on the principle of mutual obligation. Mutual obligation is a principle which states that it is fair and just that people receiving unemployment allowances be asked to make a contribution to the community in return. Believing that it is fairer and less demeaning for people to work for their money than to get it as a hand&hyphen;out is not prejudiced or punitive. It is part of the fabric of values that the Australian people share.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason why the Labor Party is not voting against this legislation is that it dare not vote against this legislation. I challenge the Labor Party to vote against this legislation, because it knows that the Australian people support this legislation. They believe that it is fair legislation. They believe that if somebody is being supported by the com
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4027"> munity, it is fair to ask them to put something back into that community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation will provide local communities and organisations around Australia with the opportunity to reach out to the unemployed people in those communities and put in place worthwhile community projects which will leave something of value to the community and which will also give something of value to the unemployed people who participate in them. That is what Australian people understand as mutual obligation. No amount of sophistry on the part of the opposition, particularly on the part of the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), will change that fact. The Australian people well understand what is being put forward by the government in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is being completely honest and open in its approach to the people of Australia. The previous government has gone from one position to another in relation to this legislation. It first of all opposed it outright. Then it said it would amend it to billyo. Then it said, `Well, what are you concerned about?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government did in fact have work for the dole programs. They introduced their work for the dole programs, such as they were, by stealth. They totally misled the Australian people in saying that their so-called job compact would provide Australians  with a real job when they meant nothing of the kind. They meant a fully subsidised job which lasted for six months which ended up as nothing. They dumped the people on those programs right back at the end of the unemployment queues. They were made to be fodder for the Labor Party as it tried to manipulate the unemployment statistics by spending all the money that small businesses needed to create real jobs. They preferred to create false jobs, fake jobs, to deceive unemployed people in order to protect their short&hyphen;term political interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Work for the dole is fair. The previous government's schemes such as the LEAP program made some young people work for less than the award rate. Yet we are hearing comments tonight which suggest that somehow or other we are paying less than the award rate. The member for Jagajaga clearly
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> does not understand when she refers to the national training wage rate that is going to be paid when she says that this rate was discounted in the national training wage for the one day's training provided in the course of the national training wage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government fully understands that, and the rates that will be paid under work for the dole have in fact been grossed up to take account of the training component. That has been increased by 20 per cent. So it is completely incorrect to say that the government is applying a wage in work for the dole which is based on completely different assumptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not one of the so-called training schemes that the Labor Party put in place&mdash;those short&hyphen;term, six&hyphen;month training schemes that did not provide training which led on to real jobs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is not a training scheme. We have never claimed that it was. In fact, unlike the opposition, we are completely open and honest about that fact. Work for the dole is designed to bring young people out of the isolation in which the failure of the policies of the previous government placed them, to give them some opportunity to contribute in a worthwhile way to their communities, to lift their self&hyphen;esteem and to rebuild their motivation. Of course we hope that, in achieving this, they will be better placed through the work experience they will receive through work for the dole to get employment at a later time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not making false promises to the participants in these programs. We will be saying to the communities who put forward projects for work for the dole funding that we want those projects to include an indication of what that community is prepared to do for unemployed people at the end of the project. We want there to be an understanding in communities that the participants of these projects should not be left to go back on to the unemployment queues but that something should be done for them. They should be helped to make contacts in the community and, where possible, they should be put in touch with those who can help them get a job.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4028">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been statements during the debate that `work for the dole' is a demeaning term. The member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin) said that `the term "dole" is fraught with negative connotations'. Let me say that the opposition has repeatedly referred to unemployment allowances as `the dole'. Those words are frequently heard from opposition lips, so let us not suggest that the words `the dole' are in any way demeaning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not go down the track which is so beloved of the Labor Party of self&hyphen;delusion and self&hyphen;deception. Unemployed people know exactly what is meant by `the dole'. That is what they call the unemployment allowances. They call it `the dole', and they understand exactly what the government is talking about here, even if the Labor Party would prefer, once again, to distort the situation. `Work for the dole' is a very easily understood term and it is a well&hyphen;understood term within the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite widespread support in the community, opponents of the work for the dole initiative have criticised the element of compulsion in the legislation. This is contrary, I have to say, to the view of the vast number of people in the community who do believe that it is fair that, if some members of a group are prepared to commit to a community based project, others in the same group who are receiving the same benefits can justifiably and  justly be asked to contribute and participate in that project. Participants will make a contribution to their own support and acknowledge the contribution being made by the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many communities around Australia are very keen to participate in this initiative. The government has been approached by many community organisations seeking information and putting to us proposals for projects under the work for the dole initiative. I have no doubt that, when this legislation is passed through the Senate, the government will have a major task before it in selecting the highest quality projects from amongst those which are put forward. That is a task that we look very much forward to performing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have made it clear that the government does not represent work for the dole as a solution to youth unemployment. Real jobs, as we know, can only be provided by a business environment that secures our economic future&mdash;by small businesses that are encouraged to take people on and employ them. Some speakers have based their comments on the mistaken belief that the initiative is about creating jobs and providing training, and it is not. However, it is&mdash;and it is accurately described as&mdash;part of the government's overall armoury against youth unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the previous government, this government is striking at the roots of youth unemployment and at the disadvantages that young people suffer. It is doing that by tackling for the first time the literacy and numeracy problems that young people face. We have made a commitment to provide all young Australians with those literacy and numeracy skills that the previous government failed so abysmally to provide them with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we know from the longitudinal studies available to the government&mdash;which also were available to the Labor Party when in office but never analysed by its members because they did not want to know the truth&mdash;at the end of Labor's 13 years in office, some 30 per cent of 14-year-olds could not read properly. Of course, that is one of the main criticisms of young people that unfortunately we hear from small business&mdash;that they simply do not have the skills that are needed to obtain those jobs. And they can blame the Labor Party for that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The government's armoury against youth unemployment includes, as I have stated, quality training. That was one of our commitments in the last election. It was a commitment made in response particularly to the enormous number of representations we had from young Australians who said, `Please, please, don't make us continue to go on this merry-go-round of Labor's short-term labour market schemes which lead us either nowhere and to demoralisation in the end. Give us quality training.' And, of course, that is what the government is committed to providing for young people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Work for the dole is particularly directed at those young people who have become isolated from their communities, who are not in apprenticeship or traineeship schemes, who are not in training and who are not in case management. These young people cannot be left simply without community support or community interest in their situation. Work for the dole will help to bring these young people back into their communities; to give them links with people in their communities who can help them; and to give them the sense of being able to make a worthwhile contribution to those communities by working on very solid community projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government was very pleased to see the results of the recent Morgan and Banks survey which showed that almost 60 per cent of employers surveyed by Morgan and Banks said that they would be more willing to hire someone who had worked for the dole than someone who had spent the same period just receiving unemployment benefits. In other words, it is the view of employers themselves that work for the dole participation will be of value to young people and will make those young people more employable.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is one of the fundamental reasons why this government and, I believe, the Australian community want to see work for the dole in place. I am quite sure that the community will take a very dim view of the efforts of the Labor Party to damage and destroy this legislation and to prevent young people getting the benefits that this legislation will confer upon them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aim of this legislation is to establish the framework necessary for implementation of the pilot work for the dole projects. In particular, the bill will amend the Social Security Act 1991 to enable a person to voluntarily participate in a program of work which has been approved by the employment secretary, or to be required to participate in such a program; to remove provisions precluding measures to require a person to work in return for the payment of the unemployment allowance; to provide for participation in an approved program of work to be included in newstart activity agreements, and provide for an approved program of work supplement of $20 per fortnight for participants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 will establish that participation in work for the dole will not give rise to an employer-employee relationship for the purposes of the federal jurisdiction. This does not mean, let me emphasise, that participants will be without coverage or protection. The alternative to workers' compensation coverage for participants will be provided through equivalent accident and indemnity insurance. Participants will be adequately covered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, despite the outrage expressed by the member for Jagajaga, this is also the course followed by the previous government in relation to its labour market programs. So let us not have any more of this hypocritical and feigned concern over the way in which the government will be dealing with this important aspect of work for the dole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Project sponsors will also be required to provide participants with a safe workplace. A person may only be required to participate in a work for the dole project if they are in receipt of full unemployment allowance and there is no risk to personal health or any
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4030"> contravention of occupational health and safety laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government envisages publicly seeking submissions across the whole of Australia. Regions with the highest levels of youth unemployment will be the focus of the pilots, with an emphasis on non-metropolitan regions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pilot work for the dole projects will be for a minimum duration of three months and a maximum duration of 12 months. They will be selected on the basis of criteria which will include the needs of the local young unemployed people; the capacity of the sponsor to monitor and maintain the project; the extent of contribution and support for the project from the local community; the quality of community involvement; and the preparedness of the community to support the participants after completion of their placement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A primary test will be the benefit of the project to the wider community. Projects approved will support new or additional activities that would not otherwise proceed. No existing workers will be displaced through this process. A committee, drawing on expertise independent of government, involving individuals who are well known in the community and committed to the success of the initiative, will be involved in the selection of projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aim is to have about 10,000 places in the pilot work for the dole projects with the first expected to start in October this year, if the bill is passed in this sitting. That is the requirement for getting these projects under way. If the bill is not passed in this sitting,  the real losers will be the unemployed young people who are being denied opportunities by the Labor Party; the party which is responsible for the entrenched level of youth unemployment which this country now has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We anticipate that the majority of the participants in the projects will be volunteers. The Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency, the CSDA, and the project sponsor will advertise the availability of projects. If the response from volunteers does not provide enough participants, the CSDA will identify and notify eligible participants that they will
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be referred and that their participation will be compulsory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is very proud to be putting this legislation forward. We believe this will be a very significant contribution to improving the opportunities for many long-term unemployed young people. We will evaluate and assess these projects in the light of experience when we make decisions about the extension of the work for the dole project.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The purpose of these opposition amendments is to turn this program into a proper labour market program. What we are seeking to do here is make sure that this work for the dole program satisfies the conditions that a proper labour market program should have: that it does not displace existing workers, that it pays people for the hours that they work at the relevant award rate, that it provides people with accredited training, that it allows people to take up education and training and employment opportunities without penalty, and that it is funded to cover costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we do not want to see is the suggestion that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) put in his concluding remarks when he said that `sponsors of work for the dole programs and the participants themselves would be making a contribution to the costs of the program.' I wonder if I could ask the minister: is it his intention to have people pay to participate in the work for the dole schemes?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Five days a week. And five flavours of ice cream at the staff canteen too&mdash;five flavours of ice cream or we shut down the job. Let me tell you about shutting down the job: that is exactly what happened with labour market programs. Give people a little bit of hope, tell them we will give them a little bit of training and we will give them a job. But what happens? A job does not materialise so the training results in another round of training, which results in another round of training and another round of training. That is a good labour market program, isn't it? That is a good labour market program, to train people for jobs that they will never be able to do, for jobs that do not exist, for jobs that the community does not need. That is really a great deal of help to the people!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it did was give them hope that there might be something at the end of the tunnel, but there was nothing. So the market labour program merry&hyphen;go&hyphen;round simply cost Australian taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars&mdash;ultimately billions of dollars&mdash;in wasted taxpayers' funds. It did absolutely nothing for the unemployed. In fact, if anything, to a large extent it destroyed their self&hyphen;confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the member for Jagajaga, through you Mr Deputy Speaker, that the work for the dole scheme is not a labour market program. It is not. Your amendments that seek to turn it into that are fraudulently flawed, as flawed
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4033"> as were the Working Nation attitudes which were supposed to solve all of Australia's unemployment problem. My view is that the statistics that we have today, in a sense, are partially reflecting the wind down of those programs because the attempt of the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) to massage the figures when he was the minister by pouring millions of dollars into quick fix programs in the run&hyphen;up to the last election&mdash;in order to get people off the dole queues and onto a so&hyphen;called labour market program; out of the queues and off the dole&mdash;means those people are now re&hyphen;emerging and attempting to find jobs because they know they need real jobs. Now they are out there trying to look for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real jobs will come. They will come because this government has the guts to do something about fixing up the economy, about reducing the debt, about giving business some confidence, about reducing interest rates while still holding inflation at a very low and sustainable level. It is taking time but these things do not happen instantly. They do not happen if you do not give encouragement to business to build sustainable jobs and to grow.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the eve of the last election, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said at the National Press Club that he would be a very disappointed man if he did not make an impact on reducing youth unemployment in his first term. But what a wasted year we
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have got. At the end of 12 months youth unemployment is two per cent higher.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the Prime Minister's solution to youth unemployment? What does he suggest? Work for the dole&mdash;a scheme that his very good friend, the Premier of Victoria, Mr Jeff Kennett, describes as crazy and irrelevant. I will tell you why the Premier of Victoria describes it as crazy and irrelevant: it offers no hope and no sense of security to those young people out there at the moment who are crying out for assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put it to this government that if it was really concerned about giving young people an opportunity in life, then we would not have a $21 million scheme that the government suggests will not lead to any real jobs over 12 months. More importantly, we would be debating this evening how this government could do something about lifting the apprenticeship rate that has fallen over the last 12 months, and how to restore the growth in traineeships to the levels achieved by the Labor Party prior to the election of March 12 months ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would be debating this evening restoring expenditure on vocational education and training that has been slashed by $269 million since the election of the Howard government in March 1996. More importantly, we would be discussing this evening how to restore to labour market expenditure the $2 billion that was slashed by the Howard government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real issue this evening is the lack of a sense of hope and security out there in the lives of young people and their families. It is about putting in place a reasonable proposition that says, `Yes, there is a reciprocal obligation. There are no benefits without the responsibility and the acceptance of the need by the Australian community to front up to their responsibilities.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what the amendments we are moving this evening are about. They are about a decent program that says, `Yes, you do have reciprocal obligations but, in return for those reciprocal obligations, we as a government will also front up to our obligations: that the scheme will not displace existing workers, that the scheme will guarantee appropriate training, that the scheme will guarantee an
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4034"> appropriate training wage, that the scheme will ensure that participants are allowed to accept a job without penalties, that the scheme will ensure that when these people go to these opportunities they will be protected at work&mdash;they will be given appropriate safety boots, they will be given workers compensation, they will be entitled to superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly, we should be debating this evening the government's overall economic strategy&mdash;a strategy that said 12 months ago that unemployment this week would be something of the order of 8.25 per cent. What level of unemployment do we have in Australia at the moment because of their economic strategy? It is at 8.7 per cent because of the government's economic strategy.</PARA>

The Commonwealth is undertaking to pay participants in the scheme at award rates for the hours that they work.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendments that are being proposed by the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) to this very flawed piece of legislation. We have canvassed here one of the most pressing economic and social problems facing Australia today, and that is unemployment. Yet all we have from the national government is a very tepid response to it. Having cut over $1.8 billion from labour market programs in its first budget, the Howard government has sought to introduce a poorly structured and inadequately resourced program which plays more to the redneck elements in our community who seek to blame the unemployed for the nation's ills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since coming to power, the Howard government has progressively dismantled the comprehensive labour market programs of the former Labor government. They now seek to put in the place of those programs a totally  inadequate response to this pressing problem. That is why the opposition is proposing this raft of amendments in its attempt to make substantial improvements to the legislation for the benefit of the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we reflect on the dimensions of Australia's unemployment problem and the government's response to it, which is embod
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ied in this particular piece of legislation, then one can understand the importance of the amendments that are being proposed by the member for Jagajaga. When John Howard as Treasurer in the previous Fraser government left power in 1983, he left Labor with an unemployment rate in excess of 10 per cent and an economy in negative growth, shedding hundreds of full-time jobs per day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor restored the economic health of Australia, breaking the back of inflation and engineering growth rates of around four per cent on average for its last four years in office. It did this at a time of unprecedented change in the structure of Australia's economy and massive changes in the global economy as well. It instituted a raft of labour market programs which attempted in a very real way to come to terms with the needs of the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Prime Minister, John Howard, came to power in 1996, he inherited an economy where inflation had been beaten, growth exceeded four per cent and job creation ran at an unprecedented rate. Yet in his very first budget and again in his second, the Prime Minister literally threw in the towel on the problem of unemployment. His government was quick to set a target for reducing the paper load for business, but he steadfastly refused, along with the minister at the dispatch box, to set a target for reductions in unemployment.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal Party is on about a very defeatist sense of reciprocation&mdash;the idea that the recipients in this scheme should reciprocate solely for the reason that they are receiving a certain amount of income support.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a couple of very relevant points that I want to make tonight in relation to these amendments. I assure the House that my comments are going to be very directly relevant to the amendments for one single reason, and that is that these amendments are attempting to turn this bill into something that is going to mean a lot more to the unemployed of this country than this current bill does.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have got some questions that I believe should be answered. Where will this program actually lead the unemployed whom it affects? What is at the end of that process for those people? I fear that it is not much, and that there will not be a job there for them. Where is the training that they are going to need? I heard the minister refer earlier to the program referring through to community do&hyphen;good programs, which are very good in themselves. I heard an earlier speaker tonight talk about the sorts of community contributions, the warm and fuzzy stuff, that he seems to think that some of our communities around this country are requiring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you think about that and when you think about the training that the minister has referred to when he says that these people are
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> going to get training, you note that they have talked about people visiting the lonely in a nursing home&mdash;that is a very admirable thing to do. They have talked about people going out and mowing lawns for those who cannot do it for themselves&mdash;again that is a very nice thing to do. They can go and clean up the streets in a suburb and they can plant trees. I do not quite understand what sort of training is going to be required for a young person to plant a tree. This is what we are talking about when we say we wish to amend this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are talking about training, Minister, be genuine and be sincere and really mean what you are saying. Young people and&mdash;because your bill excludes any age reference&mdash;middle&hyphen;aged, long&hyphen;term unemployed people as well are going to be affected by this bill. Similarly, there has been very little if any comment about the over&hyphen;24s age group in this debate today. I am pretty alarmed to think about&mdash;because you are going to do everything in your power to defeat these amendments&mdash;the training element, the necessary requirement for these young people and anyone else who happens to come under the guise of this bill. I am really worried about what they are going to have at the end of the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are trying to tell me that, at the end of the process, they are going to be trained in how to plant a tree to beautify a suburb or that they are going to be trained in how to talk to lonely people in nursing homes, I will say that all these things are admirable but they are not the sorts of things you should be making younger people, in particular, we assume, go out and do through the guise of this bill. There are other ways in which that can be done. These people should not be made to feel obligated because they are unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can assure the minister that every single young unemployed person who walks into my electorate office in Namadgi is not illiterate. They are very well trained. They are frustrated and they are angry because they want to get good, proper, sincere work and all they are seeing around them is the job base disappearing. They are seeing jobs disappear in front of their very eyes, and the minister is

I find this a pretty deplorable state of affairs&mdash;all the social comment that comes out of turning the blame downwards, of making our unemployed people feel guilty that they are in that position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can assure the minister that the young unemployed in my electorate are not feeling guilty. They are feeling angry and frustrated at the decimation of the employment base around them, the lack of additional training that is available to them and the fact that, in some cases, some of them are going to be compelled to go and do these rather strange duties to, in some way, make the rest of the community feel better about how their taxes are being spent. We have got to see that these amendments get through. I support them wholeheartedly. They are there for a very good reason. He who protests too much sometimes makes a flaw in his own argument. If I hear the minister say once more, `This is not a labour program like you had,' I will start to believe that maybe he thinks it should be.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendments moved by the shadow minister tonight and to oppose the legislation unless those amendments are carried. I think that the legislation before us is extremely damaging to the people of Australia. It sends exactly the wrong kind of message out. It says that the unemployed are to blame. It says that the government thinks that it is their fault that they are unemployed. It says the government thinks they are not making any useful contribution to society, and it says that the government would feel much more relaxed and comfortable if the young unemployed in particular were just out of sight and out of mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has said that most people cannot understand how someone can be receiving benefits and not making a contribution. It seems to me that the minister does not understand the current situation. The fact is  that, under the Labor government and under the Working Nation program, there were reciprocal obligations required of the unem
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ployed. The unemployment benefit recipients were already required to accept any reasonable job offers, including ones well below their skill levels and qualifications. They were required to participate in labour market, training or educational programs. They were required to maintain jobsearch activities which were monitored fortnightly. They were required not to move to any area with lower employment prospects, and they were required to travel up to an hour and a half to access employment opportunities. It is very convenient for the Howard government to overlook these obligations which were already placed on the unemployed in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation has nothing to do with genuinely improving the situation for people who are long&hyphen;term unemployed but has everything to do with window dressing, blaming the victim and inciting community prejudice against the unemployed. Since the election of the Howard government unemployment in my area, the inner west of Sydney, has increased by 58 per cent. With the budget brought down just two weeks ago, I think it will get worse. It is not just the opposition that is opposed to this legislation and it is not just the Premier of Victoria as has been stated previously. Community leaders across the board, such as the Reverend Ray Cleary, of the Melbourne City Mission, oppose it as do the Youth Policy and Action Coalition and community sector involvement activists from churches and community organisations. All understand this legislation is not the solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this government truly valued young people in our community it would be helping them to find real long&hyphen;term jobs, to access competency based training and to develop real skills that they can use to access future employment opportunities. This scheme does none of those things. Young people have a right&mdash;a right that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the people of his generation took for granted&mdash;to gain access to rewarding, secure and quality jobs that recognise the principle of equal pay for equal work. Even the business sector has recognised that this scheme does nothing to assist in reducing unemployment. At the same time that this
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4041"> legislation has been introduced, we have seen labour market assistance outlays decline from $2.2 billion this year to $1.9 billion in 1997&hyphen;98, slipping back further to $1.6 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was at a committee inquiry in recent weeks with the Reserve Bank Governor, and he called this kind of government focus on being seen to do something rather than actually doing anything `short&hyphen;termism'. The work for the dole scheme was prompted by just this kind of short&hyphen;term political view. It was prompted by polling&mdash;prompted by the view of Andrew Robb, the former Liberal Party director, instructing the Prime Minister that he must do something about unemployment. And it is no accident that it was at the time of the crisis surrounding the discredited member of the Lyons Forum, that great moral leader, Bob Woods. I think the bottom line is that this legislation does nothing to help the long&hyphen;term unemployed and, in particular, does nothing to help young people find real jobs in our community.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is unfortunately a real indictment of this government that the best they have in their arsenal to address one of the greatest problems Australia has&mdash;if not the greatest problem Australia has&mdash;is this work for the dole legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The program is not about reciprocating at all. Indeed, it is going to be extremely costly and extremely inefficient to run. What it is about is purely and simply scapegoating. It is about pointing the finger away from where the blame should rest. And the blame should rest very much right in the seat of those who sit opposite. They have taken over the reins of government and, whether they like it or not, they have a responsibility to address the problems facing this nation&mdash;facing the youth, the middle aged and, indeed, the senior workers of our population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) mentioned that long&hyphen;term unemployment is not only a predicament of the youth. For example for over&hyphen;55&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds, 50 per cent of those who are unemployed are long&hyphen;term unem ployed. This government does absolutely nothing for them. They have said, by their own admission&mdash;despite prevaricating when
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we were calling for some announcement of detail&mdash;that this policy applies only to 18&hyphen; to 24&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds. What are they going to achieve by this? They are going to achieve a situation where unemployed, unskilled 18&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds go into the program. What comes out at the other end are unskilled, unemployed 24&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds at the stage of their life when they are in a relationship and looking at establishing a permanent home and perhaps a family. What will the work for the dole program give them to get on with their life, to get on with their family and to get on with being an asset to Australia? Nothing. Absolutely nothing at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there are any bludgers, if there are any frauds in this equation, it is not the people whom the finger is being pointed at with this shameful title of `work for the dole'. The frauds and the bludgers are those who sit opposite, those who are sponging on the public's purse and not doing one single thing to get real jobs and real skills to the unemployed youth, middle aged and senior workers. They stand condemned for that. It is a completely and utterly shameful act. As the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) said, the more appropriate title is `the Bob Woods Memorial Bill'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation came out of a situation where the government was facing trauma. It came out of a situation where the Prime Minister sat on some information from September until March and, in incredible circumstances, denied that he had received the information. He knew he was under pressure. What did the pollsters tell him? What did Andrew Robb tell him? `The public out there', as the actress said to the bishop, `want you to do something.' What he did was look for scapegoats and the scapegoats are the unemployed&mdash;particularly the unemployed youth. They, of course, according to this government, are all going out tonight with their spray cans to  graffiti the buildings of Australia. They do not use deodorant when they get up in the morning, they do not shave and they need this program, according to the government, to make them employable. The fact of the matter is that they are none of that. They are decent kids, from decent families, who want to work. They want skills and they
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4042"> want opportunities. This government is not doing anything at all to give them any of those opportunities and they stand to be condemned as frauds and bludgers.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I will be very brief. These amendments come as a result of the government not being prepared to see the benefit of turning this scheme into a decent labour market program. What we are seeking to do with these amendments is remove the compulsion. As the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) himself has said, this should be a voluntary program; there are people who want to participate in it. If that is the view of the government then they should agree to these amendments and remove the compulsion from the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of the amendments ensures that people who participate in the scheme do have access to workers compensation and other protections. The minister in his earlier remarks said that people do have those protections. I would appreciate it if he could point out to me where in the bill those protections exist and where the money will be that guarantees that the government is going to pay for those protections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments 9 to 11 try to insert some decency into the legislation to ensure that we have some appeal rights for people if they find that they are required to undertake work for the dole programs that are totally unsuitable. Given the time, I will stop there.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not take up the time of the House for any length, but I do want to make it quite clear that I at no stage said that the scheme should be voluntary. I have said on quite a number of occasions that we anticipate that the majority of participants in the scheme will be voluntary.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendments proposed by the shadow minister but a moment ago. This side of the House certainly countenances the fact that the secretary's power to compel a person to participate in any work for the dole program as part of the requirements of the activity test ought not be supported. We are opposed to the notion of compulsion. We are opposed to the fact that a decent unemployed person, who day in, day out has been legitimately adhering to the requirements and the demands placed upon them by the CES and the department and the various schemes in governments, past and present, ought now be compelled through arm twisting, coercion, penalties&mdash;through whatever you might like to put on it&mdash;to participate in a work for the dole scheme. It is a scheme which the government, as one of its key pre-election promises, said that it would not introduce.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any notion of compulsion is heinous. It is contrary to the notion that an unemployed person ought legitimately and fairly be afforded the opportunity reasonably, openly and equitably to seek out and obtain work in their own space and their own time. Of course, the sorts of schemes that we had in place prior to March of last year afforded the opportunity to the unemployed not only to do that but also to be trained in meaningful ways while that was being undertaken, while meaningful job searches were part of their main goal in life and one of their key pursuits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also aware that one of the amendments suggested is that a secretary can compel a person to participate in the labour market program as part of the activity test. I say again that compulsion is contrary to the notion of fairness and equity which ought to underpin these same schemes. We also say that there should be no exemptions to the secretary's power to compel a person to participate in a work for the dole scheme under the so-called activity tests. Again, any notion of exemptions is contrary to the undertones of fairness and equity that we hold dear and in fact cherish as a key part and as a main plank of any such scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also believe that any such person who is subject to the possibility of a penalty
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> suffers unduly. Any penalty issued for the failure to either commence or to complete a work for the dole scheme is not something that this party will countenance. It is not something the opposition at any stage included as part of its platform and as part of its key labour market programs which had operated with such success up until March of last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of workers compensation, which the shadow minister has again alluded to, clearly any suggestion that those participating in labour market programs be exempt from the Commonwealth or any other relevant workers compensation scheme clearly flies in the face of fairness and equity. Those who are working for the dole or otherwise should have available to them reasonable, proper and equitable workers compensation arrangements which underpin industrial relations and awards right across this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand why the government is indeed so sensitive about this amendment and why they are indeed sensitive about all the amendments that we are proposing here this evening. They have simply misled people on these amendments, as they have misled people on work for the dole. They said prior to the election they would not do it. They are now seeking to do it. They ought to be ashamed of their performance. They ought to be ashamed of the fact that these programs offer no meaningful training and that they throw people out there at the mercy of the employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The killer punch in what may loosely be called a labour market program is this particular component of the work for the dole arrangement which I believe ought be rejected. It is a blight upon the government. They said they would not do it. It does nothing for the unemployed. It offers them nothing. It leaves them on the scrap heap with no workers compensation and facing penalties and the notion of compulsion. The amendments ought be supported.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to these amendments because, to my way of thinking, work for the dole flies in the face of a period of reform which was, up until the mid&hyphen;1980s, a passive labour market assistance program in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4045"> Australia. The system was introduced in 1945. Unemployment was then regarded as something of a short-term nature. It was only in the mid-1980s that the Australian community decided that we had to reform the system of labour market assistance in Australia, to turn it from a passive system into one based on an active approach to try to get people back to work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That, in turn, meant the government offering to particular sections of those who were unemployed programs tailored to their special needs. It was based on what was known as the reciprocal obligation. That in fact is reflected in the fact that we would like to amend this bill by actually incorporating that in the name of the new act&mdash;one based on reciprocal obligation. Yes, there would be a sense of compulsion, but in return for that compulsory requirement to front up to one's responsibilities there would be an investment by government into trying to get those people job ready and trying to get them back to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We oppose the bill as it currently stands because, yes, there is now a sense of compulsion reflected in the proposal by the government. What we do not find in the bill this evening is that reciprocal obligation from the government. It goes to the detail of the bill: no reciprocal obligation, a sense of decency and welfare reform, with respect to access to training; no reciprocal obligation when it comes to a person's entitlements when they front up to their obligation and undertake an employment program; and no reciprocal obligation when it comes to access and protection at work and workers compensation&mdash;an ability to purchase one's safety boots so as to ensure that, when you go to work, you go to work in the knowledge that there will be protection of one's health and safety while at work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are our concerns this evening. We are not opposed to decent labour market programs that give someone opportunity in life, irrespective of whether they are young or old, irrespective of whether they are indigenous people or people of a non-English speaking background. But compulsion must be based on investment. Getting people back to work
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is not a cost to government; it is an investment in the betterment of the Australian community. In return for that, we say to the government: you are wrong to basically now require these young people to front up for a program that will not lead to a real job, that will not offer them any training or real discipline based on two days on and five days off and that will not in essence make them attractive to employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is much concern in the community about this bill because it does not offer real opportunities&mdash;real opportunities not only to get people back to work but also to rebuild the suburbs. Unemployment is not uniform across the Australian community; it varies from region to region and suburb to suburb. Yes, the Australian community does expect people to front up to their responsibilities. But in return for people fronting up to that compulsory responsibility, it also expects the government to invest in getting them back to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We urge the government to rethink its approach. Yes, it might have the numbers in the House of Representatives. But it ought to think about the stigma it will impose on young unemployed people arising out of this bill&mdash;a compulsory requirement to front up, without any long-term opportunity. That is what it really is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These workers will be stigmatised when they front up for an employment interview in the future&mdash;`Yes, you're a person who compulsorily was required to front up to work for the dole. We understand that in fronting up you weren't offered any real training opportunities. You come to us on the basis that you had to front up two days on, five days off. You come to us on the basis that you haven't fronted up over a long extended period of six or 12 months and achieved a real discipline of work based on working five days on, like a normal worker, not two days on.' That is what it is really about&mdash;people really getting back into the discipline of work, based on access to decent training opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People are not opposed to those compulsory requirements. But the real problem with this scheme with its compulsory requirements is that it is a mickey mouse scheme that offers
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4046"> no hope to the community, no hope to the unemployed, no hope to their families&mdash;and in essence, as the Prime Minister has said, it will lead to no real jobs. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Amendments (13) and (15) seek to recognise that the government is still in two minds about whether or not the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill will actually help anybody. What the government has recognised in its budget is that it is going to provide only one year's worth of funding to this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of these amendments is to put a sunset clause in the bill. The government has already said that it will announce any ongoing policy following next year's budget. As we can see from this year's budget, only a very paltry amount of money is provided for this scheme. Therefore, I think it would be wise to see the end of it. The amendments that we have moved tonight would result in a sunset clause being put in the bill. It is very important that we have a sunset clause so that people will know that they will not have to put up with this scheme for any longer than they have to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment (14) seeks to change the object clause of the bill. What we have in the current bill before us which we are seeking to amend is an object which refers to mutual obligation. There has been a lot of talk tonight about mutual obligation in the consideration in detail stage. What Labor has to say about mutual obligation is that there is nothing in here about the government's obligation to unemployed people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing in this bill that says that the government will ensure that training and protection of workers will be available to make sure that it is a decent labour market program. What we are seeking to do is have an object clause that makes it clear that the bill sets out conditions under which a person receiving newstart allowance may be required to participate in a work for the dole program.</PARA>

These are the Productivity Commission's Automotive Case Study Micro Reform&mdash;A Survey of Impacts on Firms (1996) , and its recent Draft Report Entitled The Automotive Industry (1996).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both publications report that when labour productivity of car assemblers is measured using vehicles per employee, the industry produced, on average, ten vehicles per employee in 1986 compared with sixteen vehicles per employee in 1995. These figures appear to indicate that there has been a sixty per cent increase in labour productivity of car assemblers over this period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission reported on an alternative measure of labour productivity of Australian car assembly plants, based on the methodology employed by the International Motor Vehicle Program (IMVP). The IMVP measure is designed to benchmark international labour productivity. It estimates that on average, Australian car manufacturers took 40.9 labour hours to produce a standardised vehicle in 1988 compared with 35.5. hours in 1993. This represented a thirteen per cent improvement over this period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Productivity Commission's Draft Report provided an estimate of IMVP labour productivity for 1996 of 26 hours per standardised vehicle, but  it must be stressed that this an estimate based on the best information available to the Commission, and was not a figure produced by the IMVP itself. If this figure were accurate, it would indicate a thirty six per cent increase in labour productivity of Australian car producers since 1988.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Airports Corporation has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Airport Emergency Plan covers the response to an emergency on or in the vicinity of the airport.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The emergency exercise carried out on 5 June 1996 was a Tabletop exercise which was a precursor to the exercise carried out on 19 June 1996 which involved the testing of the welfare subplans.</PARA>

At the two field exercises (19/6/97 &amp; 18/9/96) the overall comments concluded that there was a vast improvement in command, control and coordination as opposed to previous exercises. The team work between organisations and the training commitment of all participating agencies was particularly evident.</PARA>

Consistent with Government policy, I look to the opportunity to use frequent flyer points to offset the cost of official travel wherever possible, and will continue to do so. The opportunity to redeem points, however, is restricted by the airlines' conditions, eg. not all flights have seats available for frequent flyer use, not all destinations can be reached using a specific carrier and their partner airlines, and there are `block out' periods by the airlines (peak times) when no seats are available.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. I am advised that the arrangements for dissemination by the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) of reports of suspicious transactions have recently been reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that before July 1996 AUSTRAC referred all reports of suspicious transactions of potential interest to the AFP, including reports relating to possible fraud offences by recipients of social security benefits. Those latter reports were also provided to the Australian Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since July 1996 revised procedures apply. I am advised that instead of cases being identified by AUSTRAC as of potential interest to the AFP, the AFP has two dedicated officers in each of the AFP's Regions. Those officers are able to peruse all reports of suspicious transactions relating to alleged criminality and request that those matters which are within their jurisdiction, of specific interest to the AFP and within the AFP's investigative priorities be formally referred to their Region by AUSTRAC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A request is made by those officers to the Director of AUSTRAC for dissemination of reports which those AFP officers identify as of particular operational interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that AFP officers rarely request AUSTRAC to refer reports of suspicious transactions concerning possible fraud offences by recipients of social security benefits. The AFP advises that while it would like to be able to investigate more of those matters, investigation resources are limited and the AFP must prioritise demands on its resources and determine the relative value of investigating particular reports of suspicious transactions in the context of other referrals and tasks it had been given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am also advised that AUSTRAC continues to refer reports which suggest possible fraud offences by recipients of social security benefits to the Australian Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In late 1996 the AFP's Southern Region, covering Victoria and Tasmania, requested AUSTRAC to refer to it automatically all reports of suspicious transactions indicating possible fraud offences by recipients of social security benefits in Victoria and Tasmania. At the end of January, following a review of that arrangement, AUSTRAC was asked to cease referring those reports of suspicious transactions automatically to the Southern Region. That decision was taken because investigative action could not be taken in relation to the possible
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> offences disclosed in the reports because of the AFP's competing priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. I am advised that the following numbers of reports of suspicious transactions relating to possible fraud by recipients of social security benefits were provided to the AFP in the stated years:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1990&mdash;824; 1991&mdash;l()32; 1992&mdash;788; 1993&mdash;225; 1994&mdash;459; 1995&mdash;427; 1996&mdash;339.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am also advised that despite the revised procedures introduced in July 1996, AUSTRAC has continued to refer to the AFP selected reports of suspicious transactions relating to possible fraud offences by recipients of social security benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Between 1 July 1996 and 17 March 1997 304 reports relating to possible fraud offences by recipients of social security benefits have been referred to the AFP. Four of those reports had also been specifically requested by the AFP after initial perusal of the reports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. The question of access to AUSTRAC data by the Department of Social Security was examined by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its November 1993 Report, Checking the Cash. The Committee recommended that the Department of Social Security not be given access to the information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that officers of the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Social Security discussed the matter of whether or not information obtained under the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 could be passed to the Department of Social Security. The issue of an administrative scheme whereby information from AUSTRAC indicating possible fraud offences by recipients of social security benefits could be released by the AFP to the Department of Social Security was considered and found not to be legally open.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Information obtained under the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 is sensitive and its collection is privacy intrusive. The information is intended for use only in major criminal investigations. For those reasons it is considered inappropriate for the Department of Social Security to be given access to such information for the purpose of investigating possibly minor fraud by recipients of social security benefits</PARA>

<ANSWER PAGE="4080" SPEAKER="Bishop, Bronwyn, MP" NAMEID="SE4" ELECTORATE="Mackellar" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Defence Industry, Science and Personnel" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Mrs Bishop</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Without the undue redirection of resources currently engaged in finalising the budget and implementing the Defence Reform Program which flows from the Defence Efficiency Review, it is not possible to establish what might be defined as the total or full costs of preventable workplace illness or injury within Defence. This could encompass the loss of expertise and increased recruitment and training. The direct cost of workplace illness and injury in the ADF, as measured by payments through the Military Compensation Scheme, is estimated at some $80m for 1996/97. This, however, does not include the cost of ADF health services and in&hyphen;service rehabilitation provided for compensable injuries and illnesses.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The direct cost of civilian workers' compensation and rehabilitation can be measured through the premium paid to Comcare Australia which in 1996/97 amounted to $20.3m.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ADF Health Services Redevelopment Project, due for initial implementation in 1998, will provide a better basis for identifying the treatment costs associated with specific workplace injuries and illnesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Military compensation is funded by the Department of Finance and notionally attributed to each of the single Service Programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Civilian workers' compensation is funded by Defence and the premium is paid annually to Comcare through the Budget and Management Program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Illness and injury in the ADF does not adversely affect the readiness of the ADF for operations. It is widely acknowledged that preventable illness has the potential to significantly impact upon military readiness and the conduct of operations. Non&hyphen;battle casualties have historically accounted for up to 90% of casualties incurred during allied military operations, such as the battle of the Kokoda Trail. The key to minimising non&hyphen;battle casualties is the application of appropriate preventive medicine strategies based upon timely and accurate health intelligence of the area of operations. The ADF has been particularly successful in this regard as is evidenced by the low non&hyphen;battle casualty rates amongst ADF troops deployed to Somalia, Cambodia and Rwanda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Realistic training is an essential element in maintaining ADF readiness and, as part of the health support planning for all major exercises and operations, a disease and environmental threat assessment and estimates of non&hyphen;battle casualties are prepared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Defence has a very strong safety ethos and the Chief of the Defence Force and the Secretary are both committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace for all Defence employees, military and civilian. While training in the ADF is, of necessity, essential and realistic and as such inherently carries a degree of risk, every effort is made to assess and minimise that risk. The ADF has an active health monitoring program coupled with a requirement for all members to maintain a specified level of fitness appropriate for their role.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4081">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The report of the Australian National Audit Office has not yet been finalised. The report from the Defence Efficiency Review was released by the Minister for Defence on 11 April 1997. The Review contains recommendations which will affect the provision of health services for the ADF, and the Defence&hyphen;wide management of occupational health and safety, workers' compensation and rehabilitation. Those recommendations are presently the subject of discussion within the Defence organisation and plans are expected to be finalised for implementation of the key recommendations on 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Defence has in place a coordinated strategy for minimising workplace illness and injury. In 1993 the single Service health staffs, and the single Service and civilian occupational health and safety policy groups, were integrated under the Surgeon General Australian Defence Force to facilitate this process. A decision was made in 1996 to further integrate the occupational health and safety, workers' compensation and rehabilitation policy functions to enhance this capability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) The potential for reducing costs by integrating policy staffs with responsibility for occupational health and safety, compensation and rehabilitation was identified in 1996 and will occur following the implementation of recommendations flowing from the Defence Efficiency Review.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (a) RAAF Williamtown does not have a catering contract. However, Serco does have a current contract to provide domestic services for cleaning, garbage removal and grass cutting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) (i) Catering at East Sale is one of eight components in the overall contract for support services at the Base, which has a contract price of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $5.9m per annum. The contract price, for the catering component only, is $1.4m, which does not include a component for administrative overheads. The actual expenditure for the first nine months of the contract from June 1996 to February 1997 inclusive, was $1.018m.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) 1 June 1996 to 31 May 2002. The Commonwealth has options to extend the contract for a maximum further four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) (i) The Commercial Support Program at Puckapunyal is for base support and covers functions such as grounds maintenance, security and cleaning as well as catering. The original total estimated contract commitment was $77.2m. The current estimated contract commitment is $87.03m, of which the actual costs for the catering activity was $2.5m in FY 1994/95,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">$4.3m FY 1995/96 and estimated at $2.8m for FY 1996/97. The fluctuations are a consequence of changes in dependency at the unit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) 15 March 1994 to 15 March 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) (i) The contract at the Australian Defence Force Academy is for approximately $4.9m per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) Initially the contract was from July 1993 to July 1997. It has since been extended to July 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Information relating to support services contracts for RAAF Sale, Puckapunyal and the Australian Defence Force Academy, regarding the statement of requirement, the request to quote, successful tenderer and contract value, has been published in the Commonwealth Purchasing and Disposal Gazette. I regret that further information relating to the commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence aspects of the contractor's price and delivery schedule, and staffing levels provided in competition with other tenderers, cannot be released.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Serco Gardner Merchant Pty Ltd was the successful tenderer for the RAAF Sale and Puckapunyal catering contracts, while Spotless Catering Services was the successful tenderer at the Australian Defence Force Academy. The Department of Defence is not aware of any labour market program subsidies provided to the company in respect of RAAF Sale or Puckapunyal. The contractor at the Australian Defence Force Academy utilised the `Jobstart Program' in November 1995.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr Warwick Smith</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes. In addition, the Traffic Oceania report has been reviewed by the Animals Committee of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). That Committee's report will be discussed at the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4093"> forthcoming CITES Conference of Parties in June 1997. In preparing for the Conference, Environment Australia has reviewed the Committee's report and is drafting an Australian position for my consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) No. However in drafting the Australian position for the forthcoming Conference of Parties, Environment Australia has consulted with officers in the Australian Fisheries Management Authority and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Yes. Environment Australia believes all fisheries should report total removals from the marine environment, including bycatch, to enable accurate and timely assessments of the impact of fishing on that environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Environment Australia believes that management of the Northern Australian shark fisheries is likely to.be improved through more research into the catch and biology of species involved. The Department is concerned that the research programs in all fisheries should involve analysis of catch and biology of species involved, and should be appropriate in terms of the species taken and the fishing methods employed. Providing there is sufficient similarity between the Southern and Northern Shark fisheries in this regard, the Department would support that recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) Yes. Environment Australia considers that it should be axiomatic that biological information be obtained from all species caught in commercial fisheries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) Yes. Environment Australia believes all commercial fisheries should be subject to clear management plans which contain bycatch monitoring and assessment, and explicit recognition of the need to ensure ecologically sustainable development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) Yes. The view of Environment Australia is that incidental catches, such as those in beach meshing programs, provide a valuable means of obtaining additional biological information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10) Yes. As a general rule Environment Australia supports partnership approaches to resource management. The approach used in the Southern Shark Fishery involves industry, scientists, conservation groups and managers working together to manage the fishery. I understand recent stock assessments have included direct industry input into the process, including attempts to include anecdotal information which arises from the fishers' experience.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(11) As a general rule Environment Australia supports the use of bycatch reduction devices in fisheries where there is a substantial bycatch. The
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Department would be concerned if the mandatory use of bycatch reduction devices should include those which are ineffective, or which cause greater environmental damage than unmitigated fishing.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) There has been no Commonwealth assessment of the environmental significance of the area. However, the Australian Heritage Commission received a nomination in 1994 that incorporates a portion of the Coomera Valley, as part of the Mount Tamborine Area nomination. The nomination includes a number of National Parks that are listed separately on the Register. As the nomination is within an area currently being assessed as part of the Queensland Comprehensive Regional Assessment/Regional Forest Agreement process, the Commission has not yet determined whether the nominated area or other forested parts of the Coomera Valley are of National Estate significance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) If the Commonwealth was to assist in acquiring the area, funding would come from the National Reserve System program. The National Reserve System program operates in partnership with the States and Territories and requires matching funding from the State/Territory government. The Commonwealth will consider assisting Queensland with acquisition of the area if the acquisition is supported by the Queensland Department of Environment. The Commonwealth relies on local expertise of the relevant State agency for assessment of proposals such as this one. The Queensland Department of Environment has advised that it does not support acquisition of Wongawallen, and matching State funds are not available, due to higher competing priorities for limited funds.</PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON></ANSWERS.TO.QUESTIONS></HANSARD>
