<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, you never had any will. That was the great difficulty on the other side of the House over the last 13 years. We all know the commitment of the Labor Party to low literacy standards because that was their record and it is the record they currently seek to defend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To ensure that every child in this country can read and write by grade 3, there are a number of critical steps which need to be taken. Firstly, there needs to be a clearing of the overcrowded curriculum in those early years of schooling to ensure that there is the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8158"> time for every young person who has difficulties in learning to read and write to do so. Secondly, there needs to be a thorough evaluation of the teaching methods which are used in schools to assess the effectiveness of different methods in teaching young people to read and write.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, there needs to be a clear recognition of the fact that standards currently are too low, and there needs to be a commitment to the national standard which was applied to the analysis of the English literacy survey. Finally, there needs to be quality information provided to parents and the community on the performance of schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is not alone in believing that steps of this kind are necessary. I would like to quote some important words to this effect. They are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first task of the education service must be to ensure that every child is taught to read and write. Literacy is crucial because it opens the door to success across all other subject areas.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was the Labour Party member for North Tyneside, the schools minister of Tony Blair in England. What the Blair government has committed itself to is the clearing of that primary curriculum to make way for one hour of literacy teaching each day in school.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Blair government has also determined that all primary schools must produce literacy action plans. The only people who seem not to have woken up to what is necessary are those in the Australian Labor Party. It is quite astonishing that the Leader of the Opposition could go over to England and learn nothing about what needs to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Labor Party show again and again that they are out of touch with Australian parents and out of touch with the Australian community. For far too long they have received their education policy in the post from the Australian Education Union. They have not listened to the concerns of parents. If there is any clearing out to be done on the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Labor side, it is not the primary curriculum which needs it but the Jurassic Park on the Labor Party frontbench.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HM5">Mr GEORGIOU</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Finance. Can the minister provide the House with details of the 1996&hyphen;97 budget outcome? What are the implications of this outcome for the Australian economy?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="8158" SPEAKER="Fahey, John, MP" NAMEID="HQ5" ELECTORATE="Macarthur" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Finance and Administration" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HQ5">Mr FAHEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his timely question. It is well known to the members of this House&mdash;and, for that matter, to the Australian public&mdash;that this government inherited a reprehensible budget deficit from the Beazley&hyphen;Keating government. Under Labor the 1995&hyphen;96 budget outcome showed a deficit of $10.3 billion. In our first full financial year of government we have reduced that deficit by more than half to less than $5 billion. The final budget outcome for 1995&hyphen;96 shows that the underlying deficit has reduced to $4.934 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said in this House on a number of occasions&mdash;and I believe the Australian people should be reminded of this time and time again&mdash;under Labor the general government debt increased from around $16 billion or four per cent of GDP in 1989&hyphen;90 to around $93 billion or nearly 20 per cent of GDP in 1995&hyphen;96. We have stopped that reckless extravagance and, as the OECD has projected, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8159"> over 1997 and 1998 Australia will have the third lowest public debt to GDP ratio in the OECD. By 2000&hyphen;2001 we will have reduced our debt by almost half, to what it was in 1995&hyphen;96.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Commonwealth outlays on public debt interest increased by only three per cent last financial year, compared to over 14 per cent in 1995&hyphen;96 and to an enormous 24 per cent in 1994&hyphen;95. Last year's result represents sound, responsible fiscal management, a far cry from the profligate and blatant fiscal mismanagement this country received under the Beazley and Keating governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a stunning turnaround, and we are not resting on our laurels. There will be a real reduction in outlays on public debt interest during the current financial year, and by 1998&hyphen;99 the government will be in a strong position to realise its expected underlying budget surplus&mdash;the first since 1990&hyphen;91.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By reducing our level of public debt, we are reducing the burden on future generations of Australians. As we continue to reduce outlays on public debt interest, the government will have more flexibility to adjust spending in more important areas of the budget, while still maintaining the strong fiscal stance so essential to the future prospects of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike our predecessors, we are not a government of big budget deficits, large public debt and taxation increases. Our strategy is based on getting the fundamentals right for strong, sustainable economic growth. Our fiscal consolidation effort is focused primarily on outlays. Underlying outlays will decline from 27 per cent of GDP in 1995&hyphen;96 to just under 23 per cent of GDP by 2000&hyphen;2001, the lowest percentage of GDP since 1973&hyphen;74. At the same time, we are raising national savings, providing a low interest rate, low inflation environment to encourage investment and raising productivity in Australian workplaces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget outcome for 1996&hyphen;97 is a good news story for all Australians. It demonstrates quite clearly that this is a responsible government. The budget outcome, as most commentators have acknowledged, sets the stage for long&hyphen;term and sustainable recovery of the economy after 13 years of Labor mismanagement.  </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, also on greenhouse gas emissions.

<ANSWER PAGE="8162" SPEAKER="Downer, Alexander, MP" NAMEID="4G4" ELECTORATE="Mayo" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Foreign Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question on this very important issue. As the honourable member points out in his question, the European Union has indeed put forward for the Kyoto conference a proposal of a reduction in greenhouse emissions between 1990 and 2010 of some 15 per cent. This is one of a wide range of different proposals which are being canvassed at the moment by almost all of the countries which will be party to the discussions in Kyoto. So at this point we are nowhere close to a consensus being achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, all countries recognise that something needs to be done, we included. We recognise, as I think a lot do, that we should make a contribution, and that contribution should be fair and it should be equitable. But it is well known that the proposal that Australia puts forward is a proposal for differentiated national targets. That is, what we are arguing is that Australia is prepared to make a contribution, but it is only prepared to make a fair and equitable contribution. We are not prepared to carry on our own shoulders a disproportionate burden to solve this problem, and other countries should not ask Australia to carry a disproportionate burden: to give up more jobs proportionately than they are prepared to give up; to give up more of our living standards than they are prepared to give up. To put it very simply, that is why we so strongly argue for differentiated national targets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concept of differentiation is supported by a number of countries, and the argument that people like the Deputy Leader of the Opposition use, that somehow we are embarrassed in our isolation&mdash;and I will come back to that&mdash;is simply not true. As far as the European Union is concerned, I am not aware of any country outside of the European Union supporting the proposals of the European Union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as differentiation is concerned, while different countries may have different views about how differentiation should work, the concept of differentiation is supported by countries such as Japan, Norway, Switzerland, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Iceland, South Korea, Singapore, Brazil and China. So it is quite a long list of countries that support differentiation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the European Union supports differentiation as well, but the European Union only supports differentiation for the European Union. If you are outside of the European Union it is not okay; if you are in the European Union it is. Portugal, according to the European Union's program, is able to increase its emissions by 40 per cent, whereas Luxembourg is to reduce its emissions by 30 per cent. That is the differentiation of the European Union, and its simple point is that if it is all right for the European Union it should be all right for the annex 1 countries as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia will work for a good outcome, but we will stand up for our national interest. That is one of the great differences between this side of the House and the other side of the House. The other side of the House, particularly on this issue, led by the words of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, believes that, if you disagree with other countries, you should fold up immediately and fall in line with them, because otherwise you will be embarrassed. We called our white paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In The National Interest</EMPHASIS>. The Labor Party would call its white paper, if ever it were to produce one&mdash;and it never has&mdash;`The White Flag'. As long as you keep everyone else happy, you have achieved your full objectives in international relations. But you haven't. The greatest responsibility in international relations is to stand up for the national interest, and we will stand up for our national interest on this greenhouse issue.</PARA>

Waterside workers are on a 35&hyphen;hour week&mdash;this is a real&hyphen;life example under the system you gave us&mdash;and have been for many years. However, unlike most industries they are paid during their tea and meal breaks, which reduces the time available to 31.25 hours a week.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for his question. The news in today's papers highlights the false claims being put out by the MUA, with the MUA being supported by the federal Labor opposition, because it was only as recently as yesterday that John Coombs, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> who runs the MUA, was claiming that waterfront productivity was increasing. `It's on the up,' says John Coombs. Yet here you have in the paper today a real live example where, in fact, things are going backwards. For example, in November last year the MUA negotiated a new enterprise bargaining agreement with Patricks for Melbourne's East Swanston dock. At that time the average lifts per hour were 15 TEUs, down from 22 lifts in July of that year. But despite the agreement, which was entered into to increase productivity, the average lifts are 20 per cent down on what they were before the agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you have the Labor Party and the MUA basically saying, `What is the problem?' You have John Coombs saying, `Things are on the up.' Yet, when you look behind it and actually look at the figures and the facts, the reality is the company has been losing productivity since the agreement was entered into&mdash;an agreement purporighted to be to improve productivity. All this is happening in the Patricks operation at a time when they have been pumping in something like $200 million worth of investment to improve the capital equipment available to do the job better in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor opposition says, `What are the problems? What are the reasons for this?' Of course, one of the reasons for this is that we have a very high level of industrial action on the waterfront. What are the reasons? If you look at the facts, the international group Shipowners Mutual Strike Insurance Association ranked the Australian waterside as No. 1 in terms of strikes in 1996&mdash;No. 1 in terms of strikes in 1996&mdash;and, what is most amazing, that is in a situation where Australia only accounts for 2 per cent of the world's shipping trade but nearly 23 per cent of all days lost due to industrial action.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly did see those comments. I also saw the comments of the Leader of the Opposition, who is quickly moving in to support the ACTU, as usual. The government's position is to provide for a system whereby the Industrial Relations Commission can provide for safety net wage increases. In fact, it was one of the commitments we made before the last election&mdash;that we have a system that is fair to people who are on low incomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8168">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the great things of the first 12 months or 18 months of this government is that we not only made that commitment to people but also legislated it. In the $10 a week wage increase that people got from the commission earlier this year, we delivered in full on the commitment that we made. I tell you what: those people have had a hell of a lot better deal now than they ever had under the previous Labor government&mdash;so much so that, for the 1997 June quarter, it amounted to a real increase of 2.4 per cent. How ashamed you must be that in 13 years you were never able to deliver as good a deal as we have been able to for people on low pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the government, I responded quickly last night to the ACTU's claim. I did so because these issues have been the subject of a lot of debate. They have also been subject to some comments by the Industrial Relations Commission in the safety net wage case that we had earlier this year&mdash;back in April or thereabouts. It is very interesting to hear what the commission itself said. On page 74&mdash;this is not the government talking; this is what the commission said about the application made by the ACTU&mdash;it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are significant risks in our view that such increases would&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They were increases referring to $12 to $15; the latest one is a $20 increase&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2) raise the growth rate of average weekly ordinary time earnings to a level inconsistent with the Reserve Bank's inflation target;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3) diminish the incentive for unions and employees to engage in bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On page 75, it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are seriously concerned that increases much in excess of that level&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Namely, the $8 a week proposed by the joint governments&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would jeopardise the achievement of that target, i.e., the Reserve Bank's inflation target, and cause increases in interest rates and consequential adverse effects on employment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As I understand it, the latest ACTU claim is to be different from that which was put in last year. We would need to look at the differ 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ences and obviously the economic circumstances changing as time moves on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot deny the basic fact: if you have very substantial increases which are not tied to productivity, the people who cop it, the people who are disadvantaged, are the very people that you claim to be supporting and concerned about&mdash;namely, the low paid. If we do not have a responsible economic decision on low paid workers, those who will suffer are the very people that the Labor Party and the ACTU claim to represent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts are very clear. The ACTU's new claim&mdash;it is an ambit claim&mdash;cannot be sustained economically. That claim, if it were successful, would jeopardise the jobs of Australia's lowest paid workers and act as a significant break on employment growth more generally, which just shows you the hypocrisy of the other side. They support this claim when they know that the effect of that claim would be to cost people jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It threatens the maintenance of Australia's low inflation rate, which has been a key to delivering significantly lower interest rates for the very people who again you claim to be concerned about. Of course, it would significantly impact on business and consumers. An increase of that magnitude would be a serious impediment to agreement making, which when you were in government you said, as we now say, is the way in which people can genuinely have the opportunity to do a deal at work, get the higher pay and the productivity to go with it so the thing can be sustained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it was grossly irresponsible of the federal opposition to so quickly fall in line with the ACTU. This is not to the advantage of low income people; this is to the detriment of low income people. Even the New South Wales Labor government, when these matters were before the commission earlier this year, refused to go along with the ACTU claim last time. I think if you were genuine about concern for the disadvantaged in our society, you would reflect again on the position that you have already taken.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The mask of reasonableness that has been hiding the real agenda of the government on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8174"> industrial relations has finally slipped. The approach by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) and the government's industrial relations approach has been revealed. Those of us who have been studying it closely have always known what was going on, but it is now apparent to the public. It is starting to be reported and commented upon. What are they seeing? They are seeing a very partisan approach and they are seeing an approach focused on confrontation, not cooperation. It is an approach that is an abrogation of the proper responsibilities of government to pursue national, rather than narrow, sectional interests. What is more, it is an approach that is failing, even by its own miserable standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, we all say that our opposition is the worst since Federation. I said the other day that this minister is the most partisan minister in Australia's history. Is this an unreasonable claim? Let us have a look at what is being said about it by others. One of the advantages of staying back until 10.30 p.m. when the parliament sits late is that you get to see the late night news. I saw the minister being interviewed by Paul Lyneham last night. How did he start? He started off by referring to the minister as `partisan Pete'. I have to say that there is a very good reason why he did&mdash;because most Australians are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also had the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> this morning saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is becoming increasingly clear that the Government is bent on confrontation. Why else would it be urging Rio Tinto to sue the coal mining union for damages over the strikebound Hunter Valley mine?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We had the comments of the minister's co&hyphen;conspirator, Senator Kernot, in the passage of the Workplace Relations Act. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I see them&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the government and the comments in particular by this minister&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as playing a particularly partisan role and I think it is not in the national interest to say to unions and employees "go at it for as long as you like; slug it out, it doesn't matter what happens in Australia because this is about the workplace and employers and employees". 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She then went on to say that she did not think that is what the minister said to her when they were negotiating the Workplace Relations Act. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I think we are in a war of attrition between both sides . . . We shouldn't be back in the 80s with this "slug&hyphen;it&hyphen;out" approach to arbitration and union matters.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She continued by saying that she thinks the government and the comments of the current minister have been `particularly partisan'. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's one thing for a Government to intervene, it's another thing to actually get in there and say to employers "take em on, we've put an Act in place, test it and we'll help you all the way". Governments should be about facilitating co&hyphen;operative workplaces.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The best part about it from our point of view is that every time the minister gets up to deny his partisanship, he reinforces it absolutely. He gets up and says, `No, I haven't been partisan,' and starts to cite all the times in which the previous government might have intervened on behalf of unions and on behalf of working people in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He does that very selectively, because when we were the government, there were a substantial number of balanced representations made. But if the allegation is that we have a propensity to support workers and they have a propensity to support employers, I plead absolutely guilty. If it is a question of whether the role of the Labor Party in government was a balanced, responsible role in industrial relations for 13 years, I think that unquestionably it was. There is no doubt about it, and the Australian people made their judgment time and again, and I am happy to say that they are continuing to make that judgment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what we find now is the circumstance where they are saying, `We are partisan in the Hunter Valley No. 1 dispute because we are calling for arbitration. It is not us who are saying that the CFMEU's claims should be adopted. We are saying that there should be arbitration. Nobody will win everything that they want.' This minister is saying, `The simple solution is that the workers should just accept the employer's offer. Why doesn't one side give in, then the problem will be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8175"> solved?' That is not the proper role of a minister for industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a bad role for an advocate for an employer. It is what they are expected to go in and do in public and in the Industrial Relations Commission on behalf of their client. On behalf of Rio Tinto, any paid advocate would say, `The best solution is to accept the employer's offer.' I am sure that is what their barrister has said. But why is it that the minister for workplace relations is saying it for them and why is he is sending their advocate in to say it on their behalf?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They go into the commission and argue exactly the same case as Rio Tinto and expect us all to say, `Oh, it's just a coincidence. We did speak to them on the phone a lot. We rang them several times. We had a lot of discussions. But the fact that we came to the same conclusion is a coincidence. It is an absolute fluke. Fancy that! Rio Tinto came in and said the same as us. What a surprise! It may be that they helped us write the act. It may be that they donated to the election. It may be that they are the only people who will take up this absurd proposition of ours, so we have to support them. But it is a coincidence that we are saying the same thing. We didn't cooperate at all. I just rang them to tell them that if they looked at their fax machine, a press release might have come off it.' That is like ringing up the chairman of Freeport in America to ask him how he is feeling.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are now finding that this partisan position is not just that the minister is opposed to every claim by every union and every worker in Australia; he is opposed to companies that have the temerity to seek to use those parts of the Workplace Relations Act that emphasise cooperation with workers and unions. What a terrible thing! We saw what the stevedores have been saying about him this morning.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Mr McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Put up or shut up, they said. They also said, `You're all about creating noise but you're not achieving anything.' We had him on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>  last week attacking BHP because they had not been tough enough. This week what we find is that there are a lot of coalmining companies seeking reform in the coalmining industry, as they sensibly should.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of them are this week going to have a meeting with the CFMEU in Brisbane to seek to negotiate major changes. They are demanding a lot from the CFMEU and they will not be satisfied with simply being fobbed off. It is a big, tough negotiating session with BHP and the other major coalmining companies. Do we hear a word of support for that proposal from this government? No. All it is saying is that BHP has not been tough enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One company is out there not pursuing that approach but seeking confrontation, refusing arbitration, not coming to an agreement and threatening to sue its own employees. That is the one for which this minister gets out there and says, `More of it; get stuck into them.' He needs one of those little rattles so that he can stand on the side and wave it like the supporters at the British soccer&mdash;wave his scarf and rattle and come out in support of Rio Tinto with his unqualified, undying devotion to their cause.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8176">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those other companies are also operating within the Workplace Relations Act. The unions negotiating with them are working within the Workplace Relations Act. Minister, they also deserve your support. These are Australians trying to work together to achieve reform&mdash;they are not seeking confrontation; they are not seeking to attack each other but are seeking to work together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You say that you will support people who use the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act, but you only support the ones that use the bits you prefer. You say, `It is a one size fits all approach. Everybody has to go my way and I will support you.' If a company has the temerity to say, `We think we can achieve the major reforms we need in a cooperative manner by working with our employees and their representatives,' what they get from this government is condemnation, attack and criticism&mdash;and, in the case of BHP, I suspect, at the moment, it is pretty unwelcome criticism at this time in their corporate history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen in the headlines the confrontations between the government's approach to industrial relations and the people it has been able to crank up to be its advocates and some of the strongest unions in this country. Those headlines are there because those are the people who have the strength to resist. What you do not see is what is happening to the weakest employees, the employees not in a strong bargaining position, who do not have such strong unions to represent them and who are confronting these same changes without a strong voice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people do not get any publicity. They are just being rolled over. We all see them in our electorates&mdash;the young people going out to their first job being told, `Just work for a couple of days for nothing on training and we'll see how you work out.' After they get sacked, another one comes on and just works for a couple of days. In one particular workplace in my electorate one of those young people happened to be a member of the shop assistants union. She got $200 back pay. That is a sign of what has happened to all the others that nobody spoke up for. That is how much they all lost. There is no publicity about 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that because there is nobody speaking for those people. They are the ones that need the support of the arbitration system. They are the ones that need the support of a cooperative industrial relations system. I might say that they are also the ones that need a strong outcome by the Industrial Relations Commission from the latest living wage claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what do we have now? The end of the cooperative era in industrial relations has now unfortunately been seen. We have had cooperation derided, arbitration attacked. We have the promotion, the encouragement, the active seeking of confrontation. He is ringing people up in America and Jakarta saying, `Isn't there somebody out there prepared to have a fight?' He is like a promoter without a boxer ringing everybody up saying, `Who is it that is going to turn up? I've an opponent for you, won't someone hop into the ring?' He has had only a very mild change from the role he was playing before, strolling around the Australian industrial relations scene like a pocket Maggie Thatcher looking for an Arthur Scargill to fight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But why won't the employers hop into the ring? Because they have sensible obligations and responsibilities to their shareholders. If they choose to seek reform cooperatively without closing down their workplaces, if they keep the coalmine operating whilst negotiating for change, they deserve the government's support. The Australian people deserve a better industrial relations system than the Americanisation of Australian industrial relations we have experienced in Australia in this last 18 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have all seen the terrible stories and seen&mdash;those of us who had the opportunity to be there in the United States&mdash;at first-hand the consequences. This year I visited a workplace where the workers had been on strike for five years and there was no mechanism to resolve the dispute. Is that the future we want to see for Australian industrial relations? Do we want to see the government's advocate going before the Industrial Relations Commission and saying, `If this dispute goes on and on as a intractable dispute, well, so be it.' That is the government's position.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8177">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) asked a very intelligent question precisely quoting the relevant section of the Workplace Relations Act&mdash;the section that your advocate came in and tried to define away; and he quoted it precisely, word for word.

Well, why don't you have a look at it and answer the question he asked you about why you did not support arbitration in that dispute?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This cooperative partisan way is not the Australian way; it is not good for our society; it is not good for our economy; and it is not working.

As we have seen in the last week, the thing he cannot do is distinguish between the national interest and the Labor Party's parliamentary interest in being tied up to the MUA. It is incredible that you have yet to publicly understand and support the need for increased reform on the waterfront in this country. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reason you fail to do so is that the MUA has the ACTU tied up, and the ACTU have you tied up. Yet most rank and file workers out there would be absolutely ashamed of and embarrassed by the rorts, the lurks and the perks which are enjoyed today by the MUA, which you are supporting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister started with his stunning attack on the partisanship of this government! That is absolutely laughable. Do you have a memory blank prior to March 1996?

In its operation of the act, the previous government, on behalf of the ACTU and of any union which had donated to Labor Party funds, made appearances in the Industrial Relations Commission on a weekly basis, virtually.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These are the people you support: people who have set out to deliberately sabotage the operation of this company and to jeopardise the jobs of thousands of people who ultimately rely on Australia having an efficient waterfront.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the same at Rio Tinto. At the start of last week Tony Marr, who is the 2IC in the CFMEU said publicly&mdash;and it has been reported&mdash;that the intention of the union was to grind the company into the dust. And you support them! You claim we are being partisan when we say, `What needs to happen here is for people to focus on what needs to be done to run this particular operation more efficiently.' What we need is a system where people are responsible for managing their own affairs to improve the productivity of that particular mine or, in the case of the Cairns waterfront, to improve the productivity of that operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> said just the other day on this very issue of whether or not there should be arbitration:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Criticism that the Workplace Relations Act did not go far enough in deregulating the labour market, or that it was emasculated by the Senate, has tended to obscure the culture shift in industrial relations that the legislation is beginning to forge.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government insisted on this reduction in the emphasis on arbitration in order to force employers and employees' parties to engage in enterprise bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It concluded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Justice Boulton, after hearing all the parties, has decided that they should be left further to battle it out. This was the appropriate response. This is not the sort of industrial dispute where a union has asked for an unrealistic amount and an employer has responded with a negligible offer.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As it then concludes, the workers in that particular mine have been offered an extra $170 a week. These workers are being asked to sign off on a deal where their annual salary is $84,000 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most Australians would give their right arm to have a job like that. Look at Cairns, where you are supporting the wharfies. Look at the Queensland ports. Most Australians, when they get a job, expect that in the average year&mdash;52 weeks&mdash;they will have four weeks annual leave and they will work the balance: 48 weeks. If you are a wharfie on a Queensland port, of those 52 weeks, how many weeks do you reckon you are not working? It is four for everybody else. How many for them? They have 17 weeks off! And the rorters' supporters over here are attacking us for pointing out the inefficiencies on the Australian waterfront. It is absolutely incredible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Someone said to us, `Why don't you sit down and have discussions with the wharfies union about what's going on on the waterfront?' The truth is that we have sat down with the wharfies and talked to them about what is going on on the waterfront. It was said to John Coombs, during our discussion with him and his other officials from the union, `Why is it that we have "the nick" on the waterfront in Australia today?' He looked me in the eye and said, `We don't have "the nick"&mdash;that's history.' Two weeks ago, on Channel 9 on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> they had a camera outside a stevedoring operation and we saw 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8179"> people who were nicking off and going home and being paid to be at home. `The nick' is alive and well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Who is the second speaker? Are you the second speaker? Let me challenge you to stand up, after I sit down, and oppose the operation of `the nick' on the Australian waterfront. People say, `Why don't you talk?' We have talked to these people; we have looked them in the eye and they deny it. And there it is, for all to see, on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS>  two weeks ago. You talk to them about the level of productivity in Australian ports and you say, `Why can't we have ports that are as efficient as anybody else's?', and they say, `But they are. They really are. They're just as efficient as anybody else's.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We get official reports that show that the operation of Australian ports or stevedoring operations are not much more efficient than Mozambique's and the MUA is saying, `No, things are okay.' I think it is a fair comment to say, `Why can't Australia have ports which are as efficient as New Zealand's?' Does anybody say that's not a fair proposition? Who says that it is not a fair proposition?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had some work done to compare Australia with New Zealand. They have had significant reform in New Zealand. The BIE reported in 1995 that New Zealand's ports were handling just as much cargo as in 1988 but with half the work force, and that was after the two major reform efforts in 1989 and 1991. Examples of the productivity improvements include the case of the port of Tauranga where the volume of logs loaded per gang per hour increased from 70&hyphen;80 cubic metres to 110 cubic metres while gang sizes fell from 10.5 to six persons, resulting in a labour productivity increase of about 150 per cent. If they can do that in New Zealand, I reckon we should be able to do it here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are reports by both ANL and P&amp;O New Zealand of an estimated 30 per cent productivity improvement between 1989 and 1991. I say that if the New Zealanders are smart enough to do it, I reckon we should be smart enough to be able to do it. Turnaround times for ships at Tauranga were reduced 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from 10 days to 3&half; days, and a gang of six men can now load an 18,000&hyphen;tonne vessel of logs within 24 hours as against five to six days with a gang of 11 before the reforms. They can do it. Our people can do it but they do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is like the situation in the port of Cairns the other day. As people appreciate, there was a dispute about the operations of the port of Cairns and the deal was done and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Java Sea</EMPHASIS> sailed into the port of Cairns and the work was done by union labour. It was interesting that those blokes unloaded that ship like it had never been unloaded before.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it just shows you what can be done. That ship has got two cranes on it and the rule always was one gang per crane. But, I tell you what, when they unloaded this week, they had two cranes going but only one gang to service it. We have known for years that the port of Cairns is overmanned and Bob Collins, your Labor parliamentary senator, has said so in the Senate back in 1990 or 1991. It is not me saying it; it is the Labor Party saying it and yet you are claiming that we are partisan for simply calling for greater efficiencies which you yourself supported five or six years ago. It is laughable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Go back to the comparisons with New Zealand when it comes to cost. The Bureau of Transport and Communication Economics made a comparison of stevedoring charges and ship handling rates for Australian and New Zealand ports in 1995 using the same companies and same ships at each port. Using an index whereby Sydney was 100, the report in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waterline</EMPHASIS> found that stevedoring charges in Melbourne were in the 96&hyphen;102 range. By contrast, Auckland was 51&hyphen;87, Wellington 59&hyphen;81 and Lyttelton 60&hyphen;75&mdash;significantly lower than the Melbourne port. In Melbourne, the ship handling rate, which is an indicator of the speed of loading and unloading, was in the 96&hyphen;124 range whereas in Auckland it was in the 112&hyphen;190 range and in Wellington it was 126&hyphen;145.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One thing that you can say about the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) is that we have heard it all before. From his opening line to his closing line, it had a certain sameness about it. We can call him predictable, pusillanimous, partisan Pete from the penthouse, operating at his mediocre best. He is a man who can best be described as out of touch with modern Australian industrial relations. His laconic ramblings are the same as we have come to know and reject in this House, no matter what the topic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a man who acts primarily and partisanly in the sectoral interests of Australia's most militant companies, a man who tries to goad those who are too smart to be militant into using his heinous Workplace Relations Act to fight on his behalf. But those employers will not do it. Those employers are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> indeed too smart to do it, because they know that he is a man who cowers behind waterfront employers as he tries to entice them into the ring to take on a fight that they know there is no need to have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those same waterfront employers, like P&amp;O, like Patricks, doubt the commitment of the government to lend its full support if it did come to a major waterfront confrontation, which they do not want anyway. In short, they know that the government lacks the intestinal fortitude, the wherewithal and indeed the guts to pursue it. We on this side condemn the minister for his partisan approach to industrial relations at the Cairns waterfront and other places.</PARA>

He left that dispute high and dry in the same way as he has just left the chamber. At a time when he should have been acting, he was probably at home in the penthouse, tucked up with a bottle of Grange, reading <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gone with the Wind</EMPHASIS> . That is the story of his Workplace Relations Act, which has indeed gone with the wind.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Who paid for the Grange? Hudson Conway?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YK6">Mr WILTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no doubt that Hudson Conway paid for the Grange. He would be looking for an early night, I am sure, tucked up in the penthouse, before rising in the wee small hours, no doubt, to ring some poor redneck employer to try and coerce him or her into battle. As the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) interjected yesterday and again earlier today, that would be a nightmare for any such redneck employer. This man opposite was elected to act in the national interest, not for partisan interest, standing at ringside cheering on aggressive employers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He indicated to us that this side of the House was partisan. This side of the House operated, in industrial relations terms, under 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8181"> what was then called the prices and incomes accord&mdash;an accord which dealt this country a low interest rate, low inflation regime in the interest of all of us, following massive worker restraint, which has developed an economy which those opposite are now claiming credit for. That economy created in the interest of all of us was created by the activities and the restraint of workers. We were acting in the interest of all Australians. There was nothing partisan about this side of the House, but there was about those on that side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two weeks ago, before he did a bellyflop, with pike, off the end of the Cairns wharf, he was cheering an employer which at that time had effectively sacked 27 workers because they were members of a union and because they saw a legitimate need to act collectively if they had to. Not that they have acted so for some 23 years, because, by and large the Cairns waterfront, as the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) would know, has been free from industrial action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a minister of the Crown, a representative of the Australian people, to act in this improper and inappropriate manner is irresponsible in the extreme. Of course companies want improved productivity. I want improved productivity. Which company does not want improved productivity? But waterfront companies and others know that the Workplace Relations Act does not provide the proper consultative framework around which significant waterfront reforms can be generated. I know that I would much prefer a consensus approach, as under the former government's Industrial Relations Act, and I would hope that such a process could continue to be delivered in the same way under this government as it was so successfully under the last government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I quote Mr Richard Hine, Managing Director of P&amp;O Ports, who stated that the framework I have just described is simply not there. His counterpart, Chris Corrigan, Chief Executive of Patricks, has described the government's approach as blase and unrealistic&mdash;a damning indictment of all that the minister represents and all that those who sit around him represent.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only has this government lost the battle in the eyes of both workers and employers and indeed the Australian electorate, not only has it lost credibility, but it has also lost the propaganda war. Australian ports have crane rates of something like 17 to 22 containers per hour, not far behind large, multibillion dollar ports like Singapore, which has a crane rate of 23 or 24 containers an hour. The figures that the government has been bandying around by and large are those from 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will take the time to dispel some of the myths perpetuated by those opposite. Mr Andy Andrews is the manager of Australia's top terminal, Sealand Adelaide&mdash;not, I am sure, one who the minister could add to his list of employers he is trying to push into the ring. I am sure Andrews would resist in the same way that P&amp;O and Patricks had resisted. Mr Andrews has recently said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sealand Adelaide has productivity rates on a par with any mid&hyphen;ranking world port. Its crane rate for the June quarter was 21 containers per crane per hour. That is two above Auckland, and also only two below one of the world's top ports, Singapore, at 23 boxes per hour. This crane rate is a seven per cent improvement on last quarter and 21 per cent up from June in the 1996 quarter.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is very important to note that productivity can be measured in terms of container lifts, TEUs, ship rates or turnaround rates. That needs to be understood. The container rate is lower than the TEU rate. TEU stands for twenty&hyphen;foot equivalent units. Some containers are 40 foot long or longer. A 40&hyphen;foot container equals two TEUs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, when the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, John Sharp, announced on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program earlier this year that Australian ports were grossly inefficient because we had a crane rate of 17 compared to overseas port rates of 50 or 60, he was comparing the box rate here, that is, the 20&hyphen;foot rate, with TEU rates overseas.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8182"> quarter of 1996. This is only a 1.4 per cent increase and has formed the basis of the government's latest propaganda campaign. What they do not tell you is that this figure is still a five per cent increase on the March 1996 figures and a 19.5 per cent increase on the March 1992 figures. What they are being especially tight&hyphen;lipped about is that since this time productivity has jumped more than 10 per cent in the ports where new enterprise and productivity agreements have been negotiated.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will conclude by making just a few brief points about the Hunter Valley dispute. Indeed, that particular dispute does not go to the question of wages or conditions. It goes to the question of an employer that has had a long history since the Franco regime in 1937, when its managing director told a meeting of Rio Tinto shareholders in Spain that year that the workers would be quashed under Franco's, Mussolini's and Hitler's fascist regime, which would be to the benefit of the company.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot has been said about the Cairns situation and that unpleasant incident recently on the wharves.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It needs to be understood that there is a lot at stake here. We are talking about a few individuals who were complaining that they were going to lose their jobs, but International Purveyors moves over $100 million dollars worth of goods through Cairns. There has been a real concern, and I will quote our local chamber of commerce. They said that there has always been a concern that at some stage they are going to move their supply depot from Cairns. It could go to Darwin, Singapore or even the United States. They said they were constantly in competition and hoped that this move&mdash;and we are talking about Interna

Guess what the average Cairns wharf worker earns? He earns $62,000 a year&mdash;and that is for three days work a week. Is that a fair go? Talk to our people who work five, six and more days a week for $33,075.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give you some examples. We have heard some in the House recently but you have to repeat some of these; there are a couple of other ones there that I think need to go onto the record. First of all, for a day shift your average wharfie gets $33.32 an hour, for the evening shift they get $46.32 an hour and for the midnight shift they get $60.36 an hour. It increases for Sundays, public holidays, et cetera. Then there is another interesting one they call the `close day'. For a close day they get $102.57 an hour plus an extra annual day's leave whenever they work it. I will explain what a close day is in a moment&mdash;it is a little beauty. I might add that we are talking about grade 3 waterside workers. They are classified as semi&hyphen;skilled. A supervisor at the same port would earn upwards of $136,000 a year. So I can assure you we are in the wrong occupation&mdash;there is no question about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister mentioned earlier on the number of days off that they have: the five weeks annual leave, et cetera. They have 17 weeks a year when they can be absent on full pay. He did not say that they have a 27.5 per cent annual leave loading and a 27.5 per cent 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> long service leave loading too. We heard the other day about the Akubra hats for them to sit on top of their hard hats. We also heard about the wellington boots and the safety boots and the trousers and the shirts and the overalls&mdash;even towels for showering and a nylon bag to carry it all in. With all of that, of course, there are expenses. So every man receives a laundry allowance of $13.90 a week. But the overalls are different; they are provided at work and so they are laundered by the company. I mean, we have to take care of that as well!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the more interesting ones which I mentioned before is the close day. A closed public holiday, for the information of the House, is called a `wharfies' picnic day'. Under the award they are entitled to five per year&mdash;in Cairns, too! It is not a bad effort really when you think about it. And you wonder why people start to get a little bit concerned and a little bit perturbed, particularly people living out in the bush who are making a living out of trying to grow something that they are going to export and who then find that they cannot get anywhere near the prices that they want or they cannot sell their products for export because of the anti&hyphen;competitive nature of our wharves, which are held up really by just a few greedy and unreasonable individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was an interesting comment in the paper which I think is very appropriate. It was an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cairns Post</EMPHASIS> recently where they expressed extreme disappointment at the fact that they were not able to sustain the non&hyphen;union labour on the wharves. There was a real hope within the community that we would have been able to sustain that and get some productivity in there because while we are talking about one Freeport supply ship&mdash;or two every three weeks we get in there&mdash;the Chamber of Commerce has been working very hard on a number of other companies to try and get supply bases out of Cairns. We are very much reliant on the tourism industry. We desperately need other business. But while we have these restrictions on the wharves it is going to be very hard to be competitive. This was the disappointment 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8184"> expressed by the community through this <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cairns Post</EMPHASIS> editorial recently:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The union movement has been shaping up for a fight ever since Australia overwhelmingly elected the Howard coalition government. The unions have never been able to accept either their dwindling roles in modern society or the temerity of the Australian voter in dumping Labor and electing a conservative government. If it was not the waterfront, some other issue inevitably would have been found to act as an excuse to declare war on the government and the country. There is no doubt that the union movement still has the capacity to do serious damage to the Australian economy and the livelihood of every Australian, but there is no doubt also that the union movement in its current form, which is still based on outdated 19th century principles of class warfare, ultimately is. </PARA>

The lease will be acquired from the Citywest Development Corporation of the New South Wales government for a cost of $4.5 million.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the government introduced the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 it suggested that it sought only to make a number of technical amendments to the Workplace Relations Act 1996. Apparently this is the case, and more the pity for it, because there is still much that needs to be done before the principal act starts to bring about any significant improvements in Australia's labour market performance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 8 of the bill clarifies and extends the conferral powers to the Commonwealth from the Victorian government. The Commonwealth Powers (Industrial Relations) Act 1996 was passed by the Victorian parliament on 11 November 1996 and was premised on an interpretation of the Australian constitution that opines the Commonwealth is unable to pass law which impinges upon the functions of a state that are critical to that state's capacity to govern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision by Victoria to transfer one of its prime constitutional rights and responsibilities to the central government was almost, if not entirely, unique. Previously, the Commonwealth and the six states had each shared the responsibility for industrial relations. The latter had hitherto jealously guarded their sovereignty in this field of industrial relations. Despite the passage of the principal act through the parliament last year, five out of the six states remain out of step with Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By any criterion, this is a strange state of affairs&mdash;if the House will forgive that pun. Here we have, arguably, one of the key states comprising the Canberra-Sydney-Melbourne triangle acting alone in a way not emulated, or even in prospect of being emulated, by any other state. This is intriguing, because the Premier of Victoria is never short on offering his advice to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) about how he should go about his job. More about that later perhaps.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is now pretty widely accepted that the original workplace relations package fell seriously short of the government's promised reforms due to the influence of its de facto co-author, Senator Kernot. The unwelcome outcome enshrined in the principal act is that relatively modest reforms were reduced to mediocre ones. Whether that mediocrity influenced the Victorian government to subcontract to the Commonwealth remains a moot point. It is unusual, though, but not unheard of, for a state or states to relinquish powers to the central government. But it is very rare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Victoria's Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Mr Birrell, recently called on the other states to hand over their industrial relations powers to the Commonwealth so as to nurture a more uniform national industrial relations environment, saying, `Australia can ill afford the status quo.' So advice from our friends in Victoria is not limited to Mr Kennett. Mr Birrell argued that Victoria was benefiting from the decision by way of increased productivity, improved certainty, reduced costs for business and reduced complexity for both employees and employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Critics claim that the Kennett government's decision to cede its industrial relations powers to the Commonwealth amounts to little more than a cop-out. Perhaps somewhere down the track we might expect to read about the Victorian Premier once again lambasting the Commonwealth for the inadequacy of its industrial relations apparatus, as he does already at practically every other opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For its part, the present federal government, through the agency of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), continues to hail the acquisition of Victoria's powers through the legislation, which at least for now remain for the other states the responsibility of state governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of all the clauses in schedule 5, item 1 is the most significant in terms of the clarification between federal laws and awards and state legislation governing termination of employment. Subsection 152(1A), as it now exists, could see employers bound to state provisions on termination such as severance 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8188"> pay, despite being covered by a federal award. This goes way beyond what was intended in the principal act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The subsection was originally included to protect employees by providing them with access to state unfair dismissal provisions, irrespective of whether they were covered by a federal award. However, it appears that the subsection also provides an avenue for employees to utilise other state provisions, including redundancy consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While new subsection 152(1A) will not claw back any of the existing safeguards for employees, it will prevent them from accessing state laws, unless those laws relate to harsh, unjust or unreasonable termination of employment. That seems eminently reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Item 2 of schedule 5 is also important as it brings unions into line with individuals in terms of the length of time available to them to apply to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, the AIRC, over termination. The original workplace relations bill outlined a maximum 21&hyphen;day threshold for individuals to make their case to the AIRC after notification of their termination of employment. However, there was no such stipulation for unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Critics of this amendment claim that it is inequitable and may not provide unions with adequate time to launch their claim on behalf of a member or members. If 21 days is insufficient time to allow the union machine to move into top gear, then so be it. Why should the unions have more time to do what individual employees are currently doing without the resources available to a formal organisation such as a union? The simple answer is that there is no justification for this disparity, and the amendment is a sensible one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final item worth noting in this schedule is that which clarifies the ruling on termination payouts. Subsection 170CH(8) of the bill will be repealed by these measures, the result being:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commission must not fix an amount that exceeds the total amount of remuneration received by an employee; or to which the employee is entitled.  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is the latter part of the definition that is important as it was absent from the original act. Employees are now assured that, if they have been paid less than their entitlement in the six months prior to termination, their payout will reflect what they were actually paid or what they should have been paid, whichever is the higher.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes to the powers of the Employment Advocate are among the more interesting ones in this bill. As one analyst has observed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are a significant new weapon in the Employment Advocate's arsenal because, for the first time, an authorised officer is allowed to enter a workplace where breaches are not suspected, in search of evidence in relation to where breaches are suspected.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Under the proposed changes, the Employment Advocate will be able to interview any person in a workplace in an effort to determine whether there has been a breach of the Workplace Relations Act. This contrasts markedly with the current legislation that allows for the interviewing of any employee only if there is a suspicion of a breach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Items 1 to 6 of schedule 8 of the bill will clarify and extend the application of two rulings from the original act. As the legislation currently stands, a successor employer is bound to the existing certified agreement of his or her predecessor only if the former is either a constitutional corporation or the Commonwealth government itself. This amendment will mean that in future all successor employers in Victoria will also be bound by any existing certified agreements that are in place. It is not a controversial amendment as it seeks to bring into effect what was always intended by the federal and Victorian governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Lyndon Rowe, the Executive Director of the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the CCIWA, described the principal act as `a major disappointment'. What started out as a tentative step towards labour market reform was reduced in the Reith&hyphen;Kernot legislative package to something of a damp squid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that this bill seeks only to correct technical oversights in that act rather than 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8189"> substantively to improve it, Mr Rowe's comments remain valid. On behalf of his government, the responsible minister might enhance this legislation by adopting real micro-economic reform of the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must have been perfectly clear to the Prime Minister while on a recent overseas trip that Australia is languishing behind the United Kingdom, the United States and New Zealand in the freeing up of labour markets. Perhaps he could remind the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business of that. It is no accident that unemployment in each of those three countries&mdash;the UK, the USA and New Zealand&mdash;is impressively less than it is in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 5 of this bill will see a number of minor technical changes to the original act with regard to Australian workplace agreements, AWAs. However, these are insignificant changes and will not substantially impact upon the manner in which AWAs will continue to operate. At the time that the principal act was passed through this place, the CCIWA suggested that `the flexibility gained, though, by AWAs is limited by the no disadvantage requirement'. This bill will do nothing to increase the flexibility of AWAs and will therefore continue to limit any national benefit that employers and business groups hoped to see under the coalition's industrial relations reform program and policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having had time to observe the shortcomings of the Reith-Kernot legislation, there is ample evidence that criticism of it is well founded. An organisation that I would not usually rely on&mdash;the Metal Trades Industry Association, the MTIA&mdash;has its criticisms of the offer. I would not very often quote that august organisation; one of the great cop&hyphen;out employer organisations which has led the way over history in wage break&hyphen;outs time after time after time, in conjunction with employers in my old industry, the building industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A report by Mr Sid Marris in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 10-11 May 1997 refers to one of the MTIA's gripes. Mr Harris reported that the MTIA was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to write to the Minister for Industrial Relations . . . pointing out inadequacies in legislation, exposed by the long running email dispute, during 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which unions have mounted concerted action for a two&hyphen;year, 15% wage rise.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the report the Executive Director of the MTIA, Mr Bob Herbert, is attributed with having made the following comments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's one thing to say employers ought to be tough, and the signs are the hard yards we are putting in are starting to pay off. But it's the legislation that hasn't supported their&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the company's&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">toughness, and that issue has to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It should be said that the MTIA's comments were in response to remarks made by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Ian McFarlane. In effect, the governor said that management had been weak in adjusting to the demands of enterprise bargaining and that wages growth was `out of whack' with the pace of economic growth. With that newspaper report back in May, and given the record of the building industry, is it any wonder that that body of employers is now breaking out and making deals, the costs of which far exceed economic growth and productivity gains?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another example of disquiet from a whole grab bag of examples was reported by Ms Katharine Murphy in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> not so long ago. This time concerns were expressed on behalf of the Business Council of Australia, the BCA. Mr Vernon Winley called for a substantial overhaul of the Australian labour force within three years. That exhortation alone demonstrates the fact that the BCA is far from enthralled with the Reith-Kernot Workplace Relations Act. This bill will do nothing to encourage enthusiasm in the government's industrial relations reform agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ms Murphy reported that Mr Winley further said `a completely new, streamlined and internally coherent piece of labour market legislation' might be required to address the demands of the global market. This was despite the operations of the act, ostensibly designed to increase labour market flexibility. Mr Winley is just one among a number of responsible commentators who laments the minister's compromises reached with the Democrats to obtain passage of the Workplace Relations Act. Mr Winley said the act had led 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8190"> to a `new system dogged by a belts and braces approach to safeguards', particularly with the new stream of non-union individual contracts. He went on to state that the act's `excessive administrative burden' had been `to the detriment of flexibility and easy implementation of productivity dangers'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are mere examples of where Australia is or is not with the Reith-Kernot Workplace Relations Act. An outcome of the deal done with the Democrat senator by the minister acting alone is that relatively humble reforms have been reduced to modest and marginal ones, according to labour force academic Ms Judith Sloan. In other words, the originally proposed legislation before the backdown by the minister was inadequate to the needs of modern Australia seeking its place in a competitive global economy. What we ended up with was worse. That outcome is arguably because the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business in his dealings with Senator Kernot did not display an understanding of the difference between negotiation and capitulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As recently as 5 August, Mr Allan Wood wrote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> that Australia must adopt a more radical approach to labour market reform, including a simple, short and new industrial relations statute. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Growth is an important part of the solution to unemployment . . . but that growth is not a short term cyclical boost. Labour market deregulation and faster microeconomic reform more generally will lift the economy's sustainable long term growth rate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He concluded by saying that this is what is needed to eat into unemployment in Australia. In particular, the Reith-Kernot act makes less than satisfactory progress in reducing the number of unfair dismissal claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the Workplace Relations Bill 1997 that was debated in this place last sitting week, these amendments do not deal with the issue of unfair dismissal in any way. That is most unfortunate. The coalition's decision to not only partly exclude small business from unfair dismissal provisions has forced some employers to adopt practices designed explicitly to circumvent the current legislation&mdash;surprise, surprise.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, it is becoming increasingly common for employers to engage new staff on short&hyphen;term contracts. Once the contract has expired, the employer has the option of dispensing with that employee without the fear of running foul of the unfair dismissal provisions. They then simply employ another worker or even the same one on another short-term employment contract and press ahead with business as usual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a practice that should be encouraged. It is another illustration of how many in business still feel that their back is against the wall when it comes to dealing with unfair dismissal. The government remains adamant that the changes it has championed in this field will see a reduction in the number of claims being brought against employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not the way to bring about such a reduction. One wonders how sustained economic growth and employment can possibly result when business is having to resort to utilising short&hyphen;term employment contracts simply because the government did not have the gumption to bite the bullet and embrace a more radical workplace relations reform program. The CCIWA has said of the new unfair dismissal provisions:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes will not cause a large decrease in the total number of unfair dismissals filed. However, employers will be better placed in defending claims that are made against them, and claims are more likely to be settled earlier in the conciliation process than happened under the previous legislation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It went on to say other things, but I see time is going to beat me, so perhaps I should leave it there.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is unfortunate when someone as experienced in the workings of this parliament as the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) is fails to realise the situation confronting the government in this place and in the other House. While we have an overwhelming majority as a result of the very strong support of the Australian people at the last election in this House, regrettably, owing to the vagaries of the Senate voting system, that majority has not been replicated in the other House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8191">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) has sought to change the industrial relations law in this country and bring about flexibility. He is cognisant of the fact that, while the government controls the lower house, it does not control the upper house and that, for the law of Australia to be changed, a bill must pass not only through this House of Representatives but also through the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that my good friend the honourable member for Curtin was quite unfair in his condemnation of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. I suggest that he was a little inflammatory when he referred to the legislation as being the `Reith-Kernot legislation'. What this government has done is to bring in very real changes and reforms, to create a new culture in industrial relations and opportunities for employers and employees at the workplace to sort out arrangements which best suit their needs&mdash;subject, of course, to certain safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As was mentioned by the minister in his second reading speech, this is principally a piece of legislation containing a number of technical amendments to the Workplace Relations Act. The minister has sought to consult widely in the community on this legislation. Indeed, as a member of the Committee on Industrial Legislation, which is the legislative subcommittee of the National Labour Consultative Council, the minister has met with a number of people, including Mr Reg Hamilton of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Mr Tim Pallas of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, with a view to achieving broad agreement on what the government seeks to enact through the  Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This meeting discussed a range of matters. It is interesting to see that a very large number of the amendments were accepted as being non&hyphen;contentious and technical by everyone at the meeting. There were a number of amendments which, while considered to be technical amendments, Mr Pallas would recommend to the ACTU that they should be opposed. Then there was a third group which 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> were recommended for total opposition. We think that the ACTU and the Labor Party are playing politics in relation to this legislation, which is important though technical legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996. The amendments include changes to certified agreements, Australian workplace agreements and the Employment Advocate, the no&hyphen;disadvantage test, the termination of employment, the freedom of association and preference clauses, union disamalgamation and matters referred to the Commonwealth by the state of Victoria. The bill also makes a number of minor amendments to five other acts, namely: the Navigation Act 1912; the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988; the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992; the Superannuation Act 1976; and the Superannuation Act 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is eminently regrettable that the Labor Party is seeking to oppose the attempts of this government to ensure that the effect of the Workplace Relations Act mirrors the intention of this parliament when it passed through the House some time ago. What we have sought to do is to introduce flexibility and choice into the industrial relations system of Australia. It is interesting to note, that since the passage of the Workplace Relations Act 1996, we have had some 1,600 new agreements certified&mdash;including 47 directly between employers and employees&mdash;and over 500 Australian workplace agreements have been approved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, far from the concerns of the honourable member for Curtin being accurate, this government has brought about a sea change in industrial relations. This government has realised that we could not go on the way we were, with certain sections in the Australian community, principally the union movement, having rights, privileges and responsibilities not available to other Australians. This government has sought, through its legislation, to even up the situation. We have brought legislation into the House which is balanced, fair and necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It ought to be recognised that when we were elected in March 1996 we inherited an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8192"> economy that had many problems. We all recall the fact that the former government said that the budget was in surplus whereas on the Monday after the election we discovered that there was a deficit of $10.3 billion. We inherited a situation where real wages had fallen since Labor had assumed office in 1983. Despite some improvement in the last years of Labor, wages were still below their level of a decade before. Our labour productivity continued to lag behind that of many of our trading partners and was well below the OECD average. We were therefore unable to compete internationally. Inflation had risen to more than five per cent and nominal interest rates were amongst the highest in the OECD. Worst of all, our unemployment rate became stuck at a very high level and there was no attempt made by the then government to reduce it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business has clearly pointed this out on very many occasions. What we had to do, therefore, was to fix up the problem we inherited even though we did not cause it. That is why we have attacked problems in the economy. That is why we have assisted small business. That is why we have created a situation where business is able to grow, invest and create jobs. That is why we have brought in responsible economic management which has seen five successive interest rate falls in the period that we have been in office. We have created an environment where the economy will get under way. We have looked at what we have inherited and decided what had to be changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ought to mention also that one of the key problems in the area of industrial relations was the inheritance of Laurie Brereton's unfair dismissal laws&mdash;the job destroying unfair dismissal laws&mdash;which prevented so many employers putting on extra staff. We have sought through other legislation recently passed through this place to remove the effect of the job destroying unfair dismissal laws for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this government has looked at the mire and the mess that we inherited and done something about it. Consequently the workplace relations bill was introduced to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parliament. It was a very strong piece of legislation, clearly recognising the realities of this place. It was necessary to talk to the Democrats because we took the view that it was best to get most of what we wanted into the law of Australia rather than none at all. Had we taken the advice proffered to the minister by the honourable member for Curtin, we would have been stuck with the industrial relations regime of the former government, we would not have had any legislation through the parliament, and we would therefore have had business languishing under the industrial relations system given to us by the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is eminently reasonable that the minister was prepared to be flexible, that he was prepared to sit down and talk to Senator Kernot and to anyone else who would talk in the Senate with a view to making sure that we got through most of what we wanted. The Workplace Relations Act has been a particularly successful piece of legislation. Every day this legislation is considered to be a success. A number of newspaper reports and editorials have pointed out very clearly that this legislation is necessary and will benefit the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the government reviews legislation&mdash;part of the law of this land&mdash;it must from time to time make changes. We always said that we would review the legislation after it became law, and that is why we considered a number of the amendments which are currently part of the legislation before the House. We are pointing out that these are technical amendments. They do not include matters of great moment or substance. I am very sorry that once again we find that the opposition is seeking to frustrate the government as it endeavours to sweep up the mess left behind by the opposition when it left the treasury bench in March 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I referred a moment ago to the meeting which took place between the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reg Hamilton, Mr Tim Pallas and other members of the Committee on Industrial Legislation&mdash;the legislative subcommittee of the National Labor Consultative Council. Mr Pallas pointed out that the ACTU remained 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8193"> opposed to the policy of the Workplace Relations Act. But, as I said, he recommended that a number of matters listed in the first group of items were technical and ought not to be opposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those matters include: clarifying the Australian Industrial Relations Commission's power to arbitrate in relation to safety net wage adjustments during a bargaining period; clarifying the status of awards made under section 170MX; updating the reference to `awards' in legislation other than the Workplace Relations Act; ensuring that designated awards can be determined for the purposes of the no disadvantage test for certified agreements; clarifying the successor provisions for certified agreements and AWAs binding on Victorian employees; clarifying the time limit allowed for applications to certify an agreement; removing section 170VT(2), which is obsolete; correcting paragraph 170XA(2)(b) by omitting the word `other'; extending the prohibition on hindering the AWA negotiations and providing false statements to ensure that it applies in relation to variation, extension and termination of AWAs; clarifying the provision dealing with access to AWAs for Victorian employees; setting time limits on the making of certain termination of employment applications and for discontinuance of such applications; correcting an unintended limitation on access to disamalgamation by registered organisations; clarifying who may make an application for a disamalgamation ballot to ensure that a committee of management can make such application, whether it was elected by a direct or collegiate voting system; clarifying what documents may be inspected under a right of entry permit by defining the term `ancillary document', which relates to AWAs; removing from section 178 obsolete references to section 182 and bans clauses; removing a number of obsolete references and updating references to state legislation; and clarifying the status of `incidental and necessary' provisions in awards simplified by the AIRC during the award simplification process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The items in group 1 also permit the Employment Advocate or the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, as appropriate, to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> designate a state award for the purpose of the no disadvantage test where there is no federal award regulating the terms and conditions of employees engaged in the same kind of work as the employees whose employment is to be covered by an agreement. Lastly, they provide for compensation which may be awarded in respect of an unfair dismissal to be calculated by reference to the amount of remuneration to which the applicant was entitled rather than the amount the applicant actually received.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the range of technical matters in group 1, which Mr Pallas and other people present at the meeting signed off on. One would hope that the opposition would have been prepared not to oppose those matters at least. But I gather that Mr Pallas has not been able, in all cases, to persuade his colleagues in the Labor opposition to support the position that he took at that particular meeting. That is unfortunate. Maybe my good friend opposite, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), might be prepared to tell us later if he makes a contribution why the ACTU and the Labor Party have reneged on this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a group of amendments which Mr Pallas also conceded were technical amendments, but he indicated that he would recommend to the ACTU that these items should be opposed even though they are technical. So we find the ACTU, no doubt supported by the political wing of the ACTU, the Labor Party, clearly opposing the technical amendments in group 2.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think I should outline to the House what those particular amendments in group 2 are. They seek to: make clear the 14&hyphen;day period to be provided to employees to consider a certified agreement is not affected by new staff commencing work within the period; expand the definition of `AWA official' to include all staff of the Office of the Employment Advocate; clarify the provision relating to the publication of AWA determinations; clarify the rights of entry and powers of authorised officers of the Employment Advocate; and clarify reference to `relevant award' in section 152 to make clear that relevant awards are relevant state awards.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8194">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As one can see, there is nothing major, nothing complex, nothing complicated and nothing difficult in the changes proposed to be included as a result of those items set out in group 2. Yet, despite that, the ACTU has recommended that they be opposed. This government has gone out to consult, has talked and been reasonable. The minister has been prepared to talk through and discuss all of these matters with all parties in the community. Yet at the end of the day we find that, despite the fact that the law is not being substantially changed as a result of the technical amendments in group 2, the Labor Party is clearly not prepared to come on board and be reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of items set out in group 3. I suppose these are items which would positively cause the ACTU to froth&mdash;not for any particular reason, because they also are technical amendments. Clearly, those amendments are amendments which the Labor Party and the ACTU are not prepared to stomach. That is an absolutely ridiculous attitude from both of them, because these amendments merely seek to extend the time limit allowed for filing AWAs from 14 days to 21 days. They permit persons authorised by AWA parties to provide information to the Employment Advocate if the Employment Advocate considers it appropriate. They allow the Employment Advocate to waive technical filing requirements in relation to AWAs where waiver would not disadvantage a party to the AWA. They clarify the application of state laws on termination to employers covered by federal awards. They ensure that an agreement may not be approved where it includes a preference provision inconsistent with the freedom of association provisions of the Workplace Relations Act, and they provide for the removal of void preference clauses in awards and agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again I stress that the amendments currently before the chamber are not major amendments. We are not rewriting the industrial relations legislation of Australia. We are not seeking to gut the Workplace Relations Act. What we aim to do through this legislation is to bring into legal force and effect and practical application the intention of the Workplace 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Relations Act as carried by this parliament. We have brought in a number of technical amendments to the Workplace Relations Act and a number of other pieces of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the kind of bill that should have been sent off to the Main Committee as non&hyphen;contentious legislation. Unfortunately, the people opposite tend to be argumentative, they tend to play politics and they tend not to want to join with the government to improve this excellent piece of legislation brought onto the statute books of this country by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very proud and pleased to support this legislation, which is reasonable, fair, moderate and simply seeks to improve the legislation which we have already collectively endorsed as a parliament. The coalition government has brought about new flexibility. We have changed the industrial relations culture to enable employers and employees to talk. We have got away from the industrial warfare tactics of those opposite. I must say that, from talking to both employers and employees in my own electorate of Fisher, overwhelmingly, most people are very happy with the Workplace Relations Act 1996. They believe, as I do, that the act is working well. But obviously we will continue to monitor the act on an ongoing basis to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment bill before the chamber now makes a number of technical amendments. I urge those opposite to support the government in its endeavours to bring into practical application the intentions of the Workplace Relations Act as carried by the parliament. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), who preceded me, sought to reaffirm those comments that had initially been made by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) in his second reading speech. The minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill makes a number of technical amendments . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Yes, a number of technical amendments are provided for in this legislation. He said:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act is delivering genuine flexibility and choice at the workplace level.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Those comments were repeated by the member for Fisher in his contribution. The member for Fisher is one of the great apologists for the government. He is one of those people who has the capacity to call black white and to call white black and to do it without even smiling. I am not going into the myriad of issues that were pursued by him, but there are a couple of them I would like to mention to confirm the point I have just made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He said in relation to the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill that these technical amendments seek to even up the situation. I presume that what he means by that is that the amendments are designed to ensure an even balance between the employers on one side and the employees on the other side. The claim that is made by the member for Fisher and by those people who sit alongside him and on the front bench is that, in some way, this legislation will ensure that negotiations, particularly at the Australian workplace agreement level, will be undertaken by equals. Nothing is further from the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point that we have emphasised&mdash;and let me emphasise it again&mdash;concerns a situation where you have an employer, with the power of his corporation behind him, sitting across 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the table from some young kid that he is just about ready to employ. If the kid signs the contract, we do not believe for one moment that they are negotiations between equals. In his more objective, dispassionate moments, the member for Fisher will endorse that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say another thing. He said that the purpose of this legislation is to create jobs. In fact, government members use the adjective `real' in that connection. They generally say that the purpose of this government and the purpose of the government's policies are to create real jobs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The particular issue we have taken exception to&mdash;quite apart from some of the others I have personal reservations about&mdash;was the question of the Employment Advocate and the Australian workplace agreements. In our second reading amendment we have indicated that, while not declining to give the bill a second reading, we deplore the government's attempt to use this legislation in order to achieve objectives by the backdoor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have here a poster which was produced by the CFMEU about Australian workplace agreements. The poster shows old&hyphen;time miners with their horses and wagons. For all I know some of my antecedents may be among them, because they were all miners. This poster says, referring to these old&hyphen;time miners, `They too fought for what we have today. Don't give it away with an AWA.' That is the sort of sentiment which is influencing coalminers, people on the wharves and people whom this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8197"> government has set in its sights. That is the sentiment, the philosophy, the tradition and the history of people in these industries. It says at the bottom, `Stick with the union.' I endorse that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here is another CFMEU poster. This is a pretty compelling comment too. It says, `Wanted: information on any award rights and benefits that employers have offered Australian workers without the union first campaigning for them. Reward: $500.' If there is any evidence of it, you can apply to the CFMEU for a reward of $500. Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask the minister if he has any information on any award rights and benefits that employers have offered Australian workers without the union first campaigning for them? Let the CFMEU know if you have. They will write out a cheque for $500 and send it through to you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provisions of the Workplace Relations Act express more clearly than most other things the philosophy of this government towards the whole area of industrial relations. The act reflects the determination of the government to exclude vast sections of the Australian people from any meaningful participation&mdash;to prevent them having any significant say&mdash;in matters which concern them, especially the terms of their employment and the conditions under which they work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, as a result of this Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill and the parent legislation to which it relates, divides participants in the Australian community into those it considers have a right to make decisions and then, apart from them, that vast majority of people whose obligation, according to this government, is to do what they are told&mdash;under threats and intimidation, like that kid over in Western Australia. This government divides the community into the managers and the managed, the rulers and the subjects, the masters and the servants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind you that this was confirmed by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) himself, when he said business people have a right to manage their own business. The point I made after that comment was this: that could have been said 50 years ago, but the world is a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more enlightened place now. We understand that there are many different types of participants in the production process, and we should all see the production process as a social process undertaken by equals. There are some people who provide capital and management; there are other people who provide labour. Let me make it perfectly clear that, as far as I am concerned&mdash;and I believe the majority of my colleagues would agree&mdash;the people who provide labour are equally important in that process. They are equally significant in the process of making decisions about the conditions under which they make their labour available and under which they work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyone who says businessmen have a right to manage their own business and make their own decisions simply does not understand, or simply does not accept, the proposition that I put forward. It is not just masters and servants; it is also the proprietors and the factory fodder; and it is also the decision makers and the decision takers. That attitude might have been relevant in the past. It has ceased to be relevant. It has ceased to be correct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There are fundamental differences between our position and the position of the government. First of all, we believe that negotiated reforms of the industrial relations system are the appropriate way to go. As far as the coalition is concerned, it has used draconian measures to remove safeguards and to discourage the development of strategies that might facilitate civilised, sane, constructive, fruitful negotiations between employers and employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe in enterprise agreements. We have no objection to enterprise agreements being entered into, but we also accept the right of employees to be represented by their unions and not to sit across the table with the boss in the boss's office. My concern includes, of course, the Employment Advocate, who refuses to disclose many of those contract terms. It was suggested that, if he were concerned about the confidentiality of the agreements&mdash;the question of privacy&mdash;all he had to do was blot out the names and then he could let us know some of the terms that were 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8198"> being negotiated between these so&hyphen;called `equals' across the table in the boss's office. Let us see some of the terms. I would have liked to have seen the terms that would have finished up in the individual contract of that kid over in Perth if he did not have his tape recorder. Let me forewarn all kids and all employees invited into the boss's office to work out the terms of the individual contract: take the tape recorder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition, by its whole approach, believes that individual contracts are more appropriate. In our approach to enterprise agreements, we accept the rights of workers to negotiate collectively in open consultation and to be represented by their union. The coalition believes in the secrecy of the executive office. Labor believes in a comprehensive award safety net. The government believes in 20 basic core elements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let me say, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know and the minister knows, many of the agreements that have been entered into have in fact been negotiated. That is why they are there and why they have been written into the award. They then have the force of the award, but they were negotiated. Those opposite talk about negotiations, but not genuine negotiations. They like the boss's office formula. They do not like the idea of the union in a civilised, mature, balanced, constructive way sitting down with the employers and with the managers.</PARA>

Labor seeks to build on the industrial relations structure, the origins of which can be traced to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In summing up, I thank all the members who have made a contribution to this debate on the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1997, including the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who has put on his usual windbag performance. But it was entertaining for all of that. I thank the members who have put the time in to debate the actual provisions in the bill before the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst there has been a lot of rhetoric on this particular piece of legislation, the fact of the matter is that this bill is proposing various technical amendments to the operation of the Workplace Relations Act, which, by and large, came into effect on 1 January this year. In preparing the amendments, the government sat down with the ACTU and the employers organisation, the ACCI, and we comprehensively went through each and every one of the propositions that the government was proposing. Most of the amendments were put by the government as we have monitored the operation of our new workplace relations laws, but we did accept one amendment from the employers and we accepted one amendment from the ACTU.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8199">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In one of the final meetings that we held in Melbourne on a Saturday with this committee&mdash;it is known as the Committee on Industrial Legislation, which is a subcommittee of the National Labour Consultative Committee&mdash;we ended up agreeing that one lot of amendments being proposed were entirely technical, which the ACTU would not oppose; one lot they agreed were technical but they would oppose them; and there were some that they would not agree were technical and were opposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it would be fair to say that, on the ones where they disagree, they disagree because they disagree with the original proposition rather than fighting over the technical amendment. We have deliberately kept this at a technical level. Whilst there are many fights and arguments we have with the Labor Party and the ACTU, we do prefer to argue on the substantive issues rather than the technical ones. For that reason, obviously we would encourage our colleagues in the Senate to give due and appropriate passage to the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is appropriate, however, that I say something about Australian workplace agreements, which have created so much excitement in the Labor Party in recent times. These are individual, or maybe collective, agreements available under the Workplace Relations Act. I should say that, if you are going to have one of those agreements, they still have to pass the no disadvantage test; in other words, in total you cannot be worse off than the total benefit provided by the award. That is established by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and is a fair protection for people in entering into agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the little case study that the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) had&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="BROWN" NAMEID="5A5">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr Robert Brown</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A good one.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think it was a good one. You would have to give me the details, but that one, as it was reported to me, was about a circumstance in Western Australia with regard to an agreement proposed to be under Western Australian law. The federal law is different from the Western Australian law. For example, in the federal law, if you wish to go into an Australian workplace 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> agreement, we have specifically provided that the union may be your agent. I think that is fair enough. If people want to be in a union, I agree that they should be able to be in the union. If they want the union to negotiate on their behalf, to be their bargaining agent, they should be able to do that. We passed that as part of the federal law, to give people basic protections.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have made it very clear in the law to the Employment Advocate that these agreements must be genuine. If there were any suggestions of duress, obviously it is important that there be a person to whom people can go to raise their concerns. We do have duress in the system. Sometimes we have duress by union bullies who get stuck into employees and make them toe the line. If the member for Charlton is genuinely concerned about duress, he would acknowledge that. I had a woman ring up the other day: apparently her son was frogmarched by the local CFMEU bloke down to the ATM. He told him to take some money out so that the kid could make a donation to the CFMEU. You hold up the posters from the CFMEU. We remember the CFMEU. Some of them were outside the front door of this place in the infamous riot of last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition claims that some of the proposed amendments increase the powers of the Employment Advocate. This claim does misrepresent the nature and intention of these technical amendments. As I have said before, they are simply technical. They are designed to correct drafting oversights which have led to minor errors and anomalies, to clarify existing provisions and to make some other minor changes to make sure the legislation operates as intended. Even the ACTU does agree that most of them are technical. As to the few that they say are not technical, we obviously disagree with that opinion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the amendments would give the Employment Advocate the discretion to waive strict compliance with elements of the filing procedures in circumstances where the Employment Advocate considers that waiver would not disadvantage a party to the Australian workplace agreement. In the absence of such a waiver, the Employment Advocate has 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8200"> had to return a number of AWAs lodged because the applications failed in some minor way to meet the filing requirements, such as omitting the employer's Australian company number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The capacity to waive minor defects is a sensible technical amendment aimed at smoothing the operation of the AWA provisions and eliminating unnecessary delays and procedural burdens. It is in keeping with the intention of the AWA scheme that it is to provide a simple and speedy means of formalising agreements entered into by employers and employees. To suggest that the amendment amounts to an increase in the powers of the Employment Advocate is obviously a nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment makes clear that the advocate will have to be satisfied the waiver would not disadvantage a party to the AWA. The amendment will not affect the substantive requirements to be met by an AWA. There will still be a need for strict compliance with the substantive requirements, such as the provisions relating to the no disadvantage test and, of course, genuine consent. The amendment provides only for defects of a technical nature to be  waived. This will avoid a waste of time and resources involved in correcting minor defects whilst ensuring that the interests of AWA parties are protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other circumstances in administrative law where the appropriate authority is entitled by the parliament to waive technical defects. It is in everybody's interest. I would hope that there would not be any more serious opposition to that proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another proposed amendment extends the time limit for filing an AWA from 14 to 21 days after it is signed. This is a simple, practical change designed to assist the parties, especially those in rural centres. It could hardly be described as an increase in the powers of the advocate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides for AWA parties to choose to obtain assistance in explaining the operation of their AWA to the Employment Advocate. The amendment will help AWA parties who have not appointed a bargaining agent or do not wish to utilise the services of a bargaining agent for the purpose of explain 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing the operation of their AWA to the Employment Advocate. Again, this amendment could hardly be characterised as increasing the powers of the Employment Advocate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On accountability, the opposition claims there is a lack of accountability in the AWA process. It has previously suggested that the advocate should provide written decisions. Provided an agreement meets all relevant statutory requirements, including the no disadvantage test, there is no point in the advocate wasting time and resources preparing written reasons for decisions. A requirement to publish decisions would do nothing to improve the operation of AWAs; it would simply delay it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrary to the claims made by the opposition, AWAs are not secret documents. Parties to AWAs, both employers and employees, are free to disclose the content of their AWAs to anyone, and the act specifically provides that an agreement must not include any provision that prohibits or restricts disclosure of details of the AWA by either party. The fact that approval arrangements are streamlined does not mean that employee protections are compromised. The act provides extensive protection for employees and these protections are explained in the information statement which employers wishing to enter into AWAs must provide to their employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The information statement is a detailed booklet prepared by the advocate. It makes clear that to be approved an employee must genuinely consent to the agreement and the agreement must meet the no disadvantage test. The information statement explains how the test operates and provides advice about the appointment and role of bargaining agents. It makes very clear that an employee cannot be dismissed for refusing to sign an AWA. It also sets out how to obtain further information from the Office of the Employment Advocate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Employment Advocate can only approve an AWA if it clearly meets the no disadvantage test. If the Employment Advocate has any unresolved concerns about whether the test is met, the advocate is obliged to refer the agreement to the AIRC. The commission may decide to reduce particular AWA determinations to writing if it chooses 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8201"> to do so. This is a matter for the discretion of the commission, but any determination which is to be published must be edited to ensure it does not disclose the identity of the AWA parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where any concerns about compliance with the no disadvantage test are resolved by written undertakings given by the employer, those undertakings are deemed to be part of the agreement to which they relate and are therefore enforceable as part of the agreement. Stripped of their rhetoric, the opposition's objections to the proposed amendments amount to no more than the fact that they object to employers and employees taking responsibility for their own workplace relationships without the intervention of uninvited third parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments, as I say, are merely technical. They should not give rise to too much excitement in the caucuses of the federal parliamentary Labor Party. I again thank all members for their contributions. In particular, I thank those in my department for the work they have done on this bill. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The opposition understands the mischief to which the government is trying to respond in this particular set of amendments. We have a situation of continuous employment: some new person is employed every day. So the provision of the act that says you have to give 14 days' notice to everybody is impossible to comply with. You never get to a point where everybody has had 14 days' notice. We understand that. Our concern&mdash;and we want to facilitate dealing fairly with that concern&mdash;is that the rather stark way it has been dealt with in the bill has the potential of creating a situation where the time period for the last&hyphen;employed employee could get down to five minutes. We are trying to accommodate that by way of a two&hyphen;stage process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will speak to all the amendments together; they essentially go to the same point. We are trying to say, first, that a lesser period should occur as of right. It is not an extreme or unusual position for someone to be employed every day. Where a person has been employed within the last 14 days and, but for that fact, every other aspect of the approval arrangements has been complied with, the fact that the notice was between seven and 14 days as a result of late employment should not stand in the way. In all the circumstances up to and including that, the outcome of our proposal would be the same as that for the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are looking to have in place some mechanism for people employed less than seven days that says it ought to be a reasonable period. But in an extreme case&mdash;for example, the case that I gave in my opening&mdash;where it is a very big project and a new person is being employed every day, you will never meet the test. Even if the test is any specified number of days, you will never meet it because there is always a new person 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8202"> coming on. There ought to be the capacity for an independent body&mdash;the commission&mdash;to say, `You are dealing with this fairly. You have put a fair set of arrangements in place. You cannot meet even the seven&hyphen;day test but it is as fair as it can possibly be; therefore, that lesser period is approved.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the structure. It is reflected slightly differently in each of the three amendments because they are dealing with slightly different circumstances, but they come together to try to meet the legitimate concern of the government that there are circumstances in which these sorts of agreements will not otherwise be able to receive approval in meeting the technical requirements which most will, and should, meet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want to put a proposal in place that strikes a balance and I think it is the same balance the government is trying to strike. I do not think in this instance we have different objectives. Our concern is that the way it is constructed creates the potential for an individual, through no fault of anybody, to fail to receive reasonable notice of an agreement about which they are required to give their consent and that they will not have had adequate notice to give them the opportunity to consider the pros and cons and maybe take a bit of advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the framework, that is the objective and that is the structure. It is not designed to interfere with the government's attempt to achieve the flexibility that its amendments are designed to achieve in schedule 2. As I said, we understand that objective. Without any action being taken you would get into the situation where some agreements could never properly be approved and that is obviously not a reasonable situation. Whatever we think about the broad structure of the agreement stream, you cannot render it inoperable by administrative technicality. We do not seek to do that so we therefore propose this alternative framework.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We did have quite a discussion in the coil about this, looking to meet the various concerns. When you go through it from each and every angle I think our proposition is a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reasonable one. The employees still get the agreement and they have it explained to them; that is important. If you had a lot of employees in a business and you had someone who was employed five minutes prior to the approval, quite frankly if it was another 10 minutes would it make any difference? They would then be employed under terms and conditions of which they were aware. Would one person make the difference if a majority had approved it? Obviously not.</PARA></TALK.START>

When the Industrial Registrar publishes such a determination under section 143, he or she must ensure that the publication does not disclose the identity of either party to the AWA.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Although to facilitate things I am seeking to do amendments 4 to 8 together, there are actually two batches of amendments here. I will try to deal with all of them in five minutes. Most of them are quite minor and go only to the general question that we all dealt with in the second reading speech. We do not wish to reiterate and rehearse unnecessarily the general tenor of AWAs and the Employment Advocate and our overall concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The position of the Employment Advocate should never have been created. The way it is operating is reinforcing our worst fears. I did not pretend during the second reading, and do not now, that any of these is a major important new change. Our opposition is to each increment in opportunity for the employment advocate to act in the way that he has done in that remarkable lack of accountability to the parliament and the failure to in any way meet what we would regard as reasonable standards for protection of employees subjected to these AWAs which the employment advocate or his office has to apply. We will oppose and resist that until we get the opportunity to abolish the position altogether. That is our position. It is not going to be productive spending hours reiterating it; I simply state it. It is a position shared and expressed by many of my colleagues in their second reading contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regard amendment 8 as different and more important&mdash;not that I expect this minister in the House of Representatives to be swayed by the rhetoric about this matter. I hope for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> greater success when my more persuasive colleagues in the Senate advocate the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly concerned that the lack of public access to the nature of decisions being made, which are affecting the lives of Australians and have ramifications for those beyond the immediate agreement, should not extend to the Industrial Relations Commission. Our concern is that item 15 on page 8 of the bill does, in its present form, start to extend to the Industrial Registrar and the Industrial Relations Commission those sorts of provisions where decisions are made but they are not public, they are not open to scrutiny, they are not open for other people to assess their implications in connection with potential future matters on which they might impact&mdash;not just if they are not parties to this, but if they work in a similar industry or are confronting a similar problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Up until now, if a decision having been made by a public authority has the capacity to affect your rights or set a precedent that might affect your rights, you can consult on it; you can see whether or not you agree with it; you even have some capacity to respond to it. We do not want to see that important function undermined. We would like to see it taken away from the Employment Advocate, but we cannot do that in this particular set of amendments to the legislation. So that is a question for another day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, what we would like to do is make sure that the poor standard that is set with regard to the Employment Advocate is not extended to the Industrial Relations Commission. So we are seeking to substitute item 15 on page 8 with the amendment contained in amendment 8. It is, I think, an important question of principle. We do not want to drag the Industrial Relations Commission standard of accountability down to the level of the Employment Advocate. Therefore, I recommend the amendment to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond just briefly on a couple of these matters. With regard to the power of authorised officers to retain documents produced to them, being the matters I think in items 3 and 4, these amendments simply 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8204"> correct some anomalies in the right of entry powers that are available to authorised officers appointed by the Employment Advocate. The amendments will assist in protecting employees. They would, for example, ensure that authorised officers are able to properly investigate suspected coercion of employees in relation to AWAs, which I would have thought the Labor opposition surely would support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As is the case with the existing rights of entry, the new provision does not allow access to premises used for residential purposes, and the right to interview does not empower an authorised officer to compel a person to answer questions. Authorised officers must still announce their presence and produce their identity cards for inspection before entering premises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of the opposition's proposed amendment No. 8, the government obviously will oppose that particular measure, a proposed section 170WHA. The commission already has the powers, should it so wish, to publish its determinations provided that, in doing so, it does not disclose the identity of the relevant parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of people having access to information as to the operation of the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act, in respect of the application of the no disadvantage test and, generally, the functions of the Office of the Employment Advocate in approving AWAs, I would say that the Australian Democrats were similarly very concerned to ensure that the parliament was appropriately informed about what was happening. We did not disagree with what they had to say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So provision has been made for there to be an appropriately comprehensive review of processes within the AWA by the bringing in of outside academics, independent persons, by the OEA so as to prepare a report which will be made available on the operations of AWAs. That can then look at the impact of this new system on persons from non-English speaking background, on women, on those who are disadvantaged and otherwise, so as to be able to give the parliament some real information about how AWAs are working 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and the impact they are having on the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We originally proposed that ourselves and, if you like, we toughened up those provisions in the act in the negotiations with the Democrats. Mr Rowe, the Employment Advocate, in his recent appearance before the Senate estimates committee, gave further details of how that program of research would be undertaken. So we hear what the opposition says about these issues; they are not new. More than adequate provision has been made for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do welcome one thing that the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) has said: he is opposed to AWAs and, basically, he will oppose anything that has anything to do with AWAs, regardless of how technical the amendment might be. I do not think that is a reasonable way to proceed. I think you should just let them go through to the keeper, and you can have your policy day when we have an election.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments are some of those that we consider significantly more than technical. These are changes which lead to a potentially lower standard of test for the no disadvantage test in the scrutiny of AWAs. There are some similar concerns we have about scrutiny of other agreements which will come up in consideration of a different schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It gets very technical, and I do not want to start pursuing it in an inordinate amount of detail, but if I can put it in layman's language in the broad we have here the possibility that the no disadvantage test can be met by a standard set by a state award rather than a federal award. That is a cause of concern to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8205"> the opposition, particularly in those states where the standards are deplorably low.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that I grew up in Western Australia, I suppose the prejudices that I have in this matter might be obvious, but it is not exclusively a Western Australian problem and will not necessarily in the future be exclusively a Western Australian problem. If, by some mischance, the current Queensland government were to be re-elected at the next state election, there is no doubt they would wish to move in that direction, and I have some apprehensions about the second&hyphen;term agenda of a re&hyphen;elected Liberal government in South Australia should that be the result of the forthcoming election. So, while it is Western Australia about whom everybody has the priority concern at the moment, it is not exclusively a problem that could be resolved by dealing with Western Australia alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no automaticity that state standards are necessarily lower than those of federal. Of course, if the state standard is higher, the problem does not arise. In meeting the federal standard for no disadvantage test, a standard is not going to be lowered by meeting it in that circumstance. We would have no objection. The circumstance in which that might arise is highly speculative but not impossible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seriously concerned that this is not a technical amendment. It is not technical from our point of view, and it is not technical in its potential to affect the industrial rights of Australian men and women. So we will be opposing the amendments in schedule 4.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We made it quite clear in the principal debate about the Workplace Relations Act that the nature of the no disadvantage test, as originally proposed by the government, was entirely unacceptable to us. We had a debate about that in the House, and it was changed in the Senate. We might not think that what emerged from the Senate compromise is ideal. It is certainly better than that which the government proposed and which passed this House. It might not be what we would wish to see, but certainly we do not wish to see it watered down. That is the concern which strikes us with regard to schedule 4.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are slightly different aspects with regard to each subsection in the schedule, but 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I will not take the time of the House by going through them bit by bit. The point of principle is the same in each one. It is something which we think probably does not even meet the standard the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) set of being technical amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand why even the other ones I disagree with are in here. They are to make sections for which the minister set down original intention operate in accordance with their original intention. That is why we are letting a lot of them go through without criticism&mdash;because that was clearly the intention of the parliament, and let us not debate every darn thing twice. I do not think it meets that, and we are opposed to it for that reason, but more particularly for its potential to have an effect of lowering the standard of no disadvantage test applying in the scrutiny of AWAs.</PARA></SPEECH>

The act presently provides that, where there is no award covering the work of employees who are to be covered by certified agreement or AWA, the commission or the advocate, as the case requires, is to designate an appropriate federal award for the purposes of applying the no disadvantage test to the agreement. I think we all agree on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There may be some circumstances in which it is not possible to identify a suitable federal award. The proposed amendment will therefore allow the commission or the advocate to designate a state award as the benchmark for the no disadvantage test where there is no federal award covering work of the same kind as that performed by employees whose work is to be subject to an agreement. This will ensure that the absence of a suitable federal award will not prevent the effective operation of the no disadvantage test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That seems quite a good idea to me. If you do not have an underlying award, what have you got? It is not much of a no disadvantage test if it does not have something to which it can be compared. That is all this says. You could have some alternative inappropriate federal award, but that might be dudding your employees even more so, which I think is why the ACTU went along with it.

We are concerned that the changes have the capacity to restrict the access of employees to the unfair dismissal provisions, if I can use that as a generic description of our concern. There are applications which could meet the standards set in the legislation that will fall outside the standards set in this schedule and therefore would fail to be admitted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In being concerned about this, I do not think we are opening the door to some continuous frivolous applications. There are already provisions dealing with that, and I have not seen any evidence that has been brought forward that says there is a problem arising with a flood of applications of a particular sort, a flood that needs to be stemmed with these sorts of changes. While it may suit the administrative convenience of somebody to make these changes, they are not changes without effect on people's rights, and that is where our concern arises. It is what has led us to oppose these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a lot of controversy about the whole issue of unfair dismissal, and that will be debated in a Senate committee on Friday. Then, at some time after that, as determined by the government, it will be debated in the Senate. They are very important questions. These are not issues of that level of magnitude. These are not issues about which we expect to see thundering threats of double dissolution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept that these are matters of technicality, but I have not seen or heard or read in the explanatory memorandum or the second reading speech anything that says to me these changes which have a capacity to limit or restrict the access of people to the unfair

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The protections that are open to workers in terms of their state provisions and their relationship to awards, AWAs and certified agreements are not changes that recommend themselves to us. I do not want to lift it to the level of higher principle that we have dealt with in the original unfair dismissal changes or, more particularly, those that have recently passed through the House and are currently before the Senate. I do not want to get into that level of concern, but at this stage nothing that I have heard recommends these changes to me.

Again, I do not think this proposal is anything other than a technical one which makes more certain the operation of the Workplace Relations Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of this particular amendment is to clarify the application of state laws in relation to the termination of employment of an employee covered by a federal award. The intention of subsection 152(1A) was to ensure that federal system employees who do not have access to a federal remedy for unfair dismissals, such as employees whose former employers were not constitutional corporations, would still have access to a state unfair dismissal remedy. This provision was needed because some federal system employees have been denied access to state unfair dismissal remedies on the basis that federal award clauses dealing with termination of employment have been taken to cover the field to the exclusion of the state remedy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsection 152(1A) was not intended to give federal award employees access to other provisions of state laws or awards dealing with termination of employment, such as entitlements and notice and severance pay under a state award. This is because any federal award entitlements they may have related to termination and redundancy pay are unaffected by the fact that their former employer was not a constitutional corporation or engaged in constitutional trade or commerce. Section 152(1A) was only intended to provide access to unfair dismissal remedies. The proposed amendment makes it clear that it does precisely that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consistent with the original intention of the legislation, the amended provision will still allow an employee covered by a federal award who has no access to a federal remedy for unfair dismissal to apply for an unfair dismissal remedy under state law. However, the amendment will make it clear that employers bound by federal awards are not subject to other state laws relating to termination of employment, such requirements in relation to severance pay or redundancy.

<PARA STYLE="Para">We are dealing with a large number of amendments to schedule 6 but they all essentially go to the same point in terms of our concern with schedule 6. They relate to the circumstance in which a preference clause is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8208"> in an award or agreement. Obviously, the act means that that clause cannot have effect. That will be the impact of the Workplace Relations Act. A lot of people might expend millions of dollars on QCs trying to interpret that in fine detail. But, in broad principle, that is what it means. We are not trying to argue that point; we accept that conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that is not the same as saying that the fact the preference clauses are not operative means they ought immediately be struck out of every agreement or award that they are in. Let us think about the implications of that: how did the clauses get in the award or the agreement? Once you think about that, the process becomes evident. They came into the award usually by agreement but, if not by agreement, then by considered decision of the arbitral authority of the time, whatever it might have been called. For the purpose of this, we have said it is the Industrial Relations Commission but, when it happened, it might have been some different body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened is that the arbitral authority at the time, the court or commission, made a decision or accepted an agreement that such a clause should be introduced into an award. In the case of an agreement, by definition such a clause went in there because the parties to it signed on and said that is what they wanted. Now that cannot override a law passed by the parliament saying such a clause does not have any effect. Obviously, it would be wrong should that be the case.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is quite an interesting development. We are putting up 29 technical amendments and even the ACTU does not really object to most of them. Just looking through your amendments, you are proposing to omit 24 of those 29 amendments. But the amendments in relation to schedule 6 really take the cake.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just explain what is proposed here. If somebody enters into an agreement today and that agreement includes a clause which is not legal under the Workplace Relations Act because it is discriminatory, it is proposed in our amendment that that agreement should not be approved. The reason is quite simple: if the CFMEU&mdash;it is the CFMEU, the CPSU and a couple of other trade unions&mdash;get some weak employer to agree to a discriminatory, illegal clause, then the union plan is to get that agreement approved through the commission so that it can then go around the work sites and say to employees and to employers, `This has been agreed. This has been certified by the commission. This is the deal.' That is what they have been doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All we are saying is&mdash;as the shadow minister, the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) acknowledges&mdash;that it is not legal because it is outlawed by the federal act. There are penalties for breaching the anti-discriminatory provisions of the federal law; yet the shadow minister wants the CFMEU and some of these other types to be able to have these clauses in agreements with a commission stamp on them so that they can go around deceiving people and misleading people about the nature of the agreements for particular work sites.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am amazed that you would go along with this. What you are setting out here is to conspire in a little scheme with the CFMEU so that they should be able to bowl over weak employers and then go around and misrepresent to employees that, because an agreement has been certified with this particular clause in it, there is a requirement on a particular site that people be members of a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> union. It is a clear breach of the rights that people have under the federal law and you are proposing this amendment effectively to collaborate with some of these people in the trade union movement who want to enforce compulsory unionism. It is the old game.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frankly, the amazing thing about this is most rank and file trade union members do not believe you should be forced into the union. And certainly 70 or 80 per cent of the Australian public do not believe in compulsory unionism. Yet that is all that this is: it is just a device to be able to mislead people. It is a pretty serious thing too because there are penalties for enforcing compulsory unionism. Yet you are going along with a deal to get these clauses through the commission so that the usual games can be played out on the CBD work sites, the building industry and various others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does show an incredible attitude from the federal parliamentary Labor Party that, in a labour force today where only one in four people are in a union, where people have been leaving trade unions and where there is a very strong value in the Australian community that you should not be able to jackboot people into unions, it believes that unions should have a right to effectively incorporate into agreements to be certified by the federal commission clauses which they know are void and which will entrap people into breaches of federal law and expose employees to penalties under that law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have sunk to a new low. We have abolished compulsory unionism. We think it is quite wrong for you to set out, as you have today, to mislead employees about their basic rights just to support the campaigns of a few people in the trade union movement to dragoon people into unions against their will. This is quite wrong. It shows a lot about the thinking in the federal parliamentary Labor Party. I am disappointed that you do not see the commonsense of the technical amendments before the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The whole issue of preference for unionists has been one of the most misrepresented issues in the entire modern history of industrial relations debates in this country. The present Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) has indulged in the same 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8211"> time-honoured practice of misrepresenting the entire process of preference for unionists. I notice that he seems to replace the words `preference for unionists' with `compulsory unionism' on an interchangeable basis. It really does demonstrate the ideological view that the Liberal government has brought to the entire industrial relations issue. Compulsory unionism does not and has never existed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Preference for unionists is nothing of the sort and even in its heyday did not provide, with the possible exception of one or two types of employment, anything approaching an absolute requirement. In fact, there are plenty of examples where matters were taken to industrial commissions for determination on those clauses when they were enforceable in awards only to be turfed out because, as the minister would well know, the concept of preference was one that applied only where all else was equal. It was not difficult for employers to subvert the actual intent and desire of those preference clauses by obfuscating a whole range of other qualities which they may have sought in prospective employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole thing about preference for unionists has been built up as a major smokescreen by successive conservative advocates. The minister is simply the latest in that line of conservative advocates doing his darnedest to tell people why workers on low wages do not deserve an increase and why preference for unionism is somehow compulsory unionism, widespread and evil. It was nothing of the sort and it is hollow rhetoric.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has always amazed me that, on the one hand, the advocates&mdash;the minister has fallen into this trap as well&mdash;for the minister's cause will argue the evils of preference for unionists and compulsory unionism as being the dreaded impost of union bosses who wield an almighty power over their membership, the work force and the economy. In the next breath&mdash;in fact, he did it a few minutes ago in the same speech&mdash;he then points out that the number of people in unions represents about 24 to 25 per cent of the population and, therefore, they are pretty insignificant and dying. On the one hand, this is a powerful and dangerous group of people wielding 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> enormous authority and in the next moment they are a group of people who are anachronistic and have no place and no power in Australia today. You cannot have it both ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister went one better in the debate on this bill when he actually urged the opposition to accept the advice of those same people. In one breath he castigates these people as being dangerous, all&hyphen;powerful, manipulative union bosses who forced people into the union and stopped decent Australians from getting jobs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take the couple of minutes that remain before 6.30 to make a few observations about this particular question. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) referred to the outlawing of compulsory unionism. The member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) quite correctly said that the minister and the government members tend to equate compulsory unionism with preference for unionists. The minister was quite aghast that the Labor opposition should be, in effect, supporting what he alleges these circumstances to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I want to do is to remind the minister that, in connection with the CRA dispute up at Weipa, the Industrial Relations Commission found that CRA was acting contrary to federal law in not discriminating in favour of unionists or giving preference to unionists but, rather, discriminating against them and showing disadvantage to them. Who was the person who was supporting that position up at Weipa? None other than the minister himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important for us to understand that there is a particular sentiment around; it is not just a matter of philosophy. If the minister was aware of those types of communities that I am personally familiar with, he would understand the background to the development of the sentiment which gives rise to a powerful motivation on the part of those people to see everyone in the union. It does not take very long for people who are involved in industries of that kind to be affected by that sentiment and to understand its importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to draw attention to a man named Robbie Loane, who is employed at Mount Thorley. There is an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Herald </EMPHASIS>about this chap. He came from a small business background. He was one of 34 people selected out of 1,200 applicants for a job at Mount Thorley. He said that he had no background in unions; he had not supported unions and there was no particular support on his part for unions. But he said:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">It was that fellow's own experience which caused him to adopt that position. If the government and the minister fail to understand that sentiment and act in accordance with it and show respect for it, the sort of problems that they have been having will simply continue and compound. It is important that those attitudes and those experiences of working people be respected.

This House has been either inadvertently or deliberately misled&mdash;we do not yet know which and we do not yet know by whom, but misled it has been and misled massively. This is a case of smart alecs being caught out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the evidence for the fact that we have a cover&hyphen;up here? Let us take the starting point of this particular cover&hyphen;up. Members will recollect that, when ministerial travel allowance statements were previously tabled in this House and there was an element of a repayment involved in a minister's position, an asterisk was placed alongside their names with advice as to the amount that they repaid as a result of having effectively misclaimed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a coincidence about that asterisk. It was placed only against members of the former government in reporting in this place. It must be said that that particular inadvertence did not in fact relate to any degree of misclaiming of an entitlement that had been determined by the parliament or by the government, but by a convention that had been put in place by the previous government that, from a particular point during an election campaign, unless circumstances otherwise indicated, that should not be&mdash;</PARA>

I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that, on any commonsense understanding of the standing orders, it is quite clear that this whole presentation by the Leader of the Opposition is a device to avoid the normal operation of the standing orders and should be dealt with either by a ruling from you or, in the event of you not being persuaded by this presentation, a motion that the member be not further heard.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to have the opportunity to make a contribution. It has been a long time since the parliament has been full when I have made a speech and I am a little overcome. In fact, it is actually worse than that because I was planning to be sitting here quietly for half an hour listening while the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) spoke, making some notes to take the opportunity to rebut the arguments that she put forward. But I am not going to have that opportunity now, so I am a little embarrassed by that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was rather disappointed that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) took the opportunity that he did to obviously flout the standing orders or at least the spirit of the standing orders. The matters may well be matters that he may wish to raise in this House. He, when he was leader of the House, frequently pulled us into line on those sorts of matters when we were in opposition, so he knows that there are many facilities available to him to pursue the matters that he wishes to pursue. I do not deny that he might wish to pursue them but I believe that the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) was absolutely right in making the point that the Leader of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8219"> Opposition was flouting the rules and he should have done better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matter that I understood was that the government was concerned to have this bill passed through the House this evening. There was a suggestion that members might keep their speeches short. I have not been told whether that is still to be the case or not but that was my understanding. Perhaps the whip might let me know as I make my remarks whether they need to be curtailed earlier than the 20 minutes that the time shows that I have allotted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the child care industry has grown largely unchecked because in recent years it has been underpinned by government largess. It is an industry that has grown because of the system which allowed it to grow. Something had to be done about it; something had to be done to bring that growth into perspective and to make sure that the problems that existed in it were fixed. I understand that the problems are exacerbated in south&hyphen;east Queensland. I understand that in some other parts of Australia the problems are not as bad as they are in south&hyphen;east Queensland. But I can tell you that we have a serious problem in the child care industry in south&hyphen;east Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The child care industry is now a multibillion dollar industry, accounting for .5 per cent of GDP, with government providing 60 per cent of the costs. That amounts to $1.5 billion that the government is putting into child care. Let us examine the question of why. In recent years, debate about early childhood has become complicated and confusing. But there is no doubt in my mind&mdash;and I would have been interested to see whether this was an issue the member for Jagajaga might have taken up&mdash;that parent involvement gives children the best start in life whilst it also brings deep satisfaction to their parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recently read a book by Dr Peter Cook entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Early Child Care&mdash;Infants and Nations at Risk</EMPHASIS>. One paragraph from that book rather sums up my philosophy on child care. Dr Cook says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be obvious that it goes against nature for mothers to be put under pressure to hand over 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their infants and toddlers to unrelated strangers for most of their waking hours.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Howard government is committed to giving families a real choice about how their children are cared for&mdash;and I mean real choice. This legislation that we have before us is entirely consistent with actions that this government has already taken to ensure that parents do get a real choice about the sort of care that their children receive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also consistent with the economic imperatives that this government faced when it came into government. I do not need to remind the House tonight that there were very serious economic problems faced by this government when it took office, problems which it inherited from the previous government. Expenditure on child care in that regard, like expenditure in many other areas, had to be reigned in. Already actions have been taken to limit child care assistance to 50 hours a week. There have been situations where exemptions can be gained from that particular limitation. Indeed, I think most people would regard 50 hours child care a week as being very generous. A number of other measures have already been implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have been interested to know what the member for Jagajaga was saying about the bill in respect of the 20-hour limitation which is being imposed on non-working parents' access to child care.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You might learn something.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I doubt very much that I would learn anything. But I would be interested to know whether the opposition is supporting the 20-hour limit. I assume they will be supporting the 20-hour limit. If they do not, they will look a tad hypocritical, having attempted when in government to impose a 12-hour limit on the access of non-working parents to child care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government in this legislation also imposes a limit of 7,000 on the number of new private child-care places eligible for child-care assistance in the two years 1998 and 1999. Once again, I have to assume that the opposition will support that limitation. Again, I would find it rather inconceivable if they were not to, even if they were only half&hyphen;aware of what the child&hyphen;care industry is about&mdash;and particularly considering the problems existing in the child&hyphen;care industry, as I was saying, in south-east Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In south&hyphen;east Queensland, child care has grown to the point where there child-care centres on almost every corner. In fact, they are a bit like corner stores; they have just sprung up everywhere. We now have an excess supply situation that is threatening the viability of existing child-care centres. So I am very pleased that this legislation proposes that 7,000 limitation for the years 1998 and 1999. Also, I need to foreshadow that I think there will be a need to give consideration to extending that limitation beyond those two particular years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been&mdash;and I am sure the member for Jagajaga would have gone into some detail about this&mdash;some concerns expressed, and in my view quite rightly and justifiably, by the industry about the complication or complexity of the changes and also about some of the particular impacts of the changes on the industry in south&hyphen;east Queensland. I need to say&mdash;and the members opposite have detected quite correctly that I would be consistent with the line that I have put throughout the eight years that I have been in this place&mdash;that I am not a great supporter of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the child&hyphen;care industry. I am not a fan of the child&hyphen;care industry by any means. I am in that quaint group in this place and outside that believes parent care is good for kids. I believe that parent care is the best care that money can buy for kids. Especially&mdash;and the member for Jagajaga will collapse when I say this&mdash;I believe mother care happens to be important to kids as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parents should be able to choose the care that they want for their children. I noticed that during my opening remarks there was much mirth opposite when I made those sorts of statements because, of course, my pro&hyphen;child or pro&hyphen;family views&mdash;and they are views that are shared by a large number of my colleagues here&mdash;are offensive to extreme feminists. I notice that Eva Cox, for instance, is one who said that women not back in the work force by the time their child is one-year-old are bludgers. That would describe, unfortunately, a very large number of women who choose not to return to work so soon&mdash;and my wife is one of them. That description is offensive to a large number of women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate about child care was hijacked for many years by the extreme feminists who dominated the previous government's policy making in this area, and the result was unchecked growth of an industry almost completely underpinned by government largess. As I said, it has risen almost exponentially over the years and it is now costing us $1.5 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government was elected with a mandate to fix up the problems in many areas, and child care is only one of those areas which has needed attention. I am pleased that this legislation is consistent with our underlying objective in this particular area&mdash;that is, to provide real choice for families; to enable families to make choices about the child care which best suits them. I would be interested to hear what members of the opposition have to say about this issue of choice. They have always been in favour of choice. But, essentially, they want to give families Hobson's choice, or their choice. The choice was that you could make any choice you like, as long as&mdash;</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8221"></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the sort of inane interjection I would expect from the member for Jagajaga. She does herself no service by identifying with the very few people who have driven this debate for so long. This legislation is part of the process of fixing up the problems that you created. You let this debate be hijacked all along by an ideological position that essentially downgraded the importance of families and which did not take into account the best interests of children. I can understand why you are sensitive about that. If I were in your position, I would be sensitive about it too. But the fact is that that is what you allowed to occur, that is what this debate will be about and that is what this legislation is about&mdash;fixing up the mess that you particularly left us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the minute that I really ought only to take, I will refer to the immunisation requirements in this particular legislation. I want to put on record my concerns about this. I understand that there is, I think, within the community a good deal of support for it. But, once again, my position on this issue would be that parents should have a choice about this particular matter. I do not believe that they do have a real choice about this issue. The act provides that children attending child care be fully immunised before any child-care assistance is payable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the act, parents can become conscientious objectors, but a strict test applies to that particular position being taken, and it is not certain yet exactly what the requirements will be. I understand that in part they would have to be counselled by a doctor, who presumably would tell them about the risks of not vaccinating, but not necessarily the risks of vaccinating. I will finish off.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Eva Cox was right when she spoke about this immunisation requirement. It irks me to say that she is right about anything, but she is right when she says that this adds what is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> essentially a health measure to already complicated arrangements that are in place for claiming child care. As she says, it will impact heavily on the poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I need to put those remarks on record. I know they are not consistent with the government or opposition positions, but I feel strongly that it is a matter of choice for parents. Seeing it is something that I subscribe to very strongly, then I think it should apply to the choice of whether your children are immunised or not. I have chosen to immunise mine. I am not against immunisation, but I have some concerns about the obligatory or the compulsory nature of this requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Child care is important. I assume there would be general agreement on that. In fact, nothing could be more important. Let us decide and be sure in this debate that this legislation is consistent, as I believe it is, with really finding what is best for children. There has been too much of the dog wagging the tail in the child&hyphen;care debate for too long. The debate has been hijacked, as I said, by those who have an agenda other than finding out what is best for children. I believe this legislation is broadly consistent with that very desirable objective.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate because of the commitment of the Labor Party to advancing child care for working families in this country&mdash;a commitment that we never shirked during our 13 years in office. During Labor's years in office, 1983 to 1996, there was a 500 per cent increase in Commonwealth funded child-care places. Labor's policies were about addressing needs, not cutting for the sake of cutting. What we were about was offering security to families and the ability for them to exercise choice in the work force, and we had to recognise that one of the barriers to people getting into the work force, which was how they could have their children cared for whilst they were so participating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contrast to Labor's commitment to child care, what have we got from the coalition government? A cut of $820 million in child care. And that is essentially what we are debating here tonight. For the sake of some point of reference, let me indicate to you what it costs an average family a week for child care. It costs $170 a week to participate in child care. But we have the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) defrauding the Commonwealth for that amount every night in Canberra&mdash;$154 a night and he has done it for 47 nights. It costs $170 a week for child care and the minister is defrauding the Commonwealth for that every night for 47 nights at least.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I stand to address the measures contained in the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R276">Child Care Payments Bill</XREF> , I am reminded that a major part of our job is to help our constituents carve their way through the red tape of bureaucracy. Absolutely nothing separates politicians from the people they serve when it comes to dealing with the bureaucracy. We all experience the same frustrations. The word bureaucracy tells the story. It means, according to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Webster's</EMPHASIS> :</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An unwieldy administrative system, burdened with excessive complexity and lack of flexibility.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What a perfect description of the Child Care Act this government inherited. I could be easily convinced that it would be easier to have a baby than it would be to work out the child-care entitlements. Currently, child-care assistance is paid direct to approved long day care centres by the Department of Health and Family Services, but the child-care cash rebate is paid direct to the family by the Health Insurance Commission. The commission is better known for its Medicare role, which is why parents claiming their child-care cash rebate have had to apply to a Medicare office as opposed to the Department of Health and Family Services. Many, of course, have not known this; nor, sadly, have they been advised by either organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thankfully, the  Child Care Payments Bill 1997  tidies up this split system merry-go-round. As laid down in this bill, both the child-care assistance and the child-care rebate will be paid through the one agency. This will be the newly formed Centrelink, the one&hyphen;stop shop which will absorb our local Social Security offices while taking over many other government services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we took over government 18 months ago we inherited an outdated and out of control child-care system. The Child Care Act dates back to 1972 when taxpayer funded child-care assistance was virtually unheard of. The government's first move in the early 1970s was logical and involved providing capital funding to help establish childminding facilities in the suburbs where they were sorely needed. We have pretty well turned a complete cycle with an overabundance of centres in some areas and not enough in others. Child care has grown into a massive 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8228"> industry, both public and private. As a result, the system has been patched and filled so many times that even a person with the wits to program a VCR would have trouble with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly have a great deal of sympathy for the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) whose job it has been to completely restructure the child-care system. Some of the changes she has made have had predictable reaction in the community. Community funded centres want more funds and privately run centres want less competition. But everyone agreed the system was badly in need of an overhaul and concede that the changes made by this government have made child care accessible to more low income families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rationalising child-care assistance has not been an easy task and this bill resolves some of the more minor but vital aspects. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS> One of those aspects involves the introduction of a limit of 20 hours per week of taxpayer funded care for non&hyphen;working parents. This change met with unqualified support by my community in south-east Brisbane. There was one memorable story in our local paper of a non-working mother who was annoyed as the cut in hours from 50 hours per week to 20 hours per week meant that she would lose a fair amount of her leisure time. But, otherwise, the taxpayers of Griffith were happy their funds were assisting working parents and not being used for baby&hyphen;sitting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill amends one aspect of that cut to 20 hours for the parents of children who have special needs. I do not believe anyone in our community of Griffith would begrudge extending assistance to a family with a child who has special needs. I commend the Minister for Family Services for extending child&hyphen;care assistance to not just the child with the disability but also its brothers and/or sisters. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS> This change will mean much needed relief for the parents and will also assist the children by giving them time in another caring and safe environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addressing the many aspects of the child&hyphen;care system, which sorely needed reform, this Child Care Payments Bill also attacks the emotive issue of immunisation. I have made it clear to my electorate of Griffith that I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> support our program for the immunisation of our children, I have produced immunisation charts which I have delivered to child&hyphen;care centres, preschools, kindergartens, medical centres and pharmacies. Without exception everyone has been supportive of the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment to the Child Care Payments Bill makes it easier for parents to ensure that their child has been immunised before placing them in child care. The Child Care Payments Bill as it currently stands does not give parents a period of grace when they make a retrospective claim for a child&hyphen;care payment. Following these changes, a family will be given the time to meet the immunisation requirements, which will be of special benefit to those who do not use child care on a regular basis. This does not mean that they can avoid having their child immunised&mdash;quite the contrary. Any subsequent claim will be rejected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill&mdash;in particular the introduction of a limit on the number of new, private sector child care places in the next two years&mdash;brings some coherence to a system which had grown with almost carefree abandon. Recently I spent time contacting all child&hyphen;care facilities in my electorate. I spoke to the managers of community long day care centres and the operators of private centres. Both expressed concern at the growing number of private facilities opening in the electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community based long day care centres admitted that they were losing customers to the private centres. Established private centres expressed concern that new centres opening were aiming to entice customers from existing centres. In other words, unchecked funding by the previous government has allowed the caring of children to become big business, and competition in some areas is rife. Queensland has the highest per capita number of private long day care places of any state in Australia&mdash;74,600 places in all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Too many centres in one area cannot be to the advantage of the children as spreading the child&hyphen;care dollar can only result in the watering down of services. This bill not only places a limit on the number of new, private sector child&hyphen;care places eligible for government assistance but also introduces a planning 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8229"> system. The government has limited control over the forces of the marketplace but, if a planning system is put in place, the private sector, the community sector and, ultimately, all families using child&hyphen;care facilities will benefit.</PARA>

I support the need for government funded child care, and I have great admiration for those supermums of the 1970s who worked and had no government assistance at all, but if we do not take a long, close look at the way the industry is going we will find ourselves with an overabundance of child&hyphen;care centres and not enough customers.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to this Child Care Payments Bill 1997 today, I am sure that everyone, even those on the other side of this great chamber, would agree that the people of Australia are our greatest assets; although, listening to the performance we have had here tonight, I am not quite sure whether that introduction is still relevant. But I would like to think that in the future the members on the other side of the House will have a bit more decorum. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8232">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it is in our children that we find the greatest hope for our future. That is why at the very heart of the Howard government's social policy is a fundamental commitment to get a better deal for families&mdash;a fairer deal that helps to give our children both social and economic stability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Experts consider that the early years of a child's life are the most important for their development. Indeed, these formative years of childhood are invaluable. They are significant because it is during this time that parents can create the secure and loving family environment that gives our children the best chance to achieve their childhood dreams. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My personal view as a mother is that often the best care and upbringing a child can receive is one where the primary caregiver&mdash;and that predominantly is still considered to be the woman&mdash;comes from within the family environment. But it would be insensible not to acknowledge that because of different circumstances an increasing number of women wish, or indeed need, to enter the work force. For these women, the possibility for child care to be provided outside the home by a non&hyphen;parental figure is a necessity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parents who seek the assistance of professional child&hyphen;care workers do so for a variety of reasons. One of these is to heighten a child's social and educational developmental process through interaction with other children of a similar age. Yet Arleen Leibowitz, in an article on child care last year, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the research on the educational value of child care, most families see day care as a means of freeing the mother's time for market work.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is why the Howard government, through legislation introduced as part of the 1996&hyphen;97 budget and through the bill we are debating in this place today, is giving priority of access to child care for families where parents either work or are seeking a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, those taking part in schemes such as work for the dole or who are undertaking study or training to improve their opportunities of securing paid work have the same access. Therefore, it follows that child&hyphen;care assistance should, in the main, be targeted at working parents with dependent children. This 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government's philosophy is to foster a child&hyphen;care system that helps people who have the greatest need to secure the assistance they require.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to one of the many reforms that the Child Care Payments Bill 1997 seeks to introduce, namely, the limiting of child&hyphen;care assistance to 20 hours per week for each child in non&hyphen;work related care. By doing this, the government demonstrates that it is not in the business of providing respite from the responsibilities of parenthood over and above what is considered acceptable by the tax paying community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parents whose primary responsibility is the rearing and caring of their offspring utilise the child&hyphen;care system, on average, for 14 hours per week. Therefore, a cap of 20 hours per week as stated in this legislation is supported by many who serve in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes being debated today as part of this bill seek to give parents the right to choose the level of care that they consider appropriate. It also seeks to ensure that the system in which child&hyphen;care payments are made and distributed is compatible with a hectic family life. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government recognises that raising a family can at times be demanding. This government does not want to make the job of parenting any more difficult. We do not want a quagmire of bureaucratic processes for mums and dads to battle with before being able to receive the child&hyphen;care benefits they are entitled to. That is why the application, provision and appeals procedures for child&hyphen;care payments will soon be made through one agency, the new Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency's Centrelink, currently still known to most people as the Department of Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From January 1998, families applying for child&hyphen;care benefits will have to lodge only one form at one government agency. This is good news for parents, who will find the centralised method of lodging paperwork for all aspects of the benefits system much more convenient than is their current experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The long&hyphen;term strategy of the Howard government is to implement a child&hyphen;care 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8233"> system that serves our families and children well into the next century. This is in stark contrast to the previous government's policy on child care, which showed that those opposite had, and still have, a complete lack of vision. It was the intention of Labor to apply only quick fix solutions to our most pressing family concerns. That is why, on coming to government, we in the coalition have sought to redress the unacceptable situation of an undersupply of child&hyphen;care centres in some areas and an oversupply in others, a situation, I would suggest, that is most unacceptable to parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government's intention is to rectify this inefficiency. We will do this by creating a child&hyphen;care system that is flexible enough to meet the emerging needs of most families. Simultaneously, it will provide the required framework to ensure our primary objective of creating an effective and efficient child&hyphen;care system. That is why this bill seeks to introduce measures aimed at confining the number of new child&hyphen;care places to areas where they are most needed. This move is welcomed by responsible child&hyphen;care providers because they understand and acknowledge that controlled growth is essential if the industry is to reach its full potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1996&hyphen;97 budget the government introduced legislation to encourage community based long day care centres to become more efficient and cost competitive with their private sector counterparts. This government has offered additional funding to such centres so they can obtain financial planning advice which may assist them with undertaking restructuring. Measures such as this will ultimately bring benefit to the community in the form of more productive use of taxpayer subsidies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure is consistent with the finding of the 1996 child&hyphen;care task force interim report, which identified that one of the national goals for child&hyphen;care provision is for quality services to be provided at the least cost for that required quality. The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Value for money is the appropriate goal for families and governments. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would suggest that the opposition takes heed of this because it is this goal that the government most certainly concurs with.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS>  The coalition government has also been instrumental in developing a new information system to meet the planning and access needs of both service providers and parents alike. In an ideal world with perfect information, people would be equipped to make perfectly rational choices. It is then the duty of government, in this imperfect world, to ensure that an adequate level of information is made available. This will equip all concerned to make an informed decision in the best interests of the family. The national child&hyphen;care information strategy seeks to provide just that measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In concluding my comments on this bill before us, I wish to bring the attention of the members in this place to some further practical illustrations of the Howard government's commitments to families in action.</PARA>

Seventy thousand low and middle income families will benefit from the provision of outside school hours care services at a higher rate of child&hyphen;care assistance than before. More good news, I would suggest, for Australian families and particularly those constituents in my electorate of Canning. As previously mentioned, the streamlining of child&hyphen;care benefit assessments, payments and appeals procedures within one government department will assist everyone who operates within the system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Child Care Payments Bill 1997  will go a long way in delivering a child&hyphen;care system that is better targeted, more effective and more efficient.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was speaking very directly about child care. I was speaking about the 20 weeks of salary of a worker in child care&mdash;it is a very fundamental child&hyphen;care question&mdash;or the whole year of adult child&hyphen;care fees&mdash;$8,500&mdash;that would amount to the same as the amount that was claimed for travel allowance by the minister, over and above the proper entitlement. One whole year of child&hyphen;care fees&mdash;a massive distortion of priorities!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the people of Australia are called upon to assess a government, one of the things you would think they might assess is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> how its actions reflect the priorities which it sets. One of the actions is the standards it applies to itself and the standards it applies to others. We have in this bill, in the context in which it is being debated, a very serious, sad and profound example of double standards which I think would appal the people of Australia. I think they would be seriously, grievously concerned about the fact that, on the same day, a bill is being brought into this House in the context of a whole program of calculated attacks and cutbacks in child care and of fees in community owned centres increasing by $18 per child place per week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In four states the weekly fee for one child in full-time care is $170 or more. We heard on the news tonight that child care is costing more than private schools in some states and in some circumstances. More than four families in each centre are having to reduce their hours or have left the centre. More than 25 per cent of centres have had to reduce their staff, costing more jobs in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Seventy&hyphen;four per cent of parents are exiting care, citing increased fees as the reason. Sixty&hyphen;seven per cent of families are leaving centres to use informal care, at great risk to those children. Seventy&hyphen;six per cent of parents are reporting that their fees are due to increase again before the end of this year. All those points establish that a very serious situation is confronting our child-care centres, a situation of massive cuts to funding&mdash;massive, unfair, unreasonable and continuing cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Upon measuring that, you see that that is the priority the government applies to the people of Australia in need: cuts, increases in fees and denial of access. The standard it applies to itself is largesse. It says, `Don't worry what the law says, just apply. If you get caught out, we'll come into the parliament and cover it up. We will come into the parliament&mdash;'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to report tonight on a meeting I attended on Sunday at Bowman Hall. This was a rally of people against Badgerys Creek airport. There has already been extensive coverage of the wide number of people who attended this meeting organised by Charlie Lowles, the Mayor of Blacktown City Council. It was also attended by quite a number of other surrounding mayors, by two state ministers and by my federal colleague the member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I undertook at that meeting to bring back a message to the parliament: the unanimous, overwhelming view of the many hundreds, if not thousands, of people who attended that meeting that they did not want an airport at Badgerys Creek. Indeed, they did not want an airport in the Sydney Basin. In particular, they were not in favour of option B. Those Liberal ministers and backbenchers who favour option B should clearly hear that message. They were not in favour of option A, nor of option C. And why would they be?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The summary EIS that was released by Minister Sharp&mdash;how long will he be the minister?&mdash;is very deficient. It ignores serious implications with regard to the air we breathe, endangered and vulnerable flora and fauna, and noise. I thought the most poignant point made at that meeting was that 63 schools will be adversely affected by this airport&mdash;under any option. If honourable members opposite do not care about that, that translates to 30,000 students. That is a very conservative figure. In the western suburbs of Sydney, we understand that we suffer from educational disadvantage already. This airport will only add to that educational disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the information provided in the EIS, no information was provided as to how the noise levels will vary during one day or even seasonally for different climatic conditions or even operational conditions. The only 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> conclusion to be drawn from these averages is that for at least 50 per cent of the year tens of thousands of residents of western Sydney who thought they would not be affected by aircraft noise will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this EIS, the minister is using the Australian noise exposure concept methodology. This is the very methodology which was used in the third runway debacle and which was completely discredited and criticised. The very same methodology is being used in the Badgerys Creek EIS summary that was released by the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If members opposite are not concerned about endangered plant species, let me say that 31 species are vulnerable in western Sydney and will be affected by this airport.

On 25 March 1995, on the night of the state election, Bob Carr pledged on television in black and white&mdash;for those people who do not have colour televisions&mdash;that the Australian Labor Party would deliver to the people of Sydney the Badgerys Creek airport option.

We will take that idea but we are still going to build Badgerys Creek.' The Labor Party have said that when the heat is turned on, but this is after having made numerous promises to the people of Sydney that they would build Badgerys Creek.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the irony of all this is that, unless the transport minister had drawn attention to the overpayment, nothing that the administrative services minister's special investigators could have found out&mdash;or even the FBI&mdash;could have detected those overpayments, even under the allegedly tighter system put in place in May this year to supposedly make members' entitlements more accountable. Why? Because the minister uses a car to travel between his home base and Canberra&mdash;as do I. There is no way of cross checking travel and accommodation at the Sunday evening or Thursday evening end of a sitting week. The system relies on the good intent, the honesty and, it now seems, the memory of members. That is just not good enough nor is it the accountability the public demands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So let us not stand up here in the sort of pious exhibition of self righteousness that we have seen tonight, desperately scrambling to reach the higher moral ground, because the public knows the system is rotten&mdash;that in itself it is a cover-up&mdash;and they demand changes. Let us not forget that, if Senator Colston had not, to use the phrase, ratted on his colleagues, none of this would have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> happened. I asked in March that the House of Representatives travel allowances be tabled in the interests of consistency and fairness&mdash;fairness to Senator Colston and Senator Woods&mdash;and so they were at the end of May, disgracefully, for the very first time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know there are many members on both sides of the House concerned at the looseness of the system and the lack of accountability. They feel they are being tarred with the same brush, and so we are. The public out there just becomes more and more cynical, especially when it appears no attempt has been made to explain that a repayment was made because a mistake occurred and an apology offered. No, like the child we are trying to impress with our leadership, we hide the error and hope we are not found out and, when we are inevitably found out, the damage is so much the worse for us all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only the travel allowances that is of concern to the public, it is also the trips during a first term, the three-yearly junkets and the lack of public accountability for most of it which gets up the nose of the battlers out there that each party pretends to lay claim to. It just happens that one Ted Mack spoke at a dinner I held in Orange recently. Let the parliamentary ghost of the former parliament's conscience echo around this chamber tonight as I quote from that speech. Mr Mack said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the last 10 years while calling for the community to reform, tighten their belts, to get rid of inefficient management and work practices, government has simultaneously expanded enormously as have the salaries, perks and lurks of politicians and senior bureaucrats.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The expansion has almost been in proportion to rising unemployment and mirrored the increasing disparity between rich and poor. In the recent federal Budget most items were reduced or increased only slightly . . . except for one item, the cost of running federal Parliament. It jumped by 12 per cent or 50 million dollars. Federal Parliament at a cost of over 3 million dollars a day is the most expensive and unwatched program in history.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I only wish, Mr Speaker, that parliament tonight had been the most watched in Australia. Then the battlers could have seen the sanctimonious self&hyphen;justification on the one hand and the desperate avoidance of accountability on the other that passes for party politics in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to pay tribute to the lives of two remarkable women who passed away earlier this month. The first was born on 27 August 1910 at Skopje in what was then Yugoslavia, now the capital of Macedonia. The youngest of three children to Albanian parents, Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu was later to become Mother Teresa. At 12 she wanted to become a nun and at 18 she travelled to Ireland and joined the Order of Loreto. A year later she travelled from Ireland to India and joined a convent school in Calcutta, where she worked as a teacher, mainly of geography.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1937 after taking her final vows she became headmistress of St Mary's School there. In 1948 after a calling two years earlier she elected to devote her life to the poor. She left her order, became an Indian citizen and in 1950, after receiving permission, founded the Missionaries of Charity. That became international in 1965.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, 5,000 sisters, 500 brothers and four million lay workers continue her work throughout the world in 500 orphanages, in leprosy homes and in rescue centres in over 100 countries on five continents. She took the usual vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, to which she added `to put oneself entirely and wholeheartedly at the free service of the poor'. She became a living god to millions of Indians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In Calcutta alone her work feeds 500,000 families a year and her schools teach 20,000 slum children. Her clinics treat 90,000 lepers, and more than 27,000 people who might have died on the streets unnoticed have at least met a dignified end to their lives because of her work. She said that the `worst poverty of all was to reject a human soul in need'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most nights she went to sleep about midnight. She would rise at 4 a.m. to wash in a bucket in her small room before praying and having a meagre diet of dhal and rice. She gave away the habit for the sari and sandals&mdash;the blue&hyphen;bordered sari which became her trademark and the trademark of her order. She insisted that, of the moneys that were donated 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to her, not more than two per cent should be spent on administration. The sisters in her order could have only two saris&mdash;one to wear and one to wash. `To be able to love the poor and know the poor we must be poor ourselves,' she said. Her work became a symbol for what the rest of us aspire to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unexpected death of the other woman I wish to mention touched the hearts of many millions around the world. On her death the world displayed the most amazing outpouring of sorrow on the death of an individual that possibly the world has ever seen. I talk, of course, of Diana, Princess of Wales. For all her faults and foibles&mdash;and, boy, she did have a lot of them, like most of the rest of us here&mdash;she was nevertheless a very modern woman who was very much in touch with, and she related to, all the strata of society, especially young women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although she came from the opposite end of the social spectrum to Mother Teresa, Diana also embraced a number of unfashionable causes. She was genuinely interested in the poor and disadvantaged children, but she pioneered the acceptance by society of HIV victims, drug addicts and lepers and she took up the cause to rid the world of landmines. Because she was such a high profile person, her acceptance and championing of these causes gave them a respectability and a focus that nobody else could do. Her sincerity, genuine interest and love shone through in the attention she gave to the victims and unfortunates that she met when devoting her time to these causes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you combine her caring with her much admired duties as a mother and the fact that she was arguably the most photogenic female the world has ever known, you have a recipe for a legend. Her life was one of a vividly coloured flower amongst a mass of late autumnal browns and greys. She was a comet in a sky of stationary stars. Our hearts go out to her sons, William and Harry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The world has been enriched by the lives of both Diana and Mother Teresa, who became firm friends in the common cause that they had in so many of these issues. The world is impoverished by the passing of these two

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate on the adjournment to object most strenuously to a statement that was tabled in this House at 8 p.m. tonight by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull). In that statement it was brought to the notice of this House that on 29 May the minister had tabled details of travelling allowances. Yet it took him from 29 May until 23 September to come in and say that two ministers had included corrections and now he was notifying the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that that is the most shameful, fraudulent way to cover up a minister or any other member&mdash;it does not matter on which side of the parliament he or she sits&mdash;taking money from this House. Can you tell me of any member of this House or of the general public that in the last 10 months had $900 extra in their bank account and said, `Excuse me, dear, it's just $900 more I have taken from the government. Oops! I had better give it back'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask this House, the Minister for Administrative Services and Minister Sharp (he may be Sharp by name but not sharp by nature): would Minister Sharp have brought this forward, would he have paid that back, if it had not been for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> story that is going to appear tomorrow under Laurie Oakes's headline?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is fact in that story is that $8,740 was returned to this parliament. What is fact is that Minister Sharp claimed $29,205 for 144 nights. What is fact is that he had to shamefully reduce that to 97 nights and cut off the reminder. What is fact is that he received $900 extra a month over that 10&hyphen;month period, and yet all of a sudden it was brought to his notice in May that maybe he had made a mistake. What is fact is that when all members of parliament were asked to have their accounts tabled in this House we were all shown copies. What is fact is that previous ministers of another government had asterisks next to their names where they were required 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to pay money back because they had inadvertently claimed it during an election period when it was not permitted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is fact is that neither of these ministers&mdash;Mr Jull has named only one of them&mdash;has come into this House with any asterisk next to their name. What is fact is the shameful, fraudulent cover-up that this House has experienced in the debate and in the procedure tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All it required of Minister Sharp was an apology. All it required was for the man to be man enough to stand up in this House and say, `I am sorry. It has been brought to my attention that I inadvertently overlooked 47 nights when I was sleeping in bed instead of being here in Canberra.' What is a fact is that he should have got up and been man enough to apologise and say on 29 May, when Minister Jull tabled those reports in this House, `I have made an error. I have made a blue. I am now going to give you back nearly $9,000.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The way this House carried on tonight when we were debating a child&hyphen;care bill was one of the most objectionable displays of a shameful lack of integrity by government that I have ever seen. I have been in all forms of government for 25 years and never have I seen anything so blatant as what happened tonight. We saw a minister sneak in here tonight at 8 p.m. and put down one piece of paper, signed by Mr Jull and dated 23 September. Do you want to see it? I bet you have not even got a copy of it. That was what was slipped into this House tonight. That was slipped in to cover up the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister is really saying, `Oops, sorry about that. I know I told you on 29 May that I tabled all the details of the travelling allowances made to ministers, parliamentary secretaries and opposition office holders. Oops, I now wish to advise this House that the statement in respect of two ministers'&mdash;one minister named, Minister Sharp; the other one we are running a book on, by the way&mdash;`included corrections made by them to ensure the record accurately reflected travel undertaken.' He never even had the guts to read it out. He just came in and left it on the table and said, `That's what we're doing.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8243">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we had a debate demanding that the minister come forward so we can clean this House up and see what is going on. That was not permitted. That was not allowed. Everyone ran for cover. It is about time that you all had some guts and stood up to be counted. It is true what the member for Calare (Mr Andren) said: we all get tarnished with the same brush. If we want to be respected in the community, we have to show respect to this parliament, we have to respect the laws of this parliament and we have to have ministers in executive government who are honest and scrupulous in their dealings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) talked about what Sharp is supposed to be doing with Badgerys Creek. God help the people of Western Sydney; he cannot even get his bookkeeping right. He cannot even pay and claim the money correctly, yet he is going to be directing Badgerys Creek airport and the EIS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I can say is that no-one has ever experienced the sleazy, slimy way in which the Minister for Administrative Services put this to us, which, by the way, was only brought to his notice because probably the one DAS worker still left working in the public service put out a memo saying, `Excuse me, we haven't been paid back the money from Minister Sharp. Is someone going to claim it back from him?' If it was not for that, we would not have even had this claim tonight.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise concern about the ability of people behind bogus organisations to utilise a major loophole in our laws to claim exemption from taxes and other charges on the basis of religious and/or charitable exemptions. There are many organisations pursuing altruistic activities which are to be applauded and encouraged. These include genuine religions which have been the driving force behind much beneficial and benevolent activity, including the propagation of values, the education of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> children, caring for the sick and elderly and other activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an academic paper published in 1990 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Leap of faith: religious freedom in Australia</EMPHASIS>, the current Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner, Chris Sidoti, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Religious organisations receive significant indirect financial support . . . through their tax exempt status worth tens of millions of dollars annually which represents subsidies by Australia's governments for religious activities provided to groups which meet the High Court's definition of religion.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The High Court's definition of religion was set out in the case of the Church of the New Faith v. The Commissioner for Payroll Tax in Victoria. It is a very general definition referring to any belief in a supernatural being, thing or principle and the acceptance of canons of conduct to give effect to that belief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1984, in response to a question from Senator Hamer about the availability of tax benefits for religions, Senator Walsh answered that, legally, the advancement of religion is a charitable activity. A 1996 tax office document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Club Pack</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The word charitable has a technical, legal meaning . . . an organisation will be considered charitable only if it its main purpose falls within one of the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. Relief of poverty;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The advancement of education;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. The advancement of religion; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. Other purposes beneficial to the community.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The same document states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Charitable institutions for the advancement of religion include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Organisations established to build and maintain a building of worship, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Organisations established to provide stipends to the clergy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These criteria for eligibility for tax benefits are both very general and easily satisfied. I am concerned that the Commonwealth is losing significant revenues and is, indeed, in some cases indirectly subsidising the activities of many dubious organisations with dubious offshoots that are, in fact, the antithesis of religion and are doing great harm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) detailed one charlatan's 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8244"> financial manoeuvres in this place on 12 February this year, and I commend him for it. This was one Neil Thomas of the so-called Grace Church.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another example of this kind of fraud appeared in an extensive article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 24 December 1993 entitled `Prophet and loss: how an Australian cult leader duped the faithful'. It concerned one William Kamm, who calls himself `the Little Pebble'&mdash;a chip off the old block of St. Peter. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald </EMPHASIS>detailed how Kamm's allegedly non-profit public company required members to hand over all their money  and property, received donations from around the world channelled into numerous bank accounts and required members to make regular and onerous contributions to his cause out of their income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 8 November 1983 Senator Zakharov referred to the decision of the Church of the New Faith and asked Senator Evans whether the judgment extended the ability of individuals or groups to claim religious status as a means of avoiding payment of rates and taxes as a means of circumventing legislation which otherwise would limit their activities. In his reply, Senator Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear from the . . . judgment that bodies which are no more than hoaxes or parodies of religion will not be regarded as religious bodies.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What exemptions from taxes should be granted to religious bodies is a matter for decisions by governments, both federal and state.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Neil Thomas and `Little Pebble' examples demonstrate that no government has come to grips with this question of hoaxes and parodies of religion and, as a result, many people and organisations have been financially devastated. These frauds have found religion to be the perfect cloak for their activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my knowledge, this issue has not been canvassed in the parliament since Senator Evans replied to those questions in 1983. In the meantime, I believe that the number of bodies in Australia claiming to be religious has increased dramatically. I believe it is time to take stock of the situation to see whether the fairly relaxed position that was evidenced 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the early 1980s can still be justified. If there is a way to distinguish these organisations whose principal aim is to make money by posing as a religion, we need to find it. If a tightening of the criteria for eligibility is a possible route, we need to explore that route.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call upon the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to cause these issues to be fully investigated. I will also refer this issue to the taxation task force.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Standard Instrument Departure (SID) for aircraft departing to the north from Runway 34 for Perth:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aircraft departing on this SID now turn left one nautical mile, rather than the previous five nautical miles, north of Tullamarine Airport and track south, rather than north, of Sunbury.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Standard Instrument Departure for aircraft departing to the north from Runway 34 for destinations to the north&hyphen;east and south&hyphen;east:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 24 April 1997 aircraft departing on this SID turned 30 to the right after passing 1,500 feet on climb and after passing the northern end of the runway. These aircraft previously maintained runway heading until approximately six nautical miles north of the airport. The modification to the track was made to enhance safety by minimising the potential for conflict between departing and arriving aircraft. A secondary benefit flowing from this change is an increase in the traffic handling capacity of the runway by allowing less distance between some consecutive departures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Airservices Australia has since introduced a further minor modification to this track to avoid overflight of Oaklands Junction by departing aircraft.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aircraft arriving from the north on this STAR now turn onto an easterly heading approximately six nautical miles north of Tullamarine Airport. Previously aircraft arriving on this STAR turned onto a south&hyphen;easterly heading approximately ten nautical miles north of the airport. The modification to the track was made to enhance safety by minimising the potential for conflict between aircraft tracking to join the final approach to runway 27 and aircraft already on the final landing approach.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aircraft arriving from the west on this STAR previously took up an easterly heading from overhead Essendon Airport before turning left to intercept the approach path to runway 27. The modified track takes aircraft approximately 1.5 nautical miles south of Essendon Airport on an easterly heading before turning left onto a longer track to join the final landing approach to runway 27. The modification was made to allow aircraft to intercept the final approach path on a normal rate of turn compared with the previous, tighter turn.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes, my attention has been drawn to Mr Justice Wood's comments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The Government has an open mind on the value of a national drug summit. There are a number of initiatives currently in hand including the recently announced Prime Minister's Task Force to review the problem of illicit drugs. The Task Force will examine both supply and control and demand reduction issues including better allocation of federal resources, border controls, domestic law enforcement, community drug education and programs for users. It will report to the Government in September. In addition, the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy agreed at its 31 July 1997 meeting at Cairns that it would hold an extraordinary meeting in November over two days to review, inter alia, the national drug strategic framework and the progress of the National Expert Advisory Committee on Illicit Drugs. MCDS will receive a report on the development of a national heroin supply reduction strategy which is being prepared by the Senior Officers' Group of the Australasian Police Ministers' Council. In the course of this work, the members of that group will be consulting with appropriate agencies and groups including the National Drug Strategy Committee. All States and Territories have agreed that prior to the November meeting they will conduct consultations with key stakeholders and individual experts to allow them an opportunity to provide expert and community input to the meeting. I believe this process will provide an excellent opportunity for community groups to put forward their views, and to have those views presented to Ministers in a focused way in November.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) (a) Any legislation relaxing the law concerning the use of heroin would need to come within the "medical and scientific purposes" exception in the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961 as amended by the 1972 Protocol Amending the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961 (the Convention). Article 4 of the Convention is the general obligations article and requires parties to take the necessary and administrative measures to give effect to the Convention. Article 4(c) requires parties to the Convention to limit the production, manufacture, export, import, distribution of, trade in, use and possession of drugs of drugs to medical and scientific purposes. (b) The Convention came into force for Australia on 8 August 1975. (c) Australia would not need to take any steps to withdraw from the Convention so long as any relaxation of the law concerning the use of heroin complies with the "medical and scientific purposes" of the Convention. Denunciation is effected by notice to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and takes effect at a specified time thereafter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) This information is not available in precisely the form in which it is sought. A 1997 report by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)1 indicates that (a) of the 15,429 sentenced prisoners in prison throughout Australia on 30 June 1995 (National Prison Census Day&mdash;the latest data available), 1,694 were imprisoned for an offence or offences, the most serious of which related to illicit drugs2. (b) According to the same report, this represented 11.1 per cent of all sentenced prisoners on that day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) On the basis of an estimate by the Australian Institute of Criminology that it costs an average of $51,000 per year to maintain a prisoner in a penal institution in Australia, and assuming that the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8252"> number of prisoners incarcerated for drug offences remains unchanged throughout the year, it is possible to arrive at a total of $86,394,000 per year. It is not, however, known how representative the prisoner total may have been on Census Day 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) In response to international concerns regarding the high rates of importation of diacetylmorphine (heroin) into Australia3, the Commonwealth in 1953, by regulation, banned the importation of heroin. Within 12 months, all States had legislation to ban the possession, use, sale and manufacture of heroin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) The Government believes that Australia should conform to its treaty obligations. Any Federal, State or Territory legislation relaxing the law concerning the use of heroin would need to come within the "medical and scientific purposes" exception in the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) (a) Yes. (b) Yes. The Prime Minister's announcement of a Task Force of Commonwealth agencies to review the problem of illicit drugs will examine supply control and demand reduction issues. In addition, work is progressing in preparation for an extraordinary meeting of the MCDS in November, which will specifically focus on reviewing the national drug strategic framework and the progress of the National Expert Advisory Committee on Illicit Drugs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) I understand that Defence for Children International, Australia, approached the previous Government with a request to fund a workshop with relevant non&hyphen;government organisations and to prepare a non-government organisation report in response to Australia's First Report under the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr Sharp</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes. Possible sites for the second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek and the Holsworthy Military Reserve are being examined in the EIS process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Major airports recently built or currently being built at major cities overseas are generally located no more than 50 kilometres from the central business district.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) There are major disadvantages with locating a second airport at a site which is far removed from the centre of travel demand. The distance would have major adverse implications for travel times, cost and convenience, and connection with Sydney's existing airport. As a consequence, there would be a strong likelihood that passengers and airlines would be unwilling to use the second airport thereby further increasing the pressures on Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. For some sites, there would also be very significant costs associated with providing suitable road and rail access and linkages to other support services (such as a fuel line). For these reasons the Government is not considering possible sites outside the Sydney Basin for the second major Sydney airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The choice of a site for a new airport involves an assessment of a wide range of complex technical, economic and environmental issues. Valuable lessons can be learnt from overseas experience but each city must develop its own solution to reflect the characteristics of the local demand for airports, the city's unique geographic circumstances and economic opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The potential environmental impacts of the second Sydney airport will be considered in detail in the EIS.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) (a) and (b) Safety standards will not be compromised by the development and operation of the second airport. Airspace management issues are being taken into account in the EIS. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8254">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) (a) and (b) The probability of all airports in the Sydney Basin being closed by freak weather conditions is so low that it certainly could not justify the building of a second airport at Goulburn. In such extreme and unusual weather conditions, aircraft would generally either delay departure, wait in a holding pattern until the weather conditions abated or land at other regional or major airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10) (a) and (b) The impact of aircraft noise on the communities surrounding the Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy sites will be examined in detail in the EIS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(11) (a) and (b) The proposal is to consider the construction and operation of a second major international/domestic airport for Sydney at either Badgerys Creek or Holsworthy on a site large enough for future expansion of the airport if required. One option to be considered is the construction and operation of an airport based on two widely spaced parallel runways and supporting facilities capable of handling up to about 360,000 aircraft movements and 30 million passengers per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A range of scenarios for the growth in patronage at the second airport will be considered in the EIS.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Estimates of the size of the black economy can vary greatly, depending upon the definition used, and the methodological approach taken. Any estimate is very reliant on the assumptions underlying the analysis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (a) In a recent report from the Cash Economy Task Force it was noted that: "Currently, there is no official or reliable estimate of the size of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8257"> Australian cash economy or the revenue foregone. Academic studies estimate the cash economy to be between 3.5 % and 13.4 % of GDP. Using 1995&hyphen;96 GDP figures as a base and an effective average tax rate of 23%, these studies suggest that the annual amount of income tax revenue foregone could be between $3.9 billion and $15.1 billion."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)(b) Different methodological approaches for measuring the black economy for the UK, using 1970s data, have produced estimates ranging between 2 to 3 per cent of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)(c) I am not aware of any published estimate of the size of the underground economy in New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The extent of the black economy in any country is likely to reflect a number of factors, including the culture and attitude of the population towards paying tax, as well as the nature of the tax system itself. Addressing the impact of the black economy will involve a range of measures, including consideration of tax base issues. It is not sufficient to look at only one solution to the black economy because focusing on any one area in isolation would give an incomplete picture. Empirical evidence on the impact of measures to deal with the black economy is subject to considerable uncertainty because of the practical difficulties associated with accurate measurement in this area. However, there are strong conceptual grounds to believe that a broad indirect tax would increase revenue collected from the proceeds of the black economy, compared to an indirect tax levied over a narrower base.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Yes. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) (a) No. The United Nations General Assembly Special Session held in New York in June was not convened to consider the issue of setting binding targets for greenhouse gas emissions. The Special Session was called to consider progress in meeting the objectives established under Agenda 21, and broadly the Special Session did not consider matters of detail where they are being negotiated or dealt with through other forums or conventions. In regard to greenhouse issues the Assembly ultimately agreed that climate change is "one of the biggest challenges facing the world in the next century" but that it would be inappropriate for UNGASS 51 to "seek to predetermine" results prior to the Kyoto meeting in December.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) (b) No. Australia's Mission to the United Nations advises that 24 Heads of Government attended the session along with 22 Heads of State and 178 Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) No. The summit was still underway when I arrived in the United States.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes; to conduct a Rapid Deployment Exercise (RDEX) to RAAF Pearce to test No 81 Wing rapid deployment capabilities. While in Western Australia, the aircraft participated in urban counter&hyphen;terrorist training exercises with the Perth&hyphen;based Special Air Service Regiment (SASR), and training with the RAAF's flying school at Pearce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Current Defence Instructions require aircraft captains, air traffic control and maintenance personnel to ensure that unnecessary aircraft noise nuisance to the public is avoided during the operation of aircraft. Wherever possible, each operation is conducted to avoid flying over livestock and populated areas. If, because of this requirement, the efficiency and effectiveness of the operation may be unduly prejudiced, aircraft are flown with appropriate vertical and horizontal separation to minimise noise levels, or at such times that noise nuisance is unlikely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) No 77 Squadron senior executives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Twenty seven noise complaints were received by RAAF Pearce and one Ministerial representation on the matter was investigated by No 81 Wing RAAF Williamtown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The flights involved air support for SASR urban counter&hyphen;terrorist training involving the simulated delivery of precision weapons against targets in the Perth suburban area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Aircraft generally flew at 15,000 feet altitude. However, on occasions aircraft were required to descend to a minimum of 3,500 feet altitude because of weather conditions. This altitude was in excess of the minimum allowable 1,500 feet altitude over built&hyphen;up areas and the minimum safe altitude of 3,000 feet for the sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) No 77 Squadron conducted three sorties on Wednesday 18 June 1997. The flight times were 2.00 pm, 6.00 pm and 7.00 pm. Each sortie lasted approximately one and a half hours.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(11) Essentially, only people with an operational role in the exercise were informed of the impending activity. This was due to the `no notice' nature of the exercise. Prior knowledge of the deployment

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Is the Government working on the assumption that there will be a straight line projection increase in coal use worldwide, and that the use of alternative fuels, or adoption of significant energy saving strategies will be against Australia's economic interest.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The answer to both questions is no. World growth rates in coal production and consumption will vary, although overall they are predicted to increase significantly&mdash;a 50% rise from 1992 levels by 2010 is predicted by this year's International Energy Agency's Coal Information Report. Much of this will be driven by demand for electricity in Asia. The government does not believe that alternative fuels or energy saving is against our national interest: Australia has significant strengths in these areas such as an expanding LNG market, significant potential to increase uranium exports, and leading&hyphen;edge renewable energy expertise and technologies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The government's policy approach maximises our comparative advantage by efficiently taking advantage of our natural resources and economic base, and at the same time encouraging the development of a strong competitive advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) There have been several economic modelling studies that the government has consulted in the development of its climate change policy. Several studies have produced essentially similar results, indicating that Australia's costs in meeting uniform greenhouse targets are much higher than those of other Annex I countries. None of the current economic models estimates emission&hyphen;reduction benefits, so the issue of such estimates as being too high or too low is not applicable.</PARA>
