<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I rise on a matter of privilege. Mr Speaker, you, along with other members, may have seen in this morning's media three particular references to which I draw your attention. The first is in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  of Tuesday, 25 November on page 59 where it says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Pauline Hanson&hyphen;free for a while but you should know that the Ipswich Independent MP has recorded her will as an address to the nation. Channel Seven's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Witness</EMPHASIS>  program will broadcast excerpts tonight . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Fellow Australians&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">apparently, these are the opening words&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">if you are seeing me now, it means I've been murdered."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There are similar extracts from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  and from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> . From those extracts it appears that excerpts from a television program are to be shown which, I understand, are in some way inducing the fact that she may be assassinated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, I advised the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) that I intended to raise this matter. I draw your attention to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS>, 3rd edition, on page 696 where it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACTS CONSTITUTING BREACHES OF PRIVILEGE AND CONTEMPTS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By virtue of section 49 of the Constitution, the House has the ability to treat as a contempt:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . any act or omission which obstructs or impedes . . . (it)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the House&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in the performance of its functions, or which obstructs or impedes any Member or officer . . . in the discharge of his duty, or which has a tendency, directly or indirectly, to produce such results . . . even though there is no precedent of the offence.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Speaker, I would contend that any publication that asserts there is a threat to an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> individual's life, in this instance the threat suggesting that the member for Oxley might be assassinated, is such a breach of privilege. It brings this place into contempt; it brings the nature of a peaceful democratic system into contempt; and it raises the suggestion that there is another level of debate which induces violence as a form of resolving public debate and public issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, I would ask you two questions. Firstly, on behalf of the members of this place, will you contact Channel 7's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Witness</EMPHASIS> program and ask them to defer tonight's showing of any extract from this apparent TV program that has been filmed with, apparently, the honourable member for Oxley as a prime participant? Secondly, will you refer the question to the Committee of Privileges to determine whether or not there is in fact a breach of privilege in this issue? And, in your request to Channel 7, will you ask that no excerpt of this film be shown until such stage as the Committee of Privileges has had an opportunity to thoroughly examine the whole matter? In support of this matter, I tender for you three of today's papers: the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, and ask that you take those together with the excerpt from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> into account in this matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Watson for the wisdom behind his advice to me. The right honourable member for New England, of his own initiative, has raised some serious issues which trouble us all because we are, as we all know in this chamber, an open, extraordinarily vigorous 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and combative chamber. Politics in this country is pursued with enormous vigour, but the spear points historically in this parliament come from words. Reputations can be made and destroyed in the blinding flash of an eye. The escalation even in emotive terms of such unbelievable publicity, which we have all seen today, I am sure we all find deeply offensive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not aiming in any way whatsoever to politicise this debate. I am certainly not going to take extraordinary actions to vilify the honourable member for Oxley by naming her and withdrawing her from the services of the House because I would be only adding credence to the already totally unacceptable behaviour that she has pursued. I will take the right honourable member for New England's questions on notice and I will advise the House further of my decision later this day.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4T4">Mr MELHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Attorney-General. I refer to reports that the government has had advice from Chief General Counsel, Henry Burmester, since July this year stating that the government's native title bill risked breaching the Racial Discrimination Act. Attorney, can you confirm that the government has received this advice? If so, how could the Prime Minister tell the parliament on 20 November, `The bill is not racially discriminatory'?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="11164" SPEAKER="Williams, Daryl, MP" NAMEID="7V5" ELECTORATE="Tangney" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Attorney-General" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V5">Mr WILLIAMS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has, as members of the former Labor government would know, taken legal advice at every stage in the development of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . Advice was taken prior to the development of the 10-point plan. Advice was taken on the 10-point plan. Advice was taken on the draft bill that was circulated. Advice was taken on the exposure draft bill that was subject to the PJC inquires. Advice is continuing to be taken even today on different aspects of the bill. Even the opposition is probably taking advice on different aspects of the bill today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11165">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know what advice is referred to in the article that the member for Banks referred to, but I am going to offer the traditional response. I am not going to speculate about advice that the government may or may not have received nor am I going to provide any of that advice. On many occasions, the previous government declined to say whether it had legal advice on an issue and what that advice was. That is, of course, the traditional response. Let me quote an eminent person&mdash;former Senator Gareth Evans. On 28 August 1995, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nor is it the practice or has it been the practice over the years for any government to make available legal advice from its legal advisers made in the course of the normal decision making process of government, for good practical reasons associated with good government and also as a matter of fundamental principle.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Advice to government is just that; it is advice and the government receives a wide range of it. There is no shortage of contradictory legal advice on this subject.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government in developing the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997  sought to recognise and implement the Mabo decision and the Wik decision and sought to respect and comply with the Racial Discrimination Act and related international obligations. At every stage those matters were taken into account. The government believes that a fair and equitable balance of different interests has been achieved in the bill. People seem to forget that the 1993 native title bill was also strongly criticised for allegedly breaching the Racial Discrimination Act and the racial discrimination convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current bill is being criticised particularly in relation to the validation regime and allowing native title to be affected and extinguished in the future. But the current act, passed by Labor with the assistance of the Democrats and the Greens, also included a validation regime, but it was much more extensive and also allowed future extinguishment. The government's bill maintains a provision, section 7, inserted in the 1993 bill by Labor is sufficient to ensure an appropriate relationship between the native title legislation and the racial discrimination legislation. The opposition's position is inconsistent and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hypocritical. When they passed the bill in 1993, it was good enough for them. When the government seeks to amend the bill and apply the same principles, it is not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue is being raised as a delaying tactic. The opposition, unfortunately, in the public interest have been unable to get their act together. You declined to proceed with the debate in the Senate yesterday. You have a fractured caucus. Where are your amendments? The government's bill is to be commended.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Can the Treasurer advise the House of the implications for employment generating Australian businesses as a result of the continuing uncertainty in relation to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> .

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Eden Monaro for his question. Most people in Australia would know that the original Native Title Act is not working. After four years, 660 claims and nearly $200 million spent on it, we have still had only one determination of native title on the Australian mainland, notwithstanding all of the uncertainty that is associated with the Native Title Act. The President of the Business Council has said that continuing uncertainty about land tenure detracts significantly from Australia's ability to draw much needed investment. The President of the Minerals Council, Mr Nick Stump, said on 19 November 1997:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Native Title Act's inability to deliver workable outcomes for time sensitive minerals investment decisions is inhibiting further economic development of Australia's largest export industry. It is contributing to the diversion of exploration dollars offshore to new greenfields development.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Why would Australia want to send its investment offshore when we have some of the best mineral deposits and the opportunity for economic development in this country? Why would we be sending investment out of Australia where it will not be creating jobs for Australians and where it will not be creating 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11166"> economic wealth which can raise the living standards of black and white alike? Why would Australia sit by and watch that investment be lost to this country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minerals, energy and agricultural sectors comprise 75 per cent of our total merchandise exports. Yet we find in relation to claims in Western Australia and Queensland a fall off in exploration expenditure, largely as a result of uncertainties over native title. In an open letter to all Australians today, many of Australia's leading business people have come out and said that we need to think very carefully about the economic consequences of fixing up the Native Title Act. Business leaders have made the point&mdash;and it is an obvious point&mdash;that, where you are trying to reconcile the interests of Aboriginal people, pastoralists and miners, nobody is going to get everything they wish for. Business leaders come out and say that Australia is, and should be, proud of its multicultural and tolerant society. They come out and say that all Australians have a vital stake in the satisfactory resolution of the native title issue, but they make the point that the current native title legislation does not work and needs to be improved. The business leaders say that the bill the government proposes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . is a fair and reasonable accommodation of all the interests concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As leaders in Australian business, industry and the rural sector, we call on all concerned to recognise the balance achieved in the proposed legislation and to adopt its essential features without further delay.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a statement from many of Australia's leading business people. Let me reiterate that this government believes in protecting the native title rights of Aboriginal people, this government believes in doing justice as between Aboriginal and non&hyphen;Aboriginal people, this government believes that the legislation which is currently in place does not work and this government believes that it is in the interests of all Australians&mdash;white and black&mdash;to grow an economy with investment and jobs and to improve health and living standards. That is the way in which to reconcile injustice in the interests of black and white alike.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very glad you mentioned the word `agreement' because I am reminded of what the former Labor leader Mr Keating had to say on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>  in October 1993:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been a very good outcome overnight on the matter of negotiations over Mabo. What it will mean is that native title by this agreement, by that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11167"> particular deal will be extinguished on pastoral leases. That is not to the extent of any inconsistency, but extinguished.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They were the words of your own former Prime Minister. There are two other aspects, two planks which should be brought to the attention of the House, which is why our legislation stacks up, as the Treasurer has just said. Firstly, we go back to the High Court ruling which said, in respect of Mabo 2:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The personal rights conferred by common law native title do not constitute an estate or interest in the land itself. They are extinguished by an unqualified grant of an inconsistent estate in the land by the Crown&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I invite the member to listen to this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">such as a grant in fee or a lease conferring the right to exclusive possession.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, there was the High Court ruling for extinguishment in certain circumstances. That was then followed by the second element of the Wik judgment, a Wik judgment which, incidentally, I remind members of the public was by the narrowest of margins&mdash;four to three.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is it not reasonable that there will be a good deal of legal debate when the High Court of this land went four to three on the matter of the Wik judgment? Even so, in the postscript on the Wik judgment, the High Court found&mdash;the majority of judges on Wik found&mdash;that pastoralists' rights prevail and are in the ascendancy when in conflict with native title entitlements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say very firmly to the House that the government is going to push on with its fair approach to native title and with its Wik legislation. We are going to push forward in a way which will bring certainty, fairness and balance. I remind those who believe otherwise that what we are doing is a whole lot less robust than what Mr Keating tried to do with his Native Title Act preamble, and it is a whole lot less robust&mdash;in one sense&mdash;than what the father of Father Frank Brennan wrote in the minority judgment in the High Court, that is, `all pastoral leases properly issued extinguish native title'. They were the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> words of the Chief Justice, albeit in a minority judgment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I want to say something else. Yesterday we were graced by the presence of the European parliamentary delegation visiting this chamber. They are still in the parliament today. We also had the comments overnight of Mr Kerr, a member of the European parliament, and I note his lecturing of us on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make three points to the Europeans and the European parliament: firstly, I remind them of what Europe's attitude was in respect of Fiji when they did not back the indigenous people on that particular occasion. Secondly, I remind the Europeans of the Laplanders or Sami people, who have no native title rights in Finland, Sweden or Norway. They have very limited rights of any kind whatsoever. Before they start lecturing us, they might like to think of the Sami people or Laplanders in Scandinavia. Thirdly, I remind them of the recent events which have afflicted the gipsies of Europe who likewise have no rights and who, right now, are being the subject of a very ugly campaign in Czechoslovakia and Hungary. I will listen to the Europeans when the Sami have the right to claim three quarters of Scandinavia and when the gipsies have the right to claim three quarters of France, Germany, Czechoslovakia or Hungary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, while I respect the right of European parliamentary delegations to wander the world and lecture us and to have freedom of speech as they move around the world, I do not respect their right to interfere in domestic matters here in Australia. I make no apology for saying so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come back to the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition: you might just happen to remember that the Leader of the Opposition asked whether I should apologise to church leaders.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the draft policy platform of the Labor Party and the section called `Developing regional Australia'. Having read the document carefully, I cannot identify one initiative. What we can identify is that the platform is no more than a collection of statements of principle with no policy detail. It offers nothing new for regional Australia. It is nothing more than a rehash of past policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's program created a huge duplication of effort at the state and territory level. Too much money was spent on administration and too little was spent on projects that our regions needed. Labor still do not realise that they were rejected by regional Australia. Their policies were rejected by regional Australia. They recycle more of the same and offer them up again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is timely that we have a look at who represents regional Australia in this chamber. The Australian Electoral Commission classifies 63 of the 148 seats in this House as being non-metropolitan. Of the 63 electorates, two

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contrast, the Howard government is making a difference in regional Australia. We have made a difference through many initiatives, and I have mentioned a few. We have made a difference by funding the Natural Heritage Trust to the tune of $1.25 billion over six years and by spending $696 million on the national highway in 1997-98 and $122 million on roads of national importance. We are spending $36 million on the road safety black spot program, committing $250 million over five years to regional telecommunications infrastructure and spending $11.8 million over three years on the supermarket to Asia strategy. We are committing $500 million to the Agriculture&mdash;Advancing Australia package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These initiatives alone represent a multibillion dollar investment in regional Australia by the Howard government.

Of course, bridge infrastructure is in a very serious situation, particularly in regional Australia. As the member for Gippsland alluded to, the Commonwealth has provided $11 million towards a bridge review survey being undertaken by the NRTC. That is off the back of the wish of the Commonwealth to implement another recommendation of the NRTC, which is to increase mass limits from 42.5 to 45 tonnes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Local governments and state governments have indicated to the Commonwealth that they have a concern about the capacity of local bridges, in particular, to accommodate those increases.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New South Wales, in particular, are concerned. They have indicated that they believe that there is a need for something like $1.7 billion to be injected into bridge infrastructure in New South Wales. I might add, as the member that asked the question is from Victoria, that the Victorian government does have a structured bridge replacement program which works quite well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important, as far as the Commonwealth is concerned, going off the back of a number of reports we received last year, to realise that there are great advantages to be had by the economy generally by increasing the efficiency of road transport. If, in turn, that requires a bit of attention to the bridge infrastructure, then maybe that needs to be the case. That is an issue for further review and judgment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member would also be aware that yesterday the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform tabled the committee's report on road funding in Australia&mdash;that has been undertaken over the last 12 months.

The Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, Senator Alston, has recently made this announcement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, it will mean that SBS television will be available in remote Western Australia via satellite for the first time. I note that the member for Kalgoorlie is not here, but he also would benefit from this change. The service will be available initially, at a subsidised cost, to 3,500 direct to home satellite households and 120 remote Aboriginal and self&hyphen;help communities in plenty of time, for example, for next year's World Cup Soccer in France.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This service will also be accessible to viewers all over regional Western Australia who choose to purchase a satellite dish and a digital set&hyphen;top box. The cost of the digital set&hyphen;top box will be dramatically lower than the analog device that currently exists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The assistance for providing for terrestrial retransmission of the new SBS service to regional communities in Western Australia will be considered, in line with the government's policy of extending SBS nation 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ally. More importantly perhaps for some, there will be an extension of Triple J and the Parliamentary News and Network services and they will also be available through the new reconfigured satellite systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is actually happening is that negotiations with Telstra and Optus, which are utilising digitisation in their satellite transmission arrangements, will see that regional and remote Western Australia will, in fact, receive digitised television services in advance of urban dwellers in Australia, and we will provide the capacity for those services to be received through a single set&hyphen;top box.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be providing an amount of $11.2 million, the member for O'Connor will be pleased to know, to provide a contribution of $750 towards the conversion costs of new digital decoders in each of the existing direct to home remote households, and $2,500 towards the replacement of each existing decoder in remote Aboriginal and self&hyphen;help communities. This is another example of the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund assisting regional and remote communities to receive these types of services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to the $8 million provided by the fund, the government is providing an additional $3.3 million to make sure these new services can become available.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Sunday I announced that the government would proceed to establish a national strategy for ageing in Australia, a policy initiative that has been met with universal acclaim by all of the provider sector and, more generally in the community, it is seen as being necessary. If we go to the draft

You do not do anything about determining what should be the long-term strategy of this nation with regard to the provision of aged care services for those who are certainly deserving of some attention from all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We come to press release. It is interesting that Francis Sullivan, who is the signatory of that press release, did not actually attend the two meetings that have been held. I have had occasion, unfortunately, in this House in recent times to chide Mr Sullivan for taking liberties with conversations that have been had with him. We find he was a former senior adviser to the Labor minister in Western Australia, Keith Wilson.

There will be continuing discussions about capital needs. I might point out that the $12 and $6 generates a level of capital into the sector over a 10-year horizon equivalent to the Gregory benchmarks. Mr Sullivan himself, through his representatives, indicated that the aged care reform legislation that was passed in July was a formula on which he agreed there needed to be a contribution by those in the community who could afford to do so under fair arrangements.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. It gives the government the opportunity to report to the Australian people what a terrific success the privatisation of one-third of Telstra actually was; what a great job the Minister for Finance did in overseeing that, assisted by the minister for communications; how rewarding it was to see that 92 per cent of Telstra employees defied the Australian Labor Party and went out and got shares; and how even more gratifying it was to see union superannuation funds investing in the Telstra float. This was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11174"> an opportunity for little Australian shareholders who put in their application for Telstra shares and applied for five times more than the number of shares that were on offer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us talk about some of the benefits that will accrue to the Australian people. When this government came to office, the Australian Labor Party had put this country into $90,000 million worth of debt. They had, over five years, increased debt fivefold and put Australia into $90,000 million worth of debt. And they had no plan to even stabilise it, let alone repay it! What that means is this government has to raise over $9 billion just to pay the interest bill on Labor's debt&mdash;over $9 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give you some figures that put that in perspective: $9 billion&mdash;the amount that the Australian people have to pay in taxes to service the Keating Labor debt&mdash;is greater than all of the collections from payroll tax in this country. If we were not servicing Keating Labor debt, you would not need a payroll tax. Nine billion dollars is greater than all of the amount raised through petrol excise in this country. If you did not have to service Keating Labor debt, you would not need a petrol excise. Nine billion dollars is about half of the amount that is raised by corporate taxes in this country. If you did not have to service Keating Labor debt, you could cut the company tax in half. That is the extent of the wanton mismanagement of the Australian Labor Party. The worst thing about it is that the then Minister for Finance has still not apologised to the Australian people. Apologise. Why won't you apologise to the Australian people for putting them $90 billion into debt?</PARA>

I point out that in the course of the APEC and related meetings with Korea the government continues to push bilateral market access. In that process, I am happy to report to the House that Korea has decided to reduce by 40 per cent the tariff on Australian sugar entering the Korean market. That will now bring the tariff down to three per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also take the opportunity to point out that Brunei, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Latvia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, Slovenia and the UAE have already reduced to zero their tariffs on our sugar exports to those markets. Again, that reflects the determined effort we have made. It is difficult to be precise, but I would think that the additional flow from Korea's most recent decision would be worth some $5 million to $6 million for the Australian sugar industry. It was paralleled with a decision they also made to halve their tariff on Australian wool exports into Korea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another piece in this extraordinary new Labor platform. It is a rather cute paragraph on trade. Buried in that platform is a paragraph which says that the Labor Party is going to return to the area of making some effort on bilateral market access. That is too little too late. You were the ones who walked away from bilateral market access. The proof of that is former Senator Button's famous statement recorded in the John Edwards biography on former Prime Minister Paul Keating where he says, `How many down there in DFAT are doing anything about the bilaterals? They are all down there dwelling on the multilaterals and no&hyphen;one is doing anything about the bilaterals.' I am glad that you have learnt the error of your ways.

At the same time, I remind the House that, in respect of Malaysia's most recent budget&mdash;whilst there was one step in the wrong direction in increasing tariffs&mdash;the government has decided to abolish 28 tariffs and reduce 32 other tariffs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for McMillan for his question. The issue of skilled migration is an important one. It is one which the Labor Party, in their recently announced platform, have indicated that they intend to wind back. I find this an extraordinary proposition because the overall levels of immigration the Labor Party accept are about right. If that is the case and they want to wind back skilled migration you have to ask yourself what they really have in mind. Is it a dramatic increase in family reunion? When you look at the reductions that have occurred in the main in family reunion they have been at the expense of people who are either non&hyphen;bona fide in their applications&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you think that is family values, that is a very interesting view of families. We know that a 25 per cent reduction in the number of applications have occurred, and we also know that there was a significant increase in the number of rejections. When you look at the rejections, you find that there has been no 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> corresponding increase in the rate of appeals, which certainly suggests that my departmental officials are getting it right in their assessments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, the other area of family reunion where there has been a reduction is in relation to aged parents. There you are dealing with a group who are highly dependent, who would be shifting eligibility to the Australian community to support them, rather than families accepting the obligations that they would support them, in a situation where people were normally excluded for up to 10 years for pension eligibility under longstanding arrangements&mdash;I assumed supported on both sides of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are seeking to wind back the skilled migration to accommodate a significant increase in family reunion, you will be moving to the situation where 30 per cent of the non-humanitarian intake were skilled migration.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The platform is very clear. That is what it says. When you have to find your way through the vague generalisations that say very little, the only substantial comment is about reducing skilled migration. I make it very clear on this matter that we have a situation now where we have the program back in balance&mdash;50 per cent of those in the program are skilled; that is the balance that the Labor Party clearly does not want&mdash;and we have lifted the entry standards for the skilled category to historically high levels. You need 115 points out of 120 to be able to satisfy it. We are not resting on our laurels on that matter: we have announced a review of the points test to ensure that it is meeting Australia's needs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we know about the independent category is that they have to be young, they have to be highly skilled and they have to be eminently employable in Australia. The research indicates that their unemployment rate is at least as low as the Australian norm. We know also from the research that has been undertaken that they have a net positive

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the major defects of those programs was that, by working solely through the CES, unemployed people had access to only 20 per cent of the job vacancies. There were 80 per cent of job vacancies that were not available to the 800,000 unemployed people that the CES was seeking to place. They were programs, as we know, that focused on process, not on getting jobs. Billions of dollars were paid out. None of those dollars were linked to unemployed people actually getting jobs. Job seekers were squeezed month after month, year after year into programs that had very poor job outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unemployed people were disillusioned and demoralised by Labor's philosophy of training for training's sake. We know that the Labor Party intends to revive the $10 billion failed Working Nation program, but it is one of this government's real achievements that it is dismantling these Working Nation programs and putting into place effective programs to get unemployed people and disadvantaged unemployed people jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new employment service arrangements, which will commence on 1 May next year, will get more unemployed people into jobs and they will do that for a whole variety of reasons. One reason is that they will have access to many more job vacancies than were ever available to the CES. The multiple providers who will successfully tender in the current employment services market tender will have access to a whole range of job vacancies. For the first time, public dollars will be paid out when unemployed people get jobs&mdash;not when they are put into a training program, not when some process has been completed, but when they get a job. These 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11178"> reforms will be targeting the most disadvantaged job seekers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great difference between what this government is proposing and what the Labor government did is that we will be aiming to get the most disadvantaged job seekers into jobs, not into training programs. We will be employing the expertise which is available right through the community sector and the training market. They will provide tailored services. The rigid, fixed, bureaucratic Labor programs will be abandoned and job seekers will get the sort of assistance which is tailored to their needs to get jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does the opposition offer? It offers `active programs of assistance as previously implemented under Working Nation'. Its draft policy platform states that it is going to reinstate labour market job readiness programs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make it clear that the government has committed itself so far in relation to international packages for Thailand and Indonesia. In relation to Thailand, led by the World Bank, a number of countries in the region pledged funding&mdash;including Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea and Australia. Those funds are now being made available to the Thai authorities in return for that country engaging in substantial economic restructuring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not aid; this is a loan. It is a finance facility which is disbursed as the country engages in economic restructuring.

Australia has made it clear that it would come into a second tier of financing if a second tier were required. It has not been called up.

As I said yesterday, the IMF provides the main finance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make it entirely clear: the downturn in the Asian region, the currency instability and the effect on growth have an adverse effect on Australia.

It is a pity he does not take the opportunity to get some good advice on these matters before raising the issue in the House. These remarks have been made by a former public servant who, I understand, has put these points of view forward many times and, indeed, quite a lengthy time ago. They were addressed at that time, and they are no more valid now than they were when they were first raised. There is no suggestion that any provider will be given access to the Social Security database, nor are there any issues that arise that will in any way contravene the privacy rights of unemployed people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the meeting with aged care groups last Thursday week the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) said that he would make a ministerial statement on the following Monday, setting out the details of the government's new position on aged care. Now we discover that the minister has no such intention. The minister and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) have been rolled by the backbench.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The backbench have at least 20 questions about aged care that neither the minister nor the department can answer. But instead of finding the answers this government decided that it would be better to try to hide, hoping that the problems would go away. Well, the problems will not go away. The aged care sector, pensioner groups and the Labor opposition have a lot more than 20 questions if the minister will not come clean and make a detailed ministerial statement. We will ask the many unanswered questions in question time&mdash;questions such as whether or not pensioners are going to have to pay provisional tax if they rent their homes. We will also give the unanswered questions to the media so that they can ask them of the Prime Minister while he is out on his morning stroll in Vancouver.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No government should be allowed to hide from those who are desperately trying to find out how much they will have to pay to get into a nursing home. No government should be allowed to hide from revealing the policy details that actually affect people's lives. No government should be allowed to hide from its responsibilities to the most vulnerable in our society. But when it comes to explaining the detail of its aged care policy this government has hit the mattresses. It is nowhere to be found&mdash;and no wonder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us briefly run through the catalogue of disaster, the never&hyphen;ending story of change and confusion that masquerades as aged care policy in this country under this government. In May this year the government announced the daily concessional resident capital contribution of $5 a day but, by June, after considerable pressure from aged care groups, the concessional fee had increased to $7 and $12. In May they also announced that the introduction of the accommodation bonds would be delayed from July to October. In September the introduction of daily fees was delayed from October to November. In October the introduction of daily fees was further delayed from November to next March and limited to residents entering nursing homes from that date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In October again, the gifting provisions were reduced from the previous five years to gifts made after 20 August 1996. In October again, co&hyphen;resident carers were allowed to remain in the family home if they had cared for two rather than five years. In October again, 15 per cent of rent assistance to hostel residents living in hostels before 1 October this year was reinstated. In October again, the Prime Minister said that `fine tuning' was completed and the system needed no further changes. On the same day in October the minister said that he had an open mind on capping of accommodation bonds. Two days later, the minister said he would not be reviewing aged care policy and that his views on this had been misrepresented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 1 November, two days after he said that there would not be any further review, the minister agreed to review the limit of 52 days a year on hostel residents leave, after an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11182"> absolute blowtorch applied by John Laws. On 5 November the Prime Minister appeared on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS>, announcing that accommodation bonds were going to be scrapped and replaced by an annual payment `in the order of $4,000'. On the same day the Prime Minister said that the annual payment would be `an average of about $4,000'. Also on that day the option of annual payment was extended to hostel residents. Then the minister said that he would announce a range of mechanisms to assist people in making annual payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the next day on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> the minister washed his hands of responsibility for those unfortunate enough to have to pay the bond. He said, `We can't undo that.' But on the next day he announced his intention to appoint a special representative to help those who had paid accommodation bonds. On 6 November&mdash;remember that a couple of days before that the annual payments were going to be $4,000&mdash;he said that the annual payments would be capped at between $7,000 and $10,000. On 10 November Senator Herron said that annual payments would be levied for up to five years. On the same day the minister said that the central trust fund for hostels would be scrapped and that hostels would hold the funds themselves. On 13 November&mdash;this is after having been told that annual payments would be $7,000 or $10,000&mdash;they were capped at $4,380.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is correct. Who knows what it will be tomorrow, because the minister had a proviso on the 13th and said `unless industry groups provide evidence they need more money'. Where will the `more money' come from? Of course it will come from those who need nursing home care. On 13 November he also said that interest rates on outstanding fees would drop from nine per cent to six per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an extraordinary saga of incompetence. But does the minister in this government propose to face up to the mess that has been created by this extraordinary saga? Of course not. Their reaction is to duck for cover, to hide away from making a ministerial statement or, even worse, to suggest that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people out there actually support this litany of changes that have been made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at what the minister said in the parliament yesterday and again today. He said yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These arrangements were endorsed initially by an all party working group of providers and consumer groups Thursday week ago. Again, on Friday . . . All were in agreement that the arrangements that I have in place are appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He said it again yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On Friday, the industry, the consumer groups and my colleagues&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think he means the backbench&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">realised that what has been established is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not know why we cannot have a statement if it is all so appropriate. But we get the truth from the Australian Catholic Health Care Association today, whose press release is headed `Nursing home arrangements far from appropriate'. At both the 13 November meeting and the 21 November meeting&mdash;the two meetings the minister has called&mdash;the Catholics made it very clear that they do not agree. The points they do not agree to include the budget cutting and lack of full reinvestment of moneys to aged care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister in question time wondered where we got the figure of $500 million from. I draw his attention to the 1996-97 budget speech, a fairly authoritative document. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) himself says that they will save $479 million out of aged care. We rounded that to $500 million, Minister. That was the Treasurer, your Treasurer. That is where the figure came from. Everybody in the aged care sector wants that $500 million put straight back into aged care. They will not agree to your changes until you put the money back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Catholic Health Care Association do not agree with the charging of entry and annual fees to short stay nursing home residents. They want you to mandate a minimum level of income for pensioners in residential care and they want your new income tested charges that are going to apply from March next year to be scrapped because they know&mdash;and you know&mdash;that they will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11183"> not deliver one extra dollar to the care of those people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Catholics, along with other church providers, made it very clear in letters to you and in a press release that they have called on the federal government to reinject into the system the aged care program savings as well as commit additional necessary funds.

There is a chorus of calls from the sector that this money be put back in. Stop making the myriad of changes, the continuing changes, day after day. How could anybody who needs a nursing home or who is running a nursing home know what it is they are going to be up for? One day it is $4,000, the next day it is $10,000, the day after that it is $4,300 and that is the end of it because there is not going to be any ministerial statement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What confected indignation about nursing home and aged care needs in this country coming from the shadow minister and supported by the now departing Labor members who do not want to hear the facts of the situation. This issue started during the 13 years of Keating budgets. As I have shown this chamber before, here is the graph showing what happened to the capital that flowed into the nursing home sector&mdash;a 75 per cent decrease in the amount of money that went into the nursing home sector. The Labor government totally ignored advice from Professor Gregory in 1994 that there was an urgent need for upgrading nursing homes to deal with things such as fire cover and health cover. Thirteen per cent of homes did not meet fire cover and 11 per cent did not meet health cover and there was a desperate need for something to be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we came to power, a detailed consultation process was commenced providing an opportunity for all those in the care sector and consumer groups to meet in regular sessions to determine how best to proceed. A new Aged Care Act was created and passed in the middle of this year with the support of all of those bodies, having committed to detailed consultations throughout this period. Then on 1 October 1997 when this policy was to commence, particularly in relation to the up&hyphen;front bonds for nursing home entrants, there proceeded to be an orchestrated scare campaign led by the shadow minister and supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) who, in a shameful contribution to the debate delivered in his own electorate, made allegations that this policy had led to the suicide of particular individuals&mdash;which, of course, was never borne out.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is in his newsletter, and I find that an abysmal example to be set by the Leader of the Opposition. A couple of things need to be said today. Firstly, I would like to deal with the issue of Mr Francis Sullivan from the Australian Catholic Health Care Association, a man no doubt possessed of some experience in this area and a commitment to what he believes. I go back to what I said in question time about the mythical figure of $500 million. I quote the article to which I referred in question time of Tuesday, 18 November, and I read from the article by Mr Sullivan which says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Warwick Smith . . . He has reinstated $180 million of the $439 million cut from the aged&hyphen;care budget last year. He also has sought time to sensibly assess the longer term needs of aged care, both in residential and community settings. This shift in government focus from the bottom line to the plight of the elderly is crucial.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He admits that what has been proposed is correct. On the other issue: we have had several meetings and I have received a letter from all of those involved in the meetings, the first one being on 11 November. On 20 November, all of those involved including Aged Care Australia, the Uniting Community Services Australia, Anglicare Australia, Australian Catholic Health Care Association, Baptist Care Australia and Aged Care Network Australia wrote to me and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before proceeding further, we felt it appropriate to seek your confirmation that this approach and time&hyphen;frame accord with your understanding of the commitments made.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The commitments that I made to them in my press release following that meeting was that I would establish and continue with the announcements that I made on 6 November following the announcement by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that there would be put in place an accommodation charge for nursing homes at $12, an assisted category of $6 where people had income of up to $36,000&mdash;and below the $22,500 there is absolutely no 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11185"> charge&mdash;and the continued provision of the 27 per cent average concessional beds. That position was agreed to by all present and that continues to be the position. The sector have asked for continued time to provide to me more details about the so&hyphen;called shortage of capital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shortage of capital is an issue. It is a crisis that has been created by the Labor Party by their not having attended to the matter when they had the opportunity. It is a matter which, the government accepts, must be addressed if the proposed way of dealing with this was by way of an accommodation bond charge across the two sectors, that is, nursing homes and hostels. Following a meeting in Christchurch, I announced that there would be a continuation of the bond arrangements for hostels. This information has been provided to all of the hostels and nursing home sector and by way of a statement on 10 November. Those in the hostel care sector know that the continuation of the arrangements that have pre&hyphen;existed for 10 years continue on. So there is certainty in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The accommodation charge has been outlined. It has now been in place since 6 November and those in the sector are fully aware of how that will work. As I have already said, the arrangements relate to a five&hyphen;year limit on the amount of time that you have to be into that arrangement. But, keeping in mind that the time that people are actually in nursing homes is now averaging nine months, this was one of the reasons that legitimately people had concerns about how the accommodation bond worked in relation to nursing homes. The amount required of some of those bonds was totally disproportionate to the amount of time that people would actually spend in the nursing homes. And wasn't it interesting&mdash;shamelessly the Labor Party used the prospect of $250,000 bonds to whip up this huge scare campaign to cast aspersions on those who entered into agreements and to try to see this policy totally changed. That is what this debate is all about. This debate is about changing the policy totally; that is, saying that there ought to be money going into nursing homes but it ought to be all of the taxpayers money and none 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from those who have the capacity to contribute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The challenge for the 1990s and beyond, as others have said, is about a fair contribution from the community and a fair contribution from individuals who can contribute under legitimate rules. That is what we seek to bring about. We will continue to seek a fair contribution because it is only fair to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be remembered that 70 per cent of the care costs in the aged care sector for 135,000 residents in some 3,000 residences around the country is somewhere in the vicinity of $2.6 billion and will rise by three per cent through to over $3 billion in the next four years&mdash;a very significant amount. Sixty-five per cent of those residents in nursing homes and hostels are full pensioners. They will not be affected by the so-called 1 March fee increase at all. Only those who have a demonstrated capacity to pay will be affected. Those issues have been outlined in earlier statements from me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to focus on what it is the Labor Party is going to do. It is all right to try to address this issue in the short term. Much of the detail is there, but there will be more detail. I will provide more detail about these matters as they become available. The issue of the reverse mortgages to which I have referred will be a matter for the banks once they are released. We are extending the ranges in which people might make the payment of the accommodation charge. They can stream the rent from their property without impact on their pension, which I have already indicated is a proposal that we are pursuing in conjunction with the sector. They will be able to charge the payment against their estate, which is by far and away the method that the majority of people use when making their arrangements with the nursing home. It is payable monthly in advance and there is a six-month period of grace. That six&hyphen;month period of grace is available to the Australian Catholic Health Care Association to pursue and to make those exemptions, if they wish to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not used this article, which was only recently drawn to my attention, by the former Labor finance minister, former Senator Peter 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11186"> Walsh, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 11 November this year. In it he pointed out that the broader issue of the approach taken by the Labor Party raises questions about their commitment to looking out for the longer term needs and the increasing demand. One of the matters I have not addressed is the increasing aged numbers that we will find in our community in the near years and the longer term needs that will be there&mdash;all of which have to be funded from general tax revenue. He pointed out that Ms Macklin, the member for Jagajaga and the shadow minister, is pre-empting the public announcements in nursing homes policy, which has now been released. Peter Walsh then makes this very pertinent point:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Challenged in Parliament to spell out where Labor believed the extra money should come from, Jenny Macklin said from general taxation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She would be the first to admit that is her position. That is the position of the draft policy that was released by the Labor Party last week. What that proposes is that the number of aged people in our community that are going to seek residential aged care&mdash;and remember the Commonwealth is funding 70 per cent of that care now&mdash;will absolutely increase. It is only fair that those who have large incomes or large amounts of assets are asked to make a fair contribution to the level of that care. That is what we are asking for. That is a principle that underpins the policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first meeting that we had with all the aged care sectors when I took over as minister in early October&mdash;and with whom I have been dealing with these matters since&mdash;it was interesting that the Catholic Church indicated that was a principle that they did not find in any way offensive. So the challenge for Australia in the short, medium and longer term is to develop a plan which will address this growing demand that is there. It is a huge and difficult issue for this community to deal with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said last Sunday that we need to have a national strategy for ageing. Over the last weeks, I think the whole community right around Australia has had to focus its mind on how we deal with this matter not just in the immediate but in the longer term. We need to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pull together all of the sector and others to see if we cannot put in place a much better integrated aged care approach to this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Look at the home and community care arrangements provided by the states with the support of the Commonwealth, at the explosion of the final recognition of the role of carers in our community and at the need for the decent delivery of community care packages&mdash;it will not be a care regime in the future that is totally residential based. It needs to be a far greater mix. If we want to embrace this policy of ageing in place&mdash;that is, letting people stay in their homes or stay in their communities and providing a range of assistance for that to be achieved&mdash;then we need to be innovative and laterally thinking in what we do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We come back to the cost&mdash;there is always a cost in providing these services to the level to which we can be proud and to which we would wish our parents or our loved elderly people to be in. This cost has to be borne fairly by the whole community. There are arguments about the level of the provision of the funds that are there, and I certainly admit to that. They are discussions that we will have in the public policy context. But there is a fundamental that needs to be addressed: you cannot with the increasing aged in our community believe that you can go on ad infinitum and fund the totality out of the general taxpayer revenue, because it simply is not fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the Labor Party not to say this side of the election just how they are going to fund this I think raises questions about how they might turn to fund it. They are the ones who have been crying about the family home. But for 10 years the family home was counted in the assets test for the hostel arrangements in this country, and it continues to be so. The arrangements that I am putting in place make the family home safe. There is a range of ways in which you can make your accommodation charge payment to the provider's home into which you are entering. These are matters that are broadly acceptable by the sector, both the consumer sector and the provider sector. We have undertaken to discuss these matters with them, and those discussions have been 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11187"> continuing very successfully. The letter signed by all the sector points out that it is an appropriate way to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any suggestion to the contrary is mischievous. It raises issues that need not necessarily add to the extent of the understanding of the community. It is clearly a political ploy by the Labor Party. This matter, having been dealt with over the last several weeks, has come off the front page. Now that the shadow minister is starting to see this matter addressed in a coherent and careful fashion, we are dealing with it in a coherent and careful fashion. We have said that the arrangements with the bonds were not appropriate and we have dealt with that, and all the sector have continued to meet with us to make sure that we deliver to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have found in meetings I have had with aged care groups that, once you sit and explain the arrangements to them, they fully understand. They know that they do not want to have a future where the funding will come from a capital gains tax on the family home, a new range of wealth taxes and a tax such as the co-payment on Medicare that was previously tried by the Labor Party. These are methods of fundraising that the Labor Party will have to pursue if they do not embrace the principles that we are putting in place here. We are looking for a long-term plan for the aged in this community that will work. This is a plan that we think will indeed work. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) a moment ago quoted Mr Francis Sullivan, he should have quoted the earlier and latter parts of that article from the paper. I would like to take the advantage of doing that now. What Mr Francis Sullivan said in that article was this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is still a basic unfairness about the Federal Government's approach to residential aged care. While Family Services Minister Warwick Smith has made some helpful changes to the government's aged care policy, we still await a just result.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I pose the question `Who said that?' As I have said, it was Mr Francis Sullivan, the executive director of the Australian Catholic 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Health Care Association, who said it just one week ago. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now instead of manipulating the manner in which the sick and frail will pay more, the Government should first jettison its budget cutting strategy to ensure the financial burden is mutually shared.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that is a far more useful way of putting fully into context what Mr Francis Sullivan said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The enormity of this public policy fiasco is only now really evident to many opposite. I have to give credit to some members opposite; it is because of them that the changes have actually started to take place. The problem we have is this: this is a very bad piece of public policy that has been basically offered up by bean counters and not by people with a real understanding of or concern for our frail aged. It is being tampered with, not withdrawn or rethought, to try to rid it of some politically unpalatable outcomes. In so doing, two things have happened: there has been an admission of the poor quality of that original policy, and there is now an atmosphere in the public of total distrust, confusion and anxiety over the subsequent announcements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look again at Francis Sullivan's words. He said `instead of manipulating the manner in which the sick and frail will pay more'. With that in mind, we should also look at the opinion of the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants League in the November-December 1997 edition of their newsletter the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Comet</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Don't be fooled by the Government's rhetoric, the Accommodation Bonds have NOT been scrapped, they have just had a name change and are presented to the general public in a different package. The Government still intends to get the same amount of money out of this scheme&mdash;the $500 million dollars scrapped from Nursing Homes will still be collected from the dying, frail aged elderly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It appears that the Prime Minister has bowed to pressure of the polls to keep middle aged and older voters on side&mdash;or is this a political stunt to properly package and sell the accommodation bonds?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As night follows day, you can be pretty sure of one thing: play around with good social policy with a bean counter attitude and it will fail. This nursing home policy is an excellent 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11188"> example of that. It is one to keep in mind, I suggest, whenever we happen to look at any social policy coming from this government in the future. You cannot remove $500 million out of your budget, cost shift it in the way that this government has and expect a decent outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at a few of the milestones in this debacle. The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) has already given a chronological outline of this debacle, but there are some key points that I want to repeat. On 27 October, the minister announced a series of minor changes to the original aged care policy of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). On 4 November, the Prime Minister went on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS>&mdash;he did not do it here&mdash;to announce his backdown on accommodation bonds. On Tuesday, 18 November, the minister announced that he was ready to deliver a ministerial statement. It was a welcome initiative. On Wednesday, 19 November, the day after, the ministerial statement was listed on the daily program for 7 p.m. That statement was never delivered. Yesterday, 24 November, the shadow minister for aged and family services asked a very straightforward question of the minister: when would he make the statement? The minister was unable to answer, and we ask why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have an atmosphere of total confusion, doubt and a lack of trust. This government with this Prime Minister came into office in March 1996. It said that it would take a new, high&hyphen;level, honest approach to government. We must laugh at that at this point. The government and the Prime Minister continually insisted that people should not fear the original policy. `Trust us', they said. But no. Eventually the reality broke through. As I outlined a moment ago, a series of announcements were made. Some of those announcements, I gather, were a little more planned or intended than others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have a series of very important questions to which people are fully entitled to expect prompt, honest, accurate and clear answers. Those questions are these: what is the government's present assessment of the amount of capital which will be raised by the latest version of the Prime Minister's nursing 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> home entry charge? How long will it take for those funds to accumulate to a useable level? How far short does it fall of the capital proposed to be raised by the first version of the policy? How far short does it fall of the $500 million that was cut from the nursing home budget in the 1996 budget?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The biggest question&mdash;the $22,000 question, I call it&mdash;is this: under the yearly fee, will the maximum amount payable over that five years, should a person be able to survive those five years, be capped at that $22,000? The reason I ask that question is very simple: we have continually heard of averages of around $4,380 or so from the minister. I must say that the current minister does not seem to use the word `average' any longer. I know that he has said there will be a five-year cap, but I am concerned whether there will be a financial cap.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many individuals and families have approached me over the many months of this debate. One lady who lives in south Woden has a husband who is already in a nursing home. They are a self-funded retired couple. She came to me and, actually crying in my office, said that she feared for her financial future over the debate on increased daily fees. Her level of anxiety was understandable and, I might say, sad to see. While she now understands that the fee increases will not actually affect her now, she no longer feels anything other than total insecurity. When will the next decision actually affect her? The government has already tried it once. She can no longer believe that it will not be tried again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the elderly couple, aged 79 and 82, in a hostel in Red Hill who were absolutely beside themselves over the threat of increased daily fees? Again, they now know that it will not apply to them, but what it did to them for the period of that debate was absolutely cruel. All those families out there are now worrying about how the new orders will affect them. They do not know under what circumstances they will be operating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, the minister attempted to discredit nursing home spokesman Mr Francis Sullivan, in what I thought was a fairly personal attack in question time. This government's attitude to the Public Service, to commentators in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11189"> public, to the churches, and to people like Mr Francis Sullivan is, I believe, outrageous. If you disagree with this government, then you are wrong&mdash;you are marginalised, attacked and, in some cases, boycotted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This policy has been out in the public arena for months and months. The Prime Minister interferes and we now wait&mdash;and we wait and we wait&mdash;for the new arrangements. Today, the minister tells us that more detail is on its way. We do not know when it will come out or for how long the public has to wait. To me, the answer is very simple: put the money back into nursing homes, remove the bond&mdash;or whatever name you give it&mdash;and remove the doubts and anxieties of our elderly. This is the government's policy, not ours. Do not accuse us of scaring  people. The scare has come from the policy of this government. I am afraid that, out there, the people simply no longer trust you. The truth of the matter is simple: they no longer trust you&mdash;and why should they?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a bunch of hypocrites! Every single one of you sitting there is a hypocrite. Who presided over the decline of aged care homes? Who sat there and did absolutely nothing while those homes went downhill; while four, five and six people sat, slept and lived in the same room? Who presided over a system where dirty laundry and food went in the same chutes? Who presided over a system where 70 per cent of homes did not meet building standards?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The answer to my questions is: the opposition. The Labor Party is so concerned about this issue that today, when the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) was speaking, two Labor members were in the House. This is your matter of public importance, and yet you are so concerned about this issue that when the minister stood here and addressed the issue for you, two opposition members were in the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party is hypocritical from the beginning to the end. The 1994 Gregory report told you what the standard was in nursing homes. You did not care about old people in nursing homes&mdash;those old people who did not have sufficient toilet facilities, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those old people who did not have proper fire&hyphen;escapes to get out if there was a fire in the home, and those old people who just lay there and suffered in inadequate facilities, with no heating in winter and no cooling in summer. The Labor Party did not care about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Gregory report said that $125 million a year needed to be spent on nursing homes, what did you do? Did you go out, as the shadow minister has been saying today, and take great care of the elderly? Did you say, `The Gregory report has told us that we have a disgrace on our hands. We have to spend $125 million a year to get these facilities up to standard'? Shadow minister, is that what you did? It was not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did you do? You cut the capital funding to nursing homes. That is what you did. You got a report commissioned which told you that the state of nursing homes was a disgrace, that older people were suffering&mdash;and what did you do? You immediately slashed the funds. In 1992&hyphen;93, you were paying $45 million. In 1993&hyphen;94, you dropped it to $26.5 million. In 1994&hyphen;95, it went down to $15.7 million. The Gregory report said that we needed to spend $125 million a year, but what did you do? You dropped it to $10.7 million. What sort of response was that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That response showed the Labor Party's callousness and total and utter lack of caring about the elderly. Everything you have said in here today is totally and utterly hypocritical. We only have to go back to your record to see that you did not give a stuff about old people&mdash;not at all. You did not care about their conditions. What is more, when you found out how bad their conditions were, you took out more money to make sure that their conditions got worse. Are you proud of that? Are you proud that you did not care about Australia's elderly? You should think about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The present government had the courage to recognise that we had a problem; and not only to recognise it, but to make some very hard decisions about how to address that problem. In case you do not know it over there, we have a crisis in this country. It is not just a crisis in the funding of aged care; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11190"> it is a crisis in the funding of everything, because when the Labor Party left office there was $101 billion of accumulated debt. How much of that debt was the Labor Party responsible for? In the 13 years of Labor's rule, it was responsible for over 80 per cent of that debt. When the Labor Party came to office the debt was $17.9 billion; when it went out it was almost $100 billion. You saddled the future generations of this country with that debt, and you did not even think about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are you saying now? You are saying that we are going to rake up more debt. On that $101 billion we are paying over $9 billion a year interest. That is interest that we cannot spend on other things. We cannot spend it on the elderly. We cannot spend it on education. We cannot spend it on the environment. We cannot spend it on anything because it is going to pay the interest on your debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is your answer to the aged care problem, the problem that is here now and that is going to grow over the years? While we are spending $2.6 billion a year now&mdash;and that does not include pensions&mdash;by the turn of the century, which is only a couple of years away, we are going to be spending over $3 billion a year. We cannot keep up at this rate&mdash;no government can.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All over the world governments are trying to deal with this problem: how do we fund aged care? One of the most sensible ways is by saying, `Let's see who can help pay.' Governments cannot keep shelling out, because when they do they end up in the position that Labor left us&mdash;$101 billion in debt and over $9 billion a year in interest payments that do not go to servicing this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does Labor want to do now? They want to say, `We will put up the expenditure. We will leave a bigger debt.' Do you know why? Because they do not believe the wealthy should pay more than the not so wealthy. They believe that it is fine for a family with kids, struggling to pay their taxes, to be subsidising the wealthy in nursing homes. That is their policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How does that fit with Labor philosophy? I would be interested in Labor philosophy. It seems to be all over the place. I thought 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Labor was actually interested in helping those who are less well off. But no&mdash;the people you are defending are the millionaires in the nursing homes so that when they die their children can inherit and that poor family with three kids who are having trouble paying their taxes will sit by in their 10-year&hyphen;old car and watch the children of the wealthy drive past in their Mercedes. This is the type of policy this no philosophy, hypocritical Labor Party is putting forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do you stand for as a party? It is certainly not for the elderly in this country. You have shown from your time in government that you did not care for the elderly, not in any possible way. You wanted to leave them in exactly the same situation they were in&mdash;in substandard conditions. You do not care for the elderly, but you do not care for the young either because you are willing to rake up debt after debt and leave this country an indebted country for the future. You are advocating a higher deficit, an unfair system that favours the wealthy. You are against older people and you are advocating bad legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report 354&mdash;Annual report of activities&mdash;1996&hyphen;97</EMPHASIS>  has been prepared as a means of reporting to the parliament on the activities and performance of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts during 1996-97. The work covers what has been a particularly busy period for the committee which has presented seven reports to the parliament on a wide range of issues. The committee's work has focused on scrutinising the performance of Commonwealth agencies, on examining matters of public policy and, increasingly, on reviewing legislation which impacts on the collection and management of public resources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year has seen the JCPA, firstly, establish new and more effective procedures for holding Commonwealth agencies to account for their responses to recommendations from the Auditor-General, a process involving the committee selecting reports for further examination and conducting public hearings into the relevant issues; secondly, play a central role in determining a new legislative framework for the Auditor-General, a framework which secures the Auditor-General's independence from the executive and establishes a new role for parliament in overseeing operations of the audit office and, indeed, an historic role in approving recommendations for appointment to the positions of Auditor- 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">General and Independent Auditor; thirdly, provide continuing parliamentary input into the process of rewriting the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936; fourthly, being asked to provide advice to government on issues to be considered in the implementation of an accrual based financial management and budgeting system for the Commonwealth; and, fifthly, being asked to advise the parliament on the government's proposed new Public Service employment and management framework. This is an impressive record of achievement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the very new chairman of the committee, I would like to pay particular tribute to the work of my predecessor, Alex Somlyay. Mr Somlyay played a significant role in guiding the work of the committee over the last 12 months. The success of the committee is due in no small way to the quality of his leadership. I would also like to thank the members of the committee and staff of the secretariat for their commitment to the work of the JCPA in the last 12 months. The committee has a full program of inquiries to see it into 1997-98 and I look forward to another productive and successful year. I commend the report to the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report 355&mdash;Aboriginal councils and Torres Strait Island councils: review of financial accountability requirements</EMPHASIS>, this inquiry is historic because it involves two parliamentary committees in two jurisdictions&mdash;the JCPA and the Queensland Public Accounts Committee. The result is a joint, unanimous report which is being tabled simultaneously in both parliaments. Aboriginal councils and Torres Strait Island councils receive funding from both Commonwealth and Queensland agencies. For some time now the Queensland Auditor-General has been issuing qualifications and disclaimers to the annual audited financial statements of a significant number of councils.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The QPAC has tabled several reports on the issue, but progress has been slow in improving council accountability. For that reason, and because councils receive money from the Commonwealth, the QPAC approached the JCPA with a view to undertaking the inquiry to explore the underlying causes for the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11195"> councils' apparent difficulty in meeting their accountability requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will recall that on 25 March 1997 the House authorised the committee to jointly inquire with the QPAC and established a set of procedures to be followed. The inquiry focused on the scope for standardising the financial accountability requirements placed on Aboriginal and Islander councils and how the councils may be assisted in meeting their accountability obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the inquiry, the committees visited most of the Aboriginal and Islander councils. Many of the communities serviced by these councils are in remote areas and suffer the consequences of this isolation in the form of poor infrastructure provision, precarious lines of supply and difficulty in attracting and retaining suitably qualified staff. The committees were impressed at the hospitality of the councils they visited, their dedication to serving the communities they represent and their motivation to address problems highlighted in their audited financial statements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the inquiry progressed, the value of a joint approach was confirmed. Each committee has been able to examine the issues from the perspective of both jurisdictions. Agencies from both the state and the Commonwealth have appeared before the committees at public hearings and have discussed matters which are cross&hyphen;jurisdictional in nature. Agencies have been brought together on the issues of application processes, accountability requirements and assistance provision to councils.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committees have concluded that there is sufficient scope for standardising application and acquittal processes but, because deficiencies in the financial administration of councils have been identified by the Queensland Auditor-General for over 10 years, the most practical way forward is to constitute a grants providers forum at ministerial level. The key initial responsibility of this forum would be the introduction of standardised financial acquittal and reporting requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committees also agreed that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, the Torres Strait Regional Authority and the Queensland Department of Families, Youth and Community Care, which represent the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> major grant providers to the councils, should immediately commence negotiation to achieve standardisation of their grant application and acquittal processes. The committees feel that cooperation by these agencies will address a large percentage of the current variations in accountability requirements faced by councils.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committees have gone further and have examined some of the underlying reasons leading to the qualifications and disclaimers in the audited financial statements. The committees are of the view that the expertise available to councils is a critical factor in their ability to provide unqualified audited financial statements. Accordingly, the committees spent some time considering how councils may be assisted in improving performance in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committees have concluded that there needs to be better coordination by agencies in the provision of assistance to councils and have recommended that Commonwealth and state agencies should work together in increasing communication between ATSIC's field officers and community service officers&mdash;who are officers of the lead Queensland agency&mdash;assessing the training needs of councils and coordinating training provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committees have identified a key inconsistency in accountability mechanisms in that ATSIC can appoint a grants controller for poor performing councils whose task is to look after Commonwealth funds. No such step is available to Queensland agencies and the only avenue available is to replace the council with an administrator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, the committees have recommended that grants controllers should also be able to administer state funds. In addition, the grant providers forum should further address the issue of inadequate financial compliance and maladministration of council business, with a view to implementing a range of procedures between, at one extreme, unsupervised control by a council of its business and, at the other, the appointment of an administrator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In concluding, on behalf of the committee, I extend my appreciation to those people who contributed to the review by meeting the committees during their inspection visits and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11196"> briefings, by preparing submissions and by giving evidence at public hearings. I would like to thank my colleagues on the JCPA and also members of the Queensland Public Accounts Committee. The inquiry and this report is a fine example of cooperation between Commonwealth and state with the aim of improving public administration and the welfare of indigenous peoples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to thank members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts' secretariat&mdash;Mr John Carter, Maureen Chan, James Catchpole, Donna Christophers and Laura Gillies&mdash;for their outstanding assistance in this most difficult task. I commend the report to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I rise briefly to add my remarks to the tabling of the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts into the financial accountability requirements faced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander local councils. As a Queenslander, I was particularly interested in this inquiry. As the chairman has pointed out, it was the first time a joint inquiry has been conducted by a federal and a state committee of public accounts. It was appropriate that the two committees worked together as funding for the councils is derived from both the Queensland and federal governments. During 1995&hyphen;96, the councils received $82.3 million from the Commonwealth government and almost $40 million from the Queensland state government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the inquiry the committees visited most of the Aboriginal councils and the Torres Strait Islander councils, in particular the DOGIT communities in Cape York and councils in the Torres Strait Islands. For all members of the committees this was an enlightening and rewarding experience. Most of these communities are extremely isolated and suffer from poor infrastructure. They also have difficulties in retaining competent staff. At all times during the inquiry, the hospitality and commitment shown to the committees by the staff in these remote locations was warm, open and friendly. The visits were extremely informative for members of the committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report arose as a result of the concerns expressed by the Queensland Auditor-General 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about the financial administration of the Aboriginal and Islander councils. Both committees agreed that the most practical way forward would be to establish a grant providers forum at the ministerial level which would oversee the introduction of standardised financial acquittals and reporting requirements. The committees agreed that the major agencies responsible for granting allocations should immediately commence negotiations to achieve standardisation of their grant and acquittal processes. We all felt that cooperation by these agencies would address a large percentage of the current financial difficulties faced by the councils.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to personally congratulate all the members of the committee from both parliaments who took part in this unique experiment. It was both rewarding and fulfilling for all the members of the committees involved. On this historic day when the Wik legislation is to be debated in the Senate, it is interesting to see that members from both sides of not only this parliament but also the Queensland parliament could hand down a unanimous report, a report that was based on a sense of fairness by all involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to place on record my thanks to the staff of the committee, particularly John Carter, who chaired it up.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;As the Deputy Chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I will make some brief comments now on one of these reports but, as I understand we will be taking note of these reports, look forward to continuing my comments in the Main Committee at a later date. I found the inquiry into Aboriginal councils and Torres Strait Island councils and the review of financial accountability requirements to be a fascinating exercise, particularly in view of the fact that it was, as has been said by earlier speakers, a first for cooperation between federal and state jurisdictions in that it was a joint inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That produced some difficulties, but I would like to particularly congratulate the staff of both committees and the leadership of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11197"> both committees for the very constructive way that they went through those problems and worked towards a constructive approach, which I think was successful. I would like to thank the staff for their work in a general sense in what was quite an interesting area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An extensive inspection process took place around this particular issue, and also extensive evidence was taken from state and federal agencies. I will refer to some of those issues very briefly. One of the problems that was seen with respect to the situation faced by Aboriginal and Islander councils was the matter of isolation. There were problems in respect of the levels of infrastructure which could be very basic but created difficulties in actually doing their jobs as councils. There was also the problem of getting staff and keeping staff in isolated locations. This, of course, is not Aboriginal and Islander specific; it is something that faces all organisations in isolated rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue was the question of paperwork. Because of the range of departments both federal and state who in fact are dealing with communities of this nature, a myriad of different types of paperwork is required for the acquittal of funds and for the application for grants. It is quite phenomenal and in itself creates a significant difficulty. When we talk about accountability arrangements for Aboriginal and Islander communities, there is a significant degree of difficulty in the accountability process because of the range of different areas from which they are required to try to gain funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly the committees agree that a need for consistency exists which should be developed over time. Hopefully, the grant providers forum will assist with the question of standardisation of processes and approaches and also cooperation between federal and state, even within federal and state, jurisdictions to ensure a situation whereby these processes are not only made easier for the communities themselves to meet the requirements but also streamlined from the department's point of view as to what information is actually required in the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other recommendations go to the question of field officers. It was certainly the view of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the committee and the committee members that field officers could play a crucial role from the point of view of both the TSRA and ATSIC and also of the state department to actually assist in making this system work much better and to provide an expertise and a skill level in facilitating that assistance on the ground for the particular councils involved. I commend the report to the House. I look forward to making some comments on it at a later date. I congratulate all those who were involved in its creation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The movement to user-choice for Commonwealth litigation services could be implemented through an administrative arrangement. However, the government has chosen to re-establish the Australian Government Solicitor as an independent statutory authority so as to place it on an even footing with private sector law firms to compete for private sector work. The government has proposed this reform in this structure in what it describes as the interests of competition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During Senate estimates, it was revealed that the new Australian Government Solicitor would no longer employ persons under the terms and conditions of the Public Service Act. The loss of many of these terms and conditions are a concern of many employees within the Australian Government Solicitor's office. Interestingly, however, many within the AGS will receive substantially higher salaries as a result of this change. I repeat: many within the AGS will receive substan 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="11198"> tially higher salaries as a result of this change&mdash;particularly those employed at partner level equivalents. For such persons, private sector market forces are likely to drive up their salaries from current SES levels to amounts approaching $250,000 plus per year. Such people will also be eligible for fringe benefits such as luxury cars, payment of children's school fees, et cetera as currently occurs for other private law firms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I first commenced practice in 1979. I was in private practice for three months and I then went to what was the Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales. I was employed there from December 1979 to September 1987 when I was appointed as a Public Defender. I remained in that position from October 1987 to February 1990 when I resigned that office of profit to contest the federal seat of Banks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have served within the legal aid system and I know how professional those who work for government are. I have seen the New South Wales Public Service decimated by SES officers, by bringing in outsiders&mdash;some of it in the name of competition. I have seen salary packages rise for those on the higher echelons and jobs for others disappear. I have not seen any better competition. I have not seen any better service to government as a result of those changes. I am of the view that what the government is doing here will not enhance competition and will not enhance service delivery to government in a timely, cost-efficient way. This is a backdoor way of privatisation&mdash;although it is not really backdoor in many respects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we need to nail this myth that those in the Public Service necessarily want to be on the same salary package and necessarily have the same value system as those in the private sector. I know that but for the fact that I was elected to parliament I would have remained a public defender. I was proud to serve as a public defender and before that as a public solicitor. Indeed, I left private practice after three months and was rescued by the legal aid system in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many people who are not attracted by salary packages. There is a different ethos for those who serve in the public sector. There are very many professional solicitors 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and barristers in the federal bureaucracy and the state bureaucracy and it is not salary packages that attract them. Some of it is commitment to public service and security of tenure. When you start introducing contract systems, people move on after a while. There is not the continuity of service. There is not the professionalism of service. There are plenty of examples to date that show that this has not worked when it has been introduced in other areas of the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result, we say the cost to the AGS of providing legal services to the Commonwealth can be expected to rise dramatically. Further, the AGS will be subject to the making of payments that the Attorney&hyphen;General and Minister for Finance and Administration determine are comparable with the taxation burden and profit share of private law firms. These will also significantly increase the AGS's costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current market for government legal services is highly price sensitive, with the AGS consistently tendering for government legal work at highly competitive pricing rates. Imposing these significant additional costs on the AGS will increase the cost of its services to government, thereby lessening price competition in the government legal services market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result for government departments and agencies is that they will have to either pay considerable higher costs to obtain services or simply acquire fewer of those services. Neither outcome, it is submitted, is in the national interest. The only winners from the government's policy will be the partners of Australia's largest law firms, who will be able to increase their profits and market shares, and those employees of the AGS who will be in a position to attract significantly higher remuneration packages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On another note, the government's policy has recognised that there is a considerable public interest in the Attorney-General retaining some control over the conduct of litigation services to the Commonwealth. The good name of the Commonwealth could readily be degraded if lawyers were to conduct sharp practices in the Commonwealth's name. To this end, the government has introduced a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11199"> complex system of directives that the Attorney can issue in respect of litigation matters generally and in relation to specific cases. These directives would be enforceable by contractual remedies only and would of course be subject to breaches of the directives coming to the Attorney's attention. The office established to perform this wide&hyphen;ranging oversight role will be staffed by only three people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, it is submitted that, given the very real interest in the Commonwealth retaining control over government related litigation services, the model proposed by the government does not adequately protect the public interest. We also submit that only the retention of litigation services in the hands of the Commonwealth will satisfy this requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition's position, as determined by caucus today, is that we will be opposing the  Judiciary Amendment Bill 1997 . That is it in a nutshell&mdash;opposition. We do not believe this legislation is for the benefit of Australians. We believe that it is detrimental and that the government is on the wrong track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Attorney-General (Mr Williams), who started with the reputation as someone who was a lawyer and not a politician, has lost all self-respect in his inability to take on successfully his cabinet colleagues, his ministerial colleagues and his caucus colleagues. Time and time again, he has been rolled, and this is another area where he should have fought longer and harder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Morale in the public sector is at an all-time low. There is a different psyche around at the moment. People are feeling depression. We are not rewarding loyalty. We are not rewarding professional public servants. There are no more Nugget Coombs on the horizon as a result of this government. They are driving them out. They are not giving them the encouragement, and this is another area where that is happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, it is affecting the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department and those within the department. The dogs are barking. We do not want an Attorney&hyphen;General who is just another politician; we do not want an Attorney&hyphen;General who does not stand up in certain areas. In 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> relation to this area, we want what is there at the moment. It has a proven track record. Provide them with higher remuneration packages if you want professionals to come from the outside to the inside; give them incentives, but give them security of tenure, and do not impose burdens on them that do not allow them to compete on a level playing field. In our view, that is what this legislation does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite simply, the opposition will be opposing this legislation. We know who will be cheering it&mdash;the top end of the legal profession. But go and talk to a number of senior academics, former judges and public interest policy experts. They would be despairing at what this government is proposing to do with this bill. Dutifully, and in the spirit of providing professional public service, those people who advise government will cop it on the chin. When they come before a Senate committee they will dutifully answer the questions professionally, and it will be all for the worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is not much more to say, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am not one who believes in using the full 30 minutes allocated to me, even though we have it&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While we do not chastise the member for Banks (Mr Melham) for speaking for only 13 minutes, I think it is noteworthy that all the Labor Party has to say about the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R382">Judiciary Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  is no, which could have been said in a matter of seconds without blathering on for 13 minutes in a very negative, opportunistic and populist way. The Labor Party tries to tout itself as `new Labor', but `new Labor' seems to have an answer which is negative in every single instance where the government is trying to achieve reform. It hankers more after the past&mdash;perhaps, in the words of the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), taking a stroll down memory lane with the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor says no to every initiative that the government tries to bring to this chamber. On this matter, which you would have thought was a straight up and down, sensible sort of change which the Labor Party would have supported in government&mdash;and probably thought about in government and wanted to introduce&mdash;its answer in opposition is simply no. I know the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) is chafing at the bit within the Labor Party because he wants to try to bring about reform and change. He would really like to see the Labor Party embrace competition policy and other such things which, in government, the Labor Party happily introduced. But in opposition, sadly, it has returned to its old negative ways of the fifties and sixties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very disappointing that the Labor Party has chosen to oppose this legislation. It can only be categorised as opportunistic in the extreme. It is time to look to the future, not to the past. Labor has to understand that the world has changed dramatically, if not in the last year, at least in the last five, 10, 15 or 20 years. The world is a different place. Expecting government to simply stand still in time until those opposite return to the government benches is a very forlorn hope.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill implements the decisions of the government in response to the Report of the Review of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Legal Practice. The report was handed down in March 1997; it is known as the Logan report. The Logan report recommended that the AGS be established as an authority separate from the A&hyphen;G's department. This is a recommendation accepted and implemented by the government in this bill. The bill also gives the Attorney&hyphen;General the power to issue legal services directions with respect to Commonwealth legal work. These directions will apply mainly to clients but can be extended to private law firms and the Australian Government Solicitor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government initiated the Logan report in March 1996. The coalition had promised to review legal services provided by the Attorney&hyphen;General's Legal Practice in our most excellent policy on law and justice delivered at the last federal election. We had hoped that there was potential for government departments and agencies to use private legal firms for litigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Logan report was completed by March 1997 and handed down that month. The report contained 16 recommendations. The most significant thrust of the report's recommendations was that most of the legal services aspect of the Attorney-General's Legal Practice could be separated from the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department and established in a distinct statutory authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) has introduced into the House this bill to accept 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11201"> the major theme of the Logan report and to restructure the Legal Practice into a statutory organisation to be called the Australian Government Solicitor. In this bill, the government gives legal effect in an administrative and technical sense to that desire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are four issues in relation to the bill that I would like to deal with briefly today. The first is why the Australian Government Solicitor is not being established as a government business enterprise limited liability company. The second is why the government is limiting the Attorney-General's client base to government departments and agencies. The third is the corporate governance and accountability arrangements that will apply to the Australian Government Solicitor; and, finally, I would like to deal with issues of competitive advantage over private law firms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, why isn't the Australian Government Solicitor being established as a government business enterprise company? The Attorney&hyphen;General's Legal Practice currently operates as an organisational unit within the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department. The Australian Government Solicitor is given statutory recognition as a body corporate by the Judiciary Act 1903 but does not have a structure distinct from the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department. At a state and territory level, current rules governing the ownership and organisation of private law firms either prevent lawyers from incorporating their practices or, where incorporation is allowed, require that controlling directors carry unlimited personal and joint liability and that profit and revenue be distributed to legal practitioners controlling the company or a limited group of other persons, for example, close family members of legal practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Current state and territory laws which place restrictions on lawyers incorporating their practices mean that it would not be possible to make the Australian Government Solicitor a legal practitioner corporation that is lawfully able to practise in all jurisdictions under state and territory laws. The Commonwealth did not consider it appropriate to legislate to shield the AGS from the operation of these state and territory laws and allow it to operate as a limited liability company. Further, estab 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lishing the AGS as a company, with the directors having separate obligations under the Corporations Law, could have impaired the Attorney&hyphen;General's ability as the Attorney&hyphen;General to meet his accountability responsibilities in relation to professional legal services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Establishing the AGS as a statutory authority will give it a transparent organisational structure and enable it to focus on the provision of legal services to government. The structure will give the AGS flexibility in relation to its business operations and staffing, which will be necessary if it is to compete with private law firms. The establishment of the AGS as a statutory authority was the option recommended by the Logan committee. Indeed, the Attorney&hyphen;General's second reading speech outlines very clearly why we have structured the AGS in the way we have. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee found that maintaining government ownership of the Legal Practice was in the public interest. The reasons for this included the ability of the Legal Practice to meet the legal services needs of the Commonwealth&mdash;which could be put at risk if the Legal Practice were sold&mdash;its abilities to meet the legal services needs of departments and agencies because of its particular focus on government work, its ability to maintain a `whole of government' approach, its strong corporate memory and the need for a government legal service provider to meet the unique role and needs of the Attorney-General in providing legal services which are core to government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Amendments to the Judiciary Act are necessary to establish this new statutory body outside the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department and to provide for its powers and functions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Secondly, why does the bill limit the Australian Government Solicitor's client base to government departments and agencies? The functions of the AGS are set out in proposed section 55K. Proposed section 55N lists the persons and bodies for whom the AGS may act in the exercise of its functions and they include: the Commonwealth; ministers; statutory authorities; companies in which the Commonwealth has a controlling interest; statutory officers, Commonwealth officers and employees; non&hyphen;self&hyphen;governing territories of the Commonwealth; bodies established under a law of the relevant territory, their officers or 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11202"> employees and statutory officers&mdash;the Commonwealth's powers in this area stem from Section 122 of the constitution&mdash;a state or state persons or bodies, if requested by the state; self&hyphen;governing territories (the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island) and persons and bodies of these territories, if requested by the territory; and, finally, other persons and bodies if requested to do so by the Attorney&hyphen;General, or if the chief executive officer of the AGS so determines, provided that such services would be within the functions of the AGS. This category includes: liquidators, receivers, managers and bankruptcy trustees appointed in relation to companies or estates in respect of which the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth agency is a creditor, and persons who are the subject of an indemnity given by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides that the AGS will only be able to provide legal and related services to a limited class of clients as outlined&mdash;essentially, the Commonwealth government and its emanations as well as state and territory persons and bodies, if requested by a state or territory. This limitation is required because of constitutional limits. In essence, the functions of the AGS as a Commonwealth statutory authority have been limited to come within the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth. However, the AGS will be able to provide services to the full range of clients within those limits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The more focused client base of the AGS will enable it to deliver a unified, specialised and nationally coordinated approach to government legal services&mdash;which must come as a great comfort to the member for Werriwa. The AGS has characteristics which distinguish it from a private law firm. It has a unique value to government arising from its ownership by the government and its expertise in the delivery of legal services to government clients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, what corporate governance and accountability arrangements will apply to the AGS? The AGS will be subject to an appropriate level of governance, control and supervision reflecting both its ongoing public ownership and legal services and business 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> objectives. The Minister for Finance and Administration and the Attorney&hyphen;General acting jointly will be responsible for determining the corporate governance requirements that will apply to the AGS. This will enable us, acting as joint shareholders, to establish policies for the operation of the AGS generally consistent with the approach adopted under the government's government business enterprise arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, governance arrangements will be able to require the AGS to pay a dividend to the Commonwealth and make other payments for the purpose of ensuring the AGS does not enjoy any net competitive advantage over its competitors by virtue of its public ownership. The AGS will also be subject to the provisions of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997, which provides reporting and accountability rules for Commonwealth authorities and for matters such as banking, investment and the conduct of officers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, doesn't the AGS exemption from taxation laws give it a competitive advantage over private law firms? That is the question I want to deal with today. The approach adopted by the states and territories is to exempt their business enterprises from Commonwealth taxes, pending resolution with the states and territories of issues relating to implementation of competitive neutrality principles. Once these issues have been resolved, it may become appropriate to prescribe state and territory taxing statutes to which the AGS will be subject. The bill provides for that possibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill establishes a mechanism to require the AGS to pay to the Commonwealth amounts equivalent to any Commonwealth, state or territory taxes which do not apply to the AGS. The AGS will, therefore, not enjoy any competitive tax advantages over private law firms. The tax equivalent payment will be based on the total amount of the tax liability that would have been incurred under Commonwealth, state and territory laws if the AGS were a firm of legal practitioners. This is in accordance with the government's competitive neutrality policy statement, of which taxation neutrality is a major compo 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="11203"> nent. Further, the bill provides for the capacity to prescribe state and territory taxation laws to which the AGS will be subject if that becomes appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am genuinely disappointed in the opposition for their lack of foresight and vision to the next century. I hope the member for Werriwa, the member for Banks and other members of the shadow ministry reconsider their opposition to this bill. One would hope that, with the changes to be wrought by the  Judiciary Amendment Bill 1997 , the AGS will become a competitive and exciting new venture for the federal government. I know it has been welcomed by legal practitioners within the government who look for a new age of legal activity on behalf of the Commonwealth government. So I ask them to reconsider their position. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

I am a barrister and solicitor and do hold practising certificates in Victoria and New South Wales, but I do not practise, despite holding those certificates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Judiciary Amendment Bill 1997  has been brought about following careful consideration by the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) and the government of recommendations of the Logan committee. I will talk a little about that in a moment. The aspects of the bill I would like to comment on include: the consultation process leading to this legislation, which has been very substantial, and I will inform members of the House of that consultative process; why the government did not proceed to privatise the AGS; why the AGS has been handed a guaranteed category of tied work, certain work which is guaranteed; why the bill provides exemptions from state and territory laws for AGS and Attorney-General lawyers; and, finally, if time permits, why the bill contains amendments to permit the AGS and the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department to act for two or more parties.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) was not aware of the consultative process&mdash;if he were, he would be embarrassed, because it was very extensive. It made certain that the Attorney-General and the government were fully aware of the feelings of a wide section of interested people. The Logan committee, as we all know, consulted extensively with government departments, agencies and the private sector on all issues that were the subject of the recommendations. The process of consultation included calling for written submissions&mdash;and there were, I think, more than 40 very substantial submissions from a wide range of government agencies, departments, private practitioners and organisations. That list is available if members would like to see it. It is a very impressive list. We in the government thank those people for their interest and their constructive submissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An independent survey of client departments and agencies was also commissioned. Ernst and Young were also commissioned to report on the business performance of the Legal Practice. A consultative committee was established comprising public and private sector representatives. Meetings took place with key figures, senior partners of Australia's major law firms and key stakeholders such as the Law Council and the CPSU. As a result of those consultations, the government and I as a member of the coalition government are very confident that all relevant views and interests have been taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will always be some who argue that the provisions of the bill do not go far enough. It seems that the honourable member for Banks does not want any progress at all. It is quite sad to hear his comments. Some people say that the provisions of the bill go too far. No-one could deny that the bill is a product of extensive inquiry and consultation that involved the participation of all affected parties. It is a good bill as a result of that. I commend the Attorney-General for his work and leadership in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consultation on the bill has also been with the Department of Finance and Administration and on specific issues has involved Treasury, Workplace Relations, and PM&amp;C, as well as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11204"> departments and agencies whose legislation is subject to consequential amendments. This is very appropriate because of the confidential nature of the information prior to the introduction of the bill. However, the views of others who will be affected by the reforms, particularly private law firms, were presented in the Logan committee report and taken into account by the government in considering its response to the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why doesn't the government privatise the AGS? The Logan committee examined a number of options for reform of the Legal Practice including sale, privatisation or winding up. The committee decided that privatisation would not be in the Commonwealth's best interests because it would leave the Commonwealth at significant risk that its special legal needs might not be met; it would deny departments and agencies the opportunity to meet their obligations by recourse to a central public sector provider&mdash;an option that they strongly supported; and it would leave the Attorney-General at significant risk that his needs and responsibilities as Australia's first law officer could not be fully met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, it would be difficult to convert the major assets of the Legal Practice into a saleable form. Those assets include intangibles such as the practice's management and people, its historical performance, the high regard in which it is held by its clients, and its corporate memory. Maintaining the Legal Practice but opening it up to greater competition will not only result in increased efficiencies for the AGS but also in more efficient legal services delivery to the whole government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Logan committee considered the four options for reform of the Legal Practice. The three options rejected by the committee were: firstly, the status quo with competitive neutrality; secondly, the status quo with competitive neutrality and greater contestability; and, thirdly, privatisation. Closure of the practice without a sale would cost the government, according to Ernst &amp; Young's estimate, some $65 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next question I wish to address is: why is the AGS being handed a guaranteed category of the legal work which I will refer to as 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> `tied work'? There is a small category of Commonwealth legal work that relates so closely to the core executive activity of government that coordinated central provision is necessary in the interests of sound risk management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Legal work falling within core areas will therefore be tied to the AGS. This work will not be contestable by private law firms. The core work is primarily legal advice and litigation involving cabinet, national security, and constitutional matters. This result is consistent with the recommendations of the Logan committee, which found a considerable level of agreement for this outcome amongst departments, agencies, and even private legal firms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee recommended that departments and agencies be required to use the AGS for legal services that relate so closely to a core activity of the government that sound risk management makes coordinated, central  provision  of  legal  services  desirable  or necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from the core areas, all other areas of Commonwealth legal work&mdash;including, for the first time, litigation&mdash;will be contestable by private law firms. Any suggestion that this tied work represents an unfair competitive advantage needs to be balanced by reference to the limited government and government related client base to which the AGS is subject.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So existing legal services directions provide for a wide range of legal work, particularly litigation, to be tied to the Legal Practice. Some of this work is performed on a commercial, billable basis. A significant proportion of the work currently tied to the Legal Practice will be made contestable under the new arrangements. The work that is to be tied to the AGS will kept to the minimum necessary to avoid risks and to protect the interests of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next point I wish to address is: why does the  Judiciary Amendment Bill 1997  contain amendments to permit the  AGS and the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department to act for two or more parties? The Judiciary Act already provides that Attorney-General's Department lawyers who are also Australian 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11205"> Government Solicitor lawyers may act for two or more parties in the same matter. This provision is desirable, because there are situations where having the AGS act for two parties is highly desirable&mdash;for example, in certain cases where the matter involves core government work or where it requires specialised knowledge of government legal issues not readily available in the private sector. It may also be in the Commonwealth's interests for the AGS to act for two  Commonwealth agencies in an attempt to prevent litigation between them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides a flexible regime, requiring the approval of the Attorney-General if the AGS is to act for more than one party in the same matter. The approval, by the way, can be by way of general arrangements or in a specific case. This will enable the Attorney&hyphen;General to control risks and help protect the interests of departments and agencies. For example, the Attorney&hyphen;General's approval could be withheld if granting it could result in serious prejudice to the interests of one of the parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A similar provision is justified in relation to Attorney-General's Department lawyers. The ability for them to act for two or more parties may be important where, for example, the department has been asked to give advice to two or more parties on legislation administered by the department. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the background on these points is that the duties and obligation of lawyers under state&hyphen;territory rules could place restrictions on the ability of Attorney-General's Department lawyers to act for two or more parties in the same matter where the parties' interests conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the reasons I have set out, legislative provisions are therefore necessary to permit lawyers to act for two or more parties. Apart from a requirement for Attorney-General's approval, the new provision is wider than the existing one in that the existing provision applies only to AGS lawyers and does not enable AGS to act for two parties with conflicting interests in litigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is good legislation. I might say that I think the short contribution by the member for Banks on behalf of the opposition, in which he trumpeted the opposition's total 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> opposition to this legislation, will be quite embarrassing when it is read and studied by members of the public, the profession and all of those interested in the administration of legal matters from the Commonwealth perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The speaker for the opposition in fact tried to provide a suggestion, an atmosphere, that the government did not wish to have a strong, viable, vibrant, efficient Public Service. How wrong he is. The Public Service Bill that has been frustrated by the opposition in the Senate is in fact a major piece of legislation which has been widely supported by responsible members of the Public Service and the community. It is seen as a very important pacemaker in the development of a modern Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems that the honourable member for Banks wants to hold back the Public Service. He wants to hold back the whole machinery of government and to dwell in the past, as if that cosy blanket of the past is what is best for this nation. His contribution did not spell out any reasons why the bill should be opposed on its merit. It was an emotional appeal: `Don't change. Please don't change. I can't cope with change.' It was quite sad to see the member confess that it was change which he could not cope with, and that was why the opposition was opposing the bill. I think the opposition will regret very much its intransigent attitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, looking at the history of the opposition's performance over the last 20 months since this new government was elected, most of the major reforms of this new government have been delayed by the opposition. The opposition has tried to frustrate those reforms; it has misrepresented the purpose of those reforms; and it has set about dividing the community and trying to be a very spoiling opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition, when in government for 13 years, failed because it sat on issues that it should have addressed. It is to be blamed and condemned for that. You would have thought that the previous government, thrown into opposition so overwhelmingly by the Australian people, would resolve that it would not stand in the way of reform and that it would 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11206"> welcome the changes that it should have introduced itself. Whilst feeling guilty about not doing it&mdash;because of the various vested interests that prevented Labor from being a reformative government&mdash;at least it should welcome these changes and help them to be bedded in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, no, once again we see a demonstration of intransigence and a very negative approach. It is a very sad thing for Australia, because one would have hoped that the member for Banks would have at least put some arguments on the merit about why the opposition will oppose this reform. But he did not do that at all. He was very lacking in his presentation in that area. It reflects the strategy of the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the shadow minister at the table, the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), cannot nod, he must be feeling&mdash;because he has a lot of vigour and interest in reform and I do appreciate that&mdash;very frustrated in his own heart that the years and years that he will spend in opposition will be as part of a worn-out, tattered, divided, negative organisation&mdash;the Labor opposition&mdash;which cannot even apologise to the Australian people for what it did in the 13 years and for what it failed to do in the 13 years that it was in government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to add my contribution to those of the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) and the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman), both of whom made very thoughtful speeches on this very important piece of legislation, the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R382">Judiciary Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . This bill gives effect to the decision of the government, announced in March this year, to implement the recommendations of the Logan review of Commonwealth legal services in relation to the Attorney-General's Legal Practice. The bill establishes the Australian Government Solicitor as a separate statutory authority and provides that the Attorney-General and the Minister for Finance and Administration&mdash;two ministers, as is customary&mdash;are to be the responsible ministers for this statutory authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CEO will determine the terms and conditions of staff who will be employed outside the Public Service. The AGS, while 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> retaining sole responsibility for legal services on core government issues such as national security, cabinet material and constitutional matters, will be restructured to comply with the principles of competitive neutrality to enable it to compete with the private sector while maintaining transparency and accountability. This is a very important reform. The Attorney-General (Mr Williams) deserves our compliments for bringing this legislation into the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) deserves our condemnation for the diatribe of negativity that we heard when he spoke a short while ago. As the honourable member for Indi pointed out, the honourable member for Banks simply said, in effect, that he was unable to cope with change. While he was opposed to what the government was doing, he did not adequately explain to the Australian people the reasons why the opposition is failing to support this very important reform. At the end of the day, anyone who is listening to this broadcast or who reads the parliamentary <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will see what a shallow, ineffective contribution was made by the honourable member for Banks today in the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the time available to me, I intend to cover a number of points which have been raised in relation to the bill. Firstly, I intend to cover the reason why the employees of the Australian Government Solicitor will not be employed under the Public Service Act. The honourable member for Banks opposed the removal of AGS employees from the Public Service Act. The government very strongly supports the provision in the bill which brings this about. Secondly, I will deal with the proposed structure of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department after the establishment of the new AGS. Thirdly, I will point out why the Attorney-General's power to issue directions is so broad. Fourthly, I will point out how the government can justify the abrogation of legal professional privilege by the passage of this bill. And, if there is time after those matters have been dealt with, I will advise the House on the reason why consequential amendments are required to other legislation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11207">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> With respect to the reason that AGS employees will not be employed under the Public Service Act, it is important that the AGS has the ability to manage the long-term employment conditions of its staff. This is a crucial matter to its long-term viability. It would be totally wrong for blanket public service conditions to be imposed on the AGS as it seeks to be competitive and seeks to perform in the marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AGS will face strong competition from the private sector. We all know that private sector competitors are free to negotiate wages and conditions with their staff. It is absolutely vital that the AGS be given similar flexibility and that it not be hidebound by the Public Service Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the necessary flexibility for government departments will be achieved if the government's version of the Public Service Bill 1997  is enacted, the government's clear policy is that the AGS will be a government business enterprise, a GBE, and that these enterprises should be completely outside public sector employment regimes. Regardless of the fate of the Public Service Bill , we are determined that the AGS will be able to employ people outside the Public Service Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the AGS is not given this flexibility, it will be operating at a significant disadvantage because of the difficulty of attracting staff if the employment conditions on offer to AGS lawyers are not comparable with those available in the private sector. The honourable member for Banks said that there are altruistic lawyers who are not governed by the almighty dollar and that there are some who wish to go into public sector employment. I certainly admit that there are some who wish to be in public sector employment, but I do not believe that we should force those who work in the public sector to work at a financial disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Logan committee recognised that the AGS would need this flexibility to reward its staff and provide incentives equivalent to those available in the private sector. It therefore recommended that the AGS be conferred with significant employment flexibility. This does not mean that there will be a wages bonanza for AGS staff. Salaries and benefits 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will naturally be set in accordance with business and market principles and, most importantly, they will need to be funded. Along with other business expenses, including payment to the government of a dividend and tax equivalent payments, these items will come out of AGS income in the same way that they do in other businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment, the staff at the Australian Government Solicitor are employed under the Public Service Act 1922 as employees of the Attorney-General's Department. We all know about some of the wages being paid by private sector law firms. We all know about their greater freedom in relation to setting wages and conditions. That is why we seek in this bill to give the chief executive officer of the AGS the ability to set wages and conditions for staff. That is contained in proposed section 55ZB.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now wish to move to what will be the structure of the Attorney-General's Department after the establishment of the new AGS as a statutory authority. The new AGS will contain most of the legal service elements of what is currently the Attorney-General's Legal Practice. The policy elements of the Legal Practice will remain within the Attorney-General's Department. It is most important that that be noted. This division follows the structure recommended by the Logan committee. The division will allow the AGS to deliver legal services as an organisation specifically structured for that purpose. The division will also permit the Attorney-General's Department to focus on its legal policy functions. These are core functions to government regardless of what party is in office. However, the department will continue to provide and charge for some legal advice, primarily in relation to international law and legislation, which is administered by the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The department has numerous other functions which are not in either category, including functions carried out by Insolvency Trustee Services Australia, Legal Aid and Family Services, the Office of Law Enforcement Coordination, the Protective Security Coordination Centre and the Australian Protective Service. A new element of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11208"> Attorney-General's Department is the Office of Legal Services Coordination, which was established in July 1997 to assist the Attorney-General in carrying out his first law officer functions in relation to the delivery of legal services to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, this new structure of the Attorney-General's Department reflects the recommendations of the Logan committee. It ought be noted that, prior to the formal separation on 1 July 1998, from 1 July 1997, the legal services elements that will comprise the AGS have been separated administratively from the elements remaining with the department. Therefore, it is important to note that this reform is not going to be a sudden death occurrence on 1 July 1998 and that changes are moving in an evolutionary way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people have asked why the Attorney-General's power to issue directions is so broad. That is one matter that I wish to address in my contribution to this debate. The bill will give the Attorney-General the power to issue directions about the provision of legal services to the Commonwealth. Even those opposite would admit that this power is essential to the Attorney's ability to manage and reduce risks arising from legal services that are inconsistent, uncoordinated or that do not identify and deal with whole of government and public interest issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the matters that may be appropriate for directions include specifying categories of matters for which departments and agencies are required to use the AGS. Core work, including primarily cabinet, constitutional or national security matters, will be tied to government legal service providers. Another obligation that will be imposed is to require Commonwealth departments and agencies to act as a model litigant. These directions will apply primarily to client departments and agencies but will be capable of applying not just to the AGS and departmental legal units but also to private law firms when they provide legal services to the Commonwealth. This potentially broad application of directions is important from a competitive neutrality perspective and is also necessary because private law firms will be providing legal services to government. If they were exempt 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from directions, this could lead to inconsistencies and a lack of coordination in the delivery of Commonwealth legal services. The government certainly would not wish to see that occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Compliance with the directions will only be able to be enforced by the Attorney-General, and non&hyphen;compliance will only be able to be raised in proceedings by the Commonwealth. This is appropriate given that the purpose of issuing directions will be to enable the Attorney-General to protect the legal interests of the Commonwealth in relation to the delivery of legal services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If any party to proceedings involving the Commonwealth could raise an alleged breach of the legal services directions by the Commonwealth, it would seriously prejudice the conduct of Commonwealth litigation as well as cause unnecessary costs and delays. For example, it would be possible in those circumstances for a plaintiff to claim that the Commonwealth should not rely on a particular defence because it was technical or should accept certain facts without proof. The Commonwealth, Commonwealth agencies and Commonwealth officers will be expected to take the obligations under the directions very seriously, but compliance must be an internal matter for the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill does not necessarily expressly provide for the tabling and disallowance of directions. However, to the extent that they are of general application and legislative in character, they will be subject to the tabling and disallowance procedures under the Legislative Instruments Bill once it is passed. The Attorney will be asking the Office of Legal Services Coordination to consult affected parties, where appropriate, before recommending directions for his consideration. That is really a very important change. The government is very keen to make sure that everyone understands why this arrangement is being included in the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next point I wish to address is how the government can justify the abrogation by the bill of legal professional privilege. A legal services direction may require the production of information or documents that relate to the provision of legal advice or to legal proceed 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="11209"> ings. In fulfilling the obligations and duties as first law officer, the Attorney-General may find it necessary to access information or documents, in particular so that he is able to ensure that Commonwealth legal work is consistent and coordinated and promotes the interests of the whole of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In these cases, even if documents or information relates to the provision of legal advice or to legal proceedings, the wider public interest should override the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of communications between solicitor and client. Therefore, the bill provides that claims of legal professional privilege cannot be used to resist disclosure required by directions. This is necessary because the documents or information may be held by a Commonwealth agency which is a legal entity distinct from the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the bill goes no further than is necessary to give effect to the Attorney&hyphen;General's first law officer functions in relation to Commonwealth legal services. In particular, the bill provides that professional privilege or a duty of privilege is not breached, nor is the privilege waived where information or documents are supplied under a legal services direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extent to which the privilege is waived by the bill will not result in any real diminution of the protection for clients that underlies legal professional privilege, because the disclosure will be to the Attorney&hyphen;General, or a person authorised by the Attorney&hyphen;General, for the purpose of ensuring that the Commonwealth's legal affairs are conducted properly; that is, will be occurring in practice within the Commonwealth in a broad sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will also be appropriate that lawyers of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department and other government officers advising on or drafting legislation have access to relevant documents, including legal advices. This will ensure that the Commonwealth advisers are able to give consistent advice to the Commonwealth. For that reason, the privilege or duty will also not be breached, or the privilege taken to be waived, where persons performing Commonwealth legal work voluntarily provide infor 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mation or documents to the Attorney&hyphen;General or an authorised person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last key point that I wish to address is why consequential amendments are required to other legislation. Schedule 3 of the bill provides for minor amendments to other legislation. The majority of the amendments relate to acts administered in other portfolios that confer functions on the secretary to the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department or authorised Attorney&hyphen;General's Department lawyers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The justification for these provisions was that legal affairs of the Commonwealth should be the responsibility of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department and lawyers employed in it. However, this approach is no longer sustainable, given that departments now have much greater responsibility for the management of their own legal affairs and the possibility that private law firms can assist in carrying out many of these functions. Therefore, the amendments provide for those functions to be exercised by more appropriate persons, such as the secretary to the department administering the legislation concerned or an appropriate statutory officer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other amendments relate to acts administered on behalf of the Attorney&hyphen;General by the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department. The FOI amendments either confer functions on more appropriate officers or exempt the new AGS from the operation of administrative law requirements. Consistent with government policy on the exemption of government business enterprises from the operation of administrative law requirements, the AGS will also be exempted from the operation of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 and the Freedom of Information Act 1982. The FOI amendments have the effect of also excluding the AGS from the application of the information privacy principles in the Privacy Act 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes currently before the chamber will give effect to the government's commitments contained in the law and justice policy statement issued prior to the last election. They will ensure the maintenance of the government's own highly regarded law firm, while restructuring the AGS in a competitive 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11210"> environment so that it is a much more efficient organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to attract and retain staff, the AGS will be given necessary flexibility, in line with the government's approach to GBEs generally. It will, therefore, be able to employ staff outside the Public Service Act and will not be constrained, as it would be if its staff employment procedures were controlled by the Public Service Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Private law firms will be assured that the AGS will be bound by the principles of competitive neutrality and will be required to pay tax equivalents, ensuring that there is no hidden competitive advantage for the government's own legal services provider. That is a very important provision, because we are all about open, fair and transparent competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes contained in the bill are a necessary part of the announced opening up of Commonwealth litigation to competition. This will commence on 1 July 1998. As I pointed out, the Attorney&hyphen;General will be given the power to issue directions concerning the provision of Commonwealth legal services, particularly in relation to legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Confronted with such a comprehensive bill, and one which is so obviously necessary and which results from the deliberations of the Logan committee, one would have expected a thought&hyphen;provoking and reasonable response from those opposite and yet, once again, they have taken a negative approach. The opposition has clearly not considered the very important issues contained in this bill. The opposition appears to be caught in a 1940s mind&hyphen;set.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of the opposition are looking backwards and are not forward thinking people. They have forgotten that we are now approaching the next millennium and that the government was elected with a massive majority and therefore has a mandate from the Australian people to implement changes such as those contained in the  Judiciary Amendment Bill 1997 .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, these changes give effect to an election promise. Yet, despite the fact that at the election the Labor Party was hounded 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from office with a massive loss&mdash;we have almost the largest majority in Australian parliamentary history&mdash;members of the opposition come here, through the person of the honourable member for Banks, and seek to frustrate this government as we seek to deliver yet another election promise. It is about time they realised that the Labor Party lost in the 1996 election and that they are going now to allow us to govern&mdash;to introduce our legislation and have it carried by the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was particularly disappointed in the contribution of the honourable member for Banks. It was negative, adding nothing substantial to the debate. It showed that he and his colleagues were locked in ideas from decades ago and are not forward thinking. They are not prepared to support the employment of staff outside the Public Service Act and do not want the AGS statutory authority to be able to compete fairly in the marketplace. They are only prepared to look back to the past and they are unprepared to acknowledge that, as time moves on, government instrumentalities, GBEs, have to become more efficient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian people are sick and tired of this negativity. The speech of the honourable member for Banks indicates what a shallow opposition we have in this place. I believe it indicates that at the next election the Labor Party will once again be resoundingly defeated. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R382">Judiciary Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> gives effect to the government's decisions to implement the report of the review of the Attorney-General's legal practice at March 1997, the Logan report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides for the establishment of the Australian Government Solicitor as a statutory authority separate from the Attorney-General's Department. The bill gives the Attorney-General the power to issue legal 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11211"> services directions in relation to Commonwealth legal work. The directions will apply primarily to government clients but will be capable of applying to private law firms as well as to the AGS. The bill also makes necessary transitional and consequential amendments including in relation to the duties, rights and obligations of Attorney-General's Department lawyers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Logan report was commissioned by me in November last year in fulfilment of the coalition's law and justice policy to undertake a review of legal services provided by the Attorney-General's Legal Practice, including an examination of the possibility of government departments and agencies using private legal firms for litigation to a greater extent than already applied. The Logan committee undertook extensive consultations with relevant parties including law firms in the private sector and the clients&mdash;government departments and agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee delivered its report in March 1997 with 16 recommendations. They included that most of the legal services elements of the legal practice be removed from the Attorney-General's Department and placed in a separate statutory authority. In April this year, I announced that the government had accepted the thrust of the Logan committee recommendations and, in particular, that most of the legal practice would be restructured as a separate statutory organisation known as the Australian Government Solicitor. This bill gives effect to that decision by making the legislative change necessary for the new system of legal services delivery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me now turn to the amazing position of the opposition in relation to this bill. This bill was a response to a recommendation of the National Commission of Audit relating to the untying of government legal services. It was also a response, as I mentioned, to the law and justice policy of the coalition at the last election. But it was something else as well: it was in response to a requirement under bipartisan national competition policy for examination of government enterprises and provision of government services in the context of the national competition principles. What the Logan committee recommended was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in fact a logical extension of reforms that had been entered into under the previous Labor government in relation to the untying of government legal services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Banks, in speaking for the opposition and being the only speaker for the opposition, indicated that the opposition intends to oppose the bill. In saying that, he also continued the disgraceful way the opposition treats this House in relation to matters in the Attorney-General's portfolio. The usual position of the opposition in relation to a bill in the Attorney-General's portfolio area is that the opposition has not yet determined its position but will leave that matter to be sorted out in the Senate. In the Senate we frequently see obstruction and amendment for the sake of amendment of government bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what the member for Banks did in this context was a paltry performance by any standard. The member for Banks does not seem to have given the bill any detailed consideration, did not recognise that it was an exercise required by the national competition policy put in place by the previous government of which he was a part, and did not recognise that it was a simple, logical next step to what had previously been done by Labor. He dealt with issues in relation to employees, the delivery of services and the giving of directions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to employees, he indicated that AGS employees are concerned about loss of Public Service conditions and he suggested that other AGS employees will get much better conditions including luxury cars, school fees for children, and salaries of $200,000. I just wonder whom the member for Banks has consulted, if anybody, in relation to these employment conditions. He seems to be reflecting a very old&hyphen;fashioned union attitude and one wonders whether he even consulted the CPSU or the ACTU in order to make those comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to service delivery, he asserted that the bill will not result in the enhancement of service delivery or efficiency. He indicated the costs for the AGS will rise and therefore private law firms will benefit. There is a total failure on the part of the member for Banks to recognise that the AGS has to compete 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11212"> with private law firms for its employees. Increasingly, competition applies in law firms in Canberra as well as in Sydney and Melbourne. AGS employees are attractive to private law firms and from time to time are poached or at least have offers made to them. In fact, a recent example is that of the secretary to the Attorney-General's Department himself who has transferred to a Canberra branch of a national law firm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AGS currently has to compete with law firms for work for government departments and agencies. This has resulted already in greater efficiencies for the AGS. The AGS has been shown through the Logan review to be competitive both in the quality of its work and in the price of its work. If its fees increase, this will only reflect its costs. Under the bill, it will be able to compete as if it were a private law firm for a greater variety of the work of departments and agencies and would therefore be subject to the stringencies of competition. Being subject to the stringencies of competition, it should not be subject to any restrictions that would prevent it from competing on an equal level. That is what the bill is designed to effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Banks also asserted that the bill represents a backdoor privatisation. I wish to put that notion to rest at once. The AGS is not being privatised. It is not being corporatised for the purpose of being privatised. It is not being softened up for privatisation. Privatisation is not on the agenda. The Commonwealth retains 100 per cent ownership. Under the bill, it will not be a company; it will be a statutory authority. Statutory authorities simply cannot be sold in the same way that a company can. The practice will not be able to be sold for quite a number of other reasons, including the importance of the practice to other areas which are not being untied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is committed to the success of the Australian Government Solicitor as the special legal services provider to government, and under government I include some of the agencies that operate under the Commonwealth rubric. The AGS is already developing into a modern competitive unit. The implementation of the bill will result in its compet 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing on a level playing field with private law firms. It will introduce cost savings. It will introduce efficiencies. The beneficiaries will be the departments and agencies and, through them, the members of the public for whom the departments and agencies operate. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R378">Copyright Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997</XREF>  has profound ramifications for Australia's music industry and for all industries based on effective intellectual property protection. In the 21st century, that means almost every growth industry. The growth industries of the 21st century are the growth industries based on intellectual property.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have a profound, internationally troubling, domestically counterproductive attack upon Australia's intellectual property regime. Why? There are two reasons. Firstly, because of a flawed assessment of alleged consumer benefit, which I will deal with in a moment. Secondly, because the government needs to contrive a mechanism to establish its credentials with that claque of critics who believed that the government were weak wimps on the textiles, clothing and footwear and passenger motor vehicle industries. They need to build up their credentials with the editorial writer of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> and they feel that they can do it here at no cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The music industry is not very important and those left wing musicians do not vote for the government anyway. They feel that the arts&mdash;which they have already defined as the enemy&mdash;and the music industry in particular are expendable in the interests of the economic credentials of the government. They thought they started with an easy consumer line, appealing to young Australians who would like cheaper CDs&mdash;and in fact I do not know anyone in Australia who would not. What we are now finding is that there is a fundamental hole, a gaping hole right at the heart of this bill. The gaping hole is this: the evidence for consumer benefit disappears as soon as you try to establish it. As soon as you analyse it it disappears like a puff of smoke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1990, the Prices Surveillance Authority said that the price of sound recordings was too high. In fact, at that time they were talking about cassettes. The Prices Surveillance Authority said in 1990&mdash;and that has not been reported by the government&mdash;that CD prices were not unduly high or unreasonable, but were in line with overseas prices. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11214"> But its finding in 1990 about the generalised concept of sound recordings, which applied particularly to cassettes at that time, has been the intellectual underpinning of the campaign to allow parallel importation, to do away with effective copyright protection for Australian musicians and the Australian music industry since that day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Notwithstanding the fact that international comparisons conducted not just in Australia but in the UK by the companies Employment Conditions Abroad and Music Business International showed that Australia was near the bottom of the international price for compact discs, there were two comparable countries lower&mdash;that is, the United States and New Zealand. But it is the price differential with the United States that is continually relied upon, except when the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) had a flash of intellectual brilliance and thought he was making a point about New Zealand that he subsequently had to apologise for because he had his facts so wrong. He was misleading the Senate, but he did have the good grace eventually, after he was caught, to come in and apologise for doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the United States price differential that is constantly referred to, and it is claimed that parallel imports will resolve this problem. The problem is there are no parallel imports in the United States. There are no parallel imports into New Zealand. The countries with lower CD prices than Australia do not allow parallel imports but, somehow or other, we will be the exception. No country in the world has found that parallel importation has the price effect that the PSA says it should. It is fairly crude, basic economics that people are asserting, but it is not the real world. There is no example of its working, and the surveys show it to be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, a lot has changed since 1990. There has been a lot of discounting at the wholesale and the retail level. Most top 40 CDs are now available at discount prices at the big discount houses like K&hyphen;Mart, Grace Bros, Brashs, et cetera. There is a proliferation of budget and mid&hyphen;priced category CDs which take up a lot of the rack space of most 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> retail outlets. So at the core it is flawed. The 1990 assessment did say CDs were not overpriced. International assessment says they are not higher than comparable countries. The countries that allow parallel imports do not have lower prices than Australia. The countries with lower prices than Australia do not allow parallel imports. It sounds like a fairly comprehensive demolition but, nevertheless, let us have a look at the general question: do the facts back up the argument that prices will be lower?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Alston had an outburst of honesty&mdash;it was uncharacteristic of him in the way he dealt with this issue&mdash;when on 10 October he said, `You can't give any guarantees in this business.' In this instance, he was referring to lower prices, and he was right. But, before and since that time, we have seen the government's retreat on the reduction in prices that would flow from parallel imports go from the absurd to low farce. On 16 October, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said, `The decision will mean the price of CDs will fall by at least $7.' At the time, I challenged the Prime Minister to establish the factual basis for this assertion, but Australians will be stunned to know in the case of this Prime Minister that none has been forthcoming because there is none.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts thought he would come thundering to the rescue, and he said, `Actually, the price differential would be between $1.60 and $3.' I suppose it is fair enough to allow the Prime Minister a 400 per cent error. That is pretty good. His assessment of the constitutionality and non-discrimination of the Wik legislation is out by much more than 400 per cent, so he is probably doing relatively well. We ought to congratulate him for getting close. He was at least within the same $10 range. The minister said it may be $1.60. The Prime Minister said $7. I suppose that was not bad, but the problem is they cannot even justify the $1.60 to $3 figure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister said that the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics had predicted prices would fall by about $1.60 to $3, and he continues to repeat that. We continually seek access to the bureau's report 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11215"> to assess the basis, but it will not be released. We have written to Senator Alston about it. We asked him in Senate estimates hearings, but the minister refuses to hand it over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us assume for the moment he does have a technical argument that it was a cabinet document. It is an amazing claim, but let us give it credence for the moment because we do not need the whole document. We need only one fact. We need to know what was the prevailing currency assumption on which that price differential was based. Was it based on the current 68c rate or a much higher rate, which we think is the case&mdash;something up between 75c and 80c, maybe 78c?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a vitally important issue because all the independent assessment shows, and all any simple arithmetic would show, is that a minor variation like $1.60 to $3 at an Australian&hyphen;US dollar exchange rate of 78c would evaporate long before you got to the current rate of 68c. The Australian Music Retailers Association is of the view that, at the then current exchange rate of 70c&mdash;I would have to say today the dollar is something like 68.5c&mdash;US imports would be selling at $34 as against the prevailing Australian rate of either $29.95 or $30.95. So there is no price benefit to retailers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The best estimate I can make, without having access to the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics material, is that it is only at an exchange rate of between 75c and 80c that any consumer benefit becomes evident. None of us in this place should speculate about the value of the currency and its prospects&mdash;and I will not&mdash;but I think it is fair to say that no Australian business person is currently predicating their investment plans or making major decisions on the assumption that the dollar is going to be 75c to 80c.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we are talking about the future of a major industry that is economically important, culturally important and socially important, and we are talking about a change to intellectual property law with implications for a whole raft of contemporary industries&mdash;the whole multimedia, new media industry, the computer software industry and the book publishing industry&mdash;all of which are dependent upon an internationally accepted, rigorous 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> system of intellectual property protection in this country. The government is working on the spurious basis that, if only the world was different, there might be a consumer benefit. The evidence is like a puff of smoke&mdash;you try to grab it and it disappears.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You do not need a very profound imagination to work out why the government will not release any of the underlying reports or even the assumptions. It is very revealing, and that series of challenges has driven the government back from the ludicrous $7 that nobody in public life but the Prime Minister would be silly enough to comment on. That was an absurd proposition for which he ought to apologise to the Australian people. After all, the ministerial guidelines say that, if you mislead the public, you should correct the record as soon as possible. We have been waiting, but apparently a 400 per cent error rate is not good enough for the Prime Minister to say, `No, I got it wrong.' So we drove them back to `$1.60 to $3'. In the second reading speech, the best they could come up with was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . all the economic advice obtained suggests that allowing importation of legitimate CDs will lead to a reduction in prices.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Not a word about how much it might be, but that comment itself raises more questions&mdash;questions which I am sure the minister will not answer because they are not convenient questions. The first question is: what constitutes `all the economic advice' the government relies on? Is it the as yet unseen Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics report and, if so, what is the exchange rate upon which this economic advice relies?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, what was the industry advice about the possibility of a reduction in prices? Who associated with the music industry has said that, if the Australian dollar is at 68c or 70c, there will be a substantial price benefit? The government says it consulted with a wide cross-section of the Australian music and copyright industries. What was their advice? Who within that cross-section with whom the government consulted supported this proposal?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose it is hardly surprising that Senator Alston is not coming clean with us about 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11216"> price information. He has been notoriously conducting a campaign of misinformation about the potential price benefits of this bill. The most notorious was his allegation in the Senate on 20 October 1997 that the Savage Garden CD could be purchased in New Zealand for $18.90. We continued to pursue this remarkable allegation that somebody was selling the Savage Garden CD in New Zealand at below the wholesale price. Eventually, four weeks later&mdash;after every conceivable attempt to find some fig leaf of rationalisation for this absurd proposition&mdash;Senator Alston went into the Senate and confessed that he was completely wrong and that the assertion was totally misleading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Something about Savage Garden seems to affect the minister's judgment, because he also sought to argue that the success of Savage Garden and the way in which they achieved their success was justification for these changes because the big six multinational record companies operating in Australia had refused to sign up Savage Garden so they had to go overseas to get signed up and make it big. That would have been a not very relevant but quite interesting story if there had been a scintilla of evidence to support it&mdash;one jot of evidence&mdash;but there was none.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal was categorically denied by the band's manager, John Woodruff, who actually arranged the record contracts in Australia and used the parallel import legislation here and overseas to get the good deals here and around the world for Savage Garden, which is the basis of their success. That is why John Woodruff, like all the other managers of all the other bands in Australia, is a strong supporter of protection against parallel importation of CDs. No wonder Marietta, in her column commenting on the arts in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>, described the minister's remarks as merely opening his mouth to change his feet. This has been the consistent record of his performance on this matter. He wanted to show his tough, economic rationalist credentials in the cabinet. The economic rationalists have been rolled on TCF and passenger motor vehicles, so he was going to show them and he was not going to let a thing like a fact get in the way of a good argument.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want in the time available to move on to the consequences for the music industry and for those who will be adversely affected. It will not give me time to comment in too much depth on two very important parallel issues that are affected by this proposal and have profound concerns for Australia's economic success beyond the music industry over the next few years and into the early years of the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first issue, which I will mention briefly, is the implication for copyright protection and intellectual property protection in Australia. I will not be able to expand on this as much as I would wish in these circumstances&mdash;there are just too many things wrong with this bill to be able to say them all in a mere half hour. Copyright lawyers and copyright counsel are all concerned about this proliferation of parallel importation, not just here but in other areas where previous copyright legislation has had adverse consequences, such as in the food and toy industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are the implications potentially for computer software and a knock&hyphen;on effect if there is a further round of changes for book publishing. The new media and multimedia industries, which are emerging as key industries in the 21st century and where Australia has the capacity to be an important content contributor, depend upon internationally acceptable, domestically rigorous intellectual property legislation. The legislation before us puts our integrity, repute and our economic prospects in those areas in jeopardy. It is a sad and flawed proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also profound trade policy implications. There are those who contend that this measure is in breach of Australia's international obligations under TRIPS, the trade&hyphen;related intellectual property aspects of the World Trade Organisation. That is not my view. I do not think it is in breach of our obligations, but it clearly breaches the spirit of TRIPS and the World Intellectual Property Organisation. Intellectual property protection in the world is in the opposite direction to where Australia is going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, that might not be surprising; we are going in the opposite direction to the developed world in so many other ways&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11217"> racial discrimination and greenhouse, for example. Why shouldn't we do it in intellectual property as well? I suppose you can say it is consistently Neanderthal, but that is hardly a justification. But it has immediate trade policy implications, because there is a serious possibility of the United States government making a section 301 order with regard to Australia because of this matter. It is not a matter they take lightly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am reliably advised that the US trade representative Charlene Barshevsky raised this with our trade minister, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) in Vancouver this week. I know her well&mdash;she would not have done so as a passing fancy or an idle thought. She would have done it because she regards this as a serious question that affects industries important to the United States&mdash;not just the music industry but all those export industries which are important to the United States and which are based on intellectual property.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The film industry, the United States film industry, have already been to see me to express their concern about its implications. What about the music industry, computer software, et cetera? You may find other Australian industries adversely affected as a result of this gauche attempt by this minister to establish credentials which he has not earned and which his performance does not warrant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the time available to me I want to talk more directly about the music industry. The music industry is very important to Australia. It creates a lot of jobs&mdash;not a lot at the manufacturing end, but for those individuals who are involved in manufacturing they are very important jobs. After all, 95 per cent of the CDs sold in Australia are manufactured in Australia. But there are not many of them and they probably vote Labor as well, so they are expendable!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are obviously jobs for musicians. Right through the industry, in ways unseen by this government, there are lots of jobs. There are jobs particularly for young people, for sound engineers, for people who work in the venues that will be threatened. This has ramifications for touring by Australian and international artists. People in the advertising 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industry, people in the public relations industry, the managers, the roadies&mdash;all those people who work in the industry find their jobs under threat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They will not all go; there will still be a music industry in Australia because there are talented Australians who will succeed, some of them domestically, some of them internationally, in spite of this ridiculous policy. We are in danger of transforming our successful exporting, job creating music industry into an importation and distribution industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important for exports and for export potential. It is very important to young Australians as a vehicle for the expression of their view of themselves and their world and of the articulation of the cultural identity of this country which they find through contemporary music. There is no form of entertainment that generates the same level of enthusiasm or commitment from young Australians as contemporary music.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our capacity to produce contemporary music in Australia for Australians at a standard capable of being internationally successful will be undermined by this legislation. This is not just some casual assertion that I make&mdash;I do not make it casually; I take it very seriously. But everybody in the industry supports that view. Probably not surprisingly, those which the government particularly attacks&mdash;the six major companies&mdash;are concerned about this, but some of the small independent Australian companies, and the larger independent Australian companies like Shock Records, which the minister tried to conscript in support of his position, say they are opposed to his position. The managers, who are in constant conflict with the big six because they are the people with whom they negotiate, have a common cause about this because they see this as undermining the best prospect for success for the talented young Australians whom they represent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whomever you speak to in the industry&mdash;the representatives of the smaller companies, the independent companies, the independent producers and the young bands trying to break through&mdash;they express their profound concern about this proposal.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11218">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is obsessed with the big six&mdash;the six multinational companies. While they have done much that is good, they are open to criticism about some of the decisions they have made and the extent of the support they have given to Australian artists. They should be doing more. But this is not the way to get them to do more; this is the way to guarantee they will do less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we resume after dinner, I intend to present in the time available to me such detail as I can about the impact of this proposal on Australian artists and other musicians, which I regard as a very important element of this bill.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Mr McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the four minutes remaining, I want to focus on the music industry. It is a very diverse industry and not very much unites it, but this measure has. We find Australian artists and their managers are uniformly opposed to this bill. Why? Because they recognise that there must an environment that encourages record companies, both majors and independents, to invest in new talent. Crucial to this investment environment is the record companies' ability to hold exclusive copyright on their recordings&mdash;that is, the ability to protect the rights which they have spent the money to produce, free from the threat of free riders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill as it is presently drafted renders the copyright of composers and publishers, as opposed to the copyright of the record producers, basically worthless. If a recording is made in a country without copyright, the sound recording can be imported into Australia without the permission of the composer or publisher and the Australian composer would not get a cent. Even the government concedes that Australian composers will get lower royalties from imports from countries where there is copyright but lower rates. For example, in the United States, the royalty for a composer on a full price CD is 70c compared with $1.65 in Australia. That is a significant attack on their income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ironically, the big retail chains may well do okay because they will be able to make big import orders from overseas, although we 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> may find new American chains coming in. But small retailers will not do so well; they will be at a competitive disadvantage, and they have made this point strongly again and again through the Australian Music Retailers Association. My colleague the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) will give further emphasis to this important question. We have recording engineers, producers, roadies, venue managers and owners and promoters who, to the extent that the record companies will withdraw support from the Australian music industry, will suffer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have the enhanced possibility of piracy. I know this legislation increases the penalties, and we support that. But the problem is that this legislation makes the law unenforceable because it is currently enforced by the information provided by the copyright holder. Without that information, Customs is rendered virtually unable to enforce the anti&hyphen;piracy provisions. The penalties are a good idea, but they are virtually useless in an environment in which the law is rendered unenforceable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the problem of discontinued stock from overseas being able to be reintroduced. The most amazing thing to me is that in this bill the government, for all that it has its economics wrong and there will be little or no price benefit, for all that it has its attack on the big companies so out of line that it will seriously disadvantage many other Australians, has not at least protected Australian artists from the re&hyphen;import of their material produced overseas. I cannot believe that. I have spoken to managers who have had exactly that situation of attempting export promotion unsuccessfully. It is only the parallel importation restrictions that have prevented that stock coming in from overseas, undercutting the local market, and destroying the capacity of those artists to earn a living from their talent. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill seems to be summarised by an attitude towards the music industry which I can summarise as: why have a domestic music industry when you can import one from the United States? There is a gaping hole at the heart of this bill because its thesis about prices is fundamentally flawed. Its approach to the music industry is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11219"> going to have significant adverse consequences on this important industry and this important cultural and social contributor to our society. The opposition rejects and opposes this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak on the  Copyright Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 . This is a bill that will ultimately put more money into the pockets of the youth of Australia&mdash;or more CDs into their discmans. This is a bill that seeks to continue a program of reform, that promotes competition that will benefit all Australians and that will reduce the price of CDs in Australia by providing competition, not protectionism, for the foreign owned multinational companies that control some 85 per cent of the total Australian market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leading into the last election, the federal coalition made it perfectly clear that it wanted to do something about the cost of compact discs from retail outlets. For many in this place who like to talk about the big picture of economic policy, getting the price of compact discs down by removing restrictions on parallel importation might not be a predominant policy objective. Obviously it is not for the Labor Party. It was not when they had the opportunity in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, back in 1990, the former Minister for Consumer Affairs, Nick Bolkus, commissioned the then Prices Surveillance Authority to look into the price of sound recordings. In its conclusions the authority said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that basic preconditions exist which make it possible for the industry to charge high, excessive prices and to price discriminate in a way which works strongly against the interests of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In June 1992 federal cabinet made arrangements to allow parallel imports, but the legislation lapsed in the shadows of the post&hyphen;election period of 1993. In December 1993, Keating's Labor government did a monumental backflip on the retention of prohibitions 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> against parallel imports, with an industry package negotiated between the six major record companies to boot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, in relation to the Copyright Amendment Bill 1997 , said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee . . . having assessed all the evidence, considers that it is inappropriate to use copyright as a vehicle to restrict the parallel importation of products.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But if you could believe the opposition, who seek to protect a handful of foreign owned multinationals, they would have you believe that this is about allowing piracy of recordings to be sold in Australia. The Senate committee report also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also considers that the copyright law should be used strictly for the purposes of protection of intellectual property and not to create other and additional non-tariff barriers to imports . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Labor Party would have our young Australians prop up foreign owned multinationals with their hard&hyphen;earned money and all along they would try to make you believe that they are here to support the battlers of Australia. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said in response to a question on 20 October 1997:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Australian Labor Party has chosen to support a system that allows foreign multinational record companies to make massive profits at the expense of the Australian consumer.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The battlers with young kids who save up to buy the latest CD of their choice are paying too much in Australia for CDs, and the Labor Party supports that concept. I am sure those without the ability to afford the high prices of CDs in Australia will support open and fair competition, which will deliver affordable, competitively priced CDs to our local market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party is expecting the people of Australia to support and protect a handful of foreign owned record distribution companies to the tune of up to $7 per CD. The Labor Party wants young Australians to prop up foreign owned multinationals to the tune of $7 per CD. This is a disgrace. As I said, it has embarked upon a scare campaign to attract the support of a handful of foreign owned multinationals. When in government, the Labor Party supported parallel imports. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11220"> Now in opposition, in relation to parallel imports on CDs, it has just three words&mdash;`just say no'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is like a stance based on blind defiance. Hang the reality, hang the consumer and hang young Australians who are using the Internet to obtain CDs from overseas, simply hanging onto their hard&hyphen;earned dollars. But it is a stance where I ask the current Labor Party members and prospective candidates whether they have really bothered at all in their approach to ask young people what they think about the price they now pay for compact discs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw the House's attention to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Maitland Mercury</EMPHASIS> of 22 October 1997 titled `Music import concern'. The article begins:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Opposition has taken a stand against the Government's propositions to allow parallel importation of CDs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"We are taking a stand on behalf of people who could lose their jobs in the music industry and small music retailers who would face even greater competition from big retailers", said Mr Bob Horne, ALP candidate for Paterson.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The article goes on to say that Mr Horne asserts&mdash;and it borders on the ridiculous at times&mdash;that small retailers would have reduced buying power, that independent producers would be vulnerable to low price imports, that young Australian artists would have more difficulty getting recording contracts and that jobs would be lost in the areas of domestic CD manufacturing. His piece de resistance is that the allowance of parallel imports will not cause the price of CDs to fall. What a load of codswallop!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last point is an outrageous statement to make. I make that statement not as a government MP but as a former wholesaler and importer who understands the issues of competition. As a former importer let me say that I have some understanding of this entire debate. What the Labor candidate for Paterson is saying and what Kim Beazley is saying is that they disbelieve the ACCC and that they do not believe in competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the assertion that there are major numbers of Australians involved in the manufacture of CDs in this country, the figures are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pretty clear-cut&mdash;500 employed in CD manufacturing and fewer than 4,000 people in the retail sector. Yet the opposition would have you believe that all of these jobs will disappear. All the current legal protection arrangements protect is the right to carry a product from the manufacturer to the retailer. In layman's terms that means that the making of CDs in Australia has to stand on its own two feet. Allowing parallel imports makes not one iota of difference to the profitability of manufacture. I am afraid it just comes down to the cost of labour, interest rates, input costs and red tape issues&mdash;factors that this government is very much addressing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, I go further to challenge that retail jobs are under threat anyway. Australian retail sales of compact discs fell by some 7&half; per cent in the past six months of 1997, despite the fact that retail sales generally are on the climb. That figure in itself is a real concern. I hasten to add that it is due in part to two factors: firstly, the artificially inflated price of CDs in this country and, secondly, competition on the Internet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the assertion that young Australians will lose access to potential recording contracts, I have never heard such balderdash. The Australian music industry has thrived on vitality and has long stood on its own two feet. New boom bands such as silverchair from the Hunter were discovered and nurtured by no less than the ABC's Triple J, which has done more for Australian music with its unearthed talent discovery program than all of the overseas distributors put together in the last few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But you do not need my words to criticise their less than credible argument. A young lady by the name of Cynamon Toner from Rutherford wrote in a letter to the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Maitland Mercury</EMPHASIS> on 3 November this year in response to Mr Horne's apparent lack of knowledge of the Australian music industry:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obviously, Mr Horne isn't a music lover. In fact I'd like to know when was the last time he purchased a compact disc?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We all know that unless you shop really hard, most, if not all, compact discs for popular artists such as Savage Garden, Silverchair and Hanson will cost at least $29.95. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11221">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And just the other day I saw some at $31.95.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That's awfully expensive and the cost is making me think twice about which music CD's I now buy, because I simply can't afford to get all the music I want anymore.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She raises a very good point. Many consumers would say that the price of a top 40 CD, let alone an old classic, is far too high. I am not pointing the bone at music retailers&mdash;they are dealing with the market price in a competitive market. But it is a competitive market, nevertheless, where prices on music are being made artificially high because of the restriction on parallel importation. Music retailers will have opportunity and choice after this bill is passed by allowing choice between local and overseas suppliers of compact discs and tapes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Put simply, for far too long retailers have been forced to deal only with record companies&mdash;foreign owned companies&mdash;in Australia and have missed the benefits of choosing between suppliers on price, reliability, availability and service. The prohibition that currently exists means that Australian distributors have a legal monopoly on the provision of any given title. Well, no more. Competition will mean a better deal for all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been interesting during the debate on this issue to note the tone of calls to radio station Triple J supporting the lowering of prices of CDs in this country. I would like to make the House aware of an interview by Rachel Kerr on Triple J with Melbourne based music lawyer Phil Dwyer on 9 October 1997. It is the same Phil Dwyer who prepared the ACTU submission in 1989 in support of parallel imports. Rachel Kerr put to Mr Dwyer the question about the prices of CDs in Australia and the long&hyphen;term viability of the music industry if parallel imports were allowed. Mr Dwyer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that the consumer is entitled to a fair price, not an unreasonable price, there should be something in there for the record company, the artist, the retailer etc. But it should be a fair price, not an artificially inflated price which is the case now.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As I said before, the only thing that the Labor Party and the music industry are interested in is ripping the hard&hyphen;earned money out of the pockets of young Australians and colluding to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> put the money into the pockets of foreign owned multinationals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of the talk by the record companies in supporting our local artists is a load of codswallop. They state that the allowance of parallel importation will destroy local artists and introduce pirate copies. Again, I would like to quote Mr Dwyer, an industry lawyer who has represented many artists in the industry, from that same interview on Triple J:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You got to actually remember we're talking about product that is legal, that can be purchased overseas. By definition it has to be released overseas, so 95% of the product we're talking about is product by a foreign artist, not Australian artist.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are very few Australian artists that have product released overseas. The great bulk of Australian artists are on the dole, they're going out there funding their own albums, trying to get them released, independently released, they're getting no support from record companies and they are certainly not getting them released overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we should differentiate between the local Australian artist, which makes up the bulk of the artistic community in the music community, and a few artists who are signed, the signed artists . . . are effectively part of the record company bureaucracy . . . They're funded by the bureaucracy, they are part of it. They are quite different from an unsigned act who is trying to get a gig, who is trying to record their own little demo, trying to do their own little record. Now I've always said that, for the bulk of the artists in Australian, a lower price, or a fair price which is essentially a lower price, will assist them both in relation to access to product and generate live gigs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And wait for it. It gets much better. And this is the part I like because I think it shows the absolute hypocrisy by which Labor has been sucked in by these foreign owned multinationals. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must admit over the years I've vomited every time I've heard a record company get up and say that we should be able to maintain the price of records artificially so that we can continue to subsidise the Australian Artists. That is an insult. They've never subsidised one artist I've ever acted for, they commercially exploit artists . . . they do not subsidise artists.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They are Mr Dwyer's words, not mine. But they are true nonetheless. The talk of taxation reduction to benefit the consumer is not valid. In September 1985 the sales tax was reduced from 32&half; per cent to 20 per cent, which 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11222"> resulted in only one of the multinational record companies reducing their CD prices. Then, quite simply, CDs continued on a trend  of increased prices. In fact, in the 12 months following the tax cut prices increased substantially, so the line peddled by the Labor Party that tax should be cut to support the industry is just not a valid, thought&hyphen;through argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another absurd claim is ARIA's claim that 55,000 jobs would be lost. But the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Australian Music Retailers Association have conducted surveys which put the figure at 3,900 people employed full time in the music industry. The claims by the Labor Party and the music industry that this bill will promote piracy are absolutely absurd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this bill the government is introducing greater protection against piracy. The Copyright Act will be amended to substantially increase the penalties for the manufacture, sale or importation of copyright infringing sound recordings and other intellectual property products. Changes include fines of up to $55,000 and/or imprisonment of up to five years for individuals. For corporations, fines will be up to $275,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is backed up by a change to the onus of proof in civil actions. This will now make it easier for record companies to pursue pirates in the Australian courts. The importers will have to prove the legitimacy of the recording that they are marketing. This step should not be underestimated by the industry or the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the Australian Music Retailers Association has stated that it will not stock pirated sound recordings. Piracy tends to be a problem in countries where there is a lack of legislation to protect intellectual property and where sales are through large informal retail sectors, such as street and market stalls. This bill will restrict CD imports from countries with no copyright protection for sound recordings to CDs made with the consent of the producer of the original sound recording or with the consent of another person who is the copyright owner in the country where the original recording was made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The amendments to the Copyright Act 1968 to allow parallel imports will not dimin 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ish in any way the strongest intellectual property protection regimes in the world. Australia is a signatory to the Rome convention and complies with World Intellectual Property Organisation obligations. Put simply, these amendments will only allow for the importation and distribution in Australia of legitimate recordings which have been produced by record companies in and for other markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Finally, in seeking support for this bill&mdash;and I mean true support&mdash;we need to look no further than to Senator Chris Schacht who said in the Senate on 20 August 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While in the Copyright Amendment Bill we are dealing with books, the Government has before it the whole question of copyright as it concerns importations in the areas of records, compact discs and tapes. In my view, the book publishing industry has been much more flexible and realistic about accepting these changes than the Australian Record Industry Association, which has been conducting what I can only call a wicked campaign of misinformation about what would happen if changes to parallel imports were allowed in the record industry, which in my view has been putting forward some demonstrably false claims.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They are not my words&mdash;they are Senator Schacht's. We on this side may not agree all that often with the Labor Party but, on this one, we fully support Senator Schacht's statements. I must admit the part I like best is where Senator Schacht says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"> . . . the Australian Record Industry Association, which has been conducting what I can only call a wicked campaign of misinformation about what would happen if changes to parallel imports were allowed in the record industry, which in my view has been putting forward some demonstrably false claims&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the very same false claims which are now being peddled by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and others on the opposite side. It was okay to support parallel imports when you were in government, but now you are in opposition you would restrict the spending power of our lovers of music to the highly inflated prices of CDs. I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Small retailers cannot deal direct with record companies in the USA, we have to deal with a middle man and smaller shipments mean higher freight charges.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am sure the member for Paterson being the importer that he is would have some understanding of that. Mr Vanagtmaal went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The small retailer is going to be significantly disadvantaged by the changes.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The small retailers, in my view, are the ones who know the music industry best.

So much, as the member for Paterson said, for the ALP propping up foreign owned multinationals.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11224">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His government tries to tell us that they are going to help small business in Australia. They tell us that they are a small business government. This legislation is certainly not helping small business. There is not much in it to support competition for the benefit of all, as contended by the member for Paterson. Indeed, Australian bands, as I know well, are far and away the most important players in the Australian music industry. Senator Alston, unlike me, has not consulted with them either. The member for Paterson said that the ALP has not bothered to talk to young people. I have spoken to not only local small record and CD retailers but also members of the young, upcoming Australian band Faide on this issue. This is what members of Faide told me:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our group has worked hard to raise money to put out a CD, which is getting airplay on Triple J, Triple R and PBS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be great if we could get a big recording contract, but the changes may lead to the big record companies closing down their Australian offices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's much easier to get the attention of Sony Melbourne than Sony New York.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Clearly that is the case. David Gagliardi, who is Faide's lead singer, has recently completed his Victorian certificate of education. He has been offered what he would term his dream job: the chance to work full time in the industry that he knows and loves, which is the great Australian music industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation, if passed, may mean that David, like many of his kind, might not have a job in this great music industry. That is simply not fair. That is what the people who know the Australian music industry are telling me. A long-time colleague of mine is Jeff Burstin. He is one of Australia's foremost rock guitarists. Jeff played with the Falcons for many years and for the Black Sorrows throughout the duration of the Sorrows' existence. He is saying the same things to me. I see Jeff regularly, and he is disgusted at this proposed legislation for the reasons that I am outlining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it goes ahead, new Australian bands will really struggle to get a start in the Australian music industry. Jeff knows how hard it was for him to get a start. He feels that it will be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> even harder now than it was for him in the early 1970s. If they get past the hurdle of being able to get that all-important first start, there will be an ongoing battle to make the money. Triple R, Melbourne's much loved and much listened to independent radio station, has given me an example of just what this legislation will do to the future CD sales of Australian bands. I am interested in protecting the interests of Australian bands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, a group called You Am I, which is a popular Australian alternative band, may decide to break into the American market. Let us say that its members get 10,000 CDs made up but that things do not go as they wish. The sales of these CDs decline somewhat and they do not sell all the CDs. Those CDs may be left sitting on some warehouse shelf in the US and soon considered a deleted line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under current legislation, those CDs cannot be dumped on the Australian market. However, if Senator Alston's legislation comes to pass, those excess CDs could be imported into Australia for perhaps $2 per CD and then sold here with no royalties going to the artists. That means that, although an Australian band is having its CD sold in Australia, it would get no royalties. That is not fair to the band and it makes it harder for the band to get a start. It is certainly not an incentive for young Australians to work hard to secure a future in the Australian music industry.</PARA>

Triple J is a voice for a range of Australians on many issues. Triple J has spoken out against this proposed legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, Senator Alston has not listened to the music industry. It is the same industry that he claims he is in some way 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11225"> trying to assist. I was not surprised to discover that Mr Phil Tripp, who was the government's music industry export adviser, recently resigned. Mr Tripp, an earlier supporter of the senator's changes, realised that these proposed changes were wrong and unfair. The only way he thought Senator Alston would listen to him was to protest through resigning. However, his resignation fell on deaf ears. In the same way that Senator Alston does not want to listen to Tripp and young Australians, he certainly does not want to listen to Australian music, especially from up&hyphen;and&hyphen;coming bands. We know that if the senator were listening, he would not proceed with these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government have gone into this issue thinking that by making the proposed changes, as contended by the member for Paterson, CD prices will fall significantly. I am glad that he raised that issue. Perhaps they thought this would buy them much needed votes. Perhaps the member for Paterson thought it would buy him the 100 or so votes by which he clings to the seat of Paterson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fall in CD prices argument has been lost by Senator Alston. His initial claims that CDs would drop in value to $7 has been proven wrong. Even Senator Alston admits that the real fall in CD prices could be as low as $1.60. I think it is time for Senator Alston to undertake a major rethink of this legislation and to consult with the music industry, as he claims he has done but clearly has not. It would be a sad day if the thriving, up&hyphen;and&hyphen;coming, export driven, innovative, contemporary Australian music scene were destroyed. Australia has great bands. As I have said, Australians like them and I like them, and many will go on to become successful overseas.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In symphony with the Labor Party, the multinational sound recording industry has abandoned these recommendations by attempting to deceive the Australian public with six acutely flawed arguments. For the purposes of tonight's debate, it is necessary that each argument is discussed and appropriately discharged. The most superficial argument is that, in an unprecedented altruistic gesture by the industry, the superfluous profits that they derive from the prohibition on parallel importing are distributed towards the support and promotion of new talent&mdash;the altruistic argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The implausibility of this reasoning is no better illustrated than the circumstances surrounding the international rise to prominence of Brisbane band Savage Garden. Savage Garden, with a record number of ARIA awards is arguably the most popular talent in Australia today. Where were the altruistic multinationals when the members of Savage Garden were struggling to find a record label that was prepared to sign them on?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For people in the music industry, the music industry's silence was deafening&mdash;unlike the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11227"> silence of my colleagues tonight in this debate! Savage Garden were actually signed by Mr John Woodroofe, a local independent manager who mortgaged his own home to pay for the production of the award winning album. Now that Savage Garden have confirmed their marketability, it is not unexpected that the multinationals will be waving a fist full of dollars in front of them for their prized signatures on a contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry have recently been quite vocal in their promises to spend more money on local talent. They are hauntingly similar to their promises on 20 April 1995 when they struck a deal with the former Labor government, promising to invest a total of $270 million on local artists and repertoire over three years. It is a promise which they have to date avoided and they were bought off. The Labor government was bought off in 1995 with a promise that was not even kept by the multinationals when they had a chance to slither out of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The multinationals' commitment to profit is understandable. They have a duty to their shareholders to maximise company profits. In 1990 the Prices Surveillance Authority estimated the profitability of four of the big six record companies at an extraordinary 55.2 per cent return on shareholders' funds.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was 55.2 per cent. So let us not have any more of this nonsense about unbridled benevolence and altruism in the industry. Another dubious argument by the industry is that the United States has threatened action before the World Trade Organisation if Australian copyright laws are amended to allow for the parallel importation of CDs. This allegation is straight out of the Labor Party's dirty tricks handbook. They have taken a reasonably straightforward concept and have manipulated it into something complex and intimidating.</PARA></TALK.START>

Any alteration to the copyright legislation would be within the trade related aspects of intellectual property rights agreement, the TRIPS agreement, of the Uruguay Round and will not be in breach of any World Trade Organisation obligations. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The World Trade Organisation does not require distribution deals to be protected by banning imports&mdash;quite the opposite. There is simply no evidence to suggest that the provisions of a section 301 action would be satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another industry claim without foundation is that the lifting of the prohibition on parallel imports will see our domestic CD market flooded with inferior pirated products, which the member for Isaacs touched on in his paltry contribution to this debate earlier this evening.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not. This argument is based on a false premise. The removal of bans on parallel imports will inevitably result in the competitive pricing of CDs in our market thus denying music pirates the only attractive marketing feature of their product&mdash;cheap CDs. The twofold effect of Australia's geographical isolation and a sophisticated retail and consumer network means that the issue of piracy is not a problem, which is comparable to other domestic markets such as Asia which have poor intellectual property protection administration and jurisdiction and an informal retail sector. Furthermore, it has long been industry practice to carefully scrutinise the operations of music retailers with regard to pirated products. There is no evidence to suggest that this practice will cease, particularly with the amendments proposed by this bill which will restructure the penalty provisions of the act for piracy breaches.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill proposes that the Copyright Act be amended to substantially increase penalties for the unauthorised manufacture, sale, or importation of sound recordings and other intellectual property rights by up to 100 times the present limit. Individuals will risk fines of up to $55,000 and imprisonment of up to five years. Corporations will be subject to fines of up to $270,000. At present, section 133 of the Copyright Act provides that the first conviction for a natural person is only $500 and $2,500 for a corporation. We are massively increasing the fines, the penalties, for breaches of these parts of the Copyright Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Significantly, the passing of this bill will also shift the onus of proof on to the alleged 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11228"> importer of pirated products to establish to the court, on the balance of probability, that the confiscated sound recordings are legitimate products and not pirated. Furthermore, the membership of the Australian Music Retailers Association, AMRA, which has been bandied about tonight, have indicated that they would not knowingly stock pirated sound recordings and would cooperate with the industry in marginalising any impact of imported pirated products. Piracy is and always will be illegal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry vehemently maintains that the `real' retail price difference for CDs between Australia and the US is $1.32. Alternatively, and perhaps more authoritatively, an independent assessment by the ACCC estimates that the differential is approximately $A6.36 once the relevant adjustments are made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the benefit of my Labor colleagues I will explain the taxation implications in complete detail, because this is a very important aspect of the argument over the cost of CDs. The retail price on any given CD varies marginally from retail market to retail market in the United States due to the imposition of a variety of different taxes, such as state tax and city tax. For the sake of this illustration, let us consider New York city. A new release CD in the United States is generally quoted at a price of $US12.99 net of retail sales tax. A purchaser in New York city would pay $US14.06 because the retailer adds on a retail sales tax of 8.25 per cent, which consists of a four per cent state tax and a city tax of 4.25 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The taxation of CDs in Australia is considerably more complex. The sales tax rate on CDs in Australia appears at first glance to be 22 per cent, which is ostensibly a larger figure than the 8.25 per cent applicable in New York city. However&mdash;and this is very important&mdash;the tax is applied at a wholesale level, that is, on only a portion of the retail price. Indeed, the 22 per cent quoted as the sales tax rate on CDs is not entirely accurate. At present, approximately $3 of the non-discounted wholesale price is not subject to tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More specifically, the Australian Taxation Office has allowed the industry to exempt the cost of the booklet inserted into the CD case 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and certain components of the packaging in taxation liability calculations. This has the effect of reducing the effective taxation rate on a single CD to 18.3 per cent and not 22 per cent as it appears. Another calculation conveniently omitted by the industry is a sales tax exemption they are afforded by the Australian Taxation Office on distribution fees. This has the effect of further reducing the effective taxation rate to the equivalent of 18 per cent of the retailer's buy&hyphen;in price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To convert the Australian wholesale sales tax so that it is comparable to the United States sales tax we will assume a retail margin of 27.5 per cent. Therefore, for each $1 of wholesale price, sales tax adds 18c. As $1.18 is 72.5 per cent of the final price of $1.63, the notional price before a retail sales tax is $1.45. Sales tax of 18c expressed as a percentage of $1.45 gives a retail sales tax equivalent of 12.43 per cent. Therefore, the Australian rate of taxation on CDs is 50.7 per cent higher than the 8.25 per cent applicable in New York city. Adding this figure of 12.43 per cent sales tax to $US12.99 produces a figure of $US14.61. Using today's exchange rate of 0.6928, the price of this CD is $A21.09.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate of Sturt, a typical top 40 CD retails at between $24.95 and $29.95 and averages out to be $27.45. This is, in real terms, $6.36 more than the New York price. For the record, the average exchange rate for the last financial quarter was 0.7193 which would make the average cost of the CD $A20.31 which is equivalent to $A7.14 more than the price in New York City. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you could follow that, you are a better man than I am. In any case, when the Australian government reduced sales tax on sound recordings from 32&half; per cent to 20 per cent in September 1985, there was only a minimal benefit to consumers with only one of the six major record companies reducing CD prices. To add insult to injury for the Australian consumer, retail prices for CDs substantially increased over the following 12 months. Clearly, the taxation system has little or no influence on the retail prices of CDs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most recent argument put forward by the industry has been without doubt the most 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11229"> disgraceful. Solving the unemployment problem which this country inherited from the former Labor government is an acknowledged priority of this government. Recent decisions involving the motor vehicle and TCF industries are testimony to this government's conviction to weigh sensible employment policy with the competing needs of consumer protection. Shameless claims by the industry and the Labor Party that 55,000 jobs will be at risk as a result of the government's competitive reforms are unconditionally erroneous. Record companies provide 1,300 important jobs in this country. Of these, fewer than 500 people are employed in the actual manufacturing of CDs. Figures supplied by the Australian Music Retailers Association and the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicate that there are the full time equivalent of 3,980 jobs in the CD retail sector. The figure of 55,000 is fictitious as is the fanciful assumption that a 10 per cent reduction in the retail price will close down an entire industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the meantime, on the eve of these legislative changes, the CD retail sector continues to expand. The retail chain Chandlers, which specialises in top 40 titles, is flagging the possibility of opening an additional 70 stores over the next 18 months and other discount chains are likely to follow suit. This expansion in the CD retail market endorses previous claims by the chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Professor Allan Fels, that dismantling the prohibition on the parallel importing of CDs will improve domestic employment opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The passing of this bill will open up a new and exciting market for retailers and consumers alike. The archaic provisions of the Copyright Act, which prohibits the parallel importation of CDs, encourages an apathetic and anti-competitive culture in the industry. Consequently, the multinational sound recording industry provides Australian music lovers with only 20 per cent of their international music catalogue, an issue which the industry has deliberately neglected to address. With access to a music catalogue five times greater than at present, Australian small businesses will be able to foster and develop highly lucrative niche markets. Music stores will 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> now be able to specialise in music such as jazz, classical, heavy metal, European dance club music and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a wonderfully multicultural electorate which includes a lot of patriotic Australians of Italian descent who enjoy many varieties of music, including from Italy. At present they have little or no access to this genre of music because the multinationals will not catalogue any music in Australia which is not highly marketable. Because they monopolise the market, there is no incentive to be competitive. Under the proposed changes to the Copyright Act, music stores will have the capacity to import their specific stock requirements direct. The development of a niche market will be good news for music lovers in my electorate and fantastic news for CD retail small businesses who are clearly concerned by the impact of the Internet on their commercial interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no clearer illustration of the effect of the Internet on the CD market than contemporary Norway. Norway's ill-fated experiment in allowing the parallel importation of CDs in the early 1990s is often cited by the multinational sound recording industry and the Labor Party as evidence that the present monopoly arrangement in Australia should continue. Indeed, in announcing the Labor Party's response to federal cabinet's decision to dismantle the prohibition on parallel importing of CDs on 16 October this year, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) again specifically made reference to Norway. However, with Norway and New Zealand now set to dismantle their respective prohibitions on the parallel importing of CDs, it is perhaps appropriate to consider the real significance of this development with reference to the bill presently before the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real significance in Norway's anticipated return to a parallel importing policy is the tacit acknowledgment of the impact that shopping on the Internet has had on small business. Cyber shopping is more than a mere novelty. Australian music lovers purchasing on the Internet have access to five times the music catalogue than local retailers, as I indicated earlier in my speech. The CDs are cheaper and are delivered straight to your 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11230"> front door. It is little wonder that Australian music retailers are already feeling the pinch. It also comes as no surprise that the sound recording industry delicately avoids discussing the impact of Internet sales on the CD retail market. It matters little to the industry whether CDs are purchased from Australian small businesses or from overseas suppliers via the Internet. They ultimately end up with the revenue sooner or later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How popular is purchasing CDs on the Internet? Recent estimates indicate that CD sales on the Internet to date have been worth over $120 million. Compounding the damage to small business from cyber shopping is the fact that the government is losing valuable taxation revenue. Contrary to recent industry misinformation, the sound recording industry and composers will continue to earn income derived from royalties for their work. The dismantling of parallel imports will not in any way affect this arrangement. The  Copyright Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997  does not deny artists this fundamental right. Indeed, on current figures, 9.3606 per cent of the wholesale cost of a CD is made up of royalty payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice the shadow minister for this area, the honourable member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), coming into the House in the dying moments of my speech to try to regain some face considering the appalling and disgraceful level of the debate from the member for Isaacs and his own speech when he was in the House earlier. In discussing the impact of these reforms on the industry, it is appropriate to consider the practices of Shock Records, Australia's biggest independent record company. Shock Records undercuts the multinationals and provides lower priced recording for its releases, whether they  be local or international.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Copyright Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 , which is before this House, has two key objectives. They are recognising and supporting the rights of consumers to purchase the widest range of music at the lowest possible cost, while, at the same time, reinforcing the importance of protecting intellectual property and copyright for people in the industry&mdash;the performers, the creative people&mdash;to minimise illegal or pirate use of a musician's original work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through amending the Copyright Act, the government intends to allow parallel importation of legitimate copies of sound recordings. I pay tribute to the member for Sturt for being so persistent in his support for this reform. I will quote something previously said in this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most significant of the reforms the Government has decided to make following its consideration of the report is to permit the unrestricted commercial importation of non&hyphen;pirate copies of foreign records appearing in the market . . .  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11231">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This admirable sentiment was not expressed by a member of the present coalition government, but by Peter Duncan, the parliamentary secretary to the then Labor government's Attorney&hyphen;General, on 16 December 1992 in a speech on their copyright amendment bill, which was laid on the table of this House before the 1993 election and has never been heard of again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I deal substantially with the bill, I would like to demolish a few of Labor's current arguments. Labor is referring with pious tones to the public campaign of misinformation being run by the Australian Record Industry Association. This has even extended to me receiving letters in my electorate office from constituents and record retailers with a note on the top saying, `Bruce, I have been told to send this to you by the record company. I am not quite sure why.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ARIA's form and the mischief of the ALP has been exposed by one of its own. Senator Schacht stated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on 20 August 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Australian Record Industry Association, which has been conducting what I can only call a wicked campaign of misinformation about what would happen if changes to parallel imports were allowed in the record industry, which in my view has been putting forward some demonstrably false claims.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The form of ARIA's contribution to this debate and the parroting of the Labor members opposite have already been recognised as being pure mischief by one of its own. Labor also says that local bands and artists who have been mouthing the sentiments of ARIA are really expressing their own strongly held views. To my mind the artists are just doing what their employers tell them to. They are fearful of recrimination if they decline to speak&mdash;that is, fearful for their valuable contracts&mdash;or hopeful for more favourable treatment as a result of their utterances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That brings me to the contribution of the Labor member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) in this place earlier. Mr Wilton has been reinforcing his reputation as a no ideas man and the seagull of politics in the area that I represent. He occasionally visits Frankston, flies in, leaves a deposit and flies off again making heaps of noise on the way through&mdash;nothing 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> positive, no responsibility in the information he is providing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is that `whatever it takes' attitude that so epitomised the former Labor government. He has picked up that very well and is practising it to the full degree in the Frankston community, when it suits him. He is never to be found when other issues are on. He never says a positive thing. He just wanders in, drops a few of his well chosen sentiments, stirs up a bit of trouble and off he trots. I am not sure whether that is the representation people are hoping for from Mr Wilton, but he is turning it into an art form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw the attention of members back to Senator Schacht's quote to give them some idea of the mischief that this government has been dealing with. Isaacs constituents are turning to me for help probably because I at least provide them with reliable information, good service and am willing to help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a press article Mr Wilton is quoted as making some points with the support of Eric Prentice from Plato's Records. Mr Prentice was good enough to ring me on 17 November, after this material must have gone to the press, to find out what was going on because he could not get any reliable information from Mr Wilton. In this article, Mr Wilton is quoted as spouting about the virtues of Savage Garden's experience as a young Australian band under the restrictive parallel importing regime that the former government seems to want to maintain. As the member for Sturt has pointed out, they could not get a contract here off the big six. They had to get the support of an independent label, Roadshow, and then they went off to the US to get a big contract break.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another band I want to refer to is the Dead Ringer band. I am not sure whether the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) is a dead ringer of his former self in the former government&mdash;there is nothing new about it&mdash;but Dead Ringer is a country and western band. They had to form their own label to get a break in this country and before trotting off to Nashville to get a substantial break. They are two examples of what successful Australian bands have had to do to get a start in the industry.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11232">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would encourage the member for Isaacs to consider two questions that guide me in my work as an elected representative. What is it I am trying to achieve? Who am I trying to please? From my contribution tonight it is quite simple to see that I am trying to achieve cheaper CDs for the good folk of the electorate of Dunkley and those right across the country, copyright protection for those frightfully creative and talented people that produce this work and, at the same time, give an impetus to the retail sector in my electorate which is a very important part of the economy. We would have cheaper CD prices for people who want to purchase them, protection for the artists in recognition of the effort that has gone into their work and an opportunity to generate some more retail activity in my electorate of Dunkley where retailing is one of the primary economic activities. What is the member for Isaacs on about? Why is he distorting facts and trying to mislead local retailers in the electorate of Dunkley? Why is he trying to deny local residents and consumers of CDs the opportunity for cheaper CDs? What have they done?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think I know the answer because this is the same old Labor Party. It is happy to go around playing up and appealing to the select elites that they hope will turn out some votes for them at election time. Is he hoping that Tina Arena will hand out how&hyphen;to&hyphen;vote cards for him at the polling booths in the Isaacs electorate? Is that what this is really about? Is it more important to appeal to those people than to represent the interests of the fair folk of your electorate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know where I would rather be queuing up. That is trying to help the fair folk that I have been elected to represent while, at the same time, recognising and protecting the creative brilliance of the likes of Tina Arena not kowtowing to the record industry, the top end of town, which, as the member for the Sturt has already outlined, make very attractive profits&mdash;profits I am sure union superannuation funds would love to get a piece of the action of. Is that who the member for Isaacs is trying to represent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why parrot the lines of these music multinationals and deny cheaper supply prices to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> retailers and cheaper prices at the end of the day to consumers? I actually spent 40 minutes talking with the person whom the member for Isaacs is relying upon for his evidence. He told me that he started his Plato record business 13 years ago. He talked about the things that were concerning him most, and for the record I will mention a few of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He said his biggest problem was competing with the chain stores. They can already get their stock from America&mdash;some cheaper, some not. That is what he was telling me. The chains are the biggest worry for him because they can cut what are in his view unfair deals for bulk discounts for these major products. That is what was concerning my constituent. When I talked to him about how this measure would actually give him some options to get access to product that might make him competitive with those chains, he was genuinely interested in that. We discussed it for 40 minutes. He can occasionally get a deal from a local supplier, but not half as good as the deal that is available to the major chains. That is what he was telling me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We talked about the government's commitment to fair trading in the small business sector and he was again quite interested in that. I took the opportunity to contrast our commitment to small businesses like his with the Labor Party's lack of interest in his business by not even putting a small business policy before the electorate at the last election. He was very interested in that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He went on to talk about his own industry experience, which I also found very interesting, how he had to establish his own record label to get published. He went on to talk about how his band would have loved to have got an overseas deal but they could not get off the ground without doing it themselves. Again, I reminded him that there is nothing altruistic about the record industry. They are signing deals that they think are commercially viable. That is the business they are in. That is how it was in the past. That is how it is now. I imagine that is how it will be in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I even mentioned to him the government's support for the career development of Australian music artists. He was very interested in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11233"> that. When we were talking about the funds made available through the Australia Council, through the contemporary music development fund and also through the emerging artists fund, he was very interested in that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We went on to talk a little bit more about how he cannot compete with some of the bigger chain stores because of the great bulk discounts they get and how they focus almost entirely on the top 40. Then he was telling me that that was not his main market. He goes for specialist material with a very dedicated group of customers where service is the key. I said to him, `This is terrific. This is a package that is designed to help you. If those majors at the end of the day decide to give you what product you want, even though they might not have it in stock but can get around to supplying it eventually, you just have to wait at present. With the changes, you can say to your customers that they don't have to wait and you can get the stuff in.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the interesting thing was he made it clear to me that within the industry you can actually get around the current parallel importing controls. Apparently that is quite common practice, and the majors do not mind. As long as you are carrying their big ticket items, their big sellers, their big turnover products, they just turn the other way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He went on to talk to me about the taxation issues. He said how supportive he was of tax reform. He had some ideas about a VAT and the like, but he was very supportive of that. Again, I contrasted the government's position with that of the member for Isaacs and the Labor Party who are not interested in tax reform. They have just announced a program to increase taxes to fund their unbelievable expenditures, to put this country further into debt and to pass that debt onto the young people who we think will benefit from this package. So I am not quite sure what happened there, whether the member for Isaacs went in there and in true Labor Party style jawboned this person to get involved. At least I am comfortable now that he does have the full story.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor says that the local bands and artists who have been mouthing these sentiments are the ones who will be disadvantaged through 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this, and I have just shown you how they have had so little support under the current arrangements and how the government actually has in place a program to do something about it. The coalition government has had a longstanding commitment to lowering the prices of CDs, tapes and records available to consumers and invited the industry to come up with ways of delivering on that objective if parallel importing protection was so precious to them, yet there has been no movement, no progress. I think the idea was they liked the profits they were getting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995, the then shadow minister and now Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) criticised Labor's reversal of its 1992 amendments and suggested that a coalition government would implement the 1992 recommendations of the Prices Surveillance Authority. That is what it is doing. The government has a commitment from the 1996 election to lower the price of sound recordings, and I again acknowledge and commend the work of the member for Sturt in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The then PSA, which has now been subsumed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, found that the only function of parallel importing protection was to protect the rights of the manufacturers and suppliers carrying products to the detriment of retailers. In other words, a Frankston music shop could not legally import a British version of the Spice Girls recording unless the manufacturer who controlled the distribution domestically sanctioned the move. The result has been that competition in the Australian marketplace from overseas suppliers has been prevented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, international price discrimination has occurred in a way that has been very harmful to the interests of the constituents I represent in the electorate of Dunkley. To date, the only way out for the people in my electorate who like recorded music but resent paying $31 for a current recording has been for them to import through the Internet. A quick browse of the Internet came up with one US based company whose prices are probably typical. CD Universe offers the current Hanson record <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Snowed In</EMPHASIS> for a list 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11234"> price of $US15.51, about $20 here at the current exchange rates. Shipping costs by airmail are around $7.50 for one CD and $1.75 for each extra CD. It does not take much to work out that consumers placing this type of conservative credit card order over the Net are already ahead after buying two CDs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will go further because with that same supplier, as I have mentioned earlier, you can pay the list price and get two CDs and have enough change for a McDonald's meal deal. If you buy six CDs, you get a free one effectively. This is a move that is supported in a market of discretionary expenditure goods with high price, sensitive demand elasticity. So you are likely to see more purchases with the prices down. That is a better deal than we get in the cafe in our building where you pay for eight cappuccinos and get one free. Buying through the Internet, you can actually buy six CDs and effectively get one free compared to local retail prices. It goes further. If your tastes are more towards Elvis Costello, the Cure, Lisa Loeb, Richard Marx and Metallica, you can actually buy through this Internet shop front at a cheaper rate.</PARA>

In fact, in the last few months, retail sales in Victoria have started to really take off across all sectors, and I mentioned earlier how important that is to the electorate of Dunkley, because retailing is one of the lifebloods of employment opportunities in the area I represent. So the drop in sales for CDs tells us that CDs are regarded by consumers as overpriced and the consumers are shopping with their feet&mdash;they are surfing the net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just a handful of major companies&mdash;all foreign owned&mdash;dominate music sales in Australia. Companies like Sony, Polygram, EMI, Warners and Mushroom in 1995-96 earned almost $580 million, or almost three&hyphen;quarters of the total industry income, with $41 million in profits resulting. This profit figure is almost certainly understated. Record companies usually require artists to repay some development costs, and therefore they end up with a large slice of royalties paid to overseas subsidiaries. Major record companies are also made up of a number of labels, with the remaining profit typically adding to the bottom line of overseas parent companies such as Polygram in Holland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These earnings are not to the benefit of local artists. Many major record companies typically release as little as 20 per cent of their titles in Australia, making it very difficult for specialist retailers like Plato's Records in the area of Frankston that I represent. When challenged, they claim that between 60 per cent and 90 per cent of these titles are actually available through `Indent' ordering services. This is a slow, costly and unreliable method that results in sales at standard industry prices. So it is a matter of those specialist retailers being told by the majors, `You just wait, we'll get around to sending you that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11235"> product that you want to sell to your customers to keep you in business.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For music retailers, parallel importation will mean easier access to a much wider range of musical titles. This will benefit smaller retailers because consumers will have many choices when it comes to entertaining themselves and could get CDs at a competitive price. Record shops are competing not just with each other or even with Internet based retailers in the US or other countries but with sellers of everything from ice&hyphen;creams to outdoor furniture. It is discretionary expenditure, highly volatile to price movements. This is why lower CD prices, in my view, will generate much higher demand for the product and possibly increase royalties, because of the higher throughput for artists and a choice of suppliers for our local shops.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, major record companies are risk averse when it comes to promoting home&hyphen;grown Australian talent. I mentioned two examples earlier. As part of the April 1995 so-called agreement between the former government and ARIA, the industry undertook to invest $270 million in industry development supporting local talent. To date, not one cent has been spent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And peace comes over the chamber. Foreign owned record industry manufacturers have engaged in a campaign of misinformation, and the Labor Party has walked straight into it. It talks about job losses. I believe this is nonsense. About 2,300 people are employed in record companies and distributors. The vast bulk of people employed in the industry are employed at the retail end, as I mentioned earlier. The opportunity for more sales at cheaper prices of this highly elastic product promotes the chances of higher employment at the retail end, and that is what I am concerned about. I am concerned about getting jobs growth in the retail sector in the electorate of Dunkley and ensuring that young people or anybody who wants to buy a CD&mdash;even old blokes like me at 31&mdash;can buy it at a price that is competitive with what is paid elsewhere.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The previous speaker, the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Billson), began his speech by making a few charitable and worthy remarks about Michael Hutchence. Could I, in similar tones, also express my appreciation&mdash;and I am sure that of many of my constituents&mdash;at the tremendous enjoyment which he gave over the years. It is a tragic loss to the Australian music industry that he has died.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the first occasion I saw INXS was at the famous Doyalson RSL Club that my colleagues have heard me mention one or two times before. He was also one of the Australian artists who got very high billing at the very large Narara concert on the New South Wales Central Coast in about 1983. While I have not attended too many rock concerts lately, I was fortunate that, on the occasions when I was regularly attending live Australian 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11236"> concerts, as well as INXS there were bands like Midnight Oil, Cold Chisel, the Sports and Mental As Anything&mdash;great, vibrant Australian rock bands that were coming through in the early 1980s and providing a tremendous amount of enjoyment for young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian rock music industry is very concerned about this debate because the industry is going through a very difficult period at the moment. It is quite interesting to speculate as to what the future of the industry will be if this government's legislation is successful, given the other pressures that are already making it very difficult for young and emerging Australian artists to develop a successful career.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the greatest difficulties is that there is no longer that pub rock circuit that existed in the early eighties. I do not know if that is the result of the various state licensing laws or the various pieces of legislation that enforced the fire regulations. For whatever reason, for good or ill, it is now very difficult for bands to make a living by touring capital cities and regional provincial areas. For that reason, young Australians are finding it more difficult to develop a full&hyphen;time successful career.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another factor is the programming policies of many of our commercial radio stations. The hits and memories formats continue to make it very difficult for new and emerging Australian artists to have their material played. Therefore, it makes it very difficult for young Australians to listen to a lot of the new music.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even some of the older artists find it very difficult to get their latest CD releases played at all on Australian radio stations. I think that is a real tragedy. It is great to keep on flogging to death the hits and memories of the seventies and eighties but, if we are not careful, this generation of young Australians will not have the hits and memories that they are entitled to from their youth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the few bright spots on the Australian broadcasting horizon is radio station Triple J. One of the greatest achievements of the last government, particularly in the Keating years, was the extension of Triple J to many regional areas around Australia. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Pretty well any town that has 20,000 or more residents now receives Triple J. That has allowed a conversation to develop between young people in the bush and young people in the cities&mdash;and the older people who also listen to Triple J, such as the member for Dunkley. It means that we are able to have music unearthed by Triple J in regional and provincial areas, played on Triple J and receiving a national audience. In a number of cases, Triple J has been able to provide a tremendous amount of support and encouragement for young artists who live in regional and provincial areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite all of those difficulties, there are still some bands and some artists who, through sheer persistence and dedication, are able to develop successful careers. It is probably even harder to achieve that today than it was 10 years ago. We have to do all we can to nurture those dedicated young Australians who are seeking to make this their career.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the detail of the legislation. People such as the member for Dunkley need to hear a bit of history. We hope the honourable member gets to serve out his first term, but it is unlikely he will have much hope of serving a second term in this place if tonight's contribution is anything to go by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Dunkley probably forgets that this whole debate started when a man who then was not that well known, Professor Allan Fels, headed up the Prices Surveillance Authority. Certainly, he was less well known then than he is today&mdash;he certainly had a much lower media profile. Professor Fels carried out a public inquiry into the prices, not of CDs, but of audio cassettes. I think it could also have been of vinyl LPs, which perhaps gives us some indication as to how long this debate has been carried out at the national level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that time, Professor Fels believed that the prices of audio cassettes were too high, and that we therefore should allow parallel importing. It is interesting to note that at that time, when CDs had only recently been introduced, every CD that was purchased by Australians in those days was sold at the recommended maximum retail sale price.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11237">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not the case today, Madam Deputy Speaker. I know that you are a lover of fine music. I know that on many occasions you would visit the local record stores in your electorate, not only looking for the best music but also checking the prices to make sure your constituents are benefiting from the competition that exists in the Australian record industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These days, especially with the back catalogue, it is quite common for Australian consumers to receive quite substantial discounts on the prices that are paid. With a large number of the record retailers, it is also possible to get substantial discounts on the top 40 or the top 20. That is something that exists today that did not exist when this whole debate started. Certainly, the level of discounting that takes place in the Australian market is much greater and more vibrant than was the case when the debate started.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing the honourable member for Dunkley demonstrated in his contribution was that he completely misunderstood what the former government's decision was in 1992. He kept saying that this piece of legislation implements what the former government said it would do in 1992. That is what you said in your contribution tonight.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1992, for the benefit of the member for Dunkley, our plan in our legislation was not to provide for open slather parallel importing. What we did first of all was to say that there would be no parallel importing for Australian material. Australian artists were completely protected. The second thing we said was that, because of our concerns about piracy, there would be parallel importing only for overseas artists from five countries that had the toughest possible anti&hyphen;piracy regimes. In 1992 that is what we said we would do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people might say, `Why did the government subsequently revisit that decision?' There is a very clear answer to that. Because of the TRIPS agreement as part of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, it became illegal for Australia to provide a regime that exempted Australian artists while allowing parallel importing for overseas artists. According to the trade treaties, that would have provided the Australian artists with an unfair advantage over the overseas artists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very clear that, firstly, the regime that was proposed in 1992 is completely different from the open slather importing of overseas manufactured CDs which this government is providing for. Secondly, no&hyphen;one could have proceeded with the proposal that the former 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11238"> Labor government advocated in 1992. We could not exempt the Australian artists while providing for parallel importing for the overseas artists. That was the problem with our package in 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the time that I had the privilege of serving as the Minister for Communications and the Arts, we questioned some of the analysis that was done by Professor Fels, the PSA and the ACCC. When we did a comparison in 1995 based on wholesale prices rather than the bogus retail price comparisons that do not allow for all sorts of tax differences, we found that the price gap was about 59c at the wholesale level when you adjusted for the fact that there were different royalty regimes in Australia and the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have noticed that, at the moment, government members are still claiming there is a substantial price difference and, therefore, if we have parallel importing, there will be a major reduction in the price of CDs. But it is very interesting to note that the government refuses to release the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics report which it uses to justify its claims. We have Senator Alston talking about price reductions of between $1.50 and $3. We have the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) talking about price reductions of $7 a CD by Christmas, which is a complete misleading of the Australian people. We know very well that, if you do the comparisons today, with the Australian dollar at 68c, the price difference is quite minor. With the Australian exchange rate where it is, the claims of government members in this chamber that there is a substantial price gap today is a deliberate attempt to mislead this House. At least Senator Alston tries to say that it is only $1.50 to $3. When the Prime Minister says that it is $7, that is misleading the Australian public. It is quite wrong and immoral for the Prime Minister to mislead young Australians in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason we say that it is wrong to take this risk for such a small benefit in price reduction is that it is now becoming so easy to produce pirate copies of CDs. The reason it has become so easy is that, as a result of the digital revolution, it is very easy now to produce perfect copies of material. It can be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a perfect copy of a CD of a new album released by INXS. It can be a perfect copy of a new digital video disc&mdash;the next consumer item that is about to hit us. It can be a perfect digital copy of a DVD of a feature length movie. You can produce perfect digital copies of computer software that might be on a CD&hyphen;ROM. You can produce perfect digital copies of anything that can be digitised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the great change that has taken place since Professor Allan Fels started this whole debate when he was looking at whether or not we should be importing audio cassettes. It is now 100 times easier to produce pirate copies of material that can be passed off as the genuine article. Because it is now so easy to produce these perfect copies, in every other country in the world they are tightening their intellectual property regimes. In every other country in the world they are trying to ensure that the creators of music, movies, computer software or any other intellectual property receive the reward to which they are entitled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If an Australian songwriter gives us enjoyment because they write a great song, they are entitled to some reward for the joy that they give us. If an Australian band records that song by the Australian songwriter, the Australian band deserves a reward as well as the Australian songwriter, the manufacturer, who hopefully is employing people at places like Sony's manufacturing plant at Blacktown, and the retailer. Each of those Australian entrepreneurs and creators deserves a reward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this government gets its way and allows open slather importation of overseas made CDs, then what we will see is that the basis of reward for those Australian creators will be undermined and the basis of the employment of the Australians who work in the Australian manufacturing plants will be undermined. K&hyphen;Mart, Coles Myer and Woolworths might be happy in that they are able to increase the number of CDs they sell through their megastores, but the local corner record store will be devastated by this decision. That is why the Australian Record Retailers Association is fighting so hard against this government's moves. That is why the corner record store understands what is at threat here. If this government allows K&hyphen;Mart, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11239"> Woolworths and Coles to get a stranglehold on the Australian retail record industry, the volume might be up at the big department stores, but we will see the annihilation of all those small businesses that have been built up over many years. That is why they are fighting so hard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The punch line we often get from members of the government is that this is all about trying to inject competition and that those who are against this move are doing the bidding of the multinational record companies. The argument I always find most persuasive is that, if this were the case, why is it that it is the small independent record companies who are arguing most strongly for the retention of the ban on parallel importation? Why is it that it is the small record companies who know that they will be hardest hit by pirate imports and that they are the ones who are fighting hardest against the turmoil that will result with open slather importing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was the minister, people like Warren Fahey, who then worked for the independent small record company Larrikin Records, and Mushroom Records persuaded me against parallel imports. Shock Records have been playing a very positive role in this debate. David Williams, the Joint Managing Director of Shock Records, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not believe the government would be able to stop the flow of pirated and dumped product into Australia. The majors may be able to put resources into the near impossible task of identifying such product but independent operators such as such Shock will have no hope of doing so whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is the small companies like Shock that will be hardest hit by this government's decision to allow parallel importing. If it were all about multinationals protecting their returns, then why is it that every independent record company right around Australia is fighting as hard as it can to stop the government proceeding with these measures?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the start, this is all about how much encouragement and support we give the Australian recording industry. They are going through tough times at the moment. It is very hard for those new and emerging artists to get a contract and to get their material played, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> especially on commercial radio. It is very difficult even through live venues to develop a following in the Australian market. We do not want to see this government's legislation passed, which will make it even more difficult for those young Australians to develop a full-time career, a full&hyphen;time career that we know has many obstacles and difficulties placed in front of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For these reasons, we are very confident that, when Australians realise that the government cannot guarantee any price reduction&mdash;as Senator Alston has admitted&mdash;let alone the bogus $7 that the Prime Minister has promised, when Australians realise that, by proceeding down the path of open slather imports, they place at risk the very nature of the Australian recording industry and when Australians realise that this is just another example of a Howard government con on young Australians, we will see them campaigning very loud and long for the government to not proceed down this path.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak in support of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R378">Copyright Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997</XREF> , which will amend the Copyright Act 1968 to allow the parallel importing of sound recordings. Parallel importing is a system of allowing legitimate and legal copies of sound recordings, CDs, manufactured anywhere in the world to be imported into Australia without the consent of the copyright holder in Australia, usually the record company. At the moment, any import of CDs or sound recordings other than by the Australian copyright holder or without their express permission is illegal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This means that, if an album has been released by Sony Music in the United States, no-one can import copies of the Sony release into Australia for resale except that copyright owner in this country. That means that we are seeing little of the latest recordings in a short space of time in Australia. If Sony chooses to delay the introduction of a CD perhaps by months or years&mdash;perhaps that recording is never to appear here&mdash;there is little that can be done under our current laws to provide local consumers access to that music through traditional retail outlets. As the member for Dunkley (Mr Billson) reminded us, a lot of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11240"> Australia's music retailers, especially in rural areas, are small business people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of parallel importing will allow retailers and importers to source legally produced copies of sound recordings from Australian and overseas artists in response to market demand, price and availability. It is well documented that prices of CDs and other sound recordings in Australia are very high in comparison to elsewhere, despite what the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) seemed to believe. Obviously, he has not been overseas lately or has not been surfing the Internet. This is particularly the case when you compare us with the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1990 the Prices Surveillance Authority released a report&mdash;and this is some time ago, but it would be echoed today&mdash;which described CD prices in Australia as `unreasonably high'. Comparatively, our prices for CDs are higher than those in Canada, the US, New Zealand and Singapore. No wonder that, when our travellers come back from overseas, their cases are bulging with purchases of CDs that are cheaper or not available back here at home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments to the Copyright Act will have the important effect of offering Australian consumers something which they have been denied for too long&mdash;lower prices for a larger range of CDs. These amendments will implement the government's election commitment to bring down the cost of CDs, a commitment that the previous government shied away from in the face of pressure from large multinational record companies with a stranglehold on the Australian recorded music industry. Let us be honest here, it is the big foreign owned transnational record companies that are masterminding the current push against parallel importing of CDs. Why wouldn't they, when you look at the economic realities of the situation, the profits that are made?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has approximately 153 record companies. Seven of these are foreign owned transnationals&mdash;the names that we all know&mdash;Sony, Polygram, EMI, Warners, BMG, Festival and Mushroom Records. It is estimated that these seven companies control approximately 70 per cent of the global trade in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sound recordings and about 85 per of the trade in Australia. Based on figures from 1995-96, these seven companies earn more than 70 per cent of the total income earned by record companies in Australia and share between them approximately 85 per cent of the profit. On the whole, it is these multinationals who decide what music will be released into Australia, when and at what cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anne Capling, in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Journal of Political Science</EMPHASIS> entitled `The conundrum of intellectual property rights: domestic interests, international commitments and the Australian music industry', stated that the major foreign owned record companies operating in Australia generally release about only 20 per cent of their titles in Australia. Where else in the developed world do you have that sort of restriction on access to music?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An industry scheme called Indent Ordering Services&mdash;and the member for Dunkley (Mr Billson) referred to it&mdash;enables retailers to import music listed on a world catalogue but not released in Australia. But this is a very long, tedious and expensive business. They still have to go through the big record companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is therefore a costly and time&hyphen;consuming exercise for small independent retailers to be able to stock music that is not part of the 20 per cent of usually mainstream titles on offer. Independent retailers have reported that it can take weeks, even months, to get titles through the Indent system. It is no wonder people are choosing an alternative method of getting hold of their music these days&mdash;and that, of course, is cyber&hyphen;marketing, the use of the Internet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the introduction of parallel importing, retailers should be able to get the same CDs they currently have to get through Indent in as little as four days. There are also no savings for consumers under the Indent scheme. Retailers have to pay standard wholesale prices plus freight and administration charges for the music they currently cannot get through the mainstream sources. Under the new system, retailers will be able to shop around for the supplier here or overseas who can offer the best price, range and service.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11241">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever way you look at these reforms they are a win for consumers and a win for music retailers, especially independent retailers. Both of these groups have been calling for lower CD prices and a more flexible system, a freer system, for many years, since well before the 1990 Prices Surveillance Authority report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular these amendments will ensure greater choice for retailers in the type of music they stock. There will be greater choice and flexibility for independent retailers who will now be able to choose to specialise in certain musical styles&mdash;in jazz, heavy metal or world music. They will be able to respond to individual needs and develop niche markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia we have a strong and competitive CD manufacturing sector. Currently, 95 per cent of all CDs sold in Australia are manufactured here. There was some concern that they would be disadvantaged by the introduction of parallel importing. While the industry will certainly now be open to competition, there is reason to expect that Australian manufacturers who can supply high quality goods and offer excellent service and shorter delivery times will be well placed to use the new competitive environment to their advantage and to continue to perform well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until recently, consumers and retailers have in many cases simply put up with the high prices, lack of choice and waiting months for new music. However, with the rapid expansion of the Internet, as I said before, consumers are starting to take the problem into their own hands. They are importing CDs directly from the US. It is not a copyright infringement to import CDs for personal use, and the absence of sales tax and the low cost of packaging and delivery have made this an attractive option for the frustrated consumer. Figures prepared by Treasury show that consumers can at the moment save about $30, including transport costs, on the importation of only four CDs from the United States via the Internet. The member for Dunkley gave us more of those cost discounts that are available through the Internet. Of course, Australia forgoes the wholesale sales tax.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We expect that the decrease in CD prices as a result of the introduction of parallel importing as well as people being able to get immediate access to a wider range of music will help to reverse this trend of Internet buying, a trend which is making it harder for our small music retailers to survive  in Australia. We hope that it will bring consumers back to music retailers&mdash;at least in the immediate short term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, we have not yet reached the capacity of the Internet in relation to the distribution and sale of music. It is possible to purchase songs from the Internet and to download them onto your computer in as little as eight minutes for a three&hyphen; or four&hyphen;minute piece, and this area is likely to continue to grow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said this, there is still room for local artists to independently market themselves and their music through the Internet&mdash;in fact, to use the Internet themselves in order to compete. With technology allowing you to download music directly, there is scope for innovative bands and musicians to take the lead in this field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue of course is that while some consumers have been able to pay lower prices for CDs through the Internet only a small proportion of the Australian public and an even smaller percentage of people in rural, regional and remote areas are actually on line. Federal funding of over $5 million for programs such as the Farmwide Rural Access network announced yesterday as part of the Networking the Nation program will increase the number of rural people who have access to the Internet. This will be a gradual process, but at the moment it is still a small number who are able to get their music faster and more cheaply via Internet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is very aware of the challenges of Internet commerce, given that it is such a new and rapidly expanding area, and is currently looking to develop an appropriate response to the phenomenon of the Internet, Internet commerce and intellectual property rights on the Net. In line with this, a discussion paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Copyright Reform and the Digital Agenda</EMPHASIS> was released in July this year, and there has been extensive consultation on the issues in the paper over a number of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11242"> months.We still want to see our local retailers able to survive and thrive in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Retail sales of music fell&mdash;not surprisingly&mdash;7.5 per cent in the first nine months of this year, compared with 1996. In part, this has been attributed to the increase in Internet sales and the increasing cost of CDs. Lower prices and a wider selection of music to choose from should also mean that people buy more. The average Australian buys just over two CDs per year compared with the average American who buys four.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parallel importing will mean more affordable CDs for all people across all age groups and musical interests. It will mean that competition in CD prices will not be limited to the small proportion of CDs that make it into the top 40 or the bargain bins of the hits from the 60s and 70s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some critics of this legislation argue that removing or reducing sales tax on CDs would in itself solve the problem of high CD prices in Australia. There is a higher tax on CDs than on some other entertainment products. This is one of the anomalies of the tax system that we are looking to address with tax reform. However, the ACCC has found that when sales tax on sound recordings was reduced from, say, 32.5 per cent to 20 per cent in 1985 very little of this reduction was passed on to consumers and the prices increased significantly in the next 12 months. Therefore, relying on the industry to pass on sales tax savings is not guaranteed to work. We have to look to other measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me address some of the key issues being used to oppose parallel importing of CDs&mdash;the sorts of issues that have been referred to by the immediate previous speaker. In the public debate on the issue, there has been a tendency to portray the proposed changes as taking away the rights of artists and their record companies to receive royalties for their recordings. Let us make it clear: record companies and composers will continue to receive royalties for recordings that are imported from overseas under the new system. Artists will continue to receive income from these royalties, depending on their contractual agreements with their record company, irregardless of parallel importing. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The rate of royalty that record companies will get will be the royalty rate in the country that the recording is made.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Currently, the royalty rate of Australian recordings is 9.306 per cent of the wholesale price, as is the European Union&mdash;including the UK.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The United States royalty rates are currently US6.25c per piece of music or US1.3c per minute, whichever is greater&mdash;in answer to your question. They are aiming to increase the level of royalty that is to be paid, and new rates will be in force in January of next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other important thing to bear in mind is that most Australian artists&mdash;even the bigger name acts that have proved popular overseas, such as silverchair&mdash;are generally released in the local market first, and the majority of sales are exhausted in the Australian market in the first few months. Therefore, Australian copyright owners, record companies and composers will still receive the overwhelming majority of their royalties at local rates. If, subsequently, their recordings are imported from places such as the UK or the US, they will receive similar royalties as they do here now. These amendments will not affect the royalties received by artists who are not recorded overseas. I repeat: the artists are not to be disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some local artists have also expressed concern that the large record companies will dump CDs on the market from old or deleted stock and that this will reduce the market for local artists and new bands. This argument is an insult to consumers who are, as we are aware, a critical and discerning lot&mdash;no less so in relation to the music that they buy and listen to than in any other area. To suggest that Australian consumers will turn away from local artists and new music, and be conned into buying a product that the Americans or the British could not sell to their own people 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11243"> or which is already out of date, is absurd. And it is insulting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If artists are arguing that they succeed only because we have restricted access to better overseas talent, then it is to be expected that few will survive in the future as Internet sales escalate. I, for one, believe our artists can compete with the best from anywhere. Australians, particularly our young people, are well known for their support of the local industry. Triple J, the ABC youth broadcaster&mdash;which the previous speaker referred to&mdash;has a very successful program which is well supported by their listeners. They also travel around the country unearthing new talent in the different regions. Silverchair was discovered in this way, as have many other successful new bands and artists been since. This is not a listening public that will accept anything other than the best, most up-to-date music&mdash;from both Australia and overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of the talent development in this country is the work of the Australian owned record labels. The big seven record companies rely on the smaller labels and the independent sector for the vast majority of artist and local music development. They are then quite happy to poach these  artists when they have effectively done their time, learned their lessons and proved their saleability in the independent sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The independent sector has also been quite competitive and successful in Australia. Both Australian and overseas new releases from Shock Records, the largest independent Australian owned record company, generally retail for around $26, compared with approximately $30 for releases from the foreign owned record companies&mdash;or $31 in the case of Warners who recently increased the price of their releases by $1.10, thus forcing retailers to pass this increase on to consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This example illustrates that the Australian industry is well placed to respond to the demands of increased competition as a result of the introduction of parallel importation for CDs and any other sound recordings. Even with the reduction in prices expected by these changes, companies such as Shock Records will still be in a position to compete favourably. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another myth that is being perpetuated in this debate is that the introduction of parallel importing will mean the loss of 55,000 jobs in the music industry. These claims by ARIA are preposterous. ABS figures show that record companies and distributors employ only 2,324 people. The seven major companies employ 1,301 and the remaining 1,023 people are employed by another 146 companies. So the reference to 55,000 jobs would surely be only a desperate ploy. CD manufacturing companies employ only 493 people, and AMRA report that only 3,900 full-time positions exist in the music retail section.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of parallel importing of CDs is not going to wipe out the Australian music industry. I have already outlined how small independent retailers will benefit and may even be in a position to expand and create more jobs, how we have a profitable and already competitive manufacturing sector and how the claims of some artists and composers are unsubstantiated. In addition, we also have a strong live music scene in Australia which will not be affected by any changes to the copyright laws to allow parallel importation of CDs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to the Copyright Act, hand in hand with other government support for the Australian music industry&mdash;such as our commitment to work with the performing arts community to develop workable copyright laws for performers, including a recognition for the first time of the moral rights of performers&mdash;will help to make sure that we continue to have a vibrant and thriving new music industry in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has some of the strongest and best protection of copyright provisions in the world&mdash;I should know; I am a member of the Australian Society of Authors, and we have done a lot of that work ourselves&mdash;and the amendments to the Copyright Act will not weaken these laws. Australia is a signatory to both the Rome convention and the World Intellectual Property Organisation, WIPO, obligations. This is not about reducing or weakening copyright protection. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee concluded with respect to these amendments: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11244">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . copyright law should be used strictly for the purposes of the protection of intellectual property and not to create other and additional non-tariff barriers to trade.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I repeat: these changes will allow parallel CD importation and distribution in Australia of legitimate, non-pirated recordings or CDs. These amendments do not change the fundamental protection that is accorded to copyright owners. To suggest that retailers would risk their livelihood importing pirated copies is a nonsense. Indeed, rather than weakening the copyright laws, the changes contained in this bill will ensure that the excellent protection we have in place are strengthened by strong penalty provisions and the reversal of the onus of proof in civil actions for breach of copyright.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Privacy is a concern in countries which do not have strong protection in place for copyright and which rely on a large informal trade, such as markets or street sellers, for their major avenues of selling. In contrast, Australia has not only excellent copyright laws but also a formal music retail structure in which legitimate retailers would be unwilling&mdash;indeed, completely opposed to&mdash;stocking dubious recordings. Unlike the street sellers, they cannot simply run around the corner when spotted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite obviously, these amendments are a win-win situation all&hyphen;round. What we have in Australia at the moment is a population of music lovers and consumers that is exposed to only 20 per cent of the world's music at any one time. There is a major monopoly on the trade of music into this country through CDs. These amendments deliver the best for the future of Australia's music lovers and our retailers and artists. I strongly commend these amendments to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is a great honour to wind up this debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R378">Copyright Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997</XREF> , because I like music.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> widely. I buy from all sorts of sources. I buy from HMV, Chandlers, Myers or the independents, so I do not come into this debate with any baggage or favourites.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At times I do not like paying as much for CDs as I do. I imagine that my fellow Australians feel much the same way. To my surprise, and totally incongruously, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, and the member for Canberra, Mr Bob McMullan, defend the monopoly profits of the major record companies against the interests of Australian consumers, local performers and the more innovative and competitive record stores.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Canberra is generally one of the more informed and measured shadow ministers. Listening to him this afternoon, I had the distinct feeling that he did not have his heart in the debate. Labor sold out to consumers when they looked at this issue in government. It is unlikely that they would have been prepared to admit this mistake when they failed to change the legislation after the copyright law review. It is equally unlikely that they will now admit that the Prices Surveillance Authority was right in 1990 when it found that the price of sound recordings was unreasonably high in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For four years, the opposition lacked the will needed to change the laws. It vacillated on the issue. It left consumers with a restricted market and unreasonably high prices for discs. Opposition members now compliantly fall in behind the multinational record companies. But there was one lone voice in the wilderness of the Labor government, that of Senator Chris Schacht. In 1991, Senator Schacht said that the Australian Record Industry Association, ARIA, had been conducting `a wicked campaign of misinformation of what would happen if changes to parallel imports were allowed in the record industry'. He said that ARIA had been putting forward some false claims. I wonder whether anything has changed when I look at the massive one-page ads and the television commercials that have been running recently. I do not think they were put in for the benefit of young Australian artists. I think they were 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11245"> put there by companies purely to protect their market interest. Fancy that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it not also true when the ALP was in government that as recently as 1994 it received advice that it should reign in this monopoly? Is it not also true that cabinet agreed with this advice but that the then Prime Minister, the champion of the arts sycophants, had the legislation pulled? I would be interested to hear members of the opposition deny this. I think my source is pretty reliable. Fancy that.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every other Australian business and industry has had to take a good hard look at itself, the way that it does business and become competitive. It has had to make changes. I believe that the six largest record companies in Australia, which are all foreign owned, have made little effort to embrace competition and provide world competitive pricing. The Australian music manufacturing industry has the potential to be world competitive. Governments of both political colours have demanded that all sorts of industries be competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why should we exempt six foreign multinational companies from these rules? How can I say to cane farmers who have a really good case for compensation that they will have to accept losing their tariffs but then turn around and tell them and their children that the next time they go into a music store to buy a CD they will have to pay a premium? How do I tell them when they go into their music stores in  Maryborough, Bundaberg, Mackay, Proserpine, Ingham, Tully or Cairns, `Your tariff has gone, fellas, but we're propping up the six multinational companies'? It just does not hold water and people would see it as the duplicity that it was.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a strong supporter for improving competition, and I am not alone in this view. Recently in North Queensland, I was scanning the letters to the editor section of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 25 October 1997. There was an interesting letter there from Mr Stanley, an Atherton candidate for the Constitutional Convention. On his own admission, he is a buyer of some $1,400 to $1,900 worth of compact discs per year, so I suppose that he is competent to comment on these matters. I will quote from his letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a sound mixer and recordist in the record industry, I receive royalty payments from numerous albums. I don't know what arrangements others make, but my payments are based on the wholesale price at the point of manufacture and not on any local retail figure.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is a good point, isn't it? He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have lived in Australia for about 15 years and buy about 100 albums a year. I have only bought about 20 in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">First&hyphen;release CDs in the United States sell for between $US9.95 ($A14) and $US11.95 at the big record outlets. Even with shipping costs these CDs are half what the same items cost in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">All this talk about a $7 drop or worse, the $1.60 asserted by Kim Beazley, is absolute nonsense. Real competition and bulk shipment should bring the (discounted) price down to $14 or more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The record companies, with Government collusion, are ripping off the Australian public and have been for years. Anyone who supports the continuation of this rort should have their motives publicly examined.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That letter was from a guy who buys a lot of recordings. He is a sound mixer and recordist, so he has been in the business. That was the assessment of someone who has been in the business locally and overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The secretary of the Association of Independent Record Labels, Brad Simms, said that the removal of the ban on CD imports will not only cut prices but also force foreign owned companies to invest more in the local industry, not less as the argument has been. The ACCC chairman, Allan Fels, said that current laws surrounding parallel imports are the antithesis&mdash;note that word&mdash;of free trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The multinationals have three arguments for retaining parallel import restrictions. First, the sales tax on CDs is too high. Treasury has 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11246"> estimated that the Australian level of tax, as a proportion of the full price of a CD, is around 11 per cent. In its literature, the industry conveniently and dishonestly tries to compare the Australian wholesale tax of 22 per cent with the VATs and GSTs, et cetera, that operate in most other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, comparing Australia's 11 per cent tax with comparable economies, we find that the US has a tax of 7.5 per cent, the UK 15 per cent, Germany 13 per cent, New Zealand 11 per cent and Singapore three per cent. The net tax on a CD in Australia is lower than in some countries, higher than in others, but broadly comparable, yet consumers in New Zealand, who pay the same proportion of tax on a CD&mdash;11 per cent&mdash;can purchase compact discs at $18.90. That is anywhere from $8 to $12 less than we pay in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The multinationals and their anointed stars would have us believe that sales tax is the main component in the price of a CD, but the ACCC noted that when sales tax on sound recordings was reduced from 32.5 per cent to 20 per cent in Australia in September 1985, very little benefit was passed on to consumers, so why would we assume that they would suddenly turn around and do it now?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only one of the six major record companies reduced its CD prices following that tax cut. Indeed, the ACCC's forerunner monitored prices for the following 12 months, and noted that substantial price increases, not decreases, ensued. What benefit was there to the Australian consumer and what reason do we have to believe that they would do it now? The sales tax argument also does not explain why Shock Records, the biggest Australian independent record company, can undercut the major overseas owned companies. The average price of a Shock recording is $26, compared with the multinationals' price, which ranges from $30 to $32.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second argument is that retailers will be worse off under the new legislation. This argument baffles me. There are already quite profitable niche markets in music. We only have to look at the variety of radio stations around Australia to know that there is a broad spectrum of taste in our community. The big chains may offer variety and a good browse, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> but when it comes to the avid music lover&mdash;and I put myself in that category&mdash;when you want something in particular, you generally go to a specialty shop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, there are 2,200 music retailers in Australia, of which 1,200 are members of chains or department stores. Of these 2,200 retailers, 722 belong to the Australian Music Retailers Association, and there are 235 independent retailers. They are not members of franchises such as Sanity, HMV and so on. We can extrapolate from that that about 76 per cent of independent music retailers do not belong to AMRA and, according to AMRA itself, the chain stores are expanding rapidly and competing directly with small independent retailers. They are hardly examples of caring defenders of small retailers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of these independent stores have already said that parallel import restrictions prevent them from obtaining stock from overseas at lower purchase prices. In effect, this restriction prevents them from competing more effectively with the larger chains. They are left in a permanent also&hyphen;ran category and deprived of being able to compete with the bulk purchases that are enjoyed by the chain stores and the large retailers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that single or stand&hyphen;alone businesses have always had to compete with chains and find ways to improve their market share without the benefit of big names or known entities. What must be particularly hard for an independent retailer is the spread of mega music stores&mdash;HMV, Sanity and the like. How does an independent retailer compete with the name and marketing power of a 100&hyphen;strong chain which is vertically integrated with a multinational company?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Independents compete by specialising in niche markets and targeting stock to those markets. By being able to purchase legitimate copyright stocks competitively from overseas, they can enhance those niches and develop others. At the moment, 20 per cent of the six multinationals' catalogue is available in Australia. As my colleague the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) said, it is a disgrace to think that they control what we hear, how we hear it, when we hear it, and what we pay for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11247"> it. Niche stores, therefore, must compete at the whim of the multinationals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Retailers such as Target, K&hyphen;Mart and Woolworths have the advantage, and have already reduced the cost of compact discs by an average of $1. Imagine what benefits could flow to consumers if there were a $2 or greater saving on every CD. The ACCC has supported this decision of government. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> of 11 October 1997, it said that the government's policy is a huge victory for consumers. I stress the words `a huge victory for consumers'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third argument used by the multinationals is that the local musicians will lose out. Philip Tripp, former adviser to the special trade committee established to look at the issue of parallel imports, has said that small retailers will not benefit from the removal of restrictions on parallel imports and these changes will force the country's most talented artists overseas. Clearly this is not the case. Australians will go overseas to develop their talents and experience or to expand their audience base. This is hardly surprising when we are a nation of 18 million people in relative isolation from Europe and North America. It is not surprising they go to Europe and the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Popular artists such as Kylie Minogue and Nick Cave are based overseas, as indeed was the late Michael Hutchence of INXS. Dame Joan Sutherland spent many years overseas pursuing her career. These people and a host of others went overseas for good reason and quite independently from the restrictions that might have been imposed by parallel imports. The USA allows parallel imports and Australian artists are still willing to go there to sell their music. The European Union allows parallel imports between member countries. Does that prevent Kylie Minogue, for example, from being less successful in the UK?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The six multinationals also argue that new artists will not be supported in Australia. All evidence to date shows that new artists are reliant on the youth radio networks, Triple J in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Unearthed</EMPHASIS> program and the independent record companies to have their music produced and distributed. Many unknown local artists are on unemployment and find it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> difficult to get the support of the big six record companies. Indeed, as others have said tonight, Australia's Savage Garden had to go to America to record its first album, which has put them on the world music map. Indeed, many aspiring and successful young artists have become popular through Triple J and independent record companies. It was much later in their careers when the big six picked them up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Melbourne music industry lawyer Phil Dwyer in an interview on Triple J on 9 October scoffed at the suggestion that record prices should be maintained artificially so the companies can subsidise Australian artists. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 25 October said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Phil Dwyer is a Melbourne lawyer who in the past 25 years has "represented about half the contemporary artists in Australia" . . . He thinks the government plan, by making records cheaper, will help performers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Basic economics also tell us that if you reduce the price of a good or service consumers will buy more. Consumers of popular music are generally young people who do not have high levels of disposable income. Australians buy 2.9 compact discs per year compared with the US where consumers buy an average of 4.2 discs per year. So there is a capacity to expand the user market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A study by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics reports that at least $1.60 will come off the price of a compact disc selling for $30. Professor Fels says that the figure will be $7. Opposition members have disputed both, but I think one thing is quite clear: they will fall in price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can assume that, if there are greater sales, there will be greater employment in the music industry. As the member for Murray said, it is totally dishonest of ARIA or the industry in general to say in its ads that 55,000 jobs are at risk. A worst case scenario would be 2,300. If the market expands, as indeed it should, there will be many more jobs, not less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the past 12 months there has been a reduction in record sales in Australia but consumers are still buying music and they are doing it through the Internet. The choice is greater and the prices are lower. I think on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11248"> that note there is crystal clear message for the Australian industry: to survive it must get more competitive. It will not become more competitive by allowing itself to be subsumed by the policy, the directives and the totally dishonest campaign that has been waged over recent weeks by six multinational companies.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prices in Australia, the member for Canberra asserted, were among the lowest in the world and government figures on price reduction are suspect. In response to that, let me say that the reputable economic authorities are examining this issue in depth and have predicted that prices will fall if parallel importation is permitted. Even the opposition accepts that prices in the United States are lower than in Australia. The US is a major supplying country for Australia and Australia should have the advantage of those lower prices in respect of legitimately made CDs. This is something that the industry has been unable or unwilling to deliver.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Canberra then asserted that this bill will cause Australian industry to suffer, that there will be no development of local artists and that our industry will just become a distribution and importation industry. For the major companies the question of investment in local artists has always been a commercial one. That situation will not be changed by this bill. There will continue to be demand domestically and internationally for talented musicians, which Australia seems to have the capacity to continue to produce. If the large record companies are unwilling to continue a role with such artists, which remains to be seen, there are plenty of other middle&hyphen;sized and small record labels that have the capacity and would be willing to fill the gap.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Canberra also asserted that Australia is acting contrary to the spirit of international trade policy and will, in particular, antagonise the United States. The member is correct to accept that the bill does not breach Australia's international obligations. There is no accepted international position on the question on importation rights for copyright material. In fact, as recently as December last year, the member nations of the World Intellectual Property Organisation rejected the inclusion in an international treaty of requirements for members to grant importation rights for copyright material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has a broad&hyphen;ranging relationship with the United States. While the government is aware of US views on this matter, US concerns must be viewed in the context of the entire relationship. Major trading countries that permit parallel importation of sound recordings include Japan, Canada and Singapore. These countries continue to trade with the USA without specific criticism of this aspect of their legislation. Australia has a copyright regime that is acknowledged by the United States as world class. This bill maintains that high standard. I think the member for Hinkler was right, that the heart of the member for Canberra is not in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I join with the member for Murray in saying that this is a win&hyphen;win bill. Consumers will benefit from lower CD prices and greater choice. Artists in the recording industry will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11249"> gain stronger protection against piracy in the form of increased penalties and evidentiary presumptions that will make actions for infringement considerably easier. This is a bill that all fair&hyphen;minded members should support. It is a balanced bill. It removes control from the hands of copyright owners only to the extent appropriate to promote fair and reasonable competition. It ensures that the interests of copyright owners are protected in so doing. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not proposing any amendments&mdash;therefore, we will not be dividing or taking long&mdash;but I do want to raise some questions of detail and I would like to see if I can get some ministerial response. I am not going to go over those matters where I think the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) was misinformed in responding at the end of the second reading. They are debating points which we could all have some fun with on another occasion. But there are some important points that will influence subsequent consideration of this legislation. I would like to have the chance to raise them now with regard to the particular clauses and with regard to the arguments that have been put in support of the particular clauses, particularly some of the material that is outlined in the explanatory memorandum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The explanatory memorandum gives great weight to the estimates, particularly on page 5, of the benefit of the proposed parallel importation regime and at point (1) talks about the infamous Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics estimate of $1.60 and $3.00, which I note in passing were figures ridiculed by the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), although they are in the government's explanatory memorandum and originate from the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston). But I do not blame him for ridiculing them; I think they are ridiculous.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am seeking from the Attorney&hyphen;General is the basis upon which this calculation was made. It is fundamental to the case for this bill. It is fundamental to the argument that there is some sort of consumer benefit. We seek to find out the exchange rate assumptions which underpin this assertion, and we cannot find those. Everybody knows that during this year&mdash;and some people may think this is a very good thing, and for some industries it is a very good thing; I am not seeking to comment on it&mdash;the exchange rate of the Australian dollar compared to the US dollar fell from roughly 78c to 68c. That has profound implications for the alleged price benefit. Given that we cannot get a copy of the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics report, we cannot be sure of even when it was written to make some sort of estimate as to the exchange rate assumptions, but I am certain they were not 68c.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most people who are trying to work back to see how they got the figures say that it must have been something like 78c. That would not have been an unreasonable thing for them to say if they did it in the first half of this year. It is not a criticism of the bureau if they did base it on that estimate. It probably was the rate when they did the calculation, but I do not know. If it was the rate when they did the calculation, it follows logically that by now there is no consumer benefit. If there is a $1.60 difference on a $30 item at a 78c dollar, there cannot be a consumer benefit at a 68c dollar. You can change a lot of things by law, but you cannot change the laws of arithmetic. The laws of arithmetic unfortunately say that this does not add up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to be difficult in the conduct of the business. If we have to get the response to this tomorrow and consider this bill tomorrow, I will not extend the debate very long tomorrow morning to disrupt the government's program. I suspect we could finish it in 10 minutes tomorrow, but I do want the chance to get that information. The House is entitled to have that information. The House cannot consider the matter properly until it gets that information. Those are issues that I think are important for us to know before we can understand this matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I want to draw the House's attention to the very conspicuous failure of the contracting out of the case management of the long&hyphen;term unemployed in my electorate. This is just one example of many, but I think it is one of the most disastrous. I was contacted by a young woman called Sharon Foley and her husband, Michael, on Thursday, 13 November. Sharon has been unemployed for two years. She was sent by the CES&mdash;allegedly she chose, but I think she was really sent&mdash;to the local community based organisation to undertake a program of case management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very worthy organisation which, in the past, has provided labour market programs and which contracted for this funding because there was very little else. They are people of good heart and a high level of skill. The organisation, like others, is likely to earn some $300 to $400 up front for case managing Sharon and some $800&mdash;or possibly more, but not much more&mdash;once she is employed. So they can expect in total a little over $1,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sharon, who is enterprising and regularly visits the CES, although she is not case managed by them, saw an advertisement in her local branch by the Australian School of Tourism and Hotel Management. She took the flyer and a letter, she applied and was offered a place in the course. I will read briefly from that letter because I think it is very important. The course is described as a certificate 2 in hospitality operations. It is a 20&hyphen;week course&mdash;so it is a very substantial one&mdash;and it provides 40 hours of work experience and a guaranteed place at the end. No wonder she was excited when she got a place, after two years of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All it says in the letter, which is addressed `To whom it may concern,' is that the pre 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> requisite for both programs&mdash;another one was advertised simultaneously&mdash;is that people must be registered as unemployed for a minimum of 12 months. She thought she was home and hosed because she had been out of work for two years. The flyer which was attached said that to qualify a person had to be, firstly, unemployed for 12 months or more and, secondly, `CES&hyphen;case managed'. She thought that she qualified on that ground too. But when she was contacted by the CES she was told that she could not actually take a place on the course because she was not case managed by the CES, but by a community organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They told her at the Spearwood office that she would have chosen to be case managed by another organisation and, therefore, she was not eligible for the course. The officer said she would arrange for the senior case manager at Fremantle to contact my office. She later phoned and said that she had made inquiries and that she definitely would not have a place because the community organisation was being paid roughly $1,000 for her case management, approximately $200 more in the extreme case, and the course cost $3,500. CES and DEETYA both said to her that the community organisation should&mdash;for one person they are case managing&mdash;pay nearly three times more than they receive from the government and that she could not possibly get a place under those or any other circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is very interesting that I had discussions with CES and DEETYA senior officials in Western Australia and, frankly, they would not budge. They referred me to a minute from the government. I can understand why they would not budge because this particular type of program is only available to CES managed clients. Training for unemployment programs is not available to people such as Sharon, who has been out of work for two years, unless the organisation pays. Frankly, they do not have the funds to do so. The cuts are now coming home to roost. They would not allow her, either, to transfer from her community organisation back to CES. They said there had to be some evidence of an irretrievable breakdown in the relationship 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11251"> between the client and the community organisation, and there clearly was not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They insisted that the price be negotiated for the place. It is clear that the CES was charging some $3,500 in the open market, $1,200 to their own case managed clients and who knows what price for poor Sharon. It is still being negotiated. At the time I rang the office, they told me the course was not filled, but they still would not take Sharon. As of this week, they have actually delayed the start date of the course for a further week because they do not have enough clients. Yet here is a young woman begging to be allowed to enter, but, because of the way this government is funding labour market programs, she cannot get a place and therefore she cannot get a guaranteed job. It is an absolute disgrace.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="11251"><TITLE>Civil Aviation Safety Authority</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a letter from another local company called Heli Adventure. The letter was written to me seeking assistance to resolve a major problem their company in Cairns was having with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Heli Adventure has a helicopter flying school and charter company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 23 April 1997 they wrote to the Cairns office of CASA seeking approval for them to include a B206 type helicopter on their air operators certificate. CASA wrote back 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> advising them that they would be required to undergo a flight check of the B206 type helicopter at their expense and the owner of the company would also have to submit their chief pilot for approval. They had nobody in Cairns who was able to conduct that check and they were unable to confirm when this would be affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Heli Adventure wrote again on 24 July 1997 advising that they had taken possession of the helicopter, that they could not operate that helicopter until they had been approved on their AOC and that it was costing them approximately $15,000 per month sitting there on the tarmac unable to operate. On 18 September&mdash;remember this started on 23 July&mdash;they wrote to CASA again advising that they wanted to submit a Captain Terry McGowan as their chief pilot and hoping to resolve the matter. CASA wrote back that Captain McGowan was unsuitable because he had been in Cairns for only a short period of time, and on 23 October they wrote again to CASA advising that they would nominate a Captain Martin Rock for the position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reply from CASA was that they would interview Captain Rock on 21 October, one month later. Captain Rock was successful in the interview and appointed as a chief pilot. They were then advised that Captain Rock would need to undergo a flight check on the B206 and that they would also require to conduct an inspection of the operations. They advised CASA that they were available for the inspection at the earliest possible time and that Captain Rock was available for flight check. On 5 November, one month later again, Captain Rock was tested by Captain Leon Kippin in CASA, Townsville, and was successful in his testing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the same day, John Barr from CASA's office in Cairns was to conduct an operation inspection in their office. That morning they received advice that he had more pressing matters and that he would come down and explain the situation later. Needless to say, he did not turn up. He did not return the phone calls, and they are still waiting for him to turn up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Helico employ a staff of eight, and without this licence they are continuing to lose their

I would call on the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Vaile) to do everything he can to deal with these uncooperative bureaucrats.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Peter,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing in reply to your letter of 3 October 1997 to Dr. John Burgess . . . I apologise for the delay in replying.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was sorry to hear that you believe BHP's environmental record at the Belmont Wetlands is inconsistent with the Company's Vision and Values, and the BHP Environmental Policy. From the outset, BHP has recognised that this project is a very important one for the local communities and the broader region, given the absence of other coastal wetlands in the area. At the same time, we have also had to take into account the interests of our shareholders because of the commercial potential of the site. What we have been trying to do, therefore, is to find a solution that accommodates all these interests squarely within the framework of Company's core principles and policies that require us to act in a socially and environmentally responsible manner. This has involved direct contact and discussion with the community and the development of options that will protect the wetlands, dunes and beach system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current Belmont Wetlands proposal provides for more than four kilometres of beach and dune area to be rezoned as public open space; rehabilitation of the designated SEPP 14 wetlands; addition of a further 30 hectares of wetlands; and creation of a further 10 hectares&mdash;in total, some 130 hectares of wetlands. At the same time, it allows for the creation of a high quality residential precinct that we believe has the potential to enhance the overall amenity of the area.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">For that substitute, `a profit of some tens of millions of dollars', if they can get away with it&mdash;not the amenity of the area. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We accept, however, that there remain differences of view about the future of the area. These are views that we respect. We recognise we may not have yet struck quite the right balance and will continue to try to accommodate all stakeholder 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11253"> interests via a process of continuing community consultation and involvement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for taking the trouble to write.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That letter itself is classic Sir Humphrey. If you thought the Public Service knew how to write jargon and words that appear to mean something that do not mean anything, what about the private sector? You do not go to the public sector; you go to the real bureaucracy&mdash;that is, the major private bureaucracies like BHP.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of this House and all the Australian people the recent loss of one of Australian businesses' finest servants&mdash;Jim Sweeney. The former managing director of St George Bank was not only revered by his peers and colleagues in the banking industry but he was admired by many in our broader community for his great Australian qualities. Jim Sweeney was a friend of mine, a man whose integrity, humility and generosity was matched only by his stature and the size of his smile.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jim was born in Sydney in 1946 and went to school in Punchbowl. He left school at 15 to work in a timberyard in the Blue Mountains to support his family after his father was injured in the war and had a restricted working capacity. Jim worked day and night to literally keep his family going. After holding a number of jobs, Jim joined the Penrith branch of St George Building Society as a teller in 1974. From there he was promoted to regional manager in 1977 and won a scholarship to the management school at Mt Eliza in Victoria. In 1980 he was promoted to training manager at head office and moved up to become chief general manager and personal assistant to the managing director in 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the late 1980s, Jim oversaw the integration of State Building Society. In 1989 he was appointed chief executive officer and in 1992, as managing director of the group, he garnered the support of the St George Building Society membership to vote to turn the society into a listed company on the Australian Stock Exchange. With the transformation of the financial services industry, Jim Sweeney sought to expand the bank by acquisition. He secured the retail and commercial assets of Barclays Bank in 1994 and sealed the deal to take over Advance Bank in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jim Sweeney was involved with banking for the majority of his very distinguished career, overseeing some of the most significant transformations in Australian banking. He controlled the direction of St George for more than a decade, taking it from having assets of $3.2 billion in 1986 to more than $50 billion today. In recognition of his achievements, Jim was voted by his peers Australian Banker of the Year in 1994 and again in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout his career, perhaps the greatest challenge for Jim Sweeney was to steer St George through the massive industry changes without losing the friendly and engaging culture St George has always prided itself on. In fact, when the financial institutions committee of this House visited St George at Kogarah last year, it was Jim Sweeney who gave us a personal guided tour of the bank. He seemed to know each of the staff well and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11254"> took great interest in their families and their careers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an example of this, Jim Sweeney was very proud of the excellent child&hyphen;care facilities on&hyphen;site at the Kogarah head office. He was determined to give all his staff an opportunity to stay at St George during those difficult years while their families were growing up. He wanted to provide an anxious parent with access to a child during the day and that is why he provided the on&hyphen;site child care. This illustrates how he treated his staff like his own family. In turn, Jim was revered by his staff of 7,000. He steered them through the enormous changes at the bank and he led by inspiration and by example. He will be remembered by all for his huge laugh and his magnificent, all&hyphen;embracing smile.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that Jim Sweeney's passing has left a huge void in the banking industry in Australia. He will be dearly missed by his friends and the staff at St George, particularly his loyal personal assistant, Diane Schuman. For his family in particular the loss will be enormous. Jim's wife, Margaret, and children, Catherine and David, and their extended families have this parliament's sincere condolences after losing their husband and their dad. This House and this nation will mourn for some years to come the loss of Jim Sweeney at such an early age. Australia has lost a most humble, generous of spirit and pioneering business great.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="11254"><TITLE>Social Security</TITLE>

For those in government who were unaware of what was meant when they amended the social security legislation and other legislation to ensure the department could never make a mistake, I have no doubt they are now finding out just what they have done. I have no doubt also that constituents are coming to them&mdash;as they are coming to me&mdash;with the problems they are having with the department.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With those changes, there has been a particular campaign to target and focus on groups of people, and I want to mention some of those groups. The first group are those who are defrauding. We have now seen telephone number figures of savings per day on people who are defrauding social security. I know, the minister knows and everyone in parliament knows that a substantial part of that is errors, mistakes and distortions. I have been told of particular cases in recent times where women at some point previously were in a relationship where the income was being declared by the then de facto. The fact is that, when those submissions were being put in, the woman was not allowed to be involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In one case that has come to my attention, the woman tried to talk to the department about what was going in and was told that she was not allowed to because it was none of her business. The man had to put in the income statement because he was the one who was the major beneficiary and her income was a partner's allowance and therefore she was not involved. Almost four years later, suddenly that woman has a debt. The relationship broke up some time back, but she now discovers she has a debt and she is defrauding. So she effectively has a record as a cheat and a fraud, and that woman is now working in the community sector. It is a real concern that someone who has tried to act properly and do the right thing now finds that this government sees them as a fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In some of those cases&mdash;and I have had at least four in the last five or six weeks of one type or another in social security and in the de facto situation&mdash;the government is chasing very minor debt and it will cost more to recover than the debt itself. It will stigmatise people for many years to come, and in the process they are being absolutely traumatised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another form of error that occurs applies to Austudy. If the transfer between Austudy and social security does not happen smoothly, it can mean that technically a person is entitled to no support at all. They are not complying with the Austudy requirements, they are not fully transferred to social security; therefore they get neither. The fact is they get a debt. The fact is they are seen to be frauds and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11255"> cheats. Now those kinds of debts are also being recovered with no concessions whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another Austudy case I have heard about in recent times is really quite galling. It concerns a young man who is attending university on Abstudy. The young man is from Queensland and he became aware that he could apply under a state support system as well as Abstudy. He went to Austudy and talked to them about it and was assured that it would all be fine, so he accepted. Some months later he was told, `You are now disqualified from Abstudy.' He now has a debt with them, plus he has been disqualified. In a letter from the minister, the minister concedes that the young man was so advised, but tough luck. In other words, this government says to bureaucrats, `Give them advice. If it's wrong, it doesn't matter; it's still their fault.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The onus of responsibility has been shifted to people who are not responsible for these problems. This young man has a liability. He is now missing out. He is in fact taking a lesser income because he was wrongly advised by a departmental officer. The government says, `Not our fault, not our responsibility.' He will be seen to be a fraud also. I am getting these complaints; I have no doubt members opposite are getting them. As the government focuses on and targets those groups&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="11255"><TITLE>Brown, Mr Nicholas</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been my privilege to have in my office during the past two sitting weeks a young man from my electorate of Lilley, Nicholas Brown. Nicholas has just completed year 12 as School Captain of Brisbane Grammar School. Last year he was selected to participate in the Rotary Adventure in Citizenship which included a visit to Parliament House. Nicholas thinks he may like to become a parliamentarian. I would like to read to you the following adjournment speech he has written so that my colleagues may judge for themselves. It is entitled `The Adults of Tomorrow' and he starts with a quote from Benjamin Disraeli:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The youth of a nation are the trustees of posterity. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Nicholas goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Young people grow up in incredibly varied circumstances, under a great many influences. In the modern world, the pressures on young people have never been greater. With this increase in pressure, there comes the urgent task of understanding what is happening in the lives of today's youth. The trouble facing youth, growing up in any time period, can probably best be described in the words of Hippocrates, `Life is short, art long, opportunity fleeting, experience treacherous, judgment difficult.' And it could be possible to add in the modern world `competition intense'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Growing up is a difficult process, but it is a different process in today's world compared with when many honourable members were in their adolescence. Issues which young people must acknowledge and comprehend in today's world relate to the distressing prospects in employment; the importance and necessity of a comprehensive education within an extremely competitive system; domestic violence; the ubiquitous and disparaging public attitudes towards certain social divisions and community groups as well as different attitudes towards gender, class and race or ethnicity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">When coupled with the gradual destabilisation of the family unit as a structural base for society, incorporating declining family values, and a false perception on behalf of many in society that most of today's youth are impossible to manage, it is no wonder that statistics point to alarming trends in youth suicide rates, youth crime rates, the numbers experimenting with drugs, alcohol and sex, as well as disturbing numbers of homeless people within the 13 to 25 age bracket. This rather gloomy view of growing up in the `90s is of course an extreme assessment, but it is very real for some young people, albeit a minority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">So, what should the government do about the predicament in which some young people find themselves? Fortunately, the current government is concerned with the well being of Australia's youth. They are putting a concerted effort into youth programs, and have placed appropriate emphases on the education of children and the development of the family as an important basis for a stable society. It was recognised over 2000 years ago that at the foundation of every state is the education of its youth. When combined with the reinforcement of family values, many of the social problems facing Australian young people will dissipate. Mr Speaker, while young people have a tendency to disregard the advice given them by their elders, the young do need the old. As Peter Ustinov put it, `Parents and elders are the bones upon which children sharpen their teeth.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Young people, by their very nature are difficult entities with which to deal. This fact certainly does 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11256"> not make the government's job any easier, but good policies put in place by government to try and combat problems are often held up or baulked at by opposing parties in a bid to gain `political points' with the electorate. The common goal of all MPs is to develop the nation, and it is frustrating to see the opposition being so antagonistic towards legislation simply because they think they must not be seen to be agreeing with the government. The best way to gain support from the electorate is not by demeaning government operation, but by placing policies before the people of Australia and letting them judge for themselves their worthiness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, Mr Speaker, the paraphrased words of Jimmy Carter sum up the views of all Australians. `All I want is the same as what you want. To have a nation with a government that is as good and honest and decent and competent and compassionate and as filled with love as are the Australian people.'</PARA>
