<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aged Care Bill 1997 has been described as `discriminatory and ill prepared' and as `short&hyphen;sighted', its passage lamented as `seriously risking undermining the current standard of aged care in Australia', its impact assessed as certain to `punish Australia's most vulnerable older people' and its legacy `a two&hyphen;tiered system of health care'&mdash;a system that will condemn older Australians without money or assets to second&hyphen;rate levels of care in older and increasingly run&hyphen;down accommodation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are not the words of the opposition, nor are they the words of any fringe anti-government group. They are the words of the Catholic, Uniting and Anglican churches, of Over 50s Focus, Aged Care Australia, the Older Women's Network and the Alzheimers Association of Australia. They are also the words of the Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association. These organisations represent the full spectrum of private and not&hyphen;for&hyphen;profit aged care providers as well as older Australians and their families. These reactions have been provoked by a bill which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) describes as `first class' and which the government claims is aimed at cleaning up a `mess' in aged care&mdash;a `mess' that the government claims is the legacy of Labor in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a view that if you say something often enough it will become true, throw enough mud around and some of it will stick, and in politics attempt to create a sense of crisis and confusion to justify or smokescreen hidden agendas. Of course, what we see here is the government doing exactly that in relation to aged care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have heard from the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), and no doubt we will hear from other speakers from the government side on this subject, is one of the most extraordinary litanies of exaggeration, half truths and outright misrepresentation of the facts ever heard in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the truth about Labor's record in government and what did Labor inherit in terms of aged care from the Fraser govern 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment? In 1983 Labor inherited an aged care system that had seen numerous attempts at reform by previous governments of both political persuasions. However, the system provided standards of care that varied widely over the nation. Some of it was appalling. I will not go on about all that now because it is a very long time ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did Labor do about it? One thing they did not do is sit on their hands. Rather than give you my words, let us have a look at what <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's welfare </EMPHASIS>said about our aged care system. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's welfare </EMPHASIS>is a detailed report about Australia's health and welfare systems that has been undertaken by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, a body that is independent of government and political parties. I recommend to the minister that she read these reports and stop misleading the public and the parliament about what Labor did. The 1993 report describes the major restructuring of aged care services that started in 1985. It makes the point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was not until the mid&hyphen;1980s that a substantial overhaul of the aged care system&mdash;the Aged Care Reform Strategy&mdash;was implemented. Changes since that time have been considerable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor's Aged Care Reform Strategy had major social justice objectives&mdash;access, equity and participation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is worth just pausing here for a minute to compare these objectives with the Howard government's central driving tenet of user pays, which means that you get into a nursing home if you have the money, and the money will determine the type of nursing home bed you get as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government has proved extremely creative at developing policies that will increase the number of users who can pay through such things as accommodation bonds or up-front fees. But its policies are most threadbare when coping with the situation where a user cannot pay. We have seen the most glaring example of this in the last week with the government's `derisory' and `insulting' offer of $5 per bed day for the financially disadvantaged. Again, these are the words of the churches.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4826">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By way of contrast, Labor's aged care reform strategy sought to properly target services to levels of need. Thus we had the development of a system of care, with the level of care offered determined by need as opposed to how much money one has. That is the Howard government approach of user pays. The type of care was determined by independent aged care assessment teams that were made up of doctors, nurses and social workers. These teams worked to a classification instrument which specified the types of care to be offered and made sure that the more highly dependent residents got greater resources. These important changes were put in place by Labor, not by any previous Liberal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nursing homes offered higher levels of care while the development of hostels offered a lower level of care. That was encouraged to stop a trend that had emerged under successive Liberal governments of increasing institutionalisation in nursing homes of people with lower care needs. There was a further diversification of the type of care offered with the introduction in 1985 of home and community care and, later, community aged care packages, both of which allowed older Australians with increasing dependency to continue living in their own homes. User rights, including a charter of residents rights, were developed from 1989 to 1991. Labor's strategy also introduced standards monitoring in 1987. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's welfare </EMPHASIS>comments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The results of a 4 year evaluation of the Standards Monitoring Program in nursing homes . . . included international comparisons, and places the Australian program at the forefront of aged care regulatory practices.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This point needs to be stressed if only to counter the wave of strident and irresponsible rot being promoted by the Minister for Family Services and the Prime Minister. Australia under Labor had an excellent standard of aged care and was a world leader in the levels of care provided. This is not just my view; it is the view of delegates to international conferences such as the Alzheimer's International Conference in Scotland in 1994, just to give one example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Things were not perfect. They did need ongoing reform. But this trend of ongoing 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reform, of continuous improvement, was the Labor approach. I might just mention for the purposes of informing the minister that I personally had nothing to do with this process of reform. I am very happy to give the credit to others for this excellent program of reform. In fact, I was not working for the federal government and of course was not in the federal parliament. The minister might stop misleading everybody on that score as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at the capital funding issues for aged care institutions. Under Labor, capital expenditure on nursing homes and hostels increased from $46 million in 1984-85 to total $1.2 billion over the 10-year period after that. These are the facts that all those opposite should comprehend. As <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's welfare</EMPHASIS> comments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The system which emerged by the early 1980's was a consequence of incremental change which took little account of the inter&hyphen;relationships between different sectors of provision.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Commenting in 1995, the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has come to recognise the importance of a more holistic approach to service delivery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen; the best balance of care amongst domiciliary services, long term residential care, supported accommodation, short term respite services, support for carers and cash assistance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But what do this government give us? They are giving us in this Aged Care Bill a return to the incremental approach with the addition of user pays and a significant cut of $500 million to government support for aged care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In preparing for today I could not find any evidence of any other government that put the aged care sector under such budgetary pressure. None. This government has done a first as far as that is concerned. In comparing in real terms what Labor spent on aged care, we find real recurrent expenditure increased by 54 per cent in the nine years 1985-86 to 1993-94; in HACC, home and community care, by 134 per cent; in hostels by 283 per cent; and in nursing homes by 22 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Compare this picture of ordered, systematic, evolutionary reform to the mess this government has managed to make of its attempts at aged care reform over the last 12 months. Along the way the Howard government have caused an enormous amount of worry and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4827"> concern amongst the majority of older Australians and their families and a great deal of worry to the providers of aged care. In fact, what this government have managed to do is unite in opposition to their proposals all those involved in aged care&mdash;the providers, both private and not for profit, the workers and representatives of nursing home residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This opposition has developed as the full implications of the government's plans have been revealed. Let us have a look at the piecemeal and confused approach that the government has adopted. Even in the last few days, just before we were supposed to debate this bill, we have seen an announcement that the implementation of the bill is to be delayed for three months&mdash;something that the opposition and the aged care sector have been calling for&mdash;but three months is far too short a time to unravel the mess this government has created.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, we have had the final and belated revelation of one of the bill's key measures: the amount of subsidy to be paid to nursing homes for taking those who cannot pay an entry fee, an amount described by the Uniting Church as `an insult to our elderly and a slap in the face for charitable service providers' and by the Catholic Church as `a cruel joke'. These comments should be noted by all those opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the consultative group responsible for funding details still discussing&mdash;I am here debating this bill in the House and we still have people having discussions with the departments&mdash;the descriptors to be used to assess nursing home residents. Until these are provided, it is impossible for nursing homes to use the new classification instrument or to have any idea about how their finances will look under the government's new system. They have no way of knowing whether or not they will be better or worse off, and here we are debating the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have once again had the cancellation of training workshops at the last moment. This is an extremely important issue because those who work in nursing homes have to be able to understand how they are to put this new system in place, how they are to assess residents and how they are to know who will 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be employed in nursing homes. Labor's aged care strategy was accompanied by almost a year of intensive training by teams of trainers. Without proper training of nursing home staff, there will be total chaos when this bill is implemented&mdash;and that too is the view of the nursing home sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had the minister blame in media releases the Senate for obstructing the bill. As people can see, we are actually debating this bill in the House of Representatives today. So I cannot quite see how it has anything to do with obstruction in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an answer to a question in the House last week, the Minister for Family Services made much of the so-called crisis in aged care, claiming that the government had to act and act now. It might be suggested that this minister has a bit of a predilection for detecting the odd crisis in her portfolio, and of course it is a fairly standard tactic for beating up support for measures which the minister has failed to sell through rational explanation and debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In child care, for example, she has also recently discovered a crisis: increases in child-care fees. Instead of recognising they are the result of her budget cuts last year, she accuses private child&hyphen;care providers of overcharging parents by millions of dollars. Regardless of whether there is any truth to her accusation, what is her urgent response to this `crisis', as she calls it? The minister is going to wait for the report of a committee that will report in the year 2000. Some crisis!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She and the Prime Minister have been up to their misleading ways again this week. The minister claimed yesterday that the Labor Party offered only $3 per nursing home resident to carry out capital upgrades. I hope she will be better briefed before she comes in to respond to this second reading debate. For the record it must be stated that, firstly, Labor spent more than a billion dollars in the last 10 years on nursing home and hostel upgrades and new buildings. Secondly, let us just look at the facts in relation to this $3 that is being talked about. In the 1995-96 budget Labor proposed a $7 top&hyphen;up on top of the $8 per resident capital grant for any new or rebuilt nursing homes&mdash;a total of $15. So you can 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4828"> forget the $3 that she is talking about as far as that is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let us see where the $3 comes in. For nursing homes that were spending $20,000 or more on capital upgrades, Labor offered a $3 top&hyphen;up on top of the $8 per patient capital grant&mdash;a total of $11. The minister said on radio this morning, `This was going to be available only if people spent $20,000.' That is exactly right. This was supposed to be an incentive to get people to upgrade their nursing homes. That was the whole point. This government is basically saying to nursing homes, `You can raise accommodation bonds, then you don't have to spend it on upgrades. There's nothing in the legislation that requires you to do so.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government cites a crisis caused by the physical decline of aged care facilities, mainly nursing homes. It is true that in the Gregory report there was an identification of the need to spend considerably more money to bring nursing homes up to an acceptable standard. But I repeat: Labor spent over $1 billion on nursing homes and hostels in the 10 years to 1994 and had allocated $245 million in its budget forward estimates&mdash;money for direct capital upgrade of nursing home stock that of course fell victim to the cuts of Treasurer Costello in the Howard government's first budget. So, rather than retaining Labor's allocation for capital upgrading of nursing homes, the Howard government has different plans&mdash;plans more in keeping with its view of the world. To meet these capital needs the Howard government proposes a move to a user&hyphen;pays system. That is its system. That is the system that it wants to put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at what the bill actually proposes. Firstly, there is an up-front entry fee, an accommodation bond, supposedly to pay for capital upgrades. Secondly, there is a new daily fee for nursing homes and hostels to replace part of the recurrent subsidy previously paid by government. Thirdly, there is the granting of a power to the minister to transfer responsibility for aged care to the states without any reference to the parliament. Fourthly, there is no longer any decent accountability in this bill for the funds provided as recurrent subsidies or for capital. There is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> no requirement that the money raised from entry fees will be used to upgrade nursing homes. There is no requirement that subsidies paid for the care of residents will guarantee that nurses will be employed in nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fifthly, the payment of the daily subsidy for people without assets, termed `concessional residents' in this bill, to compensate nursing homes for the fact that these people cannot pay up-front fees is only $5 a day. Sixthly, there is no hostel subsidy for those residents on the lowest classification level. Lastly, there is the amalgamation of nursing homes and hostels into a single system of aged care institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are Labor's significant problems with this bill? Let us have a look at the entry fee, or accommodation bond. The bill requires all future nursing home residents to pay an entry fee subject to an assets test. There is no upper limit to the size of the entry fee. The only requirement is that a person be left with $22,500 in assets. For many people the annual interest on $22,500, around $4 a day on current interest rates, will be all they have to pay for the many extras required by nursing home residents&mdash;things like toiletries, fruit, stamps and phone calls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether a person has to pay an entry fee will be determined by an assets test that includes the family home as an asset. Only those who share their home with a spouse or a person who has been a carer for more than five years and who is a full pensioner will not have to sell. Ninety per cent of people who go to a nursing home live alone before they need to go into that home. Most people have only one significant asset: their home. Most people will have no option. They will have to sell their home to get a nursing home bed. The minister has guaranteed that no-one will be forced to sell their home. Everybody on this side of this parliament will be keeping her to that promise. The money collected from these bonds must be held in trust by the nursing home and the proprietors get to keep the interest and an annual draw down of $2,600 for five years&mdash;a total of $13,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But of critical importance is the fact that the entry fee has to be paid up-front. That 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4829"> means people who need a nursing home bed and are living alone will have to find, according to the nursing homes, around $88,000 to get that bed. That is the price nursing homes are now saying will be the norm. Professor Gregory, the author of the Gregory report into the structure of nursing home funding, totally rejected entry fees as a means of raising the capital necessary for upgrades. After careful evaluation of entry fees as an option for capital raising, he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sheer size of entry contributions and the impact on a client's life of having to agree to sell assets to receive care would be a considerable barrier to entry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In short, he felt:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . allowing entry contributions seems too harsh a measure.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Prime Minister does not agree. He thinks he knows better. He believes and has said in the parliament that his government's plan to make people sell their homes to get nursing home care is `the repayment of a debt'. Prime Minister, on behalf of all of those who have written or spoken to me about this issue, I will let you know what they think. The people who have raised families, paid their taxes and battled the Depression and the Second World War feel that the debt obligation runs the other way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has claimed that people need not necessarily sell their homes; they could rent them out and use the rent to pay the bond in periodic payments. This will not be an option for the vast majority of people because if you are a pensioner and the only asset you have is your home and you rent it out, you will be receiving income so you will lose your pension and be subjected to a new daily fee. It is a false option that this minister has put before the elderly community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also considerable doubt as to whether the system of up-front entry fees will actually raise the money necessary for capital upgrades. The Department of Health and Family Services estimates that entry fees will raise $130 million a year, but not until the year 2000&hyphen;2001. In each of the three years the amounts raised for capital for nursing homes will be considerably less than would have been provided under Labor. In 1997-98 the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> department estimates that only $26.1 million will be raised; in 1998-99, $72.3 million; in 1999-2000, $102.3 million&mdash;considerably less than the average provided by Labor over the 10 years 1984 to 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A catch-22 also seems to exist in the bill. Only certified homes will be able to be charged an entry fee but, to get certification, homes will have to have a minimum standard of buildings and services, so will not be able to get the upgrades they need to get the capital required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill introduces a new daily fee. At the moment all residents pay 87.5 per cent of their pension. Now residents will pay 85 per cent of the pension and there will be an extra daily fee of 25c in the dollar for those who have income above the pension-free area, up to a maximum of $60 a day. Nursing home residents who have to pay this new income tested fee will have effective marginal tax rates of almost 100 per cent. This measure will impact on the 35 per cent of residents who are part pensioners or self-funded retirees. All residents will be income tested by the Department of Social Security. Nursing home owners will have to collect the fee, effectively becoming tax collectors for this government and the recurrent care subsidies they get from the government will be reduced by whatever they collect in fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of this daily fee will see divisions arise in nursing homes. Those who pay the extra fees will demand extra and better care. This is a recipe for two classes of care in our nursing homes. It is further evidence of the government's muddle. The Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association, which represents a large number of private nursing homes, yesterday advised the government that delays in applying the DSS means testing of new nursing home residents will mean that all new entrants will be invoiced for two months at the maximum rate of $63.30 per day. The association warns the government that this `will result in a negative political backlash for the government'&mdash;an understatement, I would suggest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many other issues. Given the time, I will quickly move to the other signifi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4830"> cant concern we have with this bill, which is the limit of the subsidy for concessional residents to just $5. The total inadequacy of this subsidy will inevitably result in a two-tiered system of aged care, with good access and care for those who can afford to pay an entry fee and poor access and care for those who cannot. This low level of subsidy is one of the two main factors that will lead to a two-tiered system. The other factor is the up-front entry fee accommodation bonds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The $5 a day is ridiculously low because it has to be compared with what a nursing home will get from a resident who pays $88,000 in an accommodation bond. That is effectively the same as $20 a day&mdash;four times what this government is offering for a concessional resident. Nursing homes have made it clear already to the government that they will not be able to provide the same level of or access to care for all residents. For the representatives of older Australians, this figure of $5 a day has critically defined this government's total disregard for older Australians. I am sure the strength of their feelings has brought considerable discomfort to members opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A final unpalatable point about this $5 a day subsidy, which the minister does not draw attention to, is that this is not coming from new money, from extra capital money from the government; it is coming from the pool of funds allocated for the care of nursing home residents. So it will actually reduce the money that is available for care. By contrast, Labor's capital funding was targeted, and targeted to those in need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We face a serious number of changes to the aged care system in Australia. Like the churches and other aged care groups, Labor believes that the bill is discriminatory and ill-prepared and, like the churches, we believe that it must not pass through this parliament. For all these reasons we oppose this bill and will move a series of amendments both in this House and in the Senate to make this bill a fair bill, to make sure that we do not have a two-tiered system and to make sure that access to nursing homes is entirely on the basis of a person's health care needs&mdash;not on the basis of how much money they have.</PARA>

I was interested to see the motion for the suspension of standing orders in so far as it refers to a number of points in the Aged Care Bill 1997, on which basis the member was saying that the matter should be deferred.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SK6">Mr TONY SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and I will have more to say about that shortly. Her second point is agreed specific prudential arrangements for safeguarding residents' up&hyphen;front entry fees. That is how strong her argument was for suspension of standing orders, a question of trust funds. That is how high she rates that. That matter can be attended to very simply, as the member knows. We have trust accounts that operate&mdash;solicitors' trust funds, prudential arrangements&mdash;which are quite simple to arrange, yet that was the major point that was raised by the member for Jagajaga.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third point talks about residential subsidy classification, instrument and arrangements for training staff in use. Is that really the major thrust of the opposition's argument about these measures? Then we get into the fourth point which talks a lot about matters in relation to establishing an independent body to monitor various things. That is how significant the matters are that are raised by the honourable member to defer these particular measures. Then we go to the fifth point, which is, again, some mumbo jumbo about accountability of the use of funds, and so forth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It really is absolute rhetoric without substance. The only point that raises any substance at all is the first point, on which the government and the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) have said they are prepared to continue talking with those relevant groups. It must be remembered that the government is already subsidising&mdash;on top of that $5&mdash;at $100 a day which the govern ment 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4831"> pays for people to live in residential aged care facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important then to splice what was said in that motion to suspend standing orders with what the honourable member said along the way. In particular, she spoke a lot about real increased expenditure between 1984 and 1994. She made passing reference to Professor Gregory and it was perhaps just as well that she did. I am going to remind her what Professor Gregory said about what all that spending had not in fact done and had not achieved. In May 1994 Professor Gregory estimated that upgrading nursing homes to an appropriate standard would cost as much as $520 million. He attributed the problem directly to the nursing home funding system which was introduced by the Labor government in 1987. The Gregory report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The lack of incentive to maintain good quality nursing home stock is a result of the funding system, under which nursing homes receive a set amount for each resident, based on resident frailty, which is the same regardless of the age and condition of the building.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A further evaluation study of 150 nursing homes produced some alarming findings, including that 75 per cent of homes needed fixing or rebuilding to meet Australian design standards, 70 per cent of homes needed fixing or rebuilding to meet the Commonwealth outcomes standards, 13 per cent did not meet fire authority standards and 39 per cent of residents were in rooms with four or more beds. Most honourable members who have had the misfortune to visit some of those run&hyphen;down nursing homes and see the appalling conditions in which older people find themselves would realise that all of the overblown rhetoric about the real increase in spending in the 10 years is seen for what it is&mdash;just overblown rhetoric.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I pose one other matter. It was said by the honourable member that really the figure is $88,000. Let me pose this question: is the opposition saying that Australian taxpayers should put money into the pockets of the beneficiaries of those old people when they pass away? Is that what the opposition is saying? No answer.</PARA>

That is what they are really saying, rather than the reasonable position of the Australian taxpayer, that is, a system of user pays.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn now to the bill itself. The reforms that were announced in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget will take effect from 1 July this year. They will align nursing home and hostel systems. The measures include a single resident classification scale which determines the level of subsidy for each person, relaxation of previous detailed acquittal requirements for nursing homes, income testing of residential care benefits, adoption of refundable resident entry contributions across all residential care and creation of an aged care standards agency. These measures have to be seen in the context of a very significant ageing population. The aged care program aims to provide care at a benchmark of 100 aged care places per 1,000 persons aged 70&hyphen;plus in my region of Dickson and also in the region of the adjoining electorate of Longman for which the honourable Mr Mal Brough is the member. That particular program is designed to amount to 86 places per 1,000 persons aged 70, which is slightly under the national average of 93 places per 1,000 persons aged 70&hyphen;plus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently on behalf of the minister I opened the Inverpine Retirement Village, which is a 52&hyphen;place hostel in the area of Murrumba Downs. Forty places have been built and construction is about to start on another 12 places. There will be a 12&hyphen; place special care unit. Inverpine Retirement Village also includes 32 self-contained units funded solely by the RSL War Veterans' Homes Ltd. There are a number other such places in my electorate for older people, such as the Maranatha Retirement Village at Kallangur, the Pine Woods Hostel at Lawnton, Albany Gardens Nursing Home at Albany Creek, Forest Place Retirement Village at Albany Creek, Keperra Sanctuary Retirement Village at Keperra, Madonna Village Nursing Home at Mitchel

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The eyes were closed for the period between 1984 to 1994, because in actual fact we need a $520 million injection to improve the facilities in those homes. In 1971 there were a million Australians aged 65 and over. Now there are two million. By 2031 there will be five million in  this group. In Queensland about seven per cent of the population is aged over 65, and I am well aware of this trend in my electorate. It is interesting also to mention these figures: from across OECD countries the ratio of people aged over 65 to those in the work force is 19 to 100. By the year 2030, that ratio in Australia is expected to be 33 to 100. That is an alarming statistic, and it is important for all members to address that statistic. While it is not addressed we are going to have a continuing run-down in the nursing home system in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is not about the government imposing a $26,000 entry contribution. The proposition is essentially no different from that of pre&hyphen;nursing homes. Those in their own homes have provided an investment. Their return is shelter and comfort. They pay their rates, electricity and other outgoings, including maintenance to the dwelling. Once they leave their own home, they require shelter and generally a far more intensive system of care. If you move from one house to another, generally you sell your house and buy another house. That is all that is happening here under this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is not imposing a $26,000 entry  contribution. Existing nursing home residents are not required to make entry contributions. Entry contributions are negotiated between the proprietor and the resident. As to the comment which rolls beautifully off 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the tongue of the member for Jagajaga about there being no upper limit in the fee, obviously it is market determined. That is the simple answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Entry contributions are not compulsory. Full pensioners who have not owned their own homes in the past two years are not required to pay entry contributions. The government receives no portion of funds raised by entry contributions. Not all nursing homes are eligible to charge entry contributions. To be eligible to charge, facilities will be required to reach a prescribed government standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The maximum amount deducted from residents' entry contributions has been mentioned many times as being $2,600 per year for five years, to a total of $13,000. The balance is held on account of residents and is refunded if they vacate the nursing home or is paid into the resident's estate. As to the size of the entry contribution, the resident must always be left with assets of at least 250 per cent of pension, some $22,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Residents are not required to pay entry contributions as an up-front fee. There is six months before any contribution is payable. Residents who remain in care for less than six months are exempted from entry contributions. Individual nursing homes will determine their policy on whether to charge such contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a person goes to a nursing home and pays a capital contribution as a lump sum to the provider, that remains on trust until the resident leaves. A similar system in hostels had been operating under the previous government for some years. Obviously, the contributions are protected and will be protected by a proper trust system, a prudential system, if the proprietor becomes insolvent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People on low incomes will be protected. They will not have to pay an entry fee if they cannot afford it. The government has to pay and will pay a higher level of recurrent subsidy to nursing homes to encourage them to accept financially disadvantaged people as residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governments will ensure that pensioner couples whose only asset is their home do not have to sell it when one of those persons 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4833"> enters a nursing home. There is no requirement for anyone to sell their home. The tactics of scaring old people in  relation to this matter are really to be deplored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose and direction of the legislation is that the changes will bring about a future regime of quality nursing home care, because of the very nature of the growing population. I say again and again that those statistics are quite alarming when we look at the fact that we are going to have those incredible increases by 2041 when one in three Australians will be over age 65. It is something that cannot be ignored in this debate. That is the whole basis for many of these changes. There will be safe, appropriate and comfortable accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In trying to read between the lines of what the honourable member opposite said in her speech, there seems to be some sort of suggestion that the government wants to somehow frighten people out of going into nursing home care. Is the opposition suggesting that the government wants to lose many, many votes by adopting a measure that is anathema to older people? It really beggars logic to suggest such a thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The user pays system will bring a better standard of living in institutions that have been run down. I have already referred to the comments of Professor Gregory in his report in 1994. It is important to remember that the situation did not occur in the last 12 months: it has been occurring over a number of years. While that is a regrettable problem we do, as a government, undertake responsibility to fix it. That is what is behind the legislation. The objectives of the legislation are to provide a funding injection to upgrade nursing home capital stock. That is important. It will ensure that those who can afford to do contribute and it will correct subsidy inequities between nursing home and hostel residents to protect the financially disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In so far as fees and charges are concerned, full pensioners will not be required to pay one cent over the $26.05 that they currently pay. There is no income test on full&hyphen;rate pensioners. The first $49 per week of non&hyphen;pension income is exempt from the nursing home income test. People on part pensions, which amount to 25 per cent of residents, and those 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on private incomes, which amount to 10 per cent of residents, will be asked to make a modest contribution. The maximum that can be charged is an additional $34 a day but to reach this a person would need a private income of $61,000 per annum. So for a non&hyphen;pensioner with a $500 per week income the daily increase will be from $26.05 a day to $42.15 per day. There will be a cap of $60 per day on the maximum amount that the nursing home or hostel resident can pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It can be seen that those measures are reasonable in terms of the current climate of a blow&hyphen;out in the cost and a blow&hyphen;out in the aging of the population, which have to be addressed in some way. The way that is being proposed by the member for Jagajaga is to spend more and more money and put money in the pockets of the beneficiaries of people who pass away. But the attitude of the government is to make sure that the user pays and that those who happen to be in this sort of care get the best care available. The legislation provides a framework and a direction for one of the most important policy areas the country has to face; that is, the aging population and the capacity of the Australian economy to deal with this significant issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, the measures will upgrade accommodation and ensure better living conditions. They will progress the philosophy so neglected in the past of ensuring that those who can afford to pay do pay and that those who cannot afford to will be provided with a decent home in their later years. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

With respect, that is an outrageous proposition and one which will do nothing whatsoever to relieve the fear and concern that so many senior members of our community have and should not have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dickson indicated, at the commencement of his speech, that the notice of motion moved earlier by the shadow minister seeking a deferral of the bill, was without foundation. Let us leave aside the shadow minister's comments but let us consider the representations from the Aged Services Association of NSW &amp; ACT Inc. They say, in a letter dated 3 June 1997:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government's intention to debate the new legislation in the Lower House in the absence of subordinate legislation and without knowing whether the model can be viable means that there can be no informed debate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They quite properly say that for there to be an informed debate the minister needs to reveal:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . details on the new prudential arrangements, the guidelines on the new classification scale, the cost of funding the new accreditation process, and how she will honour her commitment to review the effectiveness of the reform process.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I will be paying attention to this debate and I will be curious to see how many government members can properly inform the House and the Australian people of those matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course prudential arrangements are vitally important. There are obviously going to be significant differences between those which are acceptable to the charitable sector and those which are acceptable to the private sector. For instance, will it mean that the charitable sector&mdash;the non&hyphen;profit sector&mdash;is going to have to subsidise the profit sector? The member for Dickson knows the consequences and blow&hyphen;outs caused by defaulting contributors to a prudential scheme from the experience of the Law Society scheme, where the prudential insurance requirements are really quite exorbitant as a result of the amount of money which has gone astray. Will 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the charitable sector have to compensate the private sector for that money when, regrettably and inevitably, some of it goes astray?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister indicated her concerns about the absence of auditing requirements and the complete absence of detail as to the quality of care which will be provided in nursing homes&mdash;in particular, whether qualified nurses will be required to be engaged in those homes. Further, the minister has not got given any details at all about what the transitional arrangements are going to be for nursing homes which have currently either received or applied for funding grants under parts VAB and VAC of the National Health Act. A number have already made commitments and a number have already prepared their forward budgets, anticipating that existing capital grants will be paid and that contracts they have made&mdash;often with builders&mdash;will be able to be fulfilled. Are those contracts going to be frustrated because of this legislation? The minister has not considered that, and those transitional arrangements are of vital concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dickson quite openly and frankly said that this is part of the new regime, part of the government's new policy of user pays&mdash;the user paying according to what has been determined by market forces, not what has been determined as a result of the needs of our citizens. That is entirely consistent with the National Commission of Audit report which recommended greater reliance on user charging and recommended not only entry fees but also exit fees. It remains to be seen whether that is somewhere in the government's armoury for a later date.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JK6">Mr McCLELLAND</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The other point it recommended was the complete devolution to the states of responsibility in respect of nursing homes. As a result of the government's obsession with contracting the role of the federal government, one wonders how far away that may be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is dishonest of members on the other side of the House to use the hostel situation as an appropriate example for nursing homes to follow. The situation in respect of hostels is quite different. When someone enters a hostel 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4835"> it is a voluntary arrangement; they can negotiate, shop around and compare the service they are going to receive. As the Gregory report indicated, some 60 per cent of nursing home entries are straight out of hospital, frequently straight after an acute illness such as a stroke or some other form of debilitating disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As the shadow minister indicated, 90 per cent of those people who are admitted live on their own, and the assumption that those chronically ill who live on their own have the capacity to go and negotiate one of these entry fees or bonds is nonsensical. They are at the most frail, most vulnerable stage of their life. Before they can get the care they require, they are being compelled to sit down to negotiate an entry fee with businesspeople who are, quite frequently, pretty hard&hyphen;nosed. It will not happen. They are going to be victims of the whole process. To say that they have the opportunity of fairly negotiating the so&hyphen;called fair market price is fanciful in the extreme. It will not happen, and it is unfair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I paid particular attention to the member for Dickson's comments&mdash;and indeed accusations&mdash;that the Labor Party was favouring a situation where the money which will be taken out of senior citizens' accounts&mdash;and in many cases their homes&mdash;will not be passed on to their beneficiaries. In reality, what that statement amounts to is favouring what this in actuality is: a death duty. But it is a death duty that strikes only the chronically ill, the frail aged and the demented. It is not an across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board death duty, even if that was to be advanced by the government as an appropriate taxation measure. It is one which discriminates against, hits and strikes the chronically ill and the frail. That is, with respect, a really condemning feature of the government's position in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's assumption that they are going to raise money for sufficient capital works is flawed. The best evidence indicates that at least 50&hyphen;60 per cent of people will not be able to afford the nursing home entry bond.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="LEE" NAMEID="MG4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr Lee</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Market forces!</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JK6">Mr McCLELLAND</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That will be determined by market forces. The experts say it will be close to $88,000 for anything closely 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> resembling quality nursing home care. At least 50&hyphen;60 per cent of senior citizens will not be able to afford that, and they will be competing for and negotiating for the 27 per cent of beds which the private homes are required to keep for those who are unable to meet the entry bond.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is unquestionably a bill which favours the haves and not the have&hyphen;nots. The $5 a day payment for the disadvantaged is an affront. It compares to $19 a day which the nursing homes will achieve from the drawdown of the entry bond. In other words, there is a $14 difference. In addition, the wealthy nursing homes receive the benefit of interest from the capital bond which is paid into their account. As the Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association Ltd said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government's announced funding rates for residential aged care seem likely to foster a two tiered system of aged care in Australia. The problem arises because of the Government's completely inadequate supplementary funding for concessional residents who are unable to afford to pay an accommodation bond.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Similarly, the Australian Catholic Health Care Association said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a shortfall of $14 . . . on accommodation for financially disadvantaged people . . . is totally inadequate. The difference will see these people in multi&hyphen;bed rooms in buildings that will reflect the disparity in funding.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So we have a situation where the wealthy private institutions are in demand and, according to market forces, can demand the top dollar, which is predicted to be about $88,000, compared to the charitable organisations, which quite frequently take up to 90 per cent of their residents from disadvantaged groups. You are looking at a situation where nursing homes, for 90 per cent of those patients, will receive $5; whereas the wealthy private sector will receive, for some 73 per cent of their patients, $19 a day from the drawdown plus the interest that they are earning from the entry bond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government's logic is correct and the methodology behind this bill is to provide capital funding for nursing homes, why has the government not struck a figure of $13,000, which is obtained by multiplying $2,600 per year, being the drawdown, over 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4836"> the five-year period that those drawdowns are required? Why hasn't the government frankly said, `This is our reasoning. We will require there to be a $13,000 contribution to capital assistance'? It has not because it is providing a windfall gain for private nursing homes which can benefit from the interest that they are earning from these massive amounts of money that are going to be paid into their accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One wonders whether this whole mechanism has behind it a categorising intention whereby those who have the funds are able to jump the queue and get into the good nursing homes and those who do not have the funds are simply left in those multi&hyphen;bed substandard accommodations which, as members of parliament, we have no doubt all entered into. The Executive Director of the Uniting Ministry with the Ageing, Mr Les McDonald, said that the $5 contribution is really a poison chalice and that it is going to result in the charitable nursing homes being second rate, despite their best intentions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue which is of concern to me, as a result of the member for Dickson's speech, is the government's obsession with picking scapegoats. Senior citizens are being chosen as scapegoats for our health costs, which it is argued are going to fall on younger people. Regrettably, that is something which, if not already, is going to lead to intergenerational conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are looking at a situation where younger people are not honouring the achievements of senior citizens&mdash;what they have achieved through their daily work and what they have achieved in fighting to represent our country in wars. Rather, there is an obsession with looking at senior citizens as a burden. John McCallum, in a recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, analysed this phenomena. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the arrival of the Howard Government in Canberra, the ageing of the Australian population is being more generally argued to make unsustainable demands on the health and social security systems.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I will not go through his arguments, but I suggest to any member that it is worth reading. He shows that, while health care certainly is required by senior citizens, usually it is not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> required until the last year, possibly two years, of their lives. Suggesting that people over 65 are a burden is a gross misrepresentation of the actuality. As John McCallum said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is high time we got the story straight. If there is an intent to change health and welfare in Australia it should be argued on its own merits and not attributed to a fictional crisis of ageing.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is very much what this bill is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned earlier that I have received in my office to date some 4,000 signatures, and I understand I have in excess of another 1,000 signatures, on a petition opposing the government's legislation. It is causing real concern in the community. The government has not done anything to address those concerns. The lack of detail in the bill does nothing. The advice that whether or not someone is going to be compelled to sell their home is to be sorted out by virtue of market forces does nothing for confidence. From my point of view, it actually generates fear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has a really hot political issue on its hands that it is not addressing and which the minister has not appreciated. It is going to do absolutely nothing to increase the quality of aged care. The crux of, and falling back on, the old statement that Labor did nothing is false. Labor spent more than $1 billion over the past decade of its period of office on aged care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What nursing homes will get out of these provisions from the government is considerably less than that. As the shadow minister indicated, in the 1995-96 budget the Labor government introduced a $7 top&hyphen;up in addition to the existing $8 per resident capital grant for any new or rebuilt nursing home, which was a total of $15. That $15 applied across the board to all nursing homes and compares to $5 for the charitable institutions as against $19 for the private institutions, in addition to the interest and the clear profit that the more affluent private institutions will be able to receive as a result of the windfall gained through the use of the interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has fundamentally changed the way in which we have administered aged care. It has in the past been administered on the basis of need. It is now going to be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4837"> administered on the basis that quality care is to fall to those who can afford it. It is regrettable that aged care has become like buying a pair of shoes or, indeed, engaging a lawyer&mdash;that is, those who can afford to, get it; those who cannot, do not. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a riveting speech from the member for Barton (Mr McClelland), and he is a member of the Labor Party! I remember a time when the Labor Party believed that we should help the poor and the wealthy should pay their own way, but the new Labor Party does not believe that any more.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new Labor Party want their system where the wealthy travel at the expense of the poor, where the people who can afford to pay for their own care are subsidised by the taxpayer out there on $30,000 with three children, paying a mortgage and struggling to make ends meet. That is who is paying for nursing home care for the wealthy at the present. This is the system that new Labor endorses. Old Labor would not have endorsed that system, except old Labor actually put this into place, didn't they? They put in a system where the wealthy were subsidised by the poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, under old Labor's system, which is supported by new Labor, we could have a wealthy widow with $2 million and earning $140,000 a year. If she goes into a nursing home, what does she pay? She pays approximately $180 per week. What do the taxpayers subsidise her? It is approximately $480 a week, yet she has $2 million and is earning $140,000 a year. When she dies, who gets the $2 million? It is not the poor old taxpayer who has been paying the accommodation of this wealthy widow. No, her relatives get it. They say, `Thank you very much' and, as they drive away in their Mercedes, they wave to that poor old taxpayer out there in his 10-year-old car and say, `Hi, we're doing very well, thank you. We just got $2 million. Thank you very much for the $480 a week you have been contributing to granny's care for the last 10 years because, boy, does that make our life so much better now.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the system that old Labor has that new Labor supports. You do not want the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wealthy to pay. You want everyone out there on the same level so the wealthy can come in and say, `Good,' and take advantage. That is what you stand for. That is what the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) stands for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) said he was suffering relevance deprivation syndrome. It is not only him; it is the whole Labor Party because you guys no longer know what you stand for. After 13 years in government, you have thrown away every principle that you ever held as a party. You are out there in the wilderness right now saying, `What is it we believe in? Find us a policy.' But you cannot find yourself a policy because you no longer have a philosophy. So what do you do? You attack because the only thing left for you to say is, `We know what we'll make our policies: whatever the government does, we will say it's wrong and that way we will look relevant.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, I have to tell you, you do not look relevant. You just look like a lot of negative, carping no&hyphen;hopers. Go away, get yourself a philosophy and then come back into this House. When you come back, have a look at this legislation, which has brought some sense into the aged care industry, and argue then because, when you know what you stand for, you might be able to look at this legislation and say, `Good, it has done some things that old Labor should have done and that new Labor approves of. It has made people who can afford it pay for it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the member for Jagajaga call it? She called it a tax. She said that making people pay who could afford to pay was a tax. Could the people opposite, the member for Barton or the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), who I believe will be following me in this debate, explain to me what a tax is? I always thought a tax was something the government put on you as a sort of added impost to help run the country. When you paid for a service you actually received; that was not a tax, that was what you were paying for. When I pay rent, or when anybody else pays rent, that is not a tax; it is rent, for heaven's sake. So do not call it a tax. It is not a tax. It is simply asking people to pay who 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4838"> can afford to pay. The people who cannot afford it will not be paying.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Get yourselves a philosophy. Get yourselves some policies so you can stand on something and be consistent. Come into this House with something you believe in and pick out what is good in legislation. Then people out there might start to listen to you when you pick out the negatives, because then they will not say, `Oh God, it's just those Labor people again. They criticise everything.' They will say, `They said that was good and that was good, so maybe when they pick out this little bit they could be right.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment, you are so busy knocking everything that people out there are not listening.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Jagajaga came in here and quoted her own report, saying what a great system Labor had, what a fantastic system 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Labor had. Let us have a look at what the Gregory report said about Labor's fantastic system. It said that 70 per cent of nursing homes needed upgrading. Good system! It said that 39 per cent of residents were in rooms with four or more beds. Mr Deputy Speaker, is that the sort of nursing home system you want in your country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What else did the Gregory report find? Small or insufficient bathrooms and toilets, lack of lever taps and shower seats, small rooms, inadequate ramps, lack of wheelchair access, multi-storey homes without lifts&mdash;the same multi-storey homes without lifts that the member for Barton referred to and admitted were existing under his government's policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report also found there were insufficient fire standards, toilets not large enough for walking frames or wheelchairs, too few toilets and inadequate heating and cooling&mdash;cold in winter and hot in summer. This is old Labor's system of nursing homes, the system that new Labor wants to keep. The report also found rooms with no external windows, and inadequate kitchen and laundry facilities. I especially like this one. The member for Newcastle might like to answer this one and tell me if the nursing homes in his area have this: dirty laundry and food delivered through the same chutes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That report gives us a really great picture of nursing homes under the Labor government that the member for Jagajaga was so keen to support&mdash;getting out her quotes to praise Labor from fellow travellers and also choosing some quotes to condemn the government. But, of course, this is a game we can all play. I owe these quotes to the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith), who would have liked to get them in his own speech but unfortunately could not, so I have the fortunate chance of quoting them for him. The first quote comes from the National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of an entry contribution for those that are able to pay such a contribution will overcome the matters long outstanding regarding the need to address the urgent capital upgrading of nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is exactly what we have been saying&mdash;that nursing homes under old Labor, nursing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4839"> homes that new Labor want to perpetuate, were in a terrible state. That is why this government has introduced accommodation bonds, the accommodation bonds that the member for Jagajaga has continually criticised. She almost says that the accommodation bonds this government has brought in are the work of the devil&mdash;the same accommodation bonds that the hostels have introduced under Labor. What else does the member for Jagajaga say? She says that&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="LEE" NAMEID="MG4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr Lee</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Don't you like her?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CU4">Mrs GALLUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is of no interest whether I like the member for Jagajaga or not, but I wish she would do her job properly. It would be a great asset to this parliament if the member for Jagajaga would do her job properly. That would get better legislation out there to the people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were talking about the accommodation bonds and how they have been introduced under Labor. We have the member for Jagajaga going around saying, `Isn't this terrible? People might have to sell their homes.' Well, what is so terrible about that? If I move from where I live now and I go into different accommodation, I sell my home. It is what we do when we move on. So what is so terrible about somebody selling their home to go into a nursing home?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Guess what? This is what people had to do under Labor's policy. Under Labor's policy, if you were a pensioner and you moved into a nursing home, do you know what happened? Your home was assessed as an asset for the purposes of the pension. So what happened then? Your pension dropped, you did not have any money to live on or to pay that 87.5 per cent of the pension for that accommodation. So what did you do? You sold your house. Under Labor, you were forced to sell your house when you went into a nursing home, yet it is Labor that is coming out and saying, `This is terrible. Under accommodation bonds they may have to sell their own homes.' It is exactly the same thing they had to do under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nobody will have to sell their home if they have a remaining spouse and they will not be required to pay an accommodation bond unless they have more than $20,000 left over. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> What is more, all they will take down out of that accommodation bond is $13,000. What about the people who do not have money for an accommodation bond? There are 27 per cent of places around Australia reserved for people who cannot pay accommodation bonds. That is the guarantee of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation introduces a system that looks after the poorer people and asks the people who have the money to pay for what they can afford. It is a fair system, it is an equitable system and it is a much better system than that which we have at present. Under the present system, how can anybody deal with a CAM and SAM&mdash;that ridiculous system that divided the care, the food and the housekeeping? What a stupid system that was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have got rid of that system and all the bureaucracy that went with it. That bureaucracy meant that the staff in the nursing homes, instead of looking after the residents, had to sit down and fill out forms saying, `I clean resident X's teeth today. I scrubbed for two minutes on the right side and I scrubbed for two minutes on the left side.' That was what they were required to do under the bureaucratic system that Labor had in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer again to the papers that the member for Dickson gave me. I will read another quote, seeing that we are into the game of our quote against your quote. The Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reductions in bureaucratic interference and great funding inflexibility in the residential aged care program should provide aged care consumers over time with a greater choice amongst better aged care facilities and service providers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This legislation should be regarded as something quite revolutionary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister is to be praised for her courage in looking at the system as it was and saying, `This system is bad. Let's start again and make it better.' It is a revolutionary thing to do and a very courageous thing to do. That does not mean that, as time goes by, we will not find some flaws in the detail. That happens any time you try to make things better and you bring about a huge change.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4840">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the hostel owners in my area have some concerns. I hope their concerns will be addressed and that in the end they will be totally happy with this legislation, because that is what we are aiming for. We are aiming to get the best possible legislation for all the people in our community, because the elderly people in our community have served this community all their lives. What they deserve in their declining years is proper appropriate care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They deserve nursing homes where they do not have to lie in beds with four or five other people in the room, some of whom are extremely ill. They deserve to go into homes with facilities other than a cramped corridor with one television. They deserve to go into homes where food and dirty laundry are not delivered in the same chute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what this legislation aims for. It is saying to the people of Australia, `We will take care of you in your old age. If you can afford it, we will ask you to pay, but if you cannot we will not expect you to pay.' At the end of the day, what we will have is a much better system, a much more equitable system that old Labor had that new Labor wants to keep, a much fairer system that old Labor had that new Labor wants to keep and a much simpler system that old Labor had that new Labor wants to keep.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk about old Liberal and new Liberal for a little while. Old Liberal left my electorate with the legacy of a pensioner living on dog food so that he could pay the fees for his wife who was in a nursing home. She had been there for eight years, and every year the fees went up, way above the pension. He was spending $45 to $50 out of his pension to keep her in a nursing home.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FI4">Mr ALLAN MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was old Liberal. I will give a second example. I had a meeting in 1983 with a group of families who had family members in a particular nursing home in my electorate. They came to me to tell me their concerns with the nursing home and its problems. I note that the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) asked a lot of questions but does not wait for the answers. There were a lot of problems with this particular nursing home. These people asked what we were doing about that. As honourable members know, the licensing of nursing homes is a state responsibility. I will come back to that in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">About a fortnight later, the aunt of one of those people who had come to see me to complain about the quality of care in this nursing home had been taken for a shower and had been put in the shower by a young woman who was on work experience. When she turned on the tap, the hot water tap did not work. So she left the old lady sitting on a chair in the shower with the tap turned on but with no water and went to find some help. Before she came back, the hot water came on. That old woman was scalded and died.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a coronial inquest into that case, but the fact is that the young woman cannot be held responsible because she was not a trained employee. She was not a nurse. She was a source of cheap labour. That family had been to me a fortnight earlier complaining about the level of care. That was old Liberal. Old Liberal also put in capital funding for nursing homes. A week or two ago in Newcastle, new Liberal&mdash;from the federal department&mdash;told a group of carers and concerned residents that the federal government was not responsible for licensing and that any concerns about the quality of care would be a state matter, because licensing of nursing homes was a state responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is something in common with old Liberal and new Liberal. They are both now saying that it is a state responsibility. The system of accreditation brought in by the Labor government in an attempt to lift standards had forced standards to rise and the system of controls on costs brought in by the Labor government, which controlled costs and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4841"> set maximum costs, are both being dissolved by new Liberal and new National. But there is one big difference. New Liberal and new National have cut the money. This is not about nursing home care. We have heard all that nonsense and pap about systems and how much better it was. This should be part of appropriations, not aged care, because it is about money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last August the government announced that it was going to save $244 million on capital funding to nursing homes. It also announced that it was going to save $253 million on recurrent funding for nursing homes. In other words, in those two figures alone, there is half a billion dollars worth of savings. Somehow we are being told over here that this is about improving the system and somehow the cutting of those funds will make it better for everybody.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government in this legislation is ripping half a billion dollars out of the aged community and their families. That is what it is about. This is budget stuff. To come in here and say that this is somehow making the system better is palpable nonsense. It is worse than that; it is deceitful, misleading and totally hypocritical. This undermines and guts what has been a fairly decent system in world terms. Given the increase in the last 10 or 15 years of the number of people requiring nursing home care and given the massive increase in dementia that we have suffered as a society, our system has coped better than most.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have not had the granny dumping we have seen in America. On a recent visit to Europe, asking the Europeans, particularly the British, about their aged system, they said they were all looking at ours as one of the models that was much better than theirs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another cut which is also important&mdash;that is, the $70 million to $80 million cut to home and community care. That is very relevant. Home and community care is a system that helps support people living at home, so they actually have choices. Post&hyphen;1982, post the McLeay report, the Labor government introduced a three-tiered system. It was way overdue, but a system driven by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the need for more spending and a system driven by the need for differentiated care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The home and community care negotiations with the states were incredibly complex and it took an awful long time to get all the states to agree to a common system. Even then, there were massive weaknesses in it, partly because of state peculiarities and so on. Since 1984-85 there had been constant difficulties with measuring and monitoring. The parliamentary inquiry that I chaired in the previous parliament, which looked into home and community care, focused on those difficulties and has proposed and recommended a lot of improvements, which, by the way, are all being ignored with the attempt by the current government to devolve all of it to the states. It is not even back to before the old days&mdash;it is back to the prehistoric days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that with these changes to nursing homes what is going to happen and what is happening right now is that the aged in our community will want to stay at home for longer. They are saying to me now, `I don't want that to happen.' We may get granny dumping but we will certainly get granny squatting&mdash;people staying at home because they do not want to go into a nursing home and lose the family home, the home that in so many cases has all their memories. The loss of that is the loss of their life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will get granny squatting and we will be looking for more and more in-home services. This government, which is supposed to be improving, is putting more and more pressure on home and community care by discouraging people from going into nursing homes. This is a clever trick, mind you, because the demand for nursing homes will now drop. People will say, `I don't want to go.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The euthanasia debate has some relevance here. I think all honourable members will know that people are saying, `I will die first.' You know it, Mr Deputy Speaker, and you all know it, because you are all picking it up, which is why you are so hysterical in this debate. It is why we are getting from those opposite the repeating of nonsense and falsehoods, which is so exaggerated.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4842">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The demand for nursing homes will drop simply because people will not want to sell their homes and they will feel that the government does not want them there anyway. The sense of devaluation that this legislation is causing is enormous. Do not underestimate it. It is only just starting. At the same time as you are doing that, you are also cutting home and community care funding by close to $18 million as well. So you are putting more pressure on the home support system and then cutting the money. What kind of improvement is this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the unanimous report in the last parliament we called for more funding for HACC, not less. We called for better integration between the systems, not less. We called for more Commonwealth responsibility, not less. I should also point out that under old Liberal, old National, pre-1983, the provisions for young disabled living in the community were also inadequate. During the period of the previous Labor government we saw a massive shift of young disabled out of institutions and into the community. When I was first elected the number of young people who were required to live in nursing homes because there was nothing else available and the demand for that was much more than it is now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, more important, the de&hyphen;institutionalisation programs meant the Commonwealth put funds into housing for the young disabled. Those funds have now been transferred to the state as part of the Commonwealth&hyphen;state disability agreement, but do not underestimate that shift. A substantial amount of money that was previously available for nursing homes which were housing the young disabled has been transferred to the states, as part of the disability agreement, where the states are now providing accommodation. Mind you, that will all shift as well with this new regime of getting rid of all responsibility. We will see the Commonwealth attempt to move all responsibility to the states, including that for the employment of young people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When this new system of paying an up-front fee was first announced in the last budget&mdash;and the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) talked about it being $26,000&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">my comment at that stage was that that is a joke, a charade, and that has been my comment ever since. It costs between $70,000 and $80,000 to build a nursing home bed. The idea that somehow people can pay for a bed or that it would be viable to have a $26,000 up-front fee deposit was always a falsehood, was always deceitful, was always aimed to mislead&mdash;as was suggesting that it was not really a major problem, that $26,000 was not all that much.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have now heard the figure of $88,000, but I doubt whether it would be that either&mdash;the figure I have always said is between $80,000 and $120,000&mdash;for a couple of reasons. One is that a substantial number of people die within six months of going into a nursing home because in many cases they have been discharged from a hospital after suffering a major stroke, for example, or another major medical episode. A substantial number of people die within a very short time, which means the fees are not applicable. So not only is the problem that a number of people have no money; it is also that a lot of people do not live long enough for a nursing home to be able to recover costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, if you are going to take away the Commonwealth contribution&mdash;that is, the quarter of a billion dollars in capital being ripped out of the system&mdash;as this legislation will do, you will need more than $26,000 up-front, and even more than $88,000. As interest rates go down, the up-front fees go up. Just think through the earning capacity of nursing homes. Firstly, residents have to live for five years for a nursing home to get $13,000, which is the maximum that can be drawn down from the deposit. Only the minority live that long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the interest on the up&hyphen;front fees is the only other source of revenue to build new beds&mdash;in other words, capital funding. So, as interest rates decline, the up-front fees will in fact increase. So for $100,000 we are talking about $4,000 or $5,000 a year in interest, and that is the only money available. So the capital required to put in a bed will be serviced by the deposits of the up-front fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now the government is talking about a compulsory 27 per cent of people not being 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4843"> required to pay up-front fees, but it is offering $5 a day extra. Five dollars times 365 is $1,800 a year. That is the interest on $50,000 at best. Where will the rest come from? That does not service the cost of putting in a new bed, let alone maintaining it. The fact is this will run down our system. This will degrade our nursing homes. Talk to any nursing home proprietor. Talk to anybody who is actually involved in the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the government announced this proposal it gave the impression that access to up-front fees was going to be an extension of the scheme, it was going to be an enhancement, it was going to be an add-on to what was already there. Of course, the nursing home community said, `This is great. We need more money,' and many of us said that we had no philosophical or ideological objection to those who can support themselves doing so in some form. But that was not what was being done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is happening with this legislation is that the government are raising half a billion dollars from these people. That is what this is about: raising half a billion dollars to replace the government withdrawal&mdash;and that is apart from the cuts to HACC, which also requires user charges. And I am sure that many members opposite are now finding that those are not very pleasant and, in many cases, are absolutely and totally impractical. I suggest they read the report from the parliamentary inquiry into user charges to find out what we proposed and see whether it is being done. I can assure them it is not. This is about saving half a billion dollars. If it does not work&mdash;and I am sure it will not because it will not provide the half a billion dollars unless fees are well over $100,000&mdash;then the nursing home stock will actually run down further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem we faced when in government was a substantial expansion in the numbers requiring nursing homes. Our massive investment in hostel care, which, quite frankly, was barely available in 1983, our substantial involvement in funding the HACC system, which was not there in 1983, plus our expansion of nursing homes were still not enough to meet the demand.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Gregory report was correct, because the other part of all that was the shift in levels of expectation and, as I mentioned earlier, the de-institutionalisation program. People were being transferred from hospitals and institutions to nursing homes. They were shifted from the state responsibility to the Commonwealth responsibility. That does not show up in the figures because that was never measured, but we all know it took place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we have here is a recipe for disaster. And why? Because it is not policy driven. It is driven by the budget. It is driven by finding half a billion dollars in savings in what appears to be a large, fat, lucrative area where money can be cut. That is what it is about. What we have heard since then has been an attempt to justify why that cut would occur in this area and not somewhere else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aged of Australia and their families are saying, `Why us?' The idea that somehow it is equivalent to hostel entry fees is absolutely deceptive, misleading and very nasty. People who enter hostels have some choice about their lives. The equivalent of this nursing home up-front fee is not hostels but hospitals. People do not choose to go into hospital. They are admitted on medical grounds, because they are required to. People go into nursing homes because they are required to; there is no choice. This is not a question of choosing one or the other. There is no choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are giving them the choice of a nursing home or death. That is the choice you are giving them, and it is becoming very stark. The more you talk about this being an improvement, the more you will reinforce the devaluation of our aged community and the more they will see themselves as a source of money. They will not give it to you. They will die first. That is what they are thinking and that is what they are saying. We did not create this problem. There is the idea that somehow we created this problem. The fact is that in the last budget you announced a half billion dollar cut to residential aged care support. Once you announced that, you caused a problem. The more you deny it and pretend it is about improving the aged care and residential care systems, the bigger the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4844"> hole you dig and the more you devalue our aged community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a nasty bit of legislation. It is discriminatory and it is vicious. But it is not about social policy or aged care policy; it is about budget policy. It is about a government that is more concerned with dollars than with people. It will lead to a running down of the aged care system, it will lead to granny squatting and it will lead to a massive lack of confidence in our aged care system. We had a system that was one of the world's best. We are heading for a system that will be one of the world's worst.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As those opposite smile, laugh and carry on, the aged of Australia are watching them. They understand. Make no mistake: being old does not make you stupid. These people are not stupid. They know the situation very well. Members opposite should talk to the pensioner organisations and the caring community. They understand this stuff very well. They are very aware of what you are doing. Do not patronise them and do not take them for granted, because they know that this is not about helping them; this is about cutting money out of the budget. The more you say it is about an aged care policy, the more they realise how hypocritical you are.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addressing the Aged Care Bill, I remind the House that health services and aged care are two of the fastest growing federal costs since the mid-1970s. I do not believe there is a person on either side of this House who does not acknowledge the need for major reform to protect the future of the ageing members of our community. The tragedy is that the system this government inherited had not seen effective change for over a decade. The results are clear to see. Nursing homes are in crisis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When this government took a look at the nursing homes throughout the nation, it met with an unpleasant shock. Eleven per cent of our nursing homes do not meet fire standards, 15 per cent of nursing homes do not meet state health standards and 40 per cent of nursing home patients are in four&hyphen;bed or more wards. Recently a Health and Family Services senior officer advised me that, under the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> previous government, the department did not check the physical standards of aged care facilities. This was never part of the standards set and is a most serious failing of the existing system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an imbalance in not just the funding for aged care facilities but also the type of facilities available. The Aged Care Bill is the first step along the path of improving the security and lifestyle of our aged. The Aged Care Bill is a package. It is not a quick fix solution. It creates an environment to generate funds into the nursing home sector. At the same time, it ensures that access to quality care is based on care needs, not on the means to pay. This major reform to aged care abolishes the two&hyphen;tiered aged care system and replaces it with a focus on the type of care needed by residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To ensure all hostel and nursing home residents receive appropriate care, this bill introduced a new funding structure which applies to all residential aged care facilities. The eight different care categories range from low care to high care levels and, in particular, dementia care. This ensures all residents of hostels and nursing homes will have their care needs assessed and met. At the same time, this bill eliminates the significant overlap of care between hostels and nursing homes. This bill also addresses the all but ignored residents who have dementia. This reform means residents needing dementia care will benefit from an increase in funds by over 30 per cent. This government recognised what the previous government ignored: the need for a minimum capital injection of $125 million a year to the nursing home sector. The previous government's aged care proposal was for $12.9 million&mdash;a shortfall of well over $100 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No-one pretends major reform is going to be fast. But this new strategy is a powerful start. The Aged Care Bill is a reform package which will not only allow the nursing home sector to rebuild and offer quality aged care but also eliminate the confusing difference in fees charged by hostels and nursing homes. Under the new system, all residents will pay a standard daily fee based on 85 per cent of the age pension. The income tested fee will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4845"> apply only to income above the pension&hyphen;free area, which still stands at $49 a week above the full pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Due to the inequity of the hostel versus nursing home system, we have seen a gradual decline in the standards of nursing homes. Hostels charge entry contributions. As a result, they have had that extra capital and have been of reasonably good standard. Nursing homes, on the other hand, lived on a hand&hyphen;to&hyphen;mouth existence, and it shows. To address the situation the government has allocated a substantial capital funding program to assist those facilities which need help. Forty million dollars is available over the next four years. It is expected that these funds will be used by nursing homes with a high proportion of concessional residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A major key to this bill is the funding to be injected into the nursing home sector by accommodation bonds. That entry contributions have been a way of life for hostel residents has been accepted by the community. Therefore, I am amazed that the opposition, led by the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin)&mdash;fast becoming known as the shadow minister for scare&mdash;has spent weeks terrorising our mature age citizens with empty threats that this will mean that they will lose their homes. They will not, and neither will a spouse, close family member or long-term carer be expected to leave the family home if one member goes into an aged care facility. This has been declared publicly by the Minister for Family Services ad infinitum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many other provisions in this bill to protect those who pay accommodation bonds, provisions which are rarely touted in the press by the opposition. For instance, people who can afford to pay a bond will not have to pay a lump sum up-front but have several options, including periodic payments. Those who have no assets or income will have a place in an aged care facility. This reform locks nursing homes into setting aside a national average of 27 per cent of beds for concessional residents. Those who cannot care for themselves will be cared for by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This leads me to another one of the opposition's favoured scare tactics&mdash;that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nursing homes are to receive only $5 a day for concessional residents. What the opposition fails to mention is that this is an additional $66 million injection into the nursing home section. The former government had planned to do the same thing but were only coming up with $3. It is also in addition to the existing daily amount received by all aged care facilities for concessional residents. This reform will for the first time in a decade adequately address the capital funding crisis in nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe it is unreasonable for those who have assets to be income tested when they choose to go into an aged care facility. Nor do I believe that the community disagrees with the principle that it is much fairer for people to draw on their savings to pay for their own care rather than expect the taxpayers to do so. The people of Australia are already burdened with the debt of $10 billion that Labor left this government with. This government has no intention of plundering those taxpayers' incomes any further. People are used to selling one home to move on to the next. So why not do so when they choose to move into a nursing home and adopt the special care that goes with that lifestyle?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all have to acknowledge that, while the over 65&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds comprise only 12 per cent of the population, they absorb 33.5 per cent of the health budget&mdash;and that was in 1990. In the next generation, this will reach 50 per cent. This is not unique or unexpected. Only the previous Keating government sought to ignore the needs of the slowly crumbling nursing home system, which has now reached this crisis point. The previous government had the same figures to hand but ignored the fact that our baby boomers are only a decade from retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Demographers can tell us with deadly accuracy that, by the year 2030, 20 per cent of the population will be over 65. The young will have to work doubly hard to support them. To coin the old cliche, two things are certain in life: death and taxes. I will adjust that to say that two things are certain in life: ageing and taxes. I recall vividly a documentary I saw many years ago on the life of eskimos. In that harsh environment, when the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4846"> older members of the family could no longer contribute to its survival, they walked out onto the ice, sat down and died. Fortunately, our environment is not quite so taxing and we still enjoy life to the fullest in our senior years. The senior members of our community are also able to continue to contribute to their families and to the community due to the advances we have in health and care. This government recognises the true value of extended families, of grandparents and great-grandparents and the urgent need to address the ongoing matter of their care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This reform also paves the way for simplicity for providers. In setting the path for a single national rate of subsidy, we will dramatically reduce the red tape and paperwork for the operators of our aged care facilities. In essence, hostels have worked on a single national rate of subsidy and have always had the responsibility for their staffing mix and how they spend their government subsidy. We are doing the same thing in the nursing home sector. They will still be accountable and must adhere to strict standards, but these will certainly be a vast improvement on what we inherited when we took government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In too many cases, residents have had to endure unacceptable living conditions. The opposition will argue that they did put checks and balances into place, but the facts are plain to see. The aged care system we inherited focused on minimum standards of quality control. This will not be the case in the future. Providers who do not meet high standards will be out of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The blame does not lie with the nursing home providers but with the system which did not offer any recognition for providing quality care. Dementia care, for example, was most certainly not properly addressed. This aged care reform addresses the all important issue of special care for those with that special need. Funding for dementia care will increase by over 30 per cent on average, providing much needed support for both dementia specific units and mainstream facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But possibly one of the greatest areas of change has been our reforms in recognising the different and varied needs for people turning to aged care facilities. In creating new 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> classification scales for the different levels of aged care requirements, hostels and nursing homes will be funded accordingly. The system we are introducing is simpler and far less complicated than the old system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Bob Gregory's 1994 report to the former government recommended that $125 million a year needed to be spent to bring nursing home infrastructure costs up to an acceptable level. The former government's response was to allocate $10 million a year. These funds had to be spent on staffing, infrastructure costs and all other ongoing expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aged care system we inherited focused on minimum standards and was a mess of bureaucracy and red tape. Not only was there a minimum standard of quality control&mdash;which some providers have been straddling with only centimetres to spare&mdash;but there was no recognition, as I said, of good quality care. Therefore, there has been no incentive to be the best care provider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That the previous government gave little or no thought to aged care reform is evident in their so-called aged care reform strategy of their last 10 years in government. This revealing document does not even fill one page. In fact, Labor's aged care reform strategy covers just eight short paragraphs with 207 words. They are delivering more words in objecting to this government's major reforms&mdash;reforms which ensure aged care facilities will be accountable to both the government and the families for the levels and quality of care and accommodation they provide. This reform will create the environment for the right care for the right reason, and it cannot be written off in less than a page, as Labor managed to do. I support the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Deputy Speaker, you might not have seen it, but the ACA has issued a press release asking all members of the House&mdash;opposition members and government members&mdash;not to let this legislation through. The ACA is the peak body. Do you know what the press release says?

It is true that when John Howard was the Treasurer the honourable member for Watson chaired a parliamentary committee and delivered a report into this House. I think it has been one of the most important reports that has been tabled by a parliamentary committee. It is certainly something that the honourable member for Watson and other members who served with him on that committee can take a great deal of comfort in. The title of the report was <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In home or at home?</EMPHASIS>  When we won office in 1983, it was this report that laid the Labor Party's foundations for the HACC program. That was the genesis of the HACC program. The idea was that we ought to allow our frail aged in the community to stay in their own homes for the longest possible time. Not only is that commonsense for them and a desirable outcome for them but also it makes good economic sense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our 13 years in office, we had a very structured approach to aged care. We had the HACC program, allowing more of our older Australians to enjoy their own homes, to enjoy their neighbourhoods and have the familiarity of their own surroundings. We had hostel accommodation for the aged. You do not have to have a medical conditions to get into a hostel; it is an issue of choice. When an aged person's frailty was such that they could no longer be supported either in their own home or in a hostel, we had nursing homes. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4848">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Deputy Speaker, I am sure that you fully appreciate the fact that it did not matter how much money you had, if you were assessed by ACAT&mdash;the aged care assistance team&mdash;which comprises medical experts, nurses and social workers, as requiring nursing home care, you were given a place. It did not matter if you had two bob in the bank or more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) has said that we supported millionaires in nursing home accommodation. That may be true. If the legislation needs to be tightened up so that millionaires do not take advantage of that, let's tighten it up. But let's not punish all frail aged Australians because of some millionaires.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We introduced an assets test when we were in government. The present government bitterly criticised us. One of the things that we did was to take millionaires off the pension. But we did say, `Your home is sacrosanct.' We excluded the home from the assets test. But what is this government doing? It is dealing the family home in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government says that, if your spouse is at home or if you have got a carer living with you, you do not have to sell the house. That is true, that is in the legislation, but tell me how you find a nursing home place if you do not sell the house. What do you expect private providers to do if they have the opportunity of getting even more than the $26,000 that you say this premature death tax will be? I think everyone now concedes that it is going to be in the order of $80,000 to $90,000; they undershot the figure by about 300 per cent. If a proprietor can get hold of that sort of money and keep the interest and draw down $2,500 a year as opposed to taking someone who does not own a home or someone who wants to keep the family home, are they going to take the $90,000 or nothing? Left to the marketplace&mdash;competition, operating for profit&mdash;what do you reckon is going to happen? We all know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Notwithstanding this legislation, frail aged Australians who have struggled a lifetime to get a home will be forced to sell their home to get a nursing home place. That is what this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> legislation means. That is what you are asking us to vote for, and we will not. But the government members are going to get up and say how terrific this legislation is, notwithstanding what was said in 1996 by John Howard and what the Minister for Family Services is introducing into this place now. What a lot of hypocrisy. What a lot of flip&hyphen;flopping. What a lot of inconsistency. How cruel this is to our frail aged Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As ACA, the peak organisation, says, there is still a lot of uncertainty. What are the prudential requirements? I know that the Moran corporation is friendly with the Liberal Party, that it employed former Senator Woods as a special adviser and that you are the benefit of this inside information about how private operators operate and what they need and how this can be made more profitable&mdash;I understand that&mdash;but when one of our elderly Australians has actually sold their home and paid this up-front fee how do we guarantee that it will be protected, that it will always be there, even if there has been a degree of fraud or malfeasance? What is the method of protection? What is the method of ensuring that it is properly in trust and always there?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable minister at the table is a former solicitor. Solicitors have trust funds and they are regularly inspected. Notwithstanding that regular inspection, read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS>, read your local paper, and time after time you will find situations where solicitors have improperly used those funds and the solicitor's fidelity fund has got to make up the difference. What is going to happen to the proceeds of an elderly Australian's home&mdash;that $90,000&mdash;when a proprietor skips off maybe not with the proceeds of just one home but with the proceeds of quite a number? That is a huge sum of money. You don't have to have too many residents before you get close to a million dollars. What is going to happen then? We do not get the answers in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the people of Australia really want and what elderly Australians want is to make sure that members of parliament are genuinely concerned about their needs. They do not really like us bickering, but I must say that it is the individual elements of this bill that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4849"> make me so passionate about it. What are we going to do to help them? How can we improve the situation? I am not going to stand up in this parliament and say, `Labor had a perfect system. Nothing could be done to make it better.' Of course there were things that could make it better and they are the elements that we should be discussing. Yes, we do need better nursing homes. Yes, there should be some incentives for proprietors to improve their homes. But I would be grateful if the Minister for Finance would outline to the House the competitive elements in this bill that actually force proprietors, particularly these private providers, to improve the nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the policy speech that John Howard took to the last election, he did not say that he was going to regulate standards. In fact, he promised self&hyphen;regulation. You can drive a horse and buggy through it. There is nothing in this bill that ensures, mandates or requires nursing home proprietors to put this money&mdash;this premature death tax&mdash;into improving the homes. As knowledgeable as the minister at the table, the Minister for Finance, and his department are, they will tell you that private providers can drive a horse and buggy through this legislation because they will be able to utilise this money without improving the nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From time to time governments do need to make significant changes to policy. I am not sure that this is one of those occasions. I think, when you make an intergenerational change like this&mdash;that is, you are getting just one sector of the community to leap into a new system&mdash;you should have a significant transitional period. If this is what you think is so necessary, understand that they need to save and marshall their resources so that they can afford it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point about this legislation is that there is not going to be one extra nursing home bed as a result of it. Not one. The Labor Party, when in government, justified HECS on the basis that we would take the money and provide extra university places. It was very unpopular at the time and it probably caused more angst on our side of politics than anywhere else. We said, `It is a new charge. It is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not full cost recovery, only partial cost recovery. But what we are doing with every dollar we collect is to expand the system.' And we did&mdash;massively so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, that is not happening here. What you are doing is clawing back about half a billion dollars worth of government expenditure. You are putting less into the system than we did. Not only are you asking our aged Australians that they pay&mdash;and pay with their homes&mdash;for this up&hyphen;front so-called accommodation bond, variously estimated at $90,000, but you are not guaranteeing in the legislation that nursing homes will improve. You are not guaranteeing that there will be extra beds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know people on the opposition side are going to be constantly frustrated by listening to government members, as I was when I listened to the honourable member for Griffith&mdash;I wish I could have been spared that but it is part of my responsibility&mdash;because they are going to say ad nauseam, as the minister does, `We may have promised to do a lot of other things and we're sorry we didn't tell you about what we really wanted to do when we went to the last election, but really all this is about is hostel accommodation. Labor had this system where you would pay a fee to the hostel for a place. All we are doing is just translating that from hostels to nursing homes.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me repeat the major point: hostel accommodation is about choice. People could stay at home through the HACC program, which I mentioned earlier. My own mother is in that situation. She is contemplating whether she will continue on at home or whether she will go to a nursing home. It has nothing to do with any medical condition or her state of health; it is an element of choice. But people do not choose to go into nursing homes. They have to be properly assessed. There is a compulsion about nursing homes. It is about time government members, when they are talking about these vulnerable Australians&mdash;our frail aged community who have contributed so much to this country to make it what it is today: a place we, the younger generations, can enjoy&mdash;said with a bit of honesty what it is that they are doing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4850">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, unfortunately, was totally dishonest at the last election. John Howard was totally dishonest in his aged care policy. I have already read it to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, and I am sure you are more familiar with it than I am. There is not a hint in that of these draconian measures or this particular draconian bill. I think our older Australians deserve better than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From time to time the government members have rather viciously attacked our shadow spokesperson, the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin). She has had a tough job having to speak up, as she has consistently, on behalf of our older Australians. I would encourage her to continue to do so. You are putting this draconian legislation through, and probably going to ram it through the Senate at the well, but it is going to put the Labor Party in an awful position when we come back into office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely there are some compassionate members on the government side who will read the press release of the ACA and who will have second thoughts about the impact of this measure on older Australians. Maybe they will not do it in the debate&mdash;I would admire them if they did&mdash;but perhaps they will take to the party room their real concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My electorate is characterised as a young electorate. Compared to other electorates, like that of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, for example, mine has a very small elderly population. But, like my friend the honourable member for Barton (Mr McClelland), I wrote to my constituents about this measure because, as I said, I think this legislation as it impacts on our frail aged is the most draconian bit of legislation that I have witnessed as a federal member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I invited my constituents to sign a petition. We have already lodged several hundred of those petitions, and it is taking us a great deal of time to collate them all. But, overwhelmingly, when people have rung up&mdash;and quite a number of them have&mdash;they have said, `Thanks for bringing all this to our attention. We didn't understand it.' It is not just the frail aged who are concerned. Their relatives are concerned about what the impact is going to be on their aunt, their grandmother or their 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mother. They are horrified. And in my electorate lots of them do not have homes to sell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, this is a measure which is going to make a system of health care for the wealthy&mdash;they will have no trouble accessing it&mdash;but is going to deny the poor and those who have saved for a home their life savings, of which a home is the major part. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to support the Aged Care Bill that is before the House today. The government is not prepared to accept the amendments that will be moved by the opposition. We certainly had an interesting exercise this morning with motions being moved by the opposition to delay the debate and change the focus of the debate on this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that some of the opposition speakers&mdash;the previous speaker, the member for Chifley (Mr Price), included&mdash;have referred to this legislation as a draconian measure. It would be fair to say that people in the community are always a little reticent about change, and what is being proposed is a major change from the way we have been used to doing things in the aged care system and the provision of aged care services in Australia. One of the earlier government speakers mentioned the SAM and CAM systems that have been in place. The former government instigated the Gregory report and did not take much notice of it after they did it. This government has recognised a need to reform the provision of aged care services in a sensible way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker alluded to some of the peak bodies and the comments they have made. I might draw the opposition's attention to a media release that was put out earlier this year by ANECA, the Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association Ltd. In that, the Chief Executive Officer was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall, the new aged care legislation delivers incentives for aged care service providers to strive for continuous improvement in care standards and upgrade accommodation standards.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Isn't providing a better standard of care for the aged what this debate is all about?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4851">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government's policy revolved around provision of beds. There was an announcement recently of more nursing home bed capacity being available for the Great Lakes area in my electorate. A number of different institutions put in submissions to get that allocation of beds. The focus has been on beds whereas the focus should be on the needs of the people in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the other end of my electorate, in the Hastings area, people who have been assessed through the ACAT team there as needing nursing home care outnumber the number of beds available, and so we have the situation where there are 52 people in the Hastings district on the waiting list to get access to nursing home care. Unfortunately, in regional Australia that quite often means that, until such time as beds become available in the local area, those people have to travel to the city to receive nursing home care. That puts an enormous strain on the family and on the people who need the nursing home care themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recognising this, the government has bitten the bullet in introducing the reforms contained within this legislation to try to address the problems in Australia and the increasing demand&mdash;and that is a very important and sobering statistic&mdash;for nursing home accommodation as we look towards taking this country through to the turn of the century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to an article which was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> earlier this year headed up `Nursing home plan is sound'. It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For all the sound and fury emanating from Canberra over the proposed charges for new entrants to nursing homes, the Government's policy is a sensible response to a difficult problem, one that procrastination will only make worse.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Procrastination is what we experienced from the former Labor government. This article went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is greying, with the percentage of population aged over 65 projected to grow from 11.2 per cent in 1991 to more than 19 per cent by the year 2030.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The article went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is much fairer that people be required to draw on their savings to pay for their own care rather than that they expect taxpayers to do so. The "losers" from such an arrangement are, of course, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the potential heirs of nursing home residents. But they have no reason either, to demand that taxpayers continue to subsidise nursing home care merely to protect their inheritance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The article went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But Australians must come to terms with the fact that there is no bottomless well of "government" money. The alternative is taxes to the user&hyphen;pays principle.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This country suffered from that high tax regime for the last 13 years of Labor. The government is taking this opportunity to extend to the nursing home sector what Labor started in the hostels sector of aged care services by way of a user&hyphen;pays system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's record on aged care is not all that exciting when you look at some of the statistics. Under Labor, 11 per cent of nursing homes did not meet fire standards, 15 per cent of nursing homes did not meet state health standards, and 40 per cent of nursing home patients were sharing rooms with four or more patients. The ALP created a two&hyphen;tier aged care system. Hostels, with the changes that the former government introduced, were of a good standard because they charged the entry contributions. The nursing homes became increasingly of a poorer standard because they relied on government funding. Dementia patients were not receiving adequate care and funding. The ALP arrived at the last election with a fairly thin policy in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's reforms aim to provide residents with comfort, dignity and security in their most frail years, give incentives for providers to rebuild and refurbish nursing homes and ensure that access to quality care is based on need, not on means. One of the furphies that has been perpetrated around the community in this debate has arisen from the Labor Party's putting about the proposition that people with lesser means will not have access to quality care. That will not be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the reforms will deliver simplicity for providers, make providers more accountable to residents and families and address the capital funding crisis. That is all based on two elements: firstly, accommodation bonds; secondly, the focus on concessional residents. Concessional residents are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4852"> those people in the community who cannot afford to pay an accommodation bond. They will still have access to nursing home care. A targeted percentage of the community will get access. Nursing homes must allocate a national average of 27 per cent of beds to financially disadvantaged or concessional residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the nursing homes in my electorate will probably have a higher percentage of concessional residents than 27 per cent. The flip side of the government's commitment to pay the concessional residents' supplement of $5 per person per day is that there will be an increase in income for a lot of those establishments that have a higher percentage of concessional residents already in their nursing homes. One of those providers has already contacted me, after reviewing the latest information that we have been sending out to the electorate on the reforms in this area, and indicated that they will have an increase. Remember that Labor offered only $3 per day for capital upgrading only to hostels, not to nursing homes, and so there is that balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an equity issue being addressed with the provision of the concessional residents' supplement to nursing home providers; that is, it is the broader tax paying community who should be assisting in the provision of nursing home care to those people in the community who cannot afford to pay the accommodation bonds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what this supplement is all about. If it was not there, or if it was of a lesser amount, as Labor had proposed, then the burden of providing that nursing home accommodation to concessional residents would fall mainly on the accommodation bond paying residents in that establishment alone, not on the broader tax paying community. With the $5 concessional residents' supplement being paid by the government, it is the broader tax paying community that is shouldering the responsibility of ensuring that concessional residents, those people who cannot afford to pay the accommodation bond, have access to, and the opportunity for, nursing home care when they need it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When they need it is when they have been through the assessment process with ACAT. As I have said, at one end of my electorate 52 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people are on a waiting list to access nursing home care. A lot of those people, because they are in need, will end up spending a period of time in maybe Newcastle or Sydney, a great distance from their loved ones and carers. That is certainly not a satisfactory situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of equitable access for concessional residents is one that has been raised by the opposition and one on which the government has gone to great lengths to get the message out to the broader community. This government wants people to have access to care according to their needs, not their means. That is stated quite clearly in the policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party has been peddling a lot of half&hyphen;truths and untruths about the financially disadvantaged not being protected. This bill contains stronger protection for these older people than Labor's scheme did. These protections are demonstrated by four key facts, which need to be spelt out very clearly in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One, aged care assessment teams will continue to approve people for entry to care based on their need, not their means. Two, people who cannot afford to pay an accommodation bond will not be asked to pay it, and this will not affect their access to care. Three, every nursing home and hostel will have to take a set number of concessional residents. The target will be 27 per cent of nursing home and hostel residents on average nationally. That will vary from one area to another. Financially disadvantaged areas, which is quite often regional Australia, may have a higher percentage of that. Numbers will be set in each region according to local need, and penalties will apply to providers who do not meet these targets. Four, the government will pay an extra supplement of $5 a day for these residents. This means providers will have a financial incentive to care for their residents, and the burden of providing those places will fall on the broader tax paying community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The broader tax paying community acknowledge that the provision of care for those in need and those financially disadvantaged in the community is a responsibility of the taxpayer and that, equally, people who have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4853"> the financial means to contribute to their nursing home care have a responsibility to provide that. That falls on the families of people in need as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been clearly set out that there are going to be protections in the legislation for those who are financially disadvantaged, for those pensioners whose only asset is the home, and the spouse is still living in that home. It is very important that we highlight that fact during this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another interesting element that has arisen, particularly in my community, is the level of the accommodation bonds, and I know that in the ruckus here this morning there was mention of a figure of $88,000. I am not sure where the opposition has picked that figure up from, or whether it is an indicative figure of the replacement cost of a nursing home bed, but obviously there is no set ceiling. One nursing home provider in my area, which is a community based organisation, has indicated that it will not be charging an accommodation bond, which is interesting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other element of that part of the debate is the fact that, although the accommodation bond is paid to the care provider, it is a bond: it is put in trust and will be refunded, less the $2,600 a year over five years, to the person receiving care. So the maximum that is being paid by the resident is $13,000. A lot of people have not come to terms with that and have not understood that because of the misinformation that has been peddled around in that regard. I have gone to great lengths in my electorate to explain that to people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the subject of the accommodation bonds, the guarantee that must be received about the expenditure of those bonds on improving accommodation must be fairly explicit, and the bill is explicit on this point that amounts derived from the bonds must be used for the service. This is clear and transparent. Furthermore, the bill forges a clear link between accommodation bonds and improvements to accommodation. This link is called certification. To charge an accommodation bond, a service needs to meet certain building and care standards. To demonstrate this, all services will be inspected using an instrument that assesses the building in terms 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of safety, security, privacy as well as other key points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the first time, consumers and providers can be confident that a service charging a bond meets appropriate standards. This represents a clear and open benchmark, something that has not existed. The intent is to raise the past standard progressively over time. This means a provider will need to continue investing in their building to make sure he or she can continue to charge bonds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a real improvement over Labor's hostel system. Labor did not stop providers charging accommodation bonds for substandard accommodation. Labor did not specify that bonds must be used for the service. This bill will do that and will do it in a measurable way so that we will ensure those standards are kept to and the benchmarks are adhered to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw the House's attention to some of the comments that were made by the previous speaker with regard to the support that has come from the peak bodies. He alluded to the fact that there was no support. I mentioned an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> and I mentioned a media release that came from the Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I will quote from a media release that has come from the National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals, which is headed `Structural reforms for aged care mean a better deal for all'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The . . . Chief Executive Officer said . . . Some strong measures had to be taken to address the urgent capital upgrading needs of nursing homes in order to ensure the future accommodation of Australia's aged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government in its legislation has provided more than adequate protection for consumers and through user pay systems surrounding the accommodation bond will ensure funds are available for upgrading for the future.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A couple of the peak bodies involved in providing nursing home services in Australia have indicated publicly their support for the reforms. I will finish where I started. Australia, as far as change is concerned, is traditionally a fairly conservative nation. Australians are fairly wary of change. They take their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4854"> time coming to terms with change, understanding change and getting to understand the benefits that will flow. Over time, the Australian people will come to terms with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know this government is proposing a lot of change. We had to after 13 years of a lot of inaction in a number of different areas by Labor both economically and socially. Importantly, this government is focused in this area on providing care based on needs, not means. The financially disadvantaged in our community will certainly have access to the nursing home care that they expect and deserve. We are going to ensure that it will continue into the future on an equitable basis.</PARA></SPEECH>

I rise today to condemn absolutely the government for the introduction of what are no doubt unspecified up-front fees for nursing home patients because this action, coupled with the $577 million in cuts to funding in the 1996 budget, indicates that this government is nothing less than morally bankrupt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is embarking on, in my view, nothing less than a wholesale privatisation of the aged care sector. It has no policy direction in this area. It basically has a `let the market prevail', `let it rip' type attitude. In doing that, it somehow hopes, perhaps forlornly, that the difficult problems it is not prepared to address will somehow be sorted out by a benevolent private sector. For the elderly residents of Isaacs, of course, I hope that the substance and the guts of this aged care bill, being what they are, cause the bill to fall on its face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like briefly to remind the House of the absolutely disastrous situation in which aged care was left the last time the coalition set policy for this sector. In the 26 years of coalition federal government from 1954 to 1983&mdash;of course, those three years of cherished Whitlam government interrupted that period of coalition rule&mdash;the other side of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> House managed to create a system that was nothing less than poorly managed. It was littered with regional inequalities and was badly focused on the provision of nursing beds as opposed to general care issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me briefly offer a summary to the House of the McLeay report into the aged care sector. The report highlighted the poorly coordinated provision of community based aged care services, which everybody knew about but about which the coalition did nothing. One of the issues identified in the McLeay report was the absence of a national organisation representing community care groups. While I do not blame the government for this, it is nevertheless a fact and a key issue detailed in the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue identified in this report was the relative generosity of financial provisions for the construction of nursing homes as compared with community care services. This resulted in an imbalance between community needs and government and private sector provision. The financial disincentive for state governments to involve themselves in the development of community services, which required the state government to match the Commonwealth funding, was a third key factor identified in this McLeay report, which in some way was indeed much too kind to the coalition for its so-called efforts in policy terms in this key policy area. The report should have said that the coalition has never come up with decent policy in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will refer briefly to the joint review of nursing homes and hostels conducted back in 1986. It was more explicit in its criticism than was the McLeay report. The joint review identified a number of issues. Among them were the haphazard nature of program development for aged care services, the excessive concentration on institutional care as opposed to community and home based care, and the failure to develop adequate assessment procedures. The fourth issue identified was the lack of coordination between the various levels of government and the fifth and final key issue that this report identified was the inefficiency of the prevailing funding mechanisms. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4855">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report highlighted that, in 26 years of federal government, the coalition hardly got anything right. This is not just a slight criticism but a comprehensive repudiation of this government's ability to set policy direction and spend money appropriately. This is nothing less than a joke. I know we have the minister telling us that she is now intending to undertake a major reform process in the area. I can envisage the major industry participants wishing for another term of Labor to sort out the mess that this government is in the process of creating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past 29 years, every time there has been a major crisis in aged care services it has required, as in most other policy areas, the introduction of a Labor government to sort the mess out. In extended terms of government, you on that side of the House simply lost the plot in this key policy area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Harking back momentarily to the Whitlam era of 1972 to 1975, at that time Labor had to introduce controls to the expansion of nursing home beds due to what were then massive cost overruns and the over&hyphen;provision of these services as opposed to hostel and home and community care services. The Whitlam government also had to sort out the many regional inequalities and inequities that those opposite had created  prior to the Whitlam government coming to office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Hawke-Keating years similarly, the Labor government had to continue its efforts to redress the imbalance between the provision of nursing home beds and hostel places. The Hawke-Keating government had to act to increase the provision of respite beds in hospitals and in nursing homes. It also had to act to increase the provision of home and community care in broadly general terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It appears that it is always those on this side of the House who historically have had to foot the bill for the incompetence of those opposite&mdash;or, more correctly, the public has had to foot the bill and those on this side of the House when in government have been the ones who have had to implement the necessary change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We assumed control of an industry which could only be said to be characterised by uncontrolled growth and, simultaneously, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> uncontrolled cost. It was also characterised by grossly inefficient regulation. Labor increased spending levels during the term of the Hawke-Keating government from $1.2 billion in 1985-86 to $2.6 billion in the 1993-94 budget for this key policy area. It would be quite easy for me to go on and on listing Labor's achievements in this field, but I will spare the House because I would like to discuss in some greater detail the bill currently before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To date, all this government has done in the field of aged care is to rip money out. A list of what I have called K&hyphen;Mart Costello's cuts includes a cut of $244 million from capital commitments and the removal of $253 million in subsidies from nursing homes for care. This one looks as though it may have some sort of ideological bent in that it will reduce the number of nurses caring for patients. The coalition has also enacted a $72 million saving by introducing user charges for home and community care services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These cuts were reduced in the last budget with the background of the Gregory report, indicating that there was a requirement of capital funding of about $500 million, mainly in the nursing home area. Instead of allocating more funding to the aged care sector, this government in its wisdom decided to remove a further $244 million specifically from capital outlays and introduce a user pays system, as suggested in the National Commission of Audit. This user pays system is obviously poorly directed at meeting the shortfall of 20 per cent in the provision of the home and community care services, as identified in the joint submission by the Australian Health Care Association and others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the growth rate of some 2.7 per cent per year of persons requiring HACC services, those on this side of the House are looking forward to addressing this shortfall of 40 per cent by the time the Australian public repudiates the initiatives of this mean&hyphen;spirited coalition. The coalition's alleged justification for introducing this bill includes a couple of key points. The first is the capital shortage identified above and the expectation that a user pays system will furnish the capital funding that is required. The second is that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4856"> there is some impending prospect of a blow&hyphen;out in the number of persons requiring nursing home beds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is perhaps difficult to understand when the numbers suggest that the number of people requiring assistance will actually decrease. There will be a decline in those numbers over the forthcoming 10 years. These justifications appear to be nothing less than a beat-up with the specific purpose in mind of simply cutting costs. That path is one that has been well trodden on many occasions before by the federal Treasurer (Mr Costello) and his Victorian counterpart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to draw the House's attention to the bill by summarising some of its ill&hyphen;considered measures. The first of those is an uncapped entry fee for nursing homes with an assets test which includes the family home. As the member for Chifley (Mr Price) has pointed out at quite some length, when Labor introduced the assets test, the family home was sacrosanct; the family home was exempt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over 90 per cent of people entering nursing homes are single. Those entering nursing homes will have to dispose of their house and make other very important decisions whilst they are sick. Furthermore, over 60 per cent of those entering nursing homes arrive from acute hospital care service facilities. You really could not pick a more unfair or worse time to ask people to make such important decisions and to undertake negotiations with the management of these nursing home facilities. Perhaps the minister could have some of her former colleagues provide in-house advice to sick and infirm people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another ill&hyphen;considered measure of this bill is the fact that it provides a formula for the entry fee which potentially will result in all persons having sold their house and being left with $22,500 in assets, with the remainder&mdash;whatever that may be&mdash;being placed in a trust fund&mdash;again, as put quite lucidly by the member for Chifley, at the mercy of solicitors and lawyers who are the trustees of these funds, some of whom on a regular basis are proven to be less than honest in their management of such funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These funds have no prudential requirements, as the member for Chifley has pointed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> out. We on this side of the House are expected to trust the same people who appear daily in the newspapers under crime columns having abused the trust that people have placed in them to manage their money honestly. I am sure that the aged, the elderly and the infirm would be even more vulnerable than the majority of Australian society if they placed their money in the hands of unscrupulous solicitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third ill&hyphen;considered measure is the fact that it provides a policy which is supposedly based on the assumption that more capital funds will be available for nursing homes with this up&hyphen;front fee but with no legislative requirement directing nursing homes to spend money in this particular way. This could potentially be as useless as Mr Howard's savings package because there is no net benefit, as the Secretary to the Treasury quite clearly pointed out yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another key issue of concern for those on this side of the House is that of a supposedly reformed sector characterised by the growth of a two-tier health care sector&mdash;one for the rich and one for the poor. Those places which cannot meet certain standards&mdash;that is, those which cater for the poor&mdash;will never receive payments for the capital upgrade so they will remain in a poor state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the shadow minister at the table, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), has pointed out in her contributions to the House earlier this year, some wings will get orange fruit drink but those funded by the more wealthy health care recipients will receive orange juice. This is a catch-22 situation. Obviously this will affect many members of society. Indeed, it will have a negative impact on the church and those other not for profit providers who are at the forefront of delivering aged care facilities to those most in need and to the needy.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am concerned that the scene is set for the development of a two-tiered aged care system, where 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4857"> those that can pay will have access to excellent, modern facilities and those that can't will be housed in increasingly older and inadequate aged care accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Perhaps the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), who is from the same state as Mr Les MacDonald of the Uniting Church, might keep that quote in mind when he makes a contribution to this debate after me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another major issue of concern in this bill is that it has a lack of specified auditing procedures for those involved in providing aged care services. Some of these industry participants are even suggesting a self&hyphen;audit. One can only think of the potential horrors that programs like <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> and others would be able to televise in that regard. It also facilitates an unspecified ratio of paid to concessional beds which will be needed to be provided by each nursing home. So, obviously people from some suburbs will have to search far and wide for a place because of the unknown quota of concessional beds which may have been met in their local area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This heinous and draconian bill also provides a policy based on the ridiculous premise that nursing homes and hostels provide the same service, a misconception that is still perpetrated by many of those opposite. Hostels are for those persons looking for security and a little assistance in a community environment, while nursing homes are clearly for the sick. The minister must think they all look like hotel rooms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is yet another recipe for the coalition to repeat the massive failures it has created so often in the past. It is a government bereft of vision and ideas. It has no direction. Indeed, it is very similar to the voter reaction to Mr Howard which was identified in recent polls by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> magazine. It will not be long before the coalition parties decide to move on these sentiments and ask `K&hyphen;Mart Costello' to fill this massive void.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we return to address these present and future messes&mdash;potentially as soon as the next election&mdash;we intend to follow the same basic principles outlined dishonestly when the minister introduced the bill to the House. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Minister Moylan said on 10 February this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I circulated a statement entitled `Steps to Better Care'. This statement detailed the government's commitment to a new era in the provision of residential aged care in this country, based on dignity, comfort and security for all.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What we would need to return to, after these vandals have had their go, is the reintroduction of dignity, comfort and security of accommodation to the industry. There are many ways, which the shadow minister has outlined, which show how Labor would do this. Those on this side of the House fully support the work that she has done in this area in challenging a minister who has perpetrated nothing less than a scare campaign and misrepresentation of the true facts. I am sure that the petition opposing this bill signed by 5,000 members of the electorate of Barton is reflective of the true views of modern Australia.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is one thing I cannot understand about the Labor Party's attitude in this debate. If the Aged Care Bill 1997 is so bad, so crook and so oppressive for the elderly and the aged around Australia, why don't they just let it go through both houses and let the government reap the whirlwind? Surely that would be a tactic&mdash;providing they make all the claims and the statements they are making now, making sure that they are covered&mdash;to allow this process to go through without change or amendment. I invite the shadow minister at the table, the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), if she is serious, to consider that process. I do believe that it is not really the opinion of the Australian Labor Party that this thing is so bad after all. Otherwise, why would they be delaying, why would they be attempting to put back this program, using all the techniques of the House and the Senate to delay and set aside legislation that is sorely needed for the care of the aged in Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do believe that their real purpose, their real goal, is not one that they are saying. I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, are a very direct and straightforward individual, that you would not be ensnared by a process such as this. But I do have to bring to the attention of the House the fact that I consider the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4858"> comments and the tactics of the Australian Labor Party to be dishonourable. They are not honest in the way in which they are handling this process. The shadow minister at the table and the opposition are using the processes of the House of Representatives and the Senate to have the introduction of sorely needed change delayed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If they were serious in their criticisms, if their concerns were justified and could be demonstrated and if all of the statements of the shadow minister, to every `i' and to every `t', proved to be exact, then this is an horrific piece of legislation that no person of conscience or compassion would want to foist on the aged people of Australia. Therefore, they would want the Australian people to see how heartless and thoughtless the current government is by allowing the process to be enacted. But no, that is not what they are doing. They are not allowing this process to be enacted. They are not allowing these processes that they consider heartless and poorly thought through to be implemented. They want to make changes. They want to debate for hours. They want to have the Senate go on for years with committees and all sorts of processes to get, they say, this legislation right. I do not believe that is the true motive of the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The true motive of the Australian Labor Party is a backward looking process, and because of the shadow minister's previous professional involvement with the formulation of policy, she just wants to stick with the past. She does not want to make changes. She wants to say, `What we did 18 months ago was right. What we did five years ago was right. What we did 10 years ago was right.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the opposition were a constructive organisation in its approach to this process, it would adopt constructive approaches. But its approaches are not constructive; they are destructive and delaying. So I put it to the House that the opposition, instead of wishing to see changes made for the benefit of the elderly, are using the elderly, in this instance, as a political ploy, a political process, to suit the goals and objectives of the Australian Labor Party. The complaints; the statements of how poorly constructed this legislation is; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what terrible consequences it is going to have for people who are in aged care facilities or who are contemplating going into aged care facilities: surely these must be exaggerations. Otherwise, there would be a more constructive approach to getting results from the Australian Labor Party or, on the other hand, they would let this legislation through and let the government reap the whirlwind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to turn to the details of the legislation because the government has adopted a twofold approach. I think it is imaginative and suits the needs of the elderly. It is a process which provides certainty and funding. The two streams of activity are these: first of all, to bring a consistency and simplicity of administration and provision of care without confusion and without difficulty to aged people, that is, by consolidating the nursing home accommodation with hostel accommodation and letting the assessment of a person's condition or needs be the sole criterion about what sort of accommodation they would receive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Labor Party, when they came to office, had, they said, too many nursing homes. So what they did was to not fund nursing homes but to fund hostels. That became difficult and expensive so they then allowed hostels to extend the services that they offered and the hostels of today are more like the nursing homes of 10 and 15 years go because they are allowed to do practically anything. The average length of stay in a nursing home today is six months. They are places where people really just spend the last few months of their lives. They are not there in the true sense as nursing homes, but because of the pressure of funding on the Labor Party governments over a period of time, they had to reclassify the activities of both nursing homes and hostels. So nursing homes became places where people were almost at the point of terminal illness&mdash;very ill indeed. One would hope that many people come out of those nursing homes well, or at least better, but the fact is that on average they stay there six months before they die.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hostels have become places where the treatment and care that are given are similar to that formerly given in nursing homes. Care 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4859"> for the aged was a budget driven process; the decisions that were made were purely budget driven. That was the way the Labor Party administered care for the aged; that was the result of their activities. Paul Keating was all about budget driven stuff&mdash;pulling the levers, getting the figures, having glasses overflow and bringing home the bacon. That was the Keating style of operation. We are changing that. We are saying that you cannot be an artificial division. Let us identify the problems that people have and give them the appropriate treatment at the appropriate level. What could be more sensible and better geared to the needs of individuals than that? That is the first step.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second step&mdash;the second stream of activity&mdash;is to assist people where possible to deal with their increasing age in their own home. Here I refer to what I think is a far&hyphen;sighted program: community aged care packages. People are provided with what amounts to hostel care by professionals in their own homes. This is going beyond what is considered domiciliary nursing care&mdash;somebody blowing in for an hour or two to help somebody wash or to administer their medicine or to have the community aid person come round and clean their house. It goes beyond that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The assistance provided through the community aged care packages will be personal care, shopping, housework, laundry, lawn mowing, after hours emergency care, meal preparation, monitoring medications, bill paying, minor maintenance, assistance with transport to medical appointments, and respite care. Those are some of the services that CACPs are offering. That is a comprehensive service akin to being in a motel. It is akin to being in a hostel, yet you have the backup of professional services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The largest single provider of CACPs happens to be in my electorate: the Anglican Retirement Villages. They are a fine organisation. It is all very well for members of the Australian Labor Party to say, `The poor won't get looked after,' and ask, `What are your prudential arrangements and how do you coordinate the whole thing?' They are obviously completely unaware of how things 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> actually work. The Baptist homes trust&mdash;I know my friend at the table, the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), would have some familiarity with them, and with the Anglican Retirement Villages&mdash;are a most ethical and caring organisation. They are working on the internal cross&hyphen;subsidy process right now. People who can afford it pay; those who cannot do not pay. That is exactly what the caring institutions of Australia are running now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is going to be formalised by the process that the government is using. It can easily be done, and those compassionate and worthwhile organisations are doing it, so why should everybody not do it? That is what the minister is saying. Why should the wealthy not pay for the poor in their retirement&mdash;what is strange about that?&mdash;and in the provision of capital input, the buildings and backup services that are needed. Until a person reaches that point, the process is there of providing community aged care right in their home in an extended way which more resembles the hostels of old. People are more comfortable staying in their own home. They would prefer, right to the ultimate, to stay in their own home. They would prefer to have the freedom of inviting their families at weekends. They would prefer the independence that being in their own home offers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many instances in the past under Labor policies services were not provided in the home. People were forced to sell their homes because they could not get the care they needed in their own home. We are saying, `We will give you care in your own home. We will help you have a dignified aged lifestyle. We will assist you with all the backup services we can offer by professionals.' If they have the assets, people can then sell their house and move in when it is necessary. If not, they will receive exactly the same care as they do now in the Baptist retirement trust or the Anglican Retirement Villages&mdash;the same care a wealthy person receives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot tell the differences between people. Nobody knows the differences in people's means unless they themselves disclose it to their neighbours in those villages. Nobody knows because the quality of service 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4860"> is identical no matter what your means, no matter what your background. The shadow minister advances spurious arguments about second&hyphen;class care. For goodness sake! What scurrilous arguments you bring into this place. You do not do your profession any credit by the way in which you are arguing this matter. You ought to be ashamed of the way in which you are scaring old people with nonsense arguments. A true professional in this circumstance would want to get results, not score political points. You are scoring political points and causing delays and problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have given you the solution: be constructive and get results or let the stuff go through and let the government cop the whirlwind. But you will not do either of those things, you would rather play politics. I am arguing now that you stop playing politics and let us get on with the business of providing decent care for aged people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at what the government is proposing here: proper care, professionally supported, in a person's home for as long as they are able to remain there. And then professional assessment of what care they need before they move into the next stage of their aged care&mdash;whether it be hostel accommodation or nursing home accommodation. The type of care will be different and will suit the person's need, but an assessment will be made of the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a stunt in the parliament this morning with the shadow minister trying to run a whole lot of arguments about where all the shortfalls were. I just want to reiterate some of the facts in the way in which this new aged care process is going to operate. Firstly, aged care assessment teams will continue to approve people for care based on their needs, not on their means. That is not and never has been in the government's mind; in fact, it is not in operation in most decently run nursing or retirement facilities at the moment throughout Australia. Certainly the largest ones do not operate on the basis of means but on the basis of needs. That is the tradition. You denigrate the tradition of nursing and hostel care in Australia by your arguments. Secondly, people who cannot afford to pay an accommodation bond will 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not be asked to pay it and that will not affect their access to care either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those are the statements; that is the way it works now, and that is the way it is going to work in the future. But the fact of the matter is that those who do have resources are going to help pay for those who do not. That is where the extra money is going to come from which you could not find as a government, and which the Gregory report so clearly enunciated. You went down the gurgler. The whole thing declined. You had a maintenance attitude in this area. Just maintain the system. Do not worry about any improvements or changes. Let it gradually degenerate with the processes of age to the buildings, facilities and services being provided. There has been no imagination or new policies whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every nursing home and hostel will have to take a set number of concessional residents. There is protection built in by the legislation. If they want to take more, they can. If they will not take the number required, they will be asked or required to. So there is protection there. If the bottom line is the formula, then the legislation does provide for that. It underscores and sets in concrete, if you like, the already existing practice. The government has made the commitment that if there is an extra cost it will pay it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is broadly what is necessary. What about the prudential requirements of these organisations holding bond funds and those sorts of things? If people are required to make a payment going in, and when they come out there is a release of that bond, what is the protection going to be for their funds? That is a legitimate and proper question. But it is not the spurious stuff that the shadow minister has come up with that there is no protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, there will be a requirement on facilities to maintain a certain level of assets in liquid form so the bonds can be repaid to residents as they leave. What is unusual about that? Every insurance company does it. Every bank does it. They have got to be able to pay you when you go in and ask for your money. The operators of nursing homes or retirement villages will be asked to do the same thing; they will be required to do the same thing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4861">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An industry fund will be established&mdash;that is right across Australia&mdash;which, with providers, will pay a portion of the bonds. This fund will act as a lender of last resort should a provider's own liquidity prove to be insufficient. So there is a second protection. And, as a third protection, there will be insurance as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you have got a prudential fund established by the provider, then you have got an industry&hyphen;wide fund which will be a lender of last resort, and behind that insurance again. I do not think the Reserve Bank has got so much protection. I certainly know that building societies in Australia do not. I know that credit unions do not. You are looking at something that is safer than credit unions, safer than banks, and you are going to be critical of that process. Get real! You are just exaggerating and causing concern when there should not be concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the classification of people? Maybe that is a worry&mdash;what sort of service will I get? Anybody who is currently in either a nursing home or a hostel will continue with the classification they have now. That will not change. Over a period of 12 months, assessments will be made. Is the care appropriate to your needs? What person or family would not want an elderly individual in a nursing home or a hostel assessed on that basis? Is the care appropriate to your needs? Not to your means but to your needs. Is the care adequate is the real question being asked, and if it is not it will be changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is there anything wrong with us saying, `Let's check to see how people are being cared for'? For goodness sake, they did it with child care throughout Australia. There was an incredible mess created by the previous government on the accreditation process. The thought police were out about what could be put into preschools and what could not be put into preschools. Yet are they objecting to this process? Do they not like it or do they think it is strange? I think this is a weird process that we are into here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just call once more on the Australian Labor Party to reassess their stance. If you think this is so objectionable, let it go through and let the government wear the pain. Other 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wise, change your attitudes and let us have some constructive activity from you.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If there is one piece of recent legislation that has caused concern, debate and apprehension in the community, it is this Aged Care Bill. This bill attempts to bring about the most significant changes to aged care in Australia since the Menzies government introduced the first federal act of parliament relating to aged care in 1954&mdash;namely, the Aged Persons Homes Act. That act was not so much about aged care as about provision of adequate housing for service men and women after the Second World War and the Korean War.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will, if passed unamended, allow for nursing home and hostel programs to be rolled together into a single funded residential aged model; provision of a single assessment model to replace the two systems that exist currently in nursing home and hostel programs; extension of the existing entry contribution system in hostels to accommodation bonds for all high&hyphen;dependency residential care; certification and accreditation of facilities, services and providers with the minimum acceptable benchmark being gradually increased as the existing infrastructure improves; standardisation of basic fee levels; extension of the user-pays principles; and increased quality of residential aged care services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the words of the Churches of Christ homes, `These times are exciting for aged care.' `Each of the aims of the bill,' according to the organisation, `is an admirable, desirable and achievable aim.' So why the concern? While the aims of this bill are admirable, its promotion and explanation to the elderly of Australia have been poorly handled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is in no way a criticism of the minister, who I have found to be caring and receptive to any views that I have put forward on the peculiar issues pertaining to the legislation that impact on my electorate&mdash;including, as it does, large regional centres with an established nursing home component and very small rural communities with nursing home type accommodation in local hospitals. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4862">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with dissemination of information began with the draft bill, a copy of which I received the week submissions were due and which was hardly of much use to local aged care assessment teams or service providers. The same unfortunately occurred with the exposure draft of the principles, received after the due date for comments. Is it too much to expect every member to receive copies of such contentious bills and accompanying information at a reasonable time before such submissions are due? Perhaps the peak bodies advising the aged care industry are at fault here by keeping the input and feedback at an executive level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister was alert to the concerns about a feeling of being left out by sections of the community, particularly in rural areas, and accepted late submissions from my electorate. For that I am grateful because it led to the retention of the dementia care counselling service funded by this government and administered by the Alzheimers Association. That kind of special attention to particular concerns has been greatly appreciated in the Orange district especially, where a bureaucratic pen stroke was set to eliminate a service that was, and is, a lifeline for carers of dementia loved ones in their own homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I am greatly disturbed that in the case of the Yeoval Hospital multipurpose centre, which is a model for aged care for smaller communities, I believe, the department has yet to get back to the board of that organisation, despite assurances to me in early April that they would explain the path Yeoval Hospital should take in both its hostel and nursing home care. The hospital has decided unilaterally&mdash;because the reforms will not be implemented until October&mdash;to go down the path of certification for its hostel but to seek recurrent funding for its nursing home, having entered into an agreement, and to wait for more details, which are yet to be provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the sort of lack of communication that is upsetting for the carers of the rural aged. So when I support this bill in the comments I make today, I certainly do not support the manner in which it has been explained to some key sections of the community. It is a pity there has been confusion 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> out there in the community because I believe the system the government has come up with is far simpler and fairer than aged care policies in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard the minister detail the results of the survey into the aged care sector&mdash;the homes that did not meet fire standards or health standards and the number of patients in a four&hyphen;bed, or more, ward. We have read the figures of experts who believe it will take $125 million a year to bring the nursing home infrastructure up to standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition is quick to accuse the former government of overseeing minimum standards and having no long&hyphen;term plan, especially for dementia care. But, as I said, had I not raised the threatened loss of dementia counsellors in rural areas&mdash;through the concerns of the Orange Aged Care Assessment Team and the carers out there&mdash;then this service would have gone and it would have been inadequately mainstreamed through home and community care, which is ill&hyphen;equipped for such a service. Overall, though, I believe the bill and its principles do provide a new and a fair system of aged care, and that is why I support these reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware that many in the community might question why they have to pay an accommodation bond when others do not. Unless we access funds from the assets of those who can afford to pay, then we will not have a nursing home system of any quality. I have been concerned at the failure of the government to apply a cap on accommodation bonds. The minister's office tells me that there is no need, that the hostel system has worked without a bond quite satisfactorily and that there will be little need for hostels or nursing homes to charge more than a reasonable amount, given the prudential arrangements in place. The minister argues that if a capping mechanism was put in place, then bonds could be higher than necessary and any interest obtained from bonds must be used exclusively for aged care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it is interesting to note that, under section 57&hyphen;12 of the bill, there is an additional subsection to the original draft&mdash;namely, subsection (1), clause (c)&mdash;which allows for the minister to invoke the user rights princi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4863"> ple, which sets an upper limit on bonds. So there is the mechanism to control bonds at the minister's discretion, according to the interpretation of the bill that I have received. That is good and it is essential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be a national average of 27 per cent of places for concessional clients&mdash;those on pensions. I am told this could mean as low as five per cent concessional places in some areas and as high as 85 per cent in others. I wonder how the department will keep track of that average of 27 per cent. It sounds a bit like the promise to cut small business red tape by 50 per cent. How do we know when we get there?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There must always be a way of providing for those in the community who need aged care, but who can afford to contribute only a small amount or nothing at all. I will be watching this aspect closely as these changes take effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, there has been much concern in the community about the perceived need for nursing home clients to sell their homes to afford an accommodation bond. I believe there has been an unnecessary degree of fear generated by this perception, and I draw the attention of the House to the fact that, currently, 55 per cent of hostel or nursing home occupants choose to sell their family home to enter such a facility. If there is a spouse, partner or, indeed, a carer living in the home, it does not come under the assets test because it remains the family home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I found the comments recently of one correspondent in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> a little hard to swallow. She claimed that many part&hyphen;pensioners, particularly those in Sydney or Melbourne, will complain when they discover the forced sale of their homes makes them ineligible for a pension. Mr Deputy Speaker, if someone is so lucky as to capitalise on the property boom in Sydney, especially at the moment, and pays an accommodation bond in a hostel or nursing home and is still up to $700,000 better off in the bank, why in heaven's name should they qualify for the pension anyway? It is not an inheritance tax; it is payment for accommodation and care at an advanced age.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From what I have studied in this bill, the explanatory notes, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> and elsewhere, I think this legislation is fair and will achieve the goals pointed out by the Churches of Christ Homes to which I alluded earlier in my comments. I am reassured by comments from the minister that full pensioners will pay no more than the basic pensioner contribution, and will pay no further income tested charge. The base fee for part&hyphen;pensioners of $21.10 plus 25c in every dollar of income over $49 a week appears fair enough. However, aged care providers have contacted me with concerns that concessional residents will have only about $1,500 left to spend annually after statutory fees and charges are met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This $1,500 has to provide for clothing, toiletries, telephones, stamps, entertainment, newspapers, hairdressing&mdash;perhaps cigarettes and alcohol&mdash;gifts, pharmaceuticals and, maybe, taxis. It does not seem a lot for those expenses, does it? Perhaps it does need revisiting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, this Aged Care Bill and its complementary bills comprise one of the most complex pieces of legislation to enter this parliament in many years. I therefore am not prepared to commit myself totally to it, because it may very well have a series of landmines that I have not picked up. But we need to restructure aged care in this country, given the statistics staring us in the face of the size of the aged sector in 20 to 30 years time. We could go a long way to funding much of that aged care infrastructure if we were to properly reform our tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer (Mr Costello) said in the House yesterday that the cash economy was of grave concern&mdash;or words to that effect. Forgone taxes in this country are a national budgetary disgrace. We cannot afford vital public infrastructure funds for hospitals, nursing homes, highways and railways because we are being ripped off and the poor old PAYE bunny is footing the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the absence of any political will to reform the tax system and obtain the revenue we should be recovering, we must make a start on rebuilding and improving the aged care accommodation in this country, and lifting the standards of care. It will cost a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4864"> huge amount of dollars. This users pay system is the only way we can go at the moment, so short is the lead time before the aged population crisis hits us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, there are real concerns out there still, some of which I have outlined. I would like to add a few more&mdash;these from a hostel accommodation provider in Blayney. The board of the Lee Hostel tells me the program for implementation is unrealistic, that current funding agreements with the Commonwealth are effectively ended because it is now either a recurrent funding or accommodation bond arrangement. They and the Yeoval multipurpose hospital service I earlier referred to believe the recurrent funding arrangement they have entered into with the government should remain intact and still allow them to access the accommodation bonds option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice there are provisions for rural and remote services to ensure people stay in their communities for continuous care from hostel to nursing home. I applaud that. I think there remains a high degree of misunderstanding, though, in some rural areas and I would urge the department to ensure smaller country towns, in particular, are aware of the recurrent funding option and what their options are in terms of charging accommodation bonds. This also requires an early settlement between the states and Commonwealth on the respective status of nursing home type accommodation in smaller country hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much also has been made of the subsidy of $5 a day per concessional resident, with the opposition suggesting that this alone would be the amount of Commonwealth support for such clients, as far as I can ascertain from the comments. I think I heard the minister's adviser right when he assured me this is not correct. I am concerned that Aged Care Australia believes this concessional resident supplement should be at least $12 a day if the objective of improving buildings and infrastructure is to be met. But I am also persuaded by the figures of the previous administration that show the supplement equivalent was but $3. This came about when the former government allocated $10 million a year on its tiered system standard aggregated mod 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ule&mdash;or $3 a day per resident&mdash;for capital upgrade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new arrangements will provide $5 a day, I am told, in addition to the $100 a day current subsidy. It is an additional supplement that will assist the provider's capital requirements. Nursing homes and hostels which take more than their set number of concessional residents will still receive full funding for them. I hope they are right. As well, Aged Care Australia questions the cost of the accreditation agency yet to be established. Whatever the cost will be, I presume it will be established and will perform the necessary task allotted it under the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides for three types of aged care: residential, community and flexible. I particularly applaud the resources being put into provision of home based care. It seems a sensible restructuring of the industry and the demands for aged care services. I only hope the government and the minister continue to listen to the community in the months leading up to the October start&hyphen;up, which still seems too early. Can I plead also for the government to look at other aged care options out there in the community such as that provided by the Abbeyfield Society. This organisation falls outside the residential, community and flexible care categories of this bill. However, it provides about 25 homes at this stage around Australia, including one in Orange, that offer a sharing, virtually self&hyphen;care accommodation for elderly folk, with a major, almost exclusive, voluntary local committee to run them. They are seeking $175,000 a year to maintain their Melbourne based administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The homes run themselves virtually, free up scarce rental accommodation that the clients may otherwise occupy, but offer a cooperative community based elderly residential facility for pensioners. It is highly cost&hyphen;effective accommodation for our elderly people who are not ready for hostel or nursing home care, but who require companionship and community care if needed. I urge the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) to consider Abbeyfield in her interpretation of flexible aged care under this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, this is a radical change in aged care, there is no doubt. Its consequen 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4865"> tial provisions that amend existing legislation bear testimony to the complexity of the changes. I only hope the government has got it right. I have a gut feeling that it has, but there is much fine tuning and allaying of concerns yet to be done, particularly as we are dealing with one of the two most vulnerable sectors of the community&mdash;the frail aged. With those reservations and cautions, I commend these bills to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in support of the government's Aged Care Bill and commend the initiatives outlined in the bill to the residents of the Lindsay electorate. I would like to reiterate the words of the member for Calare (Mr Andren), a true Independent in this place, who has examined the actions of the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) and the bill and cannot find fault with it but retains some reservations. Those reservations mainly come from the scaremongering by Labor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that I reassure the residents, staff and proprietors of the three hostels and four nursing homes in my electorate who will benefit directly from the measures of this bill. They are: the Emmaus Village Hostel; the Edinglassie Hostel; the Lemongrove Gardens Hostel; the Edinglassie Nursing Home; the Governor Phillip Nursing Home; the Henry Fulton Nursing Home; and the Mountainview Nursing Home. All have a proud tradition and reputation for the delivery of quality care to the aged in the Lindsay electorate. The passage of this bill will provide greater incentive and opportunity to them in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is well known that: our population is ageing&mdash;it is estimated that by the year 2030, 20 per cent of our population will be over 65; the current aged care system is in crisis and does not have the capacity to meet the needs of our ageing population; and Labor's neglect of the nursing home sector was a shameful act that consigned too many people to a life in substandard accommodation with little choice or dignity. This government's aged care policy initiatives are essential to address the failure of Labor's two&hyphen;tiered aged care system&mdash;a system that has seen individuals in nursing homes forced to accept second&hyphen;best accommodation in facilities that have been 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> poorly funded and neglected by 13 years of Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard much of Labor's cynical scaremongering campaign over the past months that has totally focused on promoting misinformation and hollow rhetoric, while deliberately scaring older people in our communities and their families&mdash;especially in the electorate of Lindsay. The shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), has made a number of unsubstantiated comments which have caused the residents of Lindsay considerable concern. She attacks our policies but has no vision of her own to put forward alternatives which will take us into the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's policy in relation to aged care is simply promising to deliver more of the same poor quality, substandard nursing home accommodation. Members of the previous Labor government sat on their hands and ignored the recommendation of Professor Gregory's 1995 report that found that `$124 million per annum needs to be spent to bring nursing home infrastructure up to an acceptable level'. Labor abdicated their responsibility to care for the aged into the future in 1995, they ignored aged care policy during the 1996 federal election campaign and now they offer no vision for the future&mdash;simply grannie bashing and scaremongering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be remembered that the shadow minister, who now professes great concern for the welfare of our older citizens, was a consultant to the previous Labor minister, who failed his responsibility to the aged. The member for Jagajaga was clearly a failure then and her lack of policy alternatives now indicates that nothing has changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout the development of this reform package, the government has undertaken a thorough assessment of the needs of the aged in our community. Some aspects of the existing hostel system have been retained and extended into the nursing home sector. The extension of the hostel entry contribution system to nursing homes will provide a much needed source of capital to overcome, for the first time in 10 years, the capital crisis that has bedevilled the nursing home sector. This will be achieved by asking those in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4866"> community who have the ability to do so to make a greater contribution to the cost of their care than they do at present. There is no need for a cap. To reassure the member for Calare, if some senior residents who can afford it wish to have gold taps, shagpile carpets and hot and cold running jacuzzis, then they are welcome to it and will pay the costs accordingly. But any home that caters to that style of accommodation must still maintain the concessional resident quota. I think competition&mdash;a great principle of our party and a great Liberal tradition&mdash;can prove that exactly what has happened in the hostel system will occur again in the homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important at this point to counter Labor's irresponsible scaremongering, suggesting that individuals will be forced to sell their homes to access an aged care facility. Nothing could be further from the truth. This has been reiterated by the minister and nearly every member speaking on this side of the House. Protections have been included for individuals with dependent children, carers and spouses. No&hyphen;one will be forced to sell the family home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is very important to make that point: no&hyphen;one will be forced to sell the family home. Once no&hyphen;one is living in it, then it is hardly a family home. It can be rented; it becomes an asset and gets included in anyone's eligibility for a pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pensioners whose income test is less than the pension, plus the free amount of $49, will not be affected by the income test arrangements. Accommodation bonds will not be on all residents and prudential arrangements have been made to protect any bonds that are put up. It is important to reassure people that those bonds we are talking about are not astronomical fees. We are talking about $2,600 a year to a maximum of five years. After that no further draw&hyphen;downs from the bonds can be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of accommodation bonds and income testing will ensure that the government's resources are focused to the advantage of the less fortunate in our communities. They will be complemented by the concessional resident quota and a concessional resident subsidy. Under the new accom 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> modation bond arrangements, the maximum contribution any individual will be required to pay is $13,000 over five years. It must be emphasised that the government will still make a substantial contribution to the costs of aged care of all people. Our ageing population will rightly demand higher quality nursing home accommodation and care than has been available in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill that we are debating today provides the foundation for the delivery of an aged care service that provides access to care based on needs, not means&mdash;a standard that meets or exceeds world's best practice. For the first time, the level of government subsidy for each resident will be based on the degree of frailty of the resident according to their needs and not according to the style of accommodation occupied, their means. The measures in this bill not only provide a plan for the future but deliver immediate benefits to the 130,000 residents in hostels and nursing homes today. The new residents classification scale will allow more choice and flexibility for older people. It also ensures that funding follows an individual's care needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's commitment to ageing is enhanced by the measures in this bill. It will enable people to stay in familiar surroundings near their family and friends as their care needs change. It is an integrated package that will deliver quality care for our older citizens and provide dignity and choice for all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new Aged Care Bill will complement other programs that support older people in our communities, such as the home and community care and the community aged care packages. In implementing this package, the government has ensured that those in our community with limited means will be assured access to aged care services. The 27 per cent concessional resident quota and the concessional resident subsidy will ensure adequate support to maintain aged care facilities in less affluent areas. This is an important consideration in the Lindsay electorate, which is a traditional lower to middle income family area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the 1996 election campaign, the government promised increased assistance for people with dementia. This bill delivers on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4867"> that commitment. For the first time, mental frailty will gain better recognition and weighting in the residential classification scale. This scale provides funding on the basis of needs arising from incapacities. Under Labor, only physical incapacities were subsidised. Under the new funding system contained in this bill, subsidies for mental incapacity will be substantially increased. In some instances, residents in aged care establishments who require intensive supervision because of dementia will receive funding increases in excess of 30 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's new aged care reforms will simplify procedures for providers and provide incentives for the investment in world&hyphen;class aged care facilities. Importantly, red tape and bureaucracy will be slashed. Unwieldy bureaucracy will be replaced by peer driven review processes that are responsive to the needs of residents, providers and others in the industry and, most importantly, promote the development of leading edge technology and world's best practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members opposite continue to criticise the government's aged care reforms. We make no apologies for moving so quickly to ensure that our elderly people can reside in aged care facilities with dignity, comfort and security. This bill represents the first step of this government's ongoing commitment to ensuring the provision of quality aged care services and facilities to our older citizens. It is interesting to note that the member for Calare has reservations, but he has examined the bill and he sees it as an enormous improvement on previous legislation and previous conditions in the industry. We will continue to improve in this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) has a grasp on her portfolio that shows vision and funding right through to all of the considerations and concepts that could possibly affect our aged population through to the year 2030. I congratulate the minister on presenting a comprehensive and integrated package that addresses Labor's failures and enhances the ability of the aged care sector to meet the challenges of our aged population. The minister came to the portfolio with limited experience in aged care, having 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> previously been the shadow minister for small business. She has shown her aptitude, her enthusiasm and her ability to get around complex procedures in industry in a very short space of time. She has listened to industry. She has responded to what has been required in this area that has been neglected for 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members opposite continue to run significant scare campaigns in this area. They have challenged our government over issues such as the enormous accommodation bonds that they say will be required. Let me assure the residents of Lindsay that this will not be so. There is no limit on what accommodation bonds can be charged. It is purely up to you in terms of the style of accommodation that you seek to access. The industry will provide a vast range of accommodation levels to meet different lifestyles. Our government's commitment to the aged has not wavered at all over the last 14 months. Over the next 14 months leading to the next election&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the next 14 years we will be challenging the leading edge technology in this industry. It is a tremendous challenge that we are all rising to meet. We are urging the industry to build better buildings, to start competing, and that is an important aspect in my electorate of Lindsay where we have a limited number of hostels but a high demand. We have a number of young families who wish to have their parents close by.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frequently, grandparents have to be settled far away from the electorate of Lindsay, which is a brand new electorate. We have got very new housing estates, such as Glenmore Park, Claremont Meadows and Mount Pleasant, which are booming with a number of new families and first home buyers who have had to move to western Sydney because of the dramatic rise in accommodation costs in the inner city. They have left behind parents who have access to aged care hostels in those areas but not in western Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an increasing concern because it also adds to the breakdown between the older generation and the younger generation. When 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4868"> children grow up too far away from their grandparents they tend to have less tolerance for the elderly. The elderly themselves develop a fear of young people. They tend to see three young people in a group and think it is a gang. A great schism occurs in our society. I think it is important to keep relationships through all generations open and flowing. It is important to place aged care homes in electorates such as Lindsay where there is access to the grandchildren and sometimes the great&hyphen;grandchildren. As the young grow up there is no fear of getting old. There is no fear of the unknown. They have a great amount of respect for their grandparents and extended family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently over 40 per cent of residents in nursing homes share rooms with three or more people. Eleven per cent of the facilities do not meet fire standards. Fifteen per cent do not meet health standards. That does not apply to any of the homes in my electorate, because they are all relatively new. They are all of an excellent standard but there is a shortage of them. With this introduction of accommodation bonds we will see the potential for new homes to open up. Groups like the Moran Group are gearing up to take advantage of what can be done in the industry and to start providing some competition, some choice, some diversity and some varied standards of accommodation to meet the increasingly particular needs of the generation of the baby boomers, who tend to be more demanding in terms of services offered and accommodation type.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to come back to Professor Gregory's report, which in 1995 identified a deficit in the aged care area. Labor's best response was worth only $36.4 million over four years. What is worse, they actually cut funding for capital. This is at a stage where nursing homes do not have elevators between floors, do not meet fire standards and are positive health risks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1992&hyphen;93, $45 million was available for nursing home capital alone. This bill addresses the need that Professor Bob Gregory stated was required, of $125 million annually. We are making inroads into the capital investment in our aged care homes and nursing care 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> records. In 14 months we have gone a lot further down the track than Labor had gone in 13 years. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I have seen comments by Mr Mick Dodson made in the United States. I have not seen the full text of what he said, so I can only comment on how I have seen it reported. I have to say that what I have seen reported is very disappointing and I ask why is Mr Dodson overseas focusing on only the negatives of what is happening and not focusing on some of the good things that are happening. It is very important in this debate that there is some balance and some capacity to say that good things are happening as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own area of health, that is, that I have direct responsibility for, there are some very positive things happening. We have framework agreements with six out of eight states and territories to bring Aboriginal people to the negotiating table&mdash;to bring ATSIC and the Commonwealth, state and territory governments and Aboriginal health services together and try to move in the one direction. Of itself, it is not going to fix things; but it is an essential building block if we are going to make progress and not repeat the mistakes of the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another essential building block for the long term is the Aboriginal work force. We are not going to have success without male and female Aboriginal health workers on the ground, without them getting adequate training and without there being greater numbers of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not going to have success without research. Research has to underpin any endeavour in health, and particularly in Aboriginal health. We have a very exciting venture happening in Darwin with the Menzies school of medical research. We have $50 million&mdash;$14 million direct from the Commonwealth and $35 million matched mainly by Commonwealth and state agencies&mdash;to spend to look at just the health needs of Aboriginal people. This is a cooperative research centre of the Department of Science and Technology that is looking at Aboriginal wellbeing. We have 15 coordinated care trials. The first of them are due to start in four weeks time. Three of those 15 are going to be in Aboriginal communities&mdash;the Tiwi Islands, the south west of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Western Australia, including Roebourne and Bunberry and one in Wilcannia in western New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at specific strategies, we have an Aboriginal sexual health strategy after a year of tough and difficult negotiation and consultation with Aboriginal people. We have a mental health action plan that, again, does not promise the world but does promise incremental improvements and has taken Aboriginal people on board to be part of it. We have new services starting up&mdash;18 that we have been able to announce in the last six months; 17 we are still trying to negotiate the location of with states and territories and Aboriginal people on the basis of need. In places like Balgo, in Western Australia, up to a thousand people have no access to health services whatsoever. On the broader issues, Aboriginal people are now getting their fair share in mainstream programs as well&mdash;diabetes, public health, HIV and AIDS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not all things of course happen because of government. Some things are happening in spite of government. In the Pitjantjatjara lands, in the north&hyphen;west of South Australia, there has been the most extraordinary improvements in health in the last four years by Nganampa health services, run out of Alice Springs, where they have been doing the hard slog on the ground and making improvements as good as anywhere in the world, recognising that the improvements come from basic public health strategy. In three shires in the Kimberleys over the last 10 years&mdash;only three shires&mdash;STD rates amongst men have dropped by two&hyphen;thirds. The only thing those three shires have in common is that they are the only three shires in the Kimberleys to have an Aboriginal medical service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Dodson is obviously frustrated. I can understand his frustration. Aboriginal people get frustrated when they see $400 million spent by the Commonwealth and states on a royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody and Aboriginal death rates go up. Aboriginal people are frustrated when there is a national Aboriginal health strategy that spends $500 million and they can find only traces of it in some places.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians are generous, and that generosity does extend to improving Aboriginal wellbeing. But their generosity will be severely tested if only one side of the argument is put. Their generosity will be severely tested if the view is put around and believed that only bad things are happening, because in many places in the country there are some wonderful, exciting things happening. If the view that everything we do is hopeless does become current, then I am sure the Australian public's generosity will be severely tested.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

The re&hyphen;emergence of the El Nino pattern and the continuing negative trend in the southern oscillation index suggest, unfortunately, that the prospect of good rains over winter and spring is increasingly remote. I have to say that the possibility of many farmers not seeing useful rainfall until next autumn is a terrible blow, particularly for those farmers in eastern Australia who are still struggling to recover from what they have been through in recent years&mdash;the worst drought on record. I know all of us sincerely hope that it unfolds differently.</PARA></TALK.START>

A six&hyphen;month recovery period was simply insufficient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of that, all eligible farmers in areas where Drought Exceptional Circumstances declarations have been revoked can receive a drought relief payment, which is an income support payment for 12 months. But tragically, even under these circumstances, there are farm families experiencing continu 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing hardship because of the unbelievable toll taken by drought and the impact of extremely low commodity prices, particularly in the livestock sector. Many families in areas where the 12&hyphen;month recovery period was due to end next week faced an impossibly bleak immediate future. This included large parts of northern and south&hyphen;eastern Queensland from where the member comes, north&hyphen;eastern New South Wales, New England, parts of Tasmania, Victoria and the Eyre Peninsula of South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government therefore announced earlier today that the drought relief payment would be extended for a further three months in these areas. This will ensure that these hard&hyphen;pressed families continue to be able to put food on the table. The government has granted this extension because it has not yet finalised detailed consultation with stakeholders, including the states and farm leaders, over the integrated rural policy package which is shortly to be announced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has to be said that this approach can be contrasted very favourably indeed with what farmers saw under the previous administration. The reality is that there is a real contrast&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true, as the honourable gentleman knows, that unemployment in this country remains too high. It is also true that high unemployment did not arrive on 2 March 1996. It is true, as the honourable gentleman knows, that high unemployment has been a feature of the Australian economic and political landscape for some time. In fact it reached more than 11 per cent when the honourable gentleman ran the ACTU and Kim Beazley was the employment minister. I do not think anybody who thinks about the unemployment problem should gainsay those undeniable facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You need higher levels of economic growth in this country&mdash;nobody denies that&mdash;over a sustained period of time. You also need structural changes to the labour market, which have been begun by this government, the quality and breadth of which are now starting to filter through the business community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the early critics of the Workplace Relations Act, some of those people who said that it did not go far enough, are now beginning to acknowledge the contribution that it will make to freeing the Australian labour market. Only on Monday I had a lengthy meeting with a very representative group of Australian businessmen and women, and the point was made at that gathering that many of the benefits of that act, after a period of five or six months of operation, are now becoming apparent.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to reduce unemployment in a sustained way over a long period of time you need higher growth, you need an infinitely more flexibility labour market and you also need taxation reform.

How does it contrast with other points of view?</PARA></TALK.START>

<ANSWER PAGE="4879" SPEAKER="Reith, Peter, MP" NAMEID="WI4" ELECTORATE="Flinders" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Industrial Relations; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Kingston for her question. It is very important to look at the way in which we are going to use our industrial relations system to improve the living standards of people in her electorate of Kingston and generally throughout the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the good things about the recent living wage case decision of the Industrial Relations Commission was that it was a fair deal for low&hyphen;income people. Because it was economically responsible it also paved the way for the interest rates cuts which were later announced by the Reserve Bank. The point about having awards as merely a safety net is that this provides you with a system that looks after the people who need to be looked after. It also opens up the system for those beyond the safety net to do productivity based deals which give them the chance of earning more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not reinventing the wheel here. This used to be the policy so espoused by the opposition when they were in government, which is a policy they are now officially opposed to. You have the gang of four out there opposing the very reforms to the system which they themselves said would be good for low&hyphen;income earners as well as which would give us a low inflation environment, thereby paving the way for better deals for people throughout the system, including particularly low&hyphen;income people. You do not get a $292 benefit in terms of lower and reduced interest rates just as a result of circumstance: it is as a result of good policy in both the fiscal area and in the wages area, giving better outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen&mdash;when you make these comparisons with other points of view&mdash;the ACTU put their living wage claim into the AIRC. Who are they supported by? The ALP. We saw the TWU run a case which was directly opposed to a system that would give benefits to low&hyphen;income people. Who supported the TWU? None other than the ALP. We have seen the ALP jettison enterprise bargaining, which they once said was good for low&hyphen;income people but which now, of course, is not populist. We have seen them abandon non&hyphen;union certified agreements, which they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4880"> themselves, in theory at least, once supported and which they now oppose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, what you have in this debate and with this point of view is the gang of four&mdash;the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the two ex&hyphen;ACTU presidents&mdash;running the ACTU line. We know this is starting to generate a few problems within their own ranks. We have seen announced in the press today this sinister conspiracy by others who are mounting some economically literate argument against the gang of four position. There is a bit of unhappiness in the mid&hyphen;party, cadre levels about economic policy and, in particular, industrial relations. What we now see is a challenge to the centralised wage system which, if you go back to the 1970s and the 1980s, was in fact the position of the ALP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The challenge, of course, is coming from none other than the member for Melbourne, backed up by the member for Werriwa. This is what the member for Melbourne had to say about wages policy. He said the party should:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . accept that the determination of terms and conditions in the higher&hyphen;earning sector of the workforce will be much more dominated by the market than previously. The award system can no longer be a comprehensive prescription of terms and conditions of employment for everyone . . . Wages policy should focus primarily on using the award system to increase the real earnings of low&hyphen;income workers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So there you have it. You have the economically literate running the proposition that the award should be the safety net, and you have the gang of four&mdash;including the two ACTU ex&hyphen;presidents&mdash;running the same old Labor line, which is that you have to have a centralised wage&hyphen;fixing system, you do not have real and genuine enterprise bargaining, you should have compulsory unionism and you should give as much power to the trade union bosses as they demand of you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Labour terms, this is a return to a sort of purist ideology. This is where they once were. This is the trip down nostalgia lane which the member for Melbourne referred to.

Of course, it sounds as if it makes it much longer&mdash;and in fact it does&mdash;but can I point out that, as the member would know, taxpayers do not have to read every page. In fact, most taxpayers whose income consists solely of PAYE and have a bank account or two covered by an interest withholding tax would have very slight requirements, and they would not have to go to those pages.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That's right. Let us have a look at the fourteenth year, since you raise it. A couple of examples will suffice. Labor's forward estimates for the 1997&hyphen;98 year showed $171 million on environmental programs. It was on the way down, but there was $171 million. This year, in that same year, we will spend $255 million, an increase of $84 million&mdash;a 50 per cent increase over what they claimed they were going to spend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it gets better. Labor's forward estimates for the following year, 1998&hyphen;99, were $147 million. That year, we will spend $267 million, an increase of 80 per cent. So let us knock firmly on the head any suggestion that somehow we are not really going to spend as much as they are. We are spending a lot more, despite the problems that we faced as a government in repairing your black hole and the undoubted pressures that put on our outlays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will tell you something else. Not only is our environment program a massive increase on your proposals; it is very important to note that it is a fully&hyphen;funded program. Your entire budget strategy was to spend more money on Australia's Bankcard. You wanted to impose the debt on future generations.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4882"> part of the first 12 months that we were in government effectively debunking the myth of massive job generation during the years of the Labor Party. Let me take the opportunity, which the member for Gellibrand's question affords me, of saying a few things about the future and saying a few things about measures that have been announced, will come on stream and into effect over coming months, and will, in the assessment of the government, have a beneficial impact upon jobs, particularly in rural and regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy drew attention in an earlier answer to a new rural policy statement, which will be made in the second half of this year, which will involve, over a number of years, an investment of some $200 million. That will have a very beneficial impact on job generation in country Australia. There will be a regional forest agreement in Tasmania, to be signed soon, which will give greater certainty for investment in that state and greater certainty for the environment in that state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister for primary industries has already referred to the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia. I wonder, in the context of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia, whether the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats realise that, in voting against it, you were voting against the generation of Australian jobs. I wonder whether you realise that, in voting against that measure, you were voting against the creation of potentially hundreds, if not thousands, of jobs in rural and regional Australia. I wonder whether every time you join the divisions against that measure, both here and in the Senate, you realise how hostile your behaviour appeared then and will continue to appear to people who live in rural and regional Australia. Further down the track there will be the $1 billion Federation Fund for projects of national significance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know it is not really the custom of those who sit opposite to think about the future. I know it is not really the custom of those who sit opposite to focus on some of the positives.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a very significant social and economic challenge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that we have established the fundamentals. We have tackled the budget problem. We have kept inflation low. We have presided over significant falls in interest rates. The benefits of those falls in interest rates are traditionally delayed by something like a year or 18 months. As they begin to flow through, as the other measures that we have put in place begin to flow through, as the job&hyphen;generating consequences and flow&hyphen;through effects of some of the proposals that I have canvassed in this answer begin to flow through, and putting all of those together, I believe that they will make a much brighter and more positive contribution to the jobs outlook in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know those who sit opposite are gloomy at the prospect that any measure announced might have a beneficial effect on the labour market of Australia. I simply remind you that 11.1 per cent under your leader was the post&hyphen;recession high of unemployment. Just remember that it was not until Kim Beazley became employment minister that unemployment in Australia went over 11 per cent.

In so doing, we have required of the mine a program for dust suppression. Those who have visited Christmas Island will know that that has been a major problem. The mine has entered into agreements to do that. That will underpin, in a most positive way, the future economics of Christmas Island.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. He has taken a deep interest in roads in his electorate, as have a number of members on the government side in their electorates. As the member for Page correctly points out, these roads are vital to regional Australia because they are the artery to the economy of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, prior to the last election, had a policy to establish a new category for Commonwealth road funding called `roads of national importance'. Chief amongst them was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4886"> the establishment of a fund to upgrade the Pacific Highway. In partnership with both the New South Wales and Queensland governments, this coalition government has fulfilled its election promise of allocating some $3.1 billion towards upgrading the Pacific Highway over the next 10 years to bring it up to a standard it should have been a long time ago. Indeed, this is something that the previous Labor government could have done but failed to do. Like so many other promises they are now making, they say they would have done it had they had a 14th or 15th year of office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Page is also concerned about other roads of national importance and, in particular, one in his electorate called the Summerland Way. This government, in order to fulfil its commitments made prior to the last election, has allocated funds to upgrade the Summerland Way, an important link from the honourable member's electorate to Brisbane and other parts of Queensland. We have allocated funds to upgrade that road over the next four years. Unfortunately, there have been some difficulties in getting the New South Wales government to cooperate in this program&mdash;as usual, Labor not putting the resources where they are most needed to upgrade these important roads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, last Friday officials from my department and officials from the Roads and Traffic Authority in New South Wales met. I now call on the New South Wales government to come good with their promise of some $50 million towards the upgrade of the Summerland Way. I call upon them to fulfil their commitment and come up with the other funds that the Commonwealth is now prepared to make available to see the Summerland Way improve, according to the wishes of not only the honourable member for Page but indeed many people throughout northern New South Wales and southern Queensland, who see the vital importance of upgrading this road for the local economies in that regional part of Australia.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Notwithstanding the fact that the bells were allowed to ring for one minute, it does require a separate count.' Could you confirm that standing order 200 requires that the doors be closed and locked for the counting of a division after the lapse of four minutes, and the ringing of the bells for one minute is provided for in sessional order 203A which relates only to successive divisions?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for her totally unexpected question. Members would realise that the sessional divisions are still in a state of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> flux. I think that the honourable member for Prospect called the first one within the last 48 hours or so. After the division this morning, we reviewed the circumstances and, while I will not address all of the questions that you have raised&mdash;I will take the balance of those on notice&mdash;I do have a comment that I would like to make, and I do thank you for your question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trial arrangement for the abbreviated taking of a successive division is set out in sessional orders 203A and 203B and was used for the first time this week. Sessional order 203A provides that, where successive divisions are taken and there is no intervening debate after the first division, the bells for the ensuing division shall be rung for one minute only. Sessional order 203B makes provision for an abbreviated taking of the count for a successive division in circumstances where members are voting in the same way as they did in the preceding division. An example of such circumstances would be where a government motion is closured followed immediately by a vote on the motion itself with the government members voting the same way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point at issue relates to the interpretation of the words in sessional order 203A `where there is no intervening debate'. Taken literally, this means that any debate such as the seconding of a motion or the moving of the closure amounts to intervening debate, and the shortened method of conducting the division does not apply. This is the way in which I applied the sessional orders this morning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recognise that there may thought to be some inconsistency between my application of the new sessional order in respect of the actual counting and the practice of the chair adopted under the old standing order 200A of frequently, but not always, ordering the bells to be rung for one minute only for a following division. This is a practice which the House has developed over some years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the newness of the counting methods provided for in sessional order 203B, the House has not yet had an opportunity to develop a practice in relation to the new counting arrangements. I assume from the comments that have been made that it is the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4892"> wish of members that the new abbreviated counting method be used where there is no debate beyond formal words such as `I second the motion'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian manufacturing industry, on today's figures, is in recession. One of the biggest sectors of employment in this nation is in recession. Indeed, if you look at the underlying figures as opposed to the quarter on quarter figures, you will see that it has been in recession for three quarters. It is no wonder the govern 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment's performance in question time was so desultory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer (Mr Costello) was standing up announcing a growth figure half the level of the year on year figure to March that the previous government left&mdash;4.9 per cent down to 2.4 per cent. He defends himself not with reference to his own Treasury figures, which of course now stand in tatters, but with reference to another group which tells him that after three years in office he can look forward to the possibility that the government might well be able to achieve a level of growth that was in place for four successive years before they came into office&mdash;a level of growth which they have conceded as absolutely essential before they can make any serious dent on those tragic unemployment figures confronting this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They had no answers to a series of questions as to what they would do about the parlous state of the Australian manufacturing industry and what they would do about employment policy in general, as they stare at an unemployment figure of one million. They had no answers to those questions. There was just a quiet, limp denunciation of the people who at least had a decent record on these matters when we were in office. The best that the government could do was to mislead people with the figures that they put forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me take just one set of figures. They are very proud of their inflation rate. You would think, if you listened to the Treasurer in here day in and day out, that they had invented a low inflation environment in Australia. `True,' they say to the workers who have missed out on jobs and to industry&mdash;manufacturing industry in particular, which is experiencing extraordinary difficulties&mdash;`you're experiencing all of that. But think of our wonderful little inflation numbers. Think of those. Think of all that portends from that.' If you listened to them, you would think that they came into office with the sort of galloping inflation that we confronted when we came into office&mdash;John Howard's 11 per cent. When we came into office there was 11 per cent unemployment, 11 per cent inflation and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4893"> a $25 billion budget deficit. That was what Labor confronted when it came into office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, if you compared the participation rate then with the participation rate that we confronted on unemployment, you would see that, at the very worst nadir of the recession that we confronted six years ago, we would have confronted not an unemployment level of 11 per cent, which was our inheritance from then Treasurer John Howard, but an unemployment level of eight per cent. We were doing, as the former Treasurer and now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said, that double backflip with pike. We were providing millions of new jobs in this country in extraordinarily difficult circumstances, as we confronted a revolution in labour force participation by women and an immigration rate twice the level of that which this government has had to cope with&mdash;that halving of that particular rate four or five years before they in fact took office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go to this business about their one little kernel, that one little part of the nut, that they drag out to defend themselves. They say, `Okay, there's ruination all around in manufacturing industry, unemployment is rising, but we've got a wonderful inflation figure. It's around about one to two per cent.' What were the figures in the four years? One year  concluded with a growth rate of 4.9 per cent and all had a growth rate of four per cent or over. What were the inflation figures? They were two per cent, 2.1 per cent, 2.1 per cent and 3.2 per cent. Was it John Howard's 11 per cent? No, it was not John Howard's 11 per cent. It was virtually the same level of inflation they experience now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All those changes which took place in the labour market were changes that we put in place. We achieved those levels of inflation which you have simply been able to continue with and which have allowed the Reserve Bank to make adjustments to pick up your failure. What has allowed the Reserve Bank to make adjustments to pick up your failure has been the fact that you were left with a low inflation environment by us, thank you very much. That has put the Reserve Bank in a position&mdash;and it has more work to do&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">where it has been able to come in and fill the hole that you have left.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, many other factors, apart from inflation rates, impact upon whether there is confidence in the business community and whether bringing down interest rates will create any opportunities for small business or for the manufacturing industry. Above all, there is the question of confidence. Whatever might be the stage that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister think they strut in this place, there is out there in the community a vote of no-confidence in this government. They are voting with their feet in the shops of the nation. They are walking out of consumption&mdash;consumption which is absolutely critical if we are going to see a better performance from business in the next year or two's figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can't you remember the smirking arrogance removed from the Treasurer's face here today for the first time in a very long time in answers to questions? Can't you remember the smirking, but in this case also smarting, arrogance from the Treasurer when he took on board a question related to our last set of growth figures, when we left the nation with a near five per cent growth level and bowed out of the place after 13 years of constructive office?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What he said then was repeated by the shadow Treasurer here today. He got up in this place and leant across with that cat's smile on his face and said: `I have to tell you&mdash;expect more of it.' Perhaps he might have said: `Expect the sort of figures that you achieved in a quarter for a year under us.' We do expect more of them. We expect a great deal more of them. We expect a bit of industry policy out of them. We expect a bit of commonsense in relation to job security out of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go to the heart of job security in this country. Job security is made up of many elements. One is that people have confidence that the business community is going to keep employing them. There are many factors associated with that. Some of it goes to the sorts of adjustment that have been made in the public sector&mdash;30,000 jobs out of the public sector, 20,000-odd jobs out of Telstra.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4894">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They take a look around the communities of this nation and wonder where the skilled jobs are going to come from. They wonder where jobs, particularly for middle aged men, are going to come from. They take a look at the decisions of the government. They take a look at the government's priorities and the government's priorities say this: `If you are a public servant we will fire you. If you happen to be in an institution which we want to privatise we will fire you.' That is this government's position on employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then they move on and talk about the industrial relations changes that they made. Remember&mdash;the industrial relations changes we made produced two million jobs and produced an inflation level of two per cent while we were in office, which you happen to be building on. That is what our industrial relations policies did. And they produced growth in the manufacturing sector. And they produced a 10 per cent per annum increase in manufactured industry exports, down to a two per cent increase in this last year, or this first year of your period in office. That is what our position produced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what has your industrial relations policy produced? Your industrial relations policy has produced fear and anguish in the Australian community as to whether or not people will be protected if they have a job. We have a Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) and a Prime Minister who got out there and said: `Everything sings and dances.' They got out there after the government's industrial relations bill and said: `What a terrific thing this industrial relations bill has been.' `There won't be a second wave', said Peter Reith. `There won't even be a ripple.' Remember the famous last words from the Treasurer: `If this is growth, I have to tell you&mdash;expect more of it.' And from Peter Reith: `There won't even be a ripple of a second wave as far as our industrial relations reforms are concerned.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister says: `This is great news for small business.' What has happened three or four months later? They think that they are going to improve confidence in the community by declaring, `Oh dear. What we thought was so good has been a failure. We are going to have to take it a point further.' 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> That is what they have had to say. What they are saying to people out there whom they are trying to encourage to consume is: `We are going to make it easier to fire you. That is what we are on about here. We are going to make you easier to sack.' What they say to those folk out there is: `We are going to make you work harder. We are going to make you work till you die.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the pension end the government will rip the dental benefits off pensioners. They will rip the position out from underneath pensioners in regard to access to their medicine. But they tell them: `Good news, team. You can work for another five years.' This is to encourage other people to feel that this is a government serious about getting additional people into the work force, when they know darned well that those over&hyphen;65s compete with what is now the most vulnerable area of the work force in the sense of job security, and that is not kids&mdash;though the figures for kids are bad enough. The real problem for job security in this community, which is impacting massively on family income and on community confidence, is, in the main, middle-aged men, in their 40s and 50s. There is nothing for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the people who are employed in the car industry. These are the people who are employed in the shipbuilding industry. These are the people who, along with their female counterparts, are heavily employed in the textile industry. These are the people the Prime Minister will not go to see at Newcastle. What a statement from the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister says to Ray Martin&mdash;he who must be answered&mdash;four weeks ago: `I am about to go to Newcastle.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;`Soon'. That was four weeks ago. But I will tell you where he is going soon. He is going to Lords soon. He is not going to Newcastle soon. Because what would he confront in Newcastle? He would confront the men that I have been talking about. He would confront the men who were told when we left office that the iron and steel situation was fine as far as they were concerned, from BHP to additional electric arc furnaces&mdash;in place a steel policy. The moment 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4895"> the hand is taken off the tiller, off they scupper. The moment a government leaves office with an industry policy and a willingness to use the bully pulpit to keep an industry policy in place, off they scupper overseas&mdash;to join the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is left? What is left is insecurity. What is left is a trail of bad faith and that bad faith is a product of this government. But will the government talk about job security? The government will not talk about its budget. I do not blame them for that. Will they talk about job security? No, they will not. What is their solution? They come in and say, `You can talk about job security. We'll talk about tax reform.' What? You have had two years in office. Where is the tax reform? You now say you have tax reform on the agenda. What tax reform? What is your proposition?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are slowly coming up to this ridiculous, bogus proposition that the GST is going to be a solution to employment problems. I can just see it now, the mantra: if you put in place a GST, what you are going to have is job security, more jobs. That is a statement of faith. It is not a statement of argument. It is not a statement of proof. You go and look at the big VAT countries in Europe. They have twice the rate of unemployment of the United States and, even after your paltry record, 50 per cent higher than the unemployment rates here. That is your solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot talk about jobs, we cannot talk about job security, we cannot talk about an industry policy&mdash;they have no industry policy&mdash;we cannot talk about our budget. So what will we talk about? We will talk about tax reform but without an idea, without a single proposition, but a small flirtation back to where we were before. And remember on that GST they promised there would be none of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Winston Churchill used to say that it takes courage to rat, but it takes VC standard courage to re&hyphen;rat. We have had that from the government on this question of a GST and we have had it from them on employment, a ratting and re&hyphen;ratting on the workers of this nation and on the people who want access to the work force of this nation.

<PARA STYLE="Para">we know that in six years they managed to get the net figures up by 16,000. Further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">every business survey, with no exception, showed major reductions in both confidence and activity, profitability fell by 16.4%, government revenue was two percentage points lower than forecast.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So quite clearly, on the basis of the independent arbitrators on this debate, the last year of Labor was a complete failure and they are very, very happy with what has been shown by today's figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only argument that the Leader of the Opposition attempted to use in this debate was the figures in respect of manufacturing. Manufacturing was down 2.7 per cent for the quarter. But let us have a look at some of the real growth that occurred in the last quarter: construction, up 5.4 per cent; agriculture, up 3.6 per cent; accommodation and cafes, up 3.2 per cent; communication services, up 2.4 per cent; wholesale trade, up 2.3 per cent; personnel and other services, up 2.1 per cent; finance and insurance, up 2.1 per cent; education, up 1.8 per cent; retail trade&mdash;and we heard a little about that&mdash;up 1.7 per cent; transport and storage, up 0.7 per cent; and mining, up 0.4 per cent. There was growth in all areas of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can argue about the future for as long as we like. The simple facts are that the foundations are in place, as every sensible economic analyst out there will acknowledge. Of course, the only nonsensical economic analysts in this particular debate are on the Labor side of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you have low inflation locked in and low interest rates locked in&mdash;interest rates that have delivered $292 per month after&hyphen;tax as a benefit to those who are seeking to purchase a house or to those with the average mortgage at the present time&mdash;then I would say to you that that is one of the healthier signs I have seen in all of the time I have been watching the management of the economy, and that is all of my adult life.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4897">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we know from today's figures was very clearly stated by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in his media release today. We have very favourable prospects for the forthcoming year. The economy is very much poised for an acceleration in growth. As I have indicated already, the forward indicators in the housing area&mdash;not just based upon the mortgage relief that has been provided in a significant way by the economic policies of this government but on the economic indicators for housing activity&mdash;confirm that the housing recovery continues to strengthen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen domestic final demand in exports grow very rapidly during the quarter by 2.1 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively. The one downside in today's figures is that there is an indication clearly that stock growth is likely to resume in coming quarters. It is an unreliable indicator, but there is a clear indication that it will return. Even in the event&mdash;as the Treasurer said in question time today&mdash;that the stocks were unchanged in the June quarter, stocks would still add about one percentage point to GDP(E) growth in the quarter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen both private and public final demand grow strongly in the last quarter. We have seen equipment investment up some 3.1 per cent. We have seen a sharp rebound in non-residential construction investment&mdash;up 11.2 per cent. We have seen a strong private consumption growth&mdash;up one per cent. We have seen accelerating growth in dwelling investment&mdash;up 5.2 per cent. We have seen, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) indicated in question time, growth in exports. That is most important for rural and regional Australia, and it contributes so significantly to what is occurring in terms of our growth in this economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the future does look bright. If you go back to the budget, the budget indicates 3&frac34; per cent growth in the economy during the year ahead. They are the exact ingredients we need to ensure that that growth occurs. We will see very clearly by the end of this financial year a growth of over three per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) continually likes to take one quarter in isolation, but he dropped off the March quarter for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> last year, which had a growth of 1.7 per cent. That was a high growth quarter. I suspect that confidence and that investment all came with a rush after 2 March 1996 or as an expectation of what was going to happen on 2 March. If you take this particular growth of 0.9 per cent, we are exactly on track for that sustainable growth with all of the right ingredients in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is despite the fact that we have inherited a deficit of $10.5 billion. We have inherited five consecutive deficit budgets from the Labor government. We have inherited an increase in general government debt of $70 billion in that five-year period. We have seen the growth in debt servicing increase from $5.3 billion in 1991 to just under $10 billion by the time the government changed. We have addressed those problems of debt and deficit by turning that $10.5 billion deficit around in the space of three budgets to a surplus of $1.6 billion. We have reduced the reliance on debt to the extent that we have increased national savings with a public sector contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, we have delivered tax reform to the families of this country. We have given all that we promised and then considerably more in the way of relief, including tax relief, and benefits to the small business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have indicated very, very clearly that this is a government that will not spend what it does not have. This is a government that will act responsibly in all matters fiscal. This is a government that is not going to throw a bucket of money at unemployment problems, as the member for Hotham did when he was the minister responsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that is responsible to the self-funded retirees and prepared to give those at that age in our community some considerable relief. We have given relief in the context of the threshold in which they have to pay tax. We have given them a tax rebate in terms of their savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have looked after the needy in the community. We have shared the load equally across the board. We have addressed the debts and the deficits of Labor, the inheritance we received and the disastrous state of the econ 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4898"> omy and the Commonwealth's finances. At the same time, we have put in place those ingredients that will ensure sustainable growth for the years ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me now go back to some of the other comments that were made by the Leader of the Opposition. He spoke very passionately&mdash;endeavouring as he was to sustain his current leadership, which is under threat&mdash;of the fact that there was a need for job security. There was no job security under Labor. Under Labor we saw jobs die. The member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) knows all about this; we saw them simply go out the door in large numbers, year after year, before, throughout and subsequent to the recession.</PARA>

When are we going to see that growth the Treasurer said was going to be boosted under the coalition government? When are we going to see the jobs?

What we have with these national accounts figures is, for the first time now, at the end of a 12&hyphen;month period of this government being in office, the record. It is no longer the prediction, it is no longer the forecast, it is no longer the expectation and it is no longer the possibility&mdash;it is the record. And what a record it is. A growth rate over those last 12 months of just 2.4 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer and the Minister for Finance say, `Well, you had to expect it to come back to that because that big quarter you had in March last year dropped out.' That big quarter we had in March last year was the last quarter of the Labor government. What has now dropped into the accounts is the first quarter of your government. What makes up the rest of the 12&hyphen;monthly accounts are the second and the third and the fourth quarters of your government. What do those four quarters add up to? They add up to 2.4 per cent. How does that compare with what we achieved in our last year in government? We achieved 4.9 per cent. It is less than half the amount. Of course the quarter of growth that we were last associ 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4899"> ated with has dropped out; that is what happens when the calendar ticks over. Sooner or later you have to bear the responsibility. It is all your own work. Growth of 4.9 per cent was us: 2.4 per cent is all your own work. It is on the record and, my God, have people noticed it. In our last four years in government we achieved four per cent. In your first year in government it was 2.4 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government that pledged itself to boosting the economy has flattened the Australian economy. It is even worse so far as manufacturing industry is concerned. You have not just flattened it: you have sent it into recession. Two quarters of negative growth for manufacturing, minus 2.2 per cent for the whole year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister, who has conceded that we have to sustain growth at four to five per cent if we are going to make a lasting inroad into unemployment, as he says, has presided over an economy growing at just half that necessary rate. Even if, looking to the future, that latest quarter of 0.9 per cent is sustained, that still only annualises out at 3.6 per cent. That is less than the 3&frac34; per cent that is in your current budget projections. It is less again than the four to five per cent your Prime Minister concedes that you need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are not going to make 3&frac34; per cent for this year. You are not going to make the revised budget forecast that you put down just a few weeks ago. To get that you would have to have two per cent growth in the next quarter. You are not going to get two per cent out of stocks or out of anything else. That is beyond reach. You cannot even meet the growth projections that you revised as recently as five or six weeks ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These figures are not just abstractions to give economists their jollies. What we are talking about with these particular figures is what they mean in terms of real human pain and suffering for ordinary Australians and, in particular, for the 800,000 unemployed Australians. What they mean is pain and suffering for the faces that I see in my electorate, in Dandenong and in south&hyphen;east Melbourne, and what so many of my colleagues in this place and, indeed, some of yours see. They are not the faces you see in the view from Kirribilli. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> They are not the faces you see in the view from Malvern or Toorak that the Treasurer enjoys. These are the faces of ordinary Australians who are affected by these policies and by this abominable performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The failure of the economy to grow at the pace that it could and should have grown over the last year has meant, as we know, 32,000 more people unemployed under the coalition government. It has meant 30,000 more long&hyphen;term unemployed. It has meant a higher rate of youth unemployment. It has meant a rate of employment growth now being projected for the outyear periods that, as the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) so effectively put it today, will mean that you are producing nearly 300,000 fewer jobs over this period of government than we did in our last.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And who is to blame for this lamentable state of affairs? Who is to blame for the fact that the economy is in this condition? The short answer is that it is absolutely nobody but this government. We are not talking about alien forces at work here. This show is not <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The X&hyphen;Files</EMPHASIS>; this show is the Australian economy. And it is the Australian government that is unequivocally responsible for running this show. It is unequivocally responsible for what has gone wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has gone wrong in the management of this economy is two big things. First of all, a budgetary strategy that has been hopelessly astray. The budgetary strategy over the period the government has been in office&mdash;for two budgets now&mdash;has been deliberately, designedly contractionary in scope, because you have had an utterly wrong&hyphen;headed appreciation of what the economic priorities of this country are. You have moved into a contractionary mode, which has meant half a per cent less growth over last year and this year than would otherwise have been the case. You have moved into a budgetary strategy that has gone about creating jobs by destroying them in the Public Service in regional Australia and everywhere else. You have gone about a budgetary strategy that has deliberately destroyed jobs and prospects in the manufacturing sector, through the removal of subsidies, the decimation of R&amp;D support, the removal of export assistance and the creation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4900"> of massive uncertainty about the tariff future of a number of key sectors. You are responsible. It is deliberate strategy that has produced this result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business has suffered particularly acutely as a result of this strategy. For small business, the growth that is generated by the economy and by the budget that is so central to economic management is far more than government regulations or taxes or access to bank finance. It is small business that has felt the full brunt of the economic slowdown. Last week's Yellow Pages survey reported that more than 80 per cent of small businesses saw the economy as going backwards or at a standstill, as it affected them. That is reflected in bankruptcy statistics. Do not tell us about the ancient past. Reflect on the fact, Minister for Finance, that bankruptcies have increased 21.3 per cent in the government's first year in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing you have done is not just to embark upon a contractionary budget strategy but to go about it in a way that has generated a massive decline in consumer confidence. Instead of generating confidence, you undermined it with all your talk about black holes and the nonsensical strategy that has gone with it. Every month, researchers at the University of Melbourne test consumer confidence, and in the space of just five months last year&mdash;I will not go into the details&mdash;your government turned strong consumer confidence into widespread pessimism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has continued. Last year's retail experience was the worst in a generation. It was the toughest period for sales in a generation. Things picked up a bit in January and February, and there was some hope that we might have been headed for better times, but now we know that all those extra sales were just generated by deep discounting by desperate retailers, many of them in small business. In the last two months retail sales have again declined sharply. This government is incapable of generating the kind of confidence the economy needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When confronted with this kind of record of failure&mdash;to generate growth, to create jobs, to reduce unemployment, to boost retail sales, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to reduce bankruptcy, to reduce foreign debt for that matter and to improve our competitiveness&mdash;the government's stock response, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said, is to call upon the strong private investment that has been occurring and the interest rate cuts that have been made possible by sustained low inflation. But these are not the government's achievements. They are the government's inheritance. They are the product of the strength of the economy they inherited. The investment decisions that are made were essentially made and bedded down before you came into office, and the inflationary environment you inherited is not something that just came to fruition in the last 12 months and has created an environment&mdash;as the Treasurer (Mr Costello) is trying to say&mdash;that made it difficult for business to adjust. The truth of the matter is that in our last five years in office inflation averaged 2&half; per cent&mdash;right bang in the middle of the Reserve Bank's target range. That was our gift to you. That was the economy that you inherited. This is the economy that you are now in the process of making an unholy mess of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let there be no mistake, no misunderstanding: the economy is potentially still in an unholy mess. The world economy gives some ground for confidence out there, but there are many dimensions of the economy as we see it that show real cause for concern, and the record of performance of this government does nothing other than to generate continuing alarm in many sectors of the economy about whether things will in fact pick up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the economy does pick up, as we all hope it will, it will not undo the damage that has been done to the economy in this first year of office. If there are better economic prospects next year&mdash;and, my God, we all hope there are, because all our constituents depend upon that&mdash;that does not change the fact that tens of thousands more Australian workers are unemployed today than was the case this time last year and  thousands of small businesses are struggling to survive&mdash;even more than was the case last year&mdash;because of one reason only. That is this government's appalling, grotesque mishandling of the economy in its first 12 months in office. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning in Brisbane the former Labor cabinet minister and former Labor Minister for Health, Graham Richardson, made a speech to a business breakfast in which he made some interesting remarks. When members of the former government leave office, then you see some truthfulness in what they have to say which is not necessarily reflected in what might have been said while they were here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the course of his remarks, the former Senator Richardson said that Paul Keating had wanted to be viewed as a statesman overseas, but had failed, because he did not address domestic problems such as native title issues, links with Asia and Australia's foreign debt. `The mishandling of these problems left the last two Labor governments looking awful,' he said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a measure of the awfulness of the past Labor government that we were left inheriting a $10,500 million Commonwealth debt. It is a measure of that awfulness that the foreign debt of this country is running at some $180 billion. It is a measure of that awfulness that the former Labor government left this country with unemployment running at over 8 per cent&mdash;in reality much higher&mdash;in the fifth year of recovery, unemployment that reached over 11 per cent under the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) when he was Minister for Employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also a measure of that awfulness that unemployment, according to the current Leader of the Opposition, was ratcheted up in each recession over which Labor presided. It is a measure of the awfulness of the former Labor government that in this country we have an increasing gap between the rich and the poor, as middle Australia has been squeezed from all directions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a measure of the awfulness&mdash;which former Senator Richardson referred to about the former governments he was part of&mdash;that we had, as the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) has pointed out today, bankruptcies at record levels under the former government. It is a measure of that awfulness that small businesses have been destroyed by the former Labor government because of the record 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> interest rates which were brought to bear by the former administration&mdash;record interest rates that reached over 20 per cent and destroyed thousands upon thousands of small businesses in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also a measure of that awfulness that national savings collapsed to an all&hyphen;time low under the former Labor government throughout their decade&hyphen;long reign in this country. It is a record of that awfulness that personal household savings have reached the point of almost non&hyphen;existence after 13 years of Labor government. It is a record of that awfulness&mdash;to which, again, former Senator Richardson referred about his own former government&mdash;that the approach to unemployment under the former government meant churning people through training programs which only served to artificially lower the number of long-term unemployed on the books in this country and which created few real jobs. In fact, as the Minister for Finance has pointed out, it was a net increase in real jobs of 16,000. This, I take it, is the measure of awfulness to which Graham Richardson was referring this morning&mdash;the awfulness of the two former Labor governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also a measure of the former governments that they arrogantly told the Australian people that the recession was the recession we had to have and that there would be a soft landing. Of course, Labor never did bring the bacon home as promised. They are now in limbo as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Howard and Costello government inherited was an economy heading towards destruction. We have started to address some of those measures. We have started to address some of what we have inherited. We have turned the Commonwealth deficit into a surplus within the period of one parliament. We have turned a $10,500 million Commonwealth deficit into a $1,600 million surplus in the period of one parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have encouraged national savings through a program which will give some incentive for people in this country actually to save some of the money they earn; by reducing some of the red tape that exists for small business in this country; by providing a tax reduction for families, particularly those 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4902"> struggling with children at the present time; and, in the larger economic sense, by taking measures that will reduce the debt to GDP ratio and by building an economy based on steady sustainable growth rather than the decade of boom and bust which was practised under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do the national accounts actually show, which this matter of public importance is said to be about? Today's national accounts show that the economy grew by 0.9 per cent in the March quarter. This is a good outcome and a pointer to very favourable prospects for the forthcoming year. With the exception of stocks, all of the areas of expenditure contributed to growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The composition of activity in the quarter, with very strong growth in final demand and a sharp run&hyphen;down in non&hyphen;farm stocks, combined with other indicators of activity, suggest that the economy is poised for an acceleration in growth. Forward indicators, for example, of housing activity confirm that the housing recovery continues to strengthen. Last week's ABS stocks and selected industry sales release indicated that manufacturers expect sales in this country to strengthen and that the outlook for business investment continues to be very positive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Real private consumption expenditure rose one per cent in the March quarter, following the growth of 0.7 per cent in the December quarter. This reflected strong growth in the consumption of retail goods, which rebounded in the March quarter to grow by 1.6 per cent, and strength in the purchase of motor vehicles. Dwelling investments rose by 5.2 per cent in the March quarter, with very strong growth in investment in new dwellings more than offsetting a fall in alterations and additions investment. Private business investment rose by 5.3 per cent in the March quarter, reflecting increases in both equipment and non&hyphen;dwelling construction investment, with the latter growing particularly strongly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sales to stocks ratio run&hyphen;down is something which will be corrected in the coming quarter, and all the indicators are that that is being corrected at the present time. If you look at some of the other breakdowns in terms of these figures, you will be able to see 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> other indicators that this economy is growing in a sustained, steady way, not in the way of the boom&hyphen;bust cycle that we had in 13 years under a Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at manufacturing specifically, which the opposition has referred to today, you will see that employment in manufacturing in the year to February increased by 22,000 positions nationally. You will also see that profitability for manufacturing has also continued to grow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than listening to the opposition, which has got to come in here and carp about what the government is doing&mdash;we know that that is the job of the opposition, and of course they are going to come in here and do it&mdash;perhaps we ought to look at what some independent analysis has said about the situation. If you look at the report of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council, you will see some indication of what the experts are saying. They referred to an outstanding economic performance so far as this country is concerned over the past year. They said that 1996 for Australia was a banner year. `A banner year,' said the experts from the Pacific Economic Cooperative Council, so far as their assessment of the Australian economy is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition come in here and feign concern about the economy at the present time. If they were really concerned about the Australian economy, if they were really concerned about creating real jobs in the Australian economy, then they would adopt a different approach from what they have adopted to industrial relations reform. They would not be so niggardly in their attitude to the unfair dismissal provisions and the changes to the new legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most feigned indignation was contained in the comments by the Leader of the Opposition on industry policy, in which he said, `We expect an industry policy.' The Leader of the Opposition has the hide to come in here today and say, `We expect an industry policy.' May I refer him to the remarks of former Senator Richardson in Brisbane this morning in which he said, `Labor never had an industry policy.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, after 13 years of having been at the wheel of the economy in this country, having 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4903"> had their hands on the levers, to come in here and say that they expect an industry policy, when for that period of time, for more than a decade, they did not have one themselves, just indicates the degree of hypocrisy so far as the opposition are concerned.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Dr KEMP</EMPHASIS> (Goldstein&mdash;Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training and Minister Assisting the Minister for Finance for Privatisation) (4.38 p.m.)&mdash;I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The bill would increase the amount previously appropriated for 1997 under the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992 by $17.938 million in line with normal price adjustments, taking total funding for 1997 to $909.263 million. In 1997, Commonwealth funding alone is expected to provide 43,000 student places over and above those provided in 1996. This will contribute substantially to an estimated total increase of 55,000 training places this year, as I said in question time today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill would also amend the legislated amount for 1998 to $890.585 million to give effect to the 1997&hyphen;98 budget decision to reduce funding for distribution to the states and territories by the Australian National Training Authority by $20 million. The bill would appropriate the same level of funding for 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget measure provides an incentive to the states and territories to achieve efficiency gains in vocational education and training operations. The reduction represents about 0.7 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> per cent of total Commonwealth, state and territory funding for the sector. It should be seen against the background of a 37 per cent increase in Commonwealth funding for the sector since 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the Australian National Training Authority ministerial council meeting on 23 May 1997, all state and territory ministers supported a resolution noting that the reform of the vocational education and training sector agreed at the meeting has the potential to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the provision of vocational education and training. Indeed, there should be substantial capacity to fund further growth in the sector from efficiency gains, including those resulting from the reforms led by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These reforms are far reaching and demonstrate the government's commitment to vocational education and training. This year's budget has clearly demonstrated this commitment with an overall increase in the allocation for vocational education and training of $144 million, or almost 12 per cent, compared with the expenditure of $1.2 billion in 1995&hyphen;96 when the Labor Party was in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been some re&hyphen;allocation of funds to focus on our highest priority&mdash;the reform of the vocational education and training system and the establishment of new apprenticeships. About 70 per cent of young Australians do not go from school into university. Vocational education and training has a major role to play in making sure young Australians obtain the skills needed to get them into jobs and in ensuring that Australian businesses can meet the challenges of the global economy. The government is working with the states and territories to establish a training system which is responsive to the needs of industry and business enterprises, while operating within a national framework that is based on national standards and high quality, portable national qualifications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The centrepiece of the government's reforms to vocational education and training is new apprenticeships. New apprenticeships are being developed to expand the number of training opportunities, especially for young people, into new industries to take advantage of economic growth and employment poten 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4904"> tial. At the ministerial council meeting last month, the states and territories endorsed arrangements to ensure implementation of new apprenticeships. This was a historic agreement to introduce a flexible national system which meets the needs of today's enterprises wherever they may be located in Australia and whether they are large or small. It also maintains a focus on protecting the interests of those undertaking training through simpler but quality assured regulatory arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ministerial council agreed that there will be new funding arrangements for off&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training for new apprenticeships, allowing employers and their trainees to choose the provider to deliver their training. For the first time, we will have a demand driven training system, giving employers an unprecedented opportunity to select the training that meets the needs of their business. More than $500 million a year in Commonwealth, state and territory funding will be available for allocation among public and private training providers under this `user choice' system. This bill provides the Commonwealth's contribution to that funding as well as ongoing support for other aspects of the vocational education and training provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides the solid foundation for building a national vocational education and training system which delivers quality outcomes, especially for young people, more efficiently and with less red tape. It provides a solid foundation for expanding opportunities for Australia's young people and improving the bottom line for Australian enterprises. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 (1997).</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 (1997) which I have just tabled contains alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to give effect to the information technology agreement, ITA, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which was signed by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) on behalf of Australia in Singapore on 13 December 1996. The ITA was one of the major outcomes of the ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organisation, WTO, held in Singapore in December 1996. Negotiations on the agreement were completed on 26 March and it comes into force on 1 July this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ITA represents a package of sectoral liberalisation which, in combination with the agreement on basic telecommunications, establishes the trading framework for the rapid growth of global information and communications infrastructure. Participants to the agreement will, in most circumstances, eliminate tariffs on computer technology and telecommunications products by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ITA has been signed by 41 countries, including our major APEC trading partners. These counties represent 92.3 per cent of world trade in these products, a trade worth an estimated $750 billion per year. During the negotiations, Australia made clear its requirements for an acceptable and balanced package of liberalisation being achieved and for the participation by a core of our regional trading partners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia stands to gain substantially from the ITA. Australian tariffs on ITA goods are proportionally lower than the tariffs of many other participating countries and the agreement will provide Australian industry with increased export opportunities to help redress the $6.9 billion trade deficit in this sector. It will do this in a number of ways:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Exporters of electronic components, office machines and telecommunications equipment to the European Union, Canada, the United States and Asia are likely to benefit from the tariff eliminations of the ITA.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Tariff elimination, combined with other factors such as rapidly expanding economies, large populations, expansion of communications infrastructures, and growing disposable income in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Korea and Taiwan will benefit trade in all ITA products. These countries, all participants in the ITA, represent the largest potential ITA market in the world.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4905">
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> ITA will ensure greater certainty of access through commitments to bind tariffs at zero.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The agreement will boost employment in this industry sector, which currently employs 30,000 Australian workers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Moreover, the ITA will provide Australian firms and consumers with access to information technology and telecommunications inputs at world competitive prices. The ITA is an excellent example of Australian industry and government working together. Industry was kept closely involved during the negotiations from the outset and has strongly supported and welcomed our participation in the ITA. The telecommunications industry believes that the ITA will add up to $400 million a year in new exports. Other parts of the industry believe that exports of their products could at least double by the end of the decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia could not have secured the market opening achieved under the ITA through direct bilateral negotiations. Working through APEC and the WTO allowed Australia, in coalition with other major economies, to bring our key regional trading partners to the ITA negotiating table.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia must now implement its commitment to reduce tariffs on ITA products. These alterations are contained in Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 (1997) and will come into effect on 1 July 1997. They fully implement Australia's tariff obligations under this agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A summary of the alterations contained in this proposal has been prepared and is being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposal to the House.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Customs Tariff Proposal No. 4 (1997) which I have just tabled contains alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 which result from Administrative Appeals Tribunal, AAT, decisions.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Each of the alterations is techni 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cal in nature, affecting only a narrow range of goods. I will briefly outline each of them and later provide more detail on each alteration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Alteration No. 1 reinstates the level of government assistance granted to local manufacturers of surgical drapes.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alterations Nos. 2 and 3 realign the Australian tariff in accordance with our international obligations to the World Customs Organisation, WCO. Alteration No. 4 corrects a recent tariff amendment, narrowing the range of goods entitled to duty free treatment to only those goods so entitled before the amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now outline the alterations in more detail. Alteration No. 1 of this proposal will apply a more precise description to goods classified in subheading 4823.90.10. This will exclude surgical drapes from that classification and reinstate the intended level of tariff assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the second matter, an automotive parts importer appealed against a classification ruling by the Australian Customs Service, ACS, that certain lamps were classified under heading 9405. The AAT agreed with the appellant that the lamps should be classified in heading 8539. Australia is a contracting partner to the harmonised commodity description and coding system, HS, sponsored by the WCO. The WCO has advised the ACS that the lamps in question are classified in heading 9405.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Alteration Nos. 2 and 3 of this proposal insert an additional note in chapter 85 of the tariff, thus realigning Australia's position with that of the HS. The third matter results from a 1991 AAT decision that certain centrally housed ADP power units should be classified to heading 8471 as computer units. The ACS accepted this decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995 the WCO, in its four&hyphen;year cycle of review of classification matters, recommended that all power units be classified in heading 8504. The ACS instituted this change and provided a new subheading for the goods covered by the AAT decision, thus allowing a continuation of their free rate of duty. The description in that subheading has now been shown to include a broader range of goods than that specified in the original AAT decision. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the debate on this proposal is adjourned, I should draw to the attention of the House that the schedule associated with it relates to Customs Tariff Proposal No. 2 1997. That proposal relates to the sugar tariff which was introduced in this place on 26 March and has not yet been brought on for discussion, even though it takes effect&mdash;and I am talking about a major breach of coalition promise prior to the election campaign; a pay cut of $27 million to Australia's sugar industry&mdash;within a couple of days of the end of this session.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to take this opportunity during the discussion of this tariff proposal to consider in the House the fact that the cane crushing season is starting in Mackay today. A very real election commitment was made by the coalition prior to the election that it would not reduce the sugar tariff beyond the present level of $55 per tonne because Australia had already met its obligations under the World Trade Organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Uruguay Round obligations for sugar represent a tariff requirement of $70 per tonne by the year 2000, and our current tariff level of $55 a tonne is comfortably within that obligation. Many of our export destinations have sugar tariffs massively higher than ours, which suggest that there is no reason for Australia to go it alone on the sugar tariff. Given all these things, they have still decided to abolish the sugar tariff by 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have already made it very clear publicly that Labor will be opposing the proposed scrapping of the sugar tariff. We do not believe it is justified. We do not believe it is an appropriate measure to be taking in the Australian economy. We are very concerned about the fact that sugar growers have been conned by the government&mdash;absolutely

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Howard coalition government is mad and bad and dangerous. The evidence for that has been seen just in the last couple of days in terms of the priorities that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has set for federal government action in two different areas. The Aged Care Bill 1997, which we have before us today and which is at issue in the discussion in this House, is an extremely important bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister indicated in the House yesterday what his approach to the next three years might be in terms of what the priorities of this government might be. The Prime Minister could, in effect, be likened to George Bush because what he has introduced into Australia now is the notion that the federal government should take on issues, attitudes and programs for which they have no direct responsibility. Absolutely contrary to the National Commission of Audit, absolutely contrary to what the government has done in the past, it is going to take up state government issues&mdash;issues that are the responsibility of the states&mdash;and campaign on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Prime Minister announced that tomorrow he will be launching a national campaign against violence and crime in Australia. That will be a three-year campaign in which the federal government will take an active strategic role in relation to trying to monitor and test anti-violence programs within the community, setting those up as models and then getting the states to implement them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before George Bush was thrown out of office, he had to be told by the Democrats that, basically, `It's the economy, stupid!' He had not got the point when he was campaigning that the economy in the United States was really in difficulty. We could make that same point here, but we could probably go further and say to the Prime Minister, `It's the society, stupid!' because what this Aged Care Bill does is present a situation where, instead of what had been done over more than a decade to build aged care facilities that reflected the needs of Australian citizens, we have a Prime Minister running around as if he were Crusader Rabbit or Mighty Mouse, launching a campaign against violence in the community 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in relation to state government responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let us look at the federal government responsibilities that this Prime Minister and his minister are walking away from. This Aged Care Bill is, I believe, a dangerous one. It is dangerous for the aged in this community, it is dangerous for the people in hostel care, it is dangerous for the charitable institutions that run not&hyphen;for&hyphen;profit hostels and nursing homes within Australia, and it is dangerous because of the steps it takes to undo the aged care strategy which the former Labor government introduced in 1985.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to our coming to office in 1983, the Giles report underlined the condition of nursing homes in Australia. What that underlined was a set of nursing homes, particularly those run for profit, that were entirely run down, where the conditions were deplorable and where people were treated in a manner that did not equate to the dignity that they had or should have been given to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor, at that time with the agreement of the coalition when it was in opposition, put forward a new program to be introduced over a period of 10 years. We had a situation prior to 1983 where, if people got sick&mdash;not dramatically sick; just sick enough that they could not look after themselves in their own home&mdash;and their family was not capable of assisting them, they had no choice but to go into one of those depleted and run-down nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The strategy that we put in place was a three&hyphen;tiered strategy. Firstly, we put Commonwealth government funding into the home and community care program, in cooperation with the states, to allow those people who were still healthy and who had minor problems to be assisted in their own homes for as long as possible and to assist those people who were caring for them and to do so by bringing in community nurses and other community resources to allow them to stay at home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, we built the hostel program. The hostel program under Labor was increased by 15 per cent in real terms year on year. That hostel program provided for people who could no longer remain at home but were not sick enough to go into a nursing home. Labor 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4911"> determined that it was important that there be a halfway house between the home and a nursing home. Labor determined that it was important to realise that people who could still cater for themselves but needed central meal facilities, nursing assistance on the property and the help and assistance of other residents could more profitably spend their lives in hostel accommodation, but they would not be forced to go into a nursing home inappropriately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third thing Labor did was to spend capital funds on building new nursing homes. In 1985&hyphen;86, the first year of that strategy, the ALP federal government spent $1.2 billion on aged care&mdash;that is, on nursing homes, hostels and home and community care. By 1993-94, that had grown to $2.6 billion worth of funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not going to happen under this government, because this government has identified two crises within the community. The first of those crises is the physical decline of aged care facilities noted in the Gregory report of 1993-94. The core problem is the fact that many nursing homes have declined in terms of their standards and fire regulations and they need to be rebuilt. The second crisis is the fact that our aged care system will increasingly come under greater impact by the ageing of the population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Using these two notions and putting them as crises, what is the coalition's solution? They knew what the situation was while Labor was in government&mdash;a three&hyphen;tiered system of appropriate care: care in the home, under home and community care; care in hostels, which met the needs of the clients in the hostels; and, for those people who became quite dramatically sick, the much more expensive nursing home beds. The coalition should realise that the cost to the then federal government was less because it had that three&hyphen;tiered system. They should realise that it was not only appropriate but also cost&hyphen;effective for the then federal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But they noted the Gregory report, they noted the run&hyphen;down nature of nursing homes in Australia and they noted that it would cost about half a billion dollars, in terms of capital funding, to renew those nursing homes. But, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> because this coalition government do not want to participate in direct service delivery to the Australian people, they do not want to provide capital funding. They have come up with an entirely new way of going about it and have misrepresented it as just simply cloning Labor's position on hostels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is particularly dangerous to the people who need those appropriate services in the community and to the not&hyphen;for&hyphen;profit charitable institutions who run nursing homes and hostels in Australia is that this coalition government has merged two types of aged care&mdash;nursing homes and hostels. No longer will any individual who is not appropriately sick enough have a choice about whether to go into a hostel or to go into a nursing home, because people will be forced into nursing homes. They will enter an aged care centre where hostel accommodation and nursing accommodation will be as one. In terms of the capital needed in those facilities, it just so happens that this bill determines that the standard of the building of hostel accommodation has to be exactly equivalent&mdash;I think it is level 9&mdash;to nursing home accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate of Blaxland we have a number of hostel places that have been built up over the past decade. Those hostel places have been very important to the people in Blaxland. They have provided appropriate care for them. A number of those hostels are run by the Bankstown City Frail Aged Persons' Homes Trust, a not&hyphen;for&hyphen;profit organisation. I have with me a letter from the general manager of that trust, Mr Terry Madden. I wish to read out a number of parts of that letter because it details the direct impact of the Aged Care Bill on the nursing homes and hostels in Bankstown and how their welfare and the welfare of the people they serve will be directly affected by this misguided bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hostel beds that we presently have in Bankstown are at level 3. They are not nursing home beds, they are not nursing home institutions, they are hostel institutions. The frail aged trust faces this simple situation: the people who came into those hostel places did not pay an entry fee. More than 60 per cent 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4912"> of the people using the hostels and nursing home places in Bankstown are concessional. They are pensioners; they do not have the funds. This not&hyphen;for&hyphen;profit organisation allowed them to enter the hostels without paying an entry fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this bill, the hostels and the trust have been told that they have to provide for a rebuilding of those hostels. They have to either renovate and bring level 3 up to level 9 or consolidate on one site. Effectively, it means this trust that has nursing home places on a site on Birdwood Road and hostel places spread throughout the municipality of Bankstown will be forced to upgrade dispersed hostel places. But this bill requires the trust to provide, effectively, nursing home care at those hostel places to not only bring the quality up to that building standard but also provide the same kind of care in that institution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think they will be effectively driven to rebuild entirely. All of those hostel places built with capital funds provided by the former Labor government will have to be rebuilt at standard 9. It is not only dangerous but also mad and bad. It is not good public policy. We have that infrastructure in Bankstown now. To duplicate it and then to not be able to run the existing infrastructure as a hostel program does not seem to make much sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This frail aged persons homes trust has never had to borrow money from a bank in order to run the trust, to run its nursing homes, to run its hostels. It has been funded by the local people of Bankstown. It has been funded by the registered clubs, such as the Bankstown District Sports Club and the club of the year, the Revesby Workers Club. It has also been funded by RSL clubs within the community. The people in Bankstown know and understand that they have to look after the aged. They know that the frail aged cannot remain at home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what is the impact of this aged care legislation? The minister, having announced that these changes would be made in the budget last year, from day one has not had a blind clue about what the implications of what her plans would be because the plans were not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fleshed out. She did not really understand them. All she could do was to rhetorically say: `It is just the same as Labor's hostels program.' It is not. This will coalesce nursing homes beds and hostel beds. Mr Madden says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those deemed able to pay the accommodation bond will pay around $88,000 entry fee for an average nursing home bed in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He supplies an article from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS>  indicating that 80 per cent of service providers in the charitable sector will fix their nursing home entry fees at around $88,000:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Charities will have no choice other than to set the fee because the Commonwealth Government has abolished capital grants at the same time it is introducing accommodation bonds for nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He further says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The average cost to build a nursing home bed in New South Wales is between $90,000 and $100,000. To build therefore a 50-bed nursing home will cost an organisation around $5 million. That means the organisation needs to have about $250,000 a year put aside to rebuild after 20 years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Changes in technology and the fact that the buildings will be run down means that an organisation will need money to rebuild. If you take inflation into account over that period he points out that you would need closer to $300,000. So from all of the sources of funds from what used to be capital input for the charity to get those nursing home beds built in the first place, Bankstown will be in the situation where for the first time ever it will have to borrow. It will have to borrow $5 million straight up in order to duplicate those hostel beds. Mr Madden looks at the way in which money under this bill can flow into a charitable trust such as Bankstown's. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following shows the effect this mix would have on any charity running a 50-bed nursing home. If a resident is taken into care as a concessional resident and the charity is paid $5 per day then in a year they would receive $1,825. If a resident is taken into care and pays an accommodation bond of $88,000, then the charity can deduct $2,600 per annum for a maximum of five years, (or $13,000) from the bond, plus the interest it gets off the bond. Presuming 5 per cent interest per annum on $88,000 ($4,400) and adding to that the $2,600 gives the charity $7,000 per annum if a person pays the full bond. This represents $19.18 a day.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The equations are that if you have a 50-bed 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4913"> nursing home with an accommodation bond of $88,000, that generates about $350,000 per annum for the charity. If, however, you have 30 per cent concessional residents, it is about $272,000. If you have 40 per cent, it is down to $246,000. If you have a 60 per cent intake it is $194,750. If you need $300,000 income and you are only getting $220,000 or $194,000, then your deficit will grow year by year over those 20 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government in this bill has indicated that all nursing homes should take in concessional patients, but it should be based on socio&hyphen;economic factors. In Hunters Hill, as an example given by the minister, they should take about 10 per cent of concessional patients. They would have to forgo $25,875 per annum. But in Bankstown if they had to take 30 per cent of concessional residents they would forgo $77,625 a year. So over 20 years, Bankstown's frail aged trust would be out of pocket by more than $1&half; million. It would be that much less able to rebuild its nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Madden puts this proposition: he does not think that this bill is equitable or non&hyphen;discriminatory because of that absolute effect. He suggests this system to make the situation more equitable between different providers, between the charitable institutions and the for&hyphen;profit providers who provided so much of the input to the minister in relation to these changes. Mr Madden says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A far better system would be for all service providers who receive any form of government subsidy to have a flat rate of concessional residents of, say, 20 per cent and that for those residents the government would pay $5 per day. However, for any residents in excess of 20 per cent, regardless of what socio&hyphen;economic area they came from, the government should pay the same rate per day the organisation would get if a person was a full accommodation bond paying resident, and that is $19.18 a day. This would be equitable, it would not be discriminatory and it would be uniform across all socio&hyphen;economic areas. An organisation would not be penalised because it is trying to provide care in a poorer area compared to another charity trying to provide the same accommodation to the same standard in a more wealthy area.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I started this debate arguing that in relation to this Aged Care Bill 1997 the coalition  government is mad and bad and dangerous. It is dangerous because it has taken a tripartite 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> program that worked exceptionally well for more than a decade and broken it into small pieces. It has coalesced nursing home and hostel beds. It has got out of the game of providing capital funding. It has heaped that on the heads of the individual citizens of Australia because this coalition government does not believe in supporting the people of Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;`What is this talk about paying to get into a nursing home? I have just visited an old mate in a home and I wouldn't live there if you paid me.' This was the opening of a conversation I had with a Dunkley elector on the subject of the government's aged care accommodation reforms. He had seen the product of Labor's regime and, to quote the terms used by the member for Blaxland (Mr Hatton), `the three&hyphen;tier regime'. Let me tell you, member for Blaxland, for one of those tiers, nursing homes, the tears were everywhere. They were about people contemplating moving into some of them. The three&hyphen;tier system has one big problem and we have got one good plan to fix it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Dunkley elector had applied the ultimate test of asking himself whether he would like to be accommodated in parts of the system, particularly in some of the nursing homes that Labor left in such a parlous state, with soul destroying living conditions that some elderly people were forced to endure while the former Labor government looked the other way and with low standard premises failing the care needs of the frailest of Australians. Labor had no plan to address these problems and the elderly people in substandard aged care accommodation had no prospect of their living conditions improving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My constituent experienced the sharp end of the problems the Labor Party ignored and that the coalition government has a plan to fix. The problems are real and warrant being publicised. The need for change is evident and compelling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Gregory report in May 1994 estimated the scale of the need to upgrade the building fabric to be a $520 million challenge&mdash;and the Labor Party turned their backs on the people affected by that challenge.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4914">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From a sample of 150 nursing homes, the deficiencies that impeded the proper care of frail residents included: 75 per cent of homes needed fixing or rebuilding to meet Australian design standards, 70 per cent of homes needed fixing or rebuilding to meet Commonwealth outcome standards, and, for the benefit of `Mr Dangerous Mad and Bad', the member for Blaxland, 13 per cent of homes did not meet fire authority standards&mdash;and that is dangerous. And 39 per cent of residents were in rooms of four or more beds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The practical care needs of residents were found to be compromised by poor access and mobility difficulties created by narrow doorways and poor building designs, bathrooms that impeded nursing assistance when bathing and insufficient heating and cooling. These were the problems and Labor had no plan to fix them, certainly not the half billion dollars that were required under the model that has just been advocated by the member for Blaxland. The Gregory report concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The lack of incentive to maintain good quality nursing home stock is a result of the funding system, under which nursing homes receive a set amount for each resident, based on resident frailty, which is the same regardless of the age and condition of the building.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government's aged care accommodation reforms, which it seeks to enact through the Aged Care Bill 1997, not only introduce the type of incentives Gregory was looking for to maintain the quality of nursing homes, but they put into place positive obligations on the proprietors of substandard facilities to lift their game. The reforms provided through this bill directly deal with my constituent's concerns about the quality of accommodation, as well as securing affordable access on a fair and sustainable basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is changing the aged care arrangements because people's expectations have changed. As my earlier example demonstrates, a higher quality standard of care is demanded from those in the Dunkley community currently enjoying what can be very exciting times as senior members, but they are contemplating a future possibly in aged care  accommodation. No longer are shabby, run&hyphen;down nursing homes acceptable when two in every five residents have to share a room of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> four or more beds. No longer is it right that we deny old people the same number of accommodation and lifestyle choices that we give to young members of our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most importantly, the coalition government wants to give older Australians the dignity, comfort and security in their lives that is so necessary for them to feel valued members of the Australian society. Times have also changed in the aged care sector itself. Half of the existing hostel residents are frail enough to qualify for nursing home care. Yet, under the current system, a hostel resident gets an average annual Commonwealth subsidy of under $10,000, compared with almost $29,000 if the same person were in a nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aged care is one of the most important issues facing the community of Dunkley by the bay. At the 1991 census, Dunkley had around 18,000 residents aged 60 or over. Senior citizens are an especially large proportion of the population in Mornington where, in 1991, they comprised almost 23 per cent of all the residents. Contrary to popular impressions, there was then a higher proportion of people aged 60&hyphen;plus in Frankston at 17&half; per cent, compared to Mount Eliza at 16.4 per cent. In Seaford, 14.1 per cent of the residents are aged 60 or over and it is only in two areas that I represent&mdash;Frankston North and Langwarrin&mdash;that the aged are not as numerically significant as in these other areas. Ten per cent and five per cent respectively of the general population are 60 or over in these communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hostels in Dunkley such as RSL Park, which I have had the pleasure of visiting with the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) and Milpara Park, where I officially opened an upgrading of their facilities just in the last week, play an important role in Dunkley. So do nursing homes such as the George Vowell Centre in Mt Eliza, which the minister has also inspected in one of her numerous tours around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key objectives of the Aged Care Bill 1997 are quite straightforward. High quality care for everyone regardless of a person's income or location is first. More choice and flexibility follows. Safe, appropriate and comfortable accommodation for everyone is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4915"> a key aim. It is also important that providers have the time to care, instead of being occupied trying to cope with red tape and paperwork. Unification of the hostel and nursing home sectors, and the introduction of a fairer, simpler subsidy system are also key goals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The implementation of arrangements that are affordable, but nonetheless seek a fair and reasonable contribution from residents who have the ability to pay, is a further objective. But perhaps most importantly, as I have suggested previously, are consumer protection measures that ensure accommodation bonds and the standard of care are up to scratch. They are very important parts of this package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consumer protection is a central plank of the coalition's plan. A prudential scheme for accommodation bonds will be established. Contrast this with Labor's inaction. While we listen to the bleatings of the Labor shadow minister for scaring, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), we might well ask why, during Labor's 13 years in office, they failed to produce a single element of consumer protection for the entry contributions paid by people in hostels. Why have things suddenly changed in the 14&half;th year?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition is also for the first time actually mandating&mdash;making it compulsory&mdash;for aged care accommodation providers to set aside a guaranteed percentage of beds, a national minimum of 27 per cent, for concessional residents, those financially disadvantaged people who do not have the means that some other members of our community have. If the need is assessed as being greater than this figure in Dunkley, this figure will be adjusted. Labor never did this either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concessional residents will also attract an additional subsidy of $5 per day, whether they are in a hostel or a nursing home under the new unified aged care system. Again, this is better than Labor's approach, which offered $3 for people in hostels as an extra subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the parliament last year, I called on the government's new aged care assessment instrument to take account of sensory impairment and multiple disabilities. I have since  been very pleased that the Minister for Family Services has granted $320,000 from the aged care support fund to the Association for the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Blind, with $200,000 of this going towards a telephone support service allowing the association to promote and extend its services to all people suffering sensory loss. The government has also provided $100,000 to the National Centre for Ageing and Sensory Loss and a further $20,000 as a one-off grant for a study to investigate the future role of the centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was hopeful of a more overt expression of the importance and the care implications of sensory loss and multiple disability in this package, but I have been assured that sensory impairment will be taken into account when the single classification instrument is applied. I am very encouraged by that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The single classification instrument is one of the other important changes of the government's reforms. Put simply, this means that residents with similar care needs will be funded equally no matter what type of facility they live in. For the first time, dementia care needs will be properly identified and resourced. Currently, people with dementia are cared for in hostels and attract less funding than in nursing homes, even if their needs are similar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hand in hand with the introduction of a single residential classification unit is the coalition's move to a new quality assurance system. I endorse the minister's comments that giving the industry greater responsibility for its own quality assurance is the most appropriate way to achieve improvements. This is not a matter of taking an immediate big stick to the industry; rather providers have to shape up or ship out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Working with aged care providers and developing realistic expectations to be implemented through the new Aged Care Standards Agency from January 1998 are good ways to achieve better quality in aged care accommodation. Of course, the government has flagged in its fact sheet that, unless accreditation can be delivered, Commonwealth funding will not be forthcoming into the future. It is a pretty impressive incentive to address some of those problems and the sorts of perceptions I shared earlier from my constituent.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4916">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Professor Gregory indicated in his seminal review of the structure of nursing home funding arrangements, nursing home infrastructure has been in decline. To use the word `crisis' is no exaggeration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To charge an accommodation bond under the government's proposals, services will need to meet the standards of building and care quality embraced by the accreditation system. The government is not imposing a $26,000 entry contribution, as those opposite seek to assert at times. This is nonsense. What is actually happening is that a non-compulsory accommodation bond may be asked of residents who can afford it, to be drawn down by not more than $2,600 a year for five years. For the residents who can afford it, they must be able to retain $22,000 of their own assets for a single person or $45,000 for a couple after they have been charged an accommodation bond they have agreed to. That is five times the amount of the annual pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The non-compulsory accommodation bond cannot be asked for unless the facility has reached prescribed standards. Residents who are in nursing homes on 1 July will not be asked for this accommodation bond, and short stay, non&hyphen;permanent residents of up to six months cannot be asked to pay a bond, although a means tested service charge may apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Current hostel residents remain subject to the arrangements in place before 1 July, with some caps on outgoings. For residents who leave a nursing home or pass away, they or their estates will receive any balance of the accommodation band that is owing to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who move from one aged care accommodation facility to another will not have to pay a second bond. A set number of concessional residents to be accommodated within these facilities has been established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might add that it was this area where I probably had the most objection from a resident in my community. He was a fairly young man&mdash;I like to say that because he was around my age&mdash;who came in to my office and was quite appalled that the government  would be seeking accommodation bonds from people who were able to afford them. As we 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> talked around and the semantics were being shared about the basis of his concern, he finally shared with me what he was worried about. He was worried about the impact on his inheritance. That was more important to him than ensuring that his parents had the sort of care and support they needed. It was an appalling example of some of the sentiment that is behind objection to the accommodation bonds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Entry contributions have worked well in hostels since 1988. Financially disadvantaged people have a higher than average chance of getting into a hostel and have so in the past. This gives the lie to Labor's claims that the coalition's changes will make it hard for people with few assets to obtain a bed in a nursing home. As was said by Labor's Gary Johns, a former minister, in his now famous letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 19 September last year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . why should Kerry Packer be able to enter a nursing home for free? The fact is that the system already applies to hostels, so why not extend it to nursing homes? . . . the residential home is not an asset if the partner remains in it, or for instance if a disabled child needs it. . . the resident must always be left with an asset of at least 250 per cent of the pension, which is around $22,000.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Labor allowed millionaire nursing home residents to pay fixed, flat low fees. If the same person was in a hostel, they usually received less care but would pay more for it. The coalition believes that it is time to unify the different types of aged care facilities and make sure those who can afford it make a reasonable contribution towards their care. The two&hyphen;thirds of nursing home residents who receive the full age pension will pay no more in minimum daily fees than they pay now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One other important issue is the security of residents' contributions in nursing homes. It would not be unnatural for older Australians who lost their life savings in the Pyramid Bank collapse to be concerned about how those funds were being managed. I welcome the minister's assurances that a mandatory prudential scheme will be introduced to protect residents if an aged care service provider experiences financial difficulty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am delighted that the industry itself recognises that standards have to improve. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4917"> The National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals stated, in August 1996, that the government's changes will:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . overcome the matters long outstanding regarding the need to address the urgent capital upgrading of nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The distinction between CAMs and SAMs will end from 1 July. This will help nursing home proprietors to spend more time on providing quality care and less on paperwork. However, to guard against misuse of public money, the validation program will continue until the middle of 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quality care for the aged is a priority of the coalition government. In 1997&hyphen;98 more than $3.7 billion is being spent: an increase of almost seven per cent&mdash;way above the predicted inflation rise over this next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the minister visited Dunkley I reminded her of my interest in offering our senior citizens more choices. That is why I am so pleased that, in implementing the aged care structural reform package, the minister has listened and consulted widely. The four working groups she established comprise consumers, providers, staff and technical experts as well as academics. The date of implementation for aged care changes is fast approaching. On 1 July new doors will be opened for Dunkley's older citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to share with you the sorts of reactions I am getting from my local providers as I talk to them about the changes. I know my friend and colleague the member for Deakin (Mr Barresi) has been busy consulting with his aged care facility providers also. Mr Frank Hoff, the Chief Executive Officer of George Vowell Home and Day Care Centre in Mount Eliza said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At Brighton, the Association for the Blind already has a hostel . . . it has worked quite well . . . The trade&hyphen;off is that, with the entry contributions, we can provide facilities that we couldn't in any other way . . .

<PARA STYLE="Para">We have been keen to provide them with additional information. To continue:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill attempts to introduce dramatic change to the provision of aged care in our community. As is being seen in other social policy areas, this government's philosophical approach is being hidden in what I would call a smokescreen of financial gobbledegook. The reality is this: people generally do not choose to live in a nursing home. The comparison continually put before this House between nursing homes and hostels is quite misleading. A bed in a nursing home is a health requirement. Other alternatives at that point in the individual's life are not available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister and members opposite can continue with these silly remarks of scare campaigns&mdash;and silly they are&mdash;for as long as they like but the community out there see through that lightweight, weak response. If you choose not to believe us, that is fine. But if you continue to choose to ignore the aged care sector, you do so at your peril. It is important that the records show the comments and the concerns coming from this area of important service delivery. I intend to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I received a fax today from Aged Care Australia and I would like to quote some sections from this fax:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite six months of discussions, ACA still cannot confirm details of the application of the proposed Resident Classification Scale and therefore cannot determine the recurrent funding which will be available to a facility for the care of residents. The costs of Prudential arrangements are still unknown. The cost of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4918"> the Accreditation Agency is unknown. The cost of Certification of existing buildings is being carried almost entirely by providers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further on it reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACA also cannot support the Government's proposal that $5 per resident per day should be paid to providers as a so&hyphen;called incentive to provide access to low income residents. This subsidy is provided to enable providers to carry out needed improvements to the quality of buildings but this amount cannot possibly achieve this objective. Given the other changes which have been made to the funding mechanisms for aged care, this proposition is completely unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concerns listed above are compounded by the fact that the final draft of subordinate legislation critical to implementation has not been sighted.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And finally:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As of today we have insufficient information about certain critical elements of the proposals and we cannot support the Government's proposal for the Concessional Resident Supplement.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would now like to refer to a service provider very close to my own electorate. In fact, many of my residents have a great deal to do with Mirinjani Retirement Village at Weston. I received an urgent letter from them two or three days ago. It reads, in part, that Mirinjani Retirement Village wish:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to express our deep concerns with the Government's announcement on Tuesday of the proposed recurrent supplement to be paid for concessional residents in residential aged care facilities. This daily rate will only be $5 a day and will place not&hyphen;for&hyphen;profit providers in an extremely difficult situation of being able to provide for this vulnerable group of older Australians. . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amount of $5 a day equates to $1,825 a year, which is less than the allowable retention rate from an accommodation bond of $2,600. The concessional subsidy is not comparable with the accommodation bond.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This funding arrangement for aged care organisations has the strong potential to see the development of a two&hyphen;tiered care system, where one group will have access to modern facilities, and the other group housed in older and inferior accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This needs to at least equate to the accommodation bond retention rate of $2,600 per year. This would need to be $7.20 a day&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">for the not&hyphen;for&hyphen;profit aged care organisations. That is from Mirinjani Retirement Village in Weston, Canberra, which is a multifaceted service provider for our aged.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another group that has come to my attention in the last week is the Australian Catholic Health Care Association. They have sent us a paper on behalf of the Alzheimers Association Australia, the Australian Catholic Health Care Association, the Australian Council of Social Service, the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, Baptist Care Australia, Churches of Christ Network of Aged Care Services, the Salvation Army and Community Services Australia&mdash;Uniting Church. The covering note from the Catholic Health Care Association includes this quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the groups' concerns focus on people who are elderly and frail being further disadvantaged by being denied access to high quality services due to their income and asset limitations. The Aged Care Bill offers little guarantee that with the use of accommodation bonds older people on low incomes will have their right of access to quality residential aged care places.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Within the paper accompanying that and representing the group whose names I have just read out, under the heading `Impact on equity', they state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A strong feature of the current system is its horizontal and vertical equity. Nursing home residents have equal access to the system regardless of income or assets.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the new system, whilst income will not be a barrier other than entry into Exempt facilities (to be called `extra service places'), assets&mdash;or, in other words, the capacity to pay an Accommodation Bond&mdash;will.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has the potential to result in a two tiered system. Socio&hyphen;economically deprived suburbs will have lesser quality buildings, whilst within some facilities the quality of the accommodation will depend on the resident's capacity to pay an Accommodation Bond.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have a couple more quotes, and I want to preface them by saying that it is terribly important that in this House we have the opportunity to put these things on record. This is not scaremongering from the opposition. These are comments from people&mdash;a lot of them fairly conservative groups in the world&mdash;who really have a view about what this Aged Care Bill is attempting to do to the care of our aged in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now have a paper in front of me dated 3 June from the Aged Services Association of New South Wales and the ACT Inc. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Aged Services Association of NSW &amp; ACT (ASA) 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4919"> today called on all Federal Members of Parliament, who will be debating the Government's proposed Aged Care Bill tomorrow, to argue for at least $12 a day in funding to support the care of those frail aged Australians who are financially disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While ASA has welcomed the Minister's deferral of the introduction of the Government's major reforms to aged care from 1st July to 1st October, the Government's intention to debate the new legislation in the Lower House in the absence of the subordinate legislation and without knowing whether the model can be viable means that there can be no informed debate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We ask all Federal MPs to ask Minister Moylan for details on the new prudential arrangements, the guidelines on the new classification scale, the cost of funding the new accreditation process, and how she will honour her commitment to review the effectiveness of the reform process.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The last paper I want to refer to today is from the Churches of Christ Homes and Community Services Inc. This is a fairly detailed paper sent some two to three weeks ago. They say at the beginning, `We plead with you to read the contents of this letter.' The writer of the letter is the Chief Executive of the organisation, Wayne Belcher. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My fear for my residents and staff is that these changes will hurt many frail, dependent residents across Australia, their families and carers. These people live and die in your electorate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He says that to the MPs to whom that letter is addressed. A further objection to this bill follows from the untargeted nature of this $5 per day subsidy. Labor's capital funding was targeted. It was directed at those institutions that needed it most and those people in the highest need. Under this bill, if no upgrade is required, or if the proprietor simply chooses, these taxpayer dollars&mdash;or proceeds of the sales of the pensioners' homes&mdash;need not go into capital upgrades. They can be taken as profit. Under Labor, capital funding for new and replacement not&hyphen;for&hyphen;profit hostels&mdash;90 per cent of hostels&mdash;was provided according to a targeted formula called variable capital funding. The emphasis was on enabling hostels to provide places for financially disadvantaged people. The proportion of financially disadvantaged people to be accommodated actually determined the level of capital grant payable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994, each FDP place attracted a build 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing subsidy of $50,550 and a land subsidy of $7,300. The funding of non&hyphen;FDP places was linked to the funding of FDP places. Thus, as the number of FDP places increased, so did the number of other places funded. As for the allegation by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) earlier this week that the Labor government stubbornly refused to inject more capital into the aged care sector, I refer him to the department of health annual reports which show that up until 1995 Labor invested $1.2 billion dollars into capital expenditure on aged care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To give but one direct piece of evidence to further illustrate that point, the Reverend Harry Herbert, Chair of Community Services Australia, in giving evidence before the recent Senate committee of inquiry into aged care, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in the last two years, the Uniting Church in NSW has received for the construction of hostels, $7,736,750&mdash;a large sum of money. None of these projects in regard to hostels would have proceeded without those capital grants.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Please note, Prime Minister&mdash;capital grants. The Reverend Herbert went on to say in his evidence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation&mdash;that is, your Aged Care Bill&mdash;ends all those capital grants.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Labor believes that nursing home care should be available to all Australians on the basis of clinical need and not on the basis of how much money you have. The capital for nursing home upgrades should come from general revenue and be applied on a needs basis. If the government can give $2 billion in tax breaks to the wealthy, give itself a $1.4 billion re&hyphen;election slush fund in the form of the Natural Heritage Trust and give another $1.7 billion in health insurance tax breaks to wealthy people, it can afford the money which the aged care sector say is all that is needed to overcome their current problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I close by saying this: for the sake of our older Australians confronted by the need to enter a nursing home at the most vulnerable time of their lives, and that of their families, please rethink this and stop your economic madness. Pass the amendments which will be moved by the shadow minister and which have been foreshadowed. Do it for the sake of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4920"> my electorate and the people in my electorate who have come to see me&mdash;individuals who have sat in my office, individuals with whom I have had conversations with in the supermarket, everywhere&mdash;and who are saying to me that the impost it is going to bring to their families is just over the top.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think the government really realises to what degree the level of disappointment and dismay is now perpetrating out there amongst particularly our older people and our families in general. We should not be putting our families up for bartering for the sake of money. As I said a moment ago, entry into a nursing home should have nothing to do with that primarily. It should have a lot to do with whether or not you clinically need to go into that nursing home and, if you do, you should be able to.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the changes that the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) is introducing with the Aged Care Bill. I think it is long overdue. After having listened to the previous speaker, I can only think that those in opposition are living in a different world. There are many sensible and significant changes being proposed in this bill. One of the main and symbolic ones is that we are going to merge, for the first time, hostels and nursing homes&mdash;put them under the one roof, so to speak&mdash;over a period of time. I think that will be very beneficial indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has many side benefits. I see cases where a married couple are both in a hostel. One deteriorates in health and has to move to a nursing home. The couple has to be split up because one has to be moved away. That is very tragic. There is no logic to it. That will cease under this bill. We also have the situation in my electorate where many hostels have in them people who should really be classified as needing to be in nursing homes. There  are high percentages of them. This artificial barrier, which is long overdue to be changed, will break down. That is a good thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The instrument that will drive this is the new residential classification scale, which means that people will be funded according to their care needs rather than their means. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> There will be eight funding categories and people can be upgraded as their health deteriorates over a period of time. That is the logical way to go with patients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most exciting things in the new package is the way the minister is dealing with dementia care. This has been a long&hyphen;neglected area. Those with dementia have been funded in the past according to their overall physical health, which is often good. These people are ambulatory; they can move around. But in a hostel or nursing home situation, they can cause great disruption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the assessment of these people, the weighting given to dementia will effectively double. I think it moves from eight percentage points up to about 18 percentage points. I am told this will mean that, in practice, funding for dementia patients will increase by 30 per cent or more. This will mean that some aged person accommodation facilities will be able to specialise wholly or partially in dementia care. If they do so partially, for example, they can put on a dementia wing so that these types of people can be contained within that wing and not interfere with other patients in the facility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The accommodation bond, or the old entry fee, has received a great deal of criticism from the opposition as they have run their scare campaign over recent months. That is unfortunate, and to some extent it is hypocritical. Entry fees for hostels have been introduced by the Labor Party for almost a decade in this country. Because we are putting hostels and nursing homes under the same roof, we are just extending this entry fee to nursing homes. There is nothing remarkable about it at all. In fact, entry fees&mdash;now to be called accommodation bonds&mdash;have worked very well in hostels. They have worked very well for the providers as they have given them some capital to keep hostels upgraded. You have only to compare the standard of most hostels with nursing homes to see the difference that the fees have made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 12&half; years that I have been a member of parliament, I have never received one complaint from one constituent about entry fees into hostels. In fact, I was curious to see what was charged. In my main centre of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4921"> Dubbo, I asked all the providers about that. The entry fees that were charged for hostel accommodation ranged from zero to $200,000. So, if people are well&hyphen;off, they pay something; if they cannot afford it, they still get accommodation anyhow. It worked very well. It was supported by the Labor Party and it was supported by the coalition. Nobody batted an eyelid about it. Now we are extending it to nursing home type patients and suddenly the sky is apparently going to fall in. It is totally beyond me as to why this would be. I can only put it down to a misleading scare campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apparently there is now charged across Australia an average entry fee into hostels of $26,000. If that is going to be the Australian average to get into an aged care facility in the future, for most people absolutely nothing changes whatsoever. I stress that, in respect of nursing home type patients, under the new arrangements for anybody who is in a nursing home now the arrangements will not change at all. You will not be charged an entry fee. So those people will be quarantined from any fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, anyone coming into a nursing home type situation will not have to pay anything for the first six months. So, if you move out, or if you pass on, obviously no payment will be made in that area. To that extent, it is more lenient than what has existed for people who have entered hostel accommodation over the last decade or so in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also it is a fee that the government does not impose on anyone. It is purely up to the provider as to whether they charge it or not and there will be some very strict rules put in place as to how it will be administered. An amount of money roughly equivalent to 2&half; times the pension must be left in the patient's bank account. At the moment, for a single pensioner that is about $22,500 and something close to double that for married couples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nobody at all is going to be forced to sell their home. So, if you have a spouse still living in your home, that spouse can continue to live in that home. If you have a carer or a close relative who has been looking after you for a period of time, they may stay in that home. But, if it is obvious that you have the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> means to make a contribution towards your upkeep in aged person's accommodation, you will be expected to pay something. That is only fair and just when there is such a shortfall in the funding that is needed for aged person accommodation facilities. That has been the case, as I say, with hostels for the last decade or so. It has worked very well in the past and it will continue to work very well in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of any accommodation bond that is paid, only $2,600 a year can be drawn down permanently for the use of the owner or provider of the aged person accommodation facility, and then only each year for a five&hyphen;year period. So a maximum withdrawal would be $13,000 over five years. It would actually be over 5&half; years because you are not charged for the first six months. So, after you leave the facility or you pass on, the remaining amount is returned to your estate. It will be protected by strict prudential requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting, and unfortunate, that the average stay in nursing home accommodation is in the order of only three years. So, if you did not pay anything for the first six months, after 2&half; years only $6,500 would have been taken out of any accommodation bond that was paid anyhow and the rest would be returned to your estate. So these are quite modest sums indeed. Of course, the providers of the facility would have the use of the interest on the accommodation bond to upgrade and maintain a higher standard that has existed in the past for you, the patient, to live in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it will be your money being spent for your benefit. Again, I think that is the only logical way to go because, as has been stated earlier in the debate, and it is worth stating again, there is a capital funding crisis in nursing home type accommodation now in Australia: 11 per cent of them are not up to speed as far as fire standards go, 15 per cent of them are behind on health standards and 40 per cent of the facilities have four or more people in the same room.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Gregory, who did the study initiated by the previous government, said that you would need an injection of capital fund 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4922"> ing in the order of $125 million a year to bring the upgrading up to the standard it should be before you even think of providing for extra places. Apparently, the previous government's response to this was to provide $10 million a year, which obviously is totally inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other changes that we are proposing too. Under the old system, there was far too much red tape and bureaucracy and the acquittal procedures were far too onerous. Providers had to account for virtually every staff minute of every day. Those will be simplified greatly, and I am sure that will be welcomed by the providers of these facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also look at financially disadvantaged people, who are going to be called concessional residents. On average Australia-wide, there are 27 per cent of these people in such facilities. So we will make it a requirement that each facility has to take, on average, 27 per cent of concessional residents. Obviously, this will vary from region to region and the percentage for each region will be set.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be giving an extra $1,825 a year, I believe, which will go towards the upkeep of these residents over and above what the providers will be getting from the government otherwise. I think the previous government was giving something in the order of $3 for those in hostels, nothing in nursing homes. We will be giving $5 in the first instance, and I hope that will be extended in future years to everybody. So I think that is very good indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One section in this bill which I am particularly pleased to see is the viability funding. Small services in remote and isolated areas will receive a viability subsidy. This will be paid in addition to the care subsidies. For facilities in isolated areas that have 15 or fewer places, that will work out at $16.25. For those with up to 29 people in their facility, that will be reduced to $10, and so it goes  down a scale whether you are in an isolated area, a remote area or a rural area outside the large centres. It varies between $1 and $16.25. It will make those viable. In addition, we are also providing $40 million over four years in capital grants so that rural and remote 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> areas can upgrade, which I think is very good indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the time remaining to me, I want to make some comments particularly pertinent to my electorate about the formula of how areas are allocated places. The present formula as it exists is 100 places allocated for each thousand of population over the age of 70 years. Those 100 places are broken up into 40 nursing home places, 50 hostel places and 10 community aged care packages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because nursing homes and hostels will be going under the one roof, that figure of 40 and 50 will become 90 and that will give the facilities much more flexibility. They can have all nursing home type patients if they wish; they can have all hostel type patients if they wish; they can have dementia patients if they wish. That will be a great assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I want to raise over and above the issue of the viability funding and the capital funding for rural and remote areas is a particular problem that exists in country areas. If you are an aged person that needs to go into such a facility in the city, in your suburb, and there is not a place available for you, what happens? You go out to the next suburb that can accommodate you&mdash;which may be five or 10 or, at the most, 15 or 20 kilometres away&mdash;and you look there. If you work through half a dozen suburbs, eventually you will find a facility that can accommodate you. So, sure, you may not find a place exactly where you live, but you are not that far away&mdash;only 10 or 15 kilometres&mdash;and your relatives can still visit you, and the system works very well indeed. But if you are in the bush, that is not so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you live in a town like Cobar, for example, in my electorate and there are no places available&mdash;as there are not at the moment in Cobar&mdash;the next available places happen to be in Brewarrina, which is several hundred kilometres away. To ship people out of a country town hundreds of kilometres away to another town when they are in the twilight of their life, in a frail condition, when their health is failing, is a cruel and distressing thing to do. Even though Cobar has a population of 7,000 people, it happens to have 14 nursing home places and 14 hostel places. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4923"> Because it has a low number of people&mdash;not much in excess of 200&mdash;over the age of 70, the number of places they have got makes them about 35 per cent over quota. So in all conscience I, as the local member, cannot ask for more places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nyngan, which is only a hundred&hyphen;odd kilometres away, does not have any nursing home places at all. People from Nyngan have to be next on the list for when places become available. It means that they have to be shipped several hundred kilometres away. It is almost a sentence of death. Their relatives are not able to visit them as much as they could if they could get a place nearby. These people pine, they do not do well. It is a great problem. In Broken Hill, it is even worse. The nearest place to go to is Adelaide, 550 kilometres away; Sydney is 1,200 kilometres away. So there is no easy solution. If you come from Tibooburra, which is 330 kilometres from Broken Hill, you have got an even greater problem. What do we do about this? How do we overcome it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a lot of country towns, if there is a hospital with spare beds, they put these people in that hospital on a temporary basis until a position falls due in one of the aged care facilities. That is not totally satisfactory, but it is better than being shipped out several hundred kilometres away. That is all very well. But in many instances these people are clogging up the hospitals. In Nyngan, for example, where there are no nursing home facilities, 50 per cent of the hospital is full of these people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Broken Hill, which has 111 nursing home places&mdash;that is slightly over quota for the number of nursing home places&mdash;30 per cent of the hospital is full of aged care people. There is nothing wrong with that, in a sense, except that it is messing up the surgical list. It is very difficult to attract surgeons to Broken Hill as it is, let alone to have their surgical lists constantly disrupted because  there are not enough beds in the hospital. So there is a problem there. Again, I say, `How do we overcome it?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You could probably have a situation whereby health board areas were allocated a number 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of bed places which could be moved from town to town according to a town's need. You will usually find that shire councils are willing to make available, at a cost to them&mdash;no cost to the taxpayer&mdash;the capital funding to provide these places. The Commonwealth would only be up for the recurrent funding which, for a nursing home type person, is in the order of $30,000 a year. So instead of moving a person out from Cobar to Brewarrina, they could stay in Cobar. There would be no greater cost to the government, because if the person went to Brewarrina the Commonwealth would still be up for the recurrent funding. But even that is not totally satisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we have to have a proper debate in this country, to get more funds for aged person accommodation places. To shift that formula of 90 places per 1,000 people over the age of 70 is going to be incredibly expensive indeed. Just to lift it from 90 to 100, let alone from 90 to 110, with the ageing population we have in this country and the greater expectation for these sorts of beds, hundreds of millions of dollars would be needed. Hundred of millions of dollars are not there in the budget. So we either have to have increased taxes or a special Medicare levy or a rejigging of the priority of spending in this country. It is going to be a major shift, but it has to be done and it will have to be faced up to in the next five to 10 years in this country, if not immediately. I would like to flag that debate in this country. We have to have it. For too long we have flick&hyphen;passed this responsibility that we have. If we are going to call ourselves a civilisation, we have to look after the elderly, who have given us the standard of living that we enjoy. We have to ensure that they can be looked after in a proper manner in the twilight years of their life.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In no other area of policy yet presented by the Howard government have we seen displayed such a flawed proposal based on flawed ideology as we have seen in these proposals for nursing home care. Even though I describe this as a flawed proposal, matters are compounded by the fact that it is being implemented with such flawed methodology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4924">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fairness to the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), this morning the House had an opportunity to give her time to take this bill away and to ensure that answers could be given to a number of matters that remain unclear in the government's proposal. Some of these matters that were mentioned in the motion that was defeated earlier today were: consideration of the prudential arrangements that would be put in place to safeguard the residents' up&hyphen;front entry fees; details of the classification instruments; consideration of an independent body to monitor the numbers of concessional residents and exempt beds that would be provided by regions; consideration or explanation of mechanisms for accountability for the use of the funds; and a rethink on the proposed $5 per day capital subsidy for concessional residents. I know that it is against the standing orders to reflect upon a decision of this place, but the opposition tried to give the government an out, an opportunity to consider these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another aspect of this debate that has concerned me is the galling notion from those opposite that the Labor governments under Prime Ministers Hawke and Keating had neglected aged care; that the `crisis' of nursing home care is an indication of 13 years of neglect under Labor. The past 15 months have taught me a lesson. When you are in government for 13 years, you have a record. When you have been in government for 13 years, in some areas you can have form. If you have been in government for 13 years, in some areas you can have pride. But in aged residential care there is nothing that Labor should be ashamed of about its achievements in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another thing I was careful to do was to reflect upon other contributions that I have made over the years about aged care to ensure that in my contribution to this debate today I did not trip up by contradicting myself. One of the interesting things I found in doing this investigation was that in 1986, when I first  spoke on aged care in the House of Representatives, aged care was in a parlous state. There were inequities that revolved about the way in which residential care was provided to aged people and people with disabilities.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There had been a series of inquiries that established and benchmarked where we were at at that stage. There was the expenditure committee report under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay). One always has to mention the honourable member for Watson, the Chief Opposition Whip. I do not wish to blatantly curry favour, but in this regard the McLeay report was very much an important aspect of the debate at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Senate there was the Giles report and there was a review conducted as a result of an initiative by the then Minister for Community Services, Senator Grimes. In the contribution I made in 1986, I referred to the nursing homes and hostels review. I want to mention a couple of things about the state of this sector at that time. I quoted the review stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government, deficit&hyphen;financed and participating non-profit homes predominate in low socio&hyphen;economic areas.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The report further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there are considerably more participating&hyphen;for&hyphen;profit homes in high status areas.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">My great fear is that the brave new world of aged care envisaged by the present government will return us to this type of situation; that as the years go on, if their version of aged care is implemented, we will have yet again developed a two-tier system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This piece of legislation perhaps more than any other represents the mean&hyphen;spiritedness of the government. It has been condemned by a wide range of groups involved in aged care in Australia. For instance, just today Aged Care Australia announced that it cannot support the passage of this legislation. Aged Care Australia, the largest provider group of residential aged care services in Australia, representing 1,300 hostels and nursing homes, states that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has provided insufficient information for our members to be confident that the proposals are viable . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is from an organisation which admits that it might support the thrust of the government's changes. Aged Care Australia goes on state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACA can only give its support for the Aged Care Bill 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4925"> when we have full knowledge and understanding of the proposals, and when we are confident about the provision of appropriate funding.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That goes directly to the heart of my comments about the implementation being a flawed methodology. The ACA statement indicates the widespread dissatisfaction with this piece of legislation, whether it be due to its flaws or because of the injustice it represents. The government still has not framed any arrangements to protect people's entry contributions. The legislation is before us, and there is no framework yet in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has still not worked out what the auditing procedures to formally monitor the quality of care in nursing homes will be. The bill does not mention the ratio of paid beds to concessional beds. There is nothing about the classification instrument used to determine the rate of residential care subsidy. The government is treating the parliament with contempt by asking the House to consider this legislation with so many unanswered questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the absence of all this information, there is a great deal of concern in the community. Despite this, the government has the cheek to call the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) the shadow minister for scaring because she has been vocal in pointing out the deficiencies in this legislation. However, it is the uncertainty created by the government's own contradictions in the legislation that has concerned and even scared people. The injustices in this legislation are glaringly obvious. The government claims that no-one will be forced to sell their homes, yet the legislation specifically includes the family home as an asset.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government cannot have it both ways. If it wanted to guarantee that no-one would have to sell their homes, it could have excluded them from any assets test. However, the minister and the government members themselves cannot seem to agree on the implications for the family home. Since the entry  contribution was announced, a string of government members have stood in this place and guaranteed that no-one will have to sell their homes to get into a nursing home. Then today in this debate the member for Hind 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> marsh (Mrs Gallus) asked whether it would really be so bad if the family home had to be sold. I can assure her that, to the majority of constituents in my electorate, it would be. Later in the debate the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) said that no-one would have to sell their homes, but then added that it was not really the family home any more because no-one lived there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister and government members who have stated publicly that no-one need sell their homes must be aware that the opposition will hold them to this guarantee. They will be called to explain themselves when the first sales occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sale of the family home is not the only injustice in this bill. The government fails to fundamentally understand that hostels are completely different from nursing homes. Hostels are an accommodation option. Nursing homes are about care. This issue is about access to care. If the government is so concerned about the condition of Australia's nursing homes, why did it decide to slash around $577 million from aged care in the 1996 budget? The government's primary concern was to reduce funding for aged care and transfer this to the users of the nursing homes. It should not be deceitful and claim that it does this to upgrade buildings or to provide services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at the proposal that is contained in this policy, we see that there is no upper limit on the size of the entry contribution. There is really no idea how much a place in a nursing home will cost. The government argues that there is a crisis in nursing home capital stock and that this is the justification for the entry fee. Yet the legislation does not even require this. In addition, the interest earned on the entry fee is kept by the nursing home and can also be taken purely as profit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is these contradictions in this poorly thought out bill that are causing angst in the community. The government should not try to put this one on the opposition. The community concern is justified and has been created entirely by the government. The government has been putting out this furphy that their nursing home policy is simply an extension of the previous Labor government's hostel 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4926"> policy. The government says this as if hostels are interchangeable with nursing homes. One of the essential ingredients of their policy is the amalgamation of nursing homes and hostels into a single care institution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While there are people in the aged care sector who have little objection to such an amalgamation, it is the proposal that the hostel funding system can be simply transferred over to apply to nursing homes that is really at the heart of the opposition's objections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has alleged that Labor should be supporting the bill because it is `modelled on one of your measures'. In other words, we should support this because the system of nursing home entry will be the same for nursing homes as we introduced for hostels. As has been explained time and again but has still been ignored by the government, nursing homes and hostels are different in the way people come to enter them and in the type of people who live in them. They were created separately and set up with different funding mechanisms for this reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, hostels are about accommodation. The government has that much right. But nursing homes are about care. People take months to decide to move into a hostel and make all the arrangements to do so. But nursing home entry is not about choice; it is about getting care and, in some cases, getting it fast in days or even hours. It is out of necessity. More than of 60 per cent of those entering nursing homes come from an acute hospital after a serious illness such as a stroke. Many are also suffering from some degree of dementia. A less appropriate condition for engaging in negotiations over the size of entry fees and the sale of one's house is hard to imagine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I stress that access to nursing homes is not a choice. It is based on need. At the heart of the opposition's concerns here is the government's proposal that much of the  regulation and operation of the aged care sector be left up to market forces. There is absolutely no way that Labor would have adopted the uncapped entry fee and market forces model of the government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like Professor Gregory, Labor believes that market forces are inappropriate regulators of care. The inquiry that is referred to quite often by government speakers and the minister is the Gregory inquiry, which investigated the capital funding needs of nursing homes. The government fails to mention Professor Gregory's comments about vehicles for raising the funds. One of the vehicles that Professor Gregory has said was not appropriate was the type of up&hyphen;front entry contribution that the government will now be putting in place. Why champion the factual information about the need for capital improvements against the indication that a model that has been suggested for getting some form of additional funding is flawed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To understand why the government has fallen into this minefield of its own making, it is necessary to understand the real motivation behind the bill. In the first place, the Howard government's major and overriding interest in aged care is to reduce the amount of money spent on older Australians. The 1996 budget cut more than half a billion dollars&mdash;$577 million&mdash;from aged care over four years. Here the savings were made by: reducing outlays on capital commitments, $244 million; reducing subsidies paid to nursing homes for care, $253 million; and introducing user charging for HACC, $72 million. Thus, it must be stressed that the Howard government's primary consideration is saving money, not necessarily concern for building upgrades or provision of services for older Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The philosophic underpinning of the government's policy on aged care can be found in the report of the National Commission of Audit. This report raised concerns about the pressure on government expenditure resulting from the ageing of the population, especially expenditure on health care, nursing home care and the age pension. The commission recommended greater reliance on user charging, introduction of more competition and devolution of services to the states. The report suggested that that last point alone will save 10 per cent. The report also recommended the introduction of entry and exit fees for nursing homes.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4927">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the National Commission of Audit report gives no explanation about the basis to the conclusions that that audit came to on nursing homes. It is a very scant document which is very silent about the methodology that was used by the audit to come to the conclusions. Even worse, because of the government's decision not to make a formal response to the National Commission of Audit, there has been no explanation as to why the government has adopted this proposal contained within the National Commission of Audit report. As I have said in relation to issues other than nursing homes, in the absence of a formal response to the National Commission of Audit report the government is just successively, especially in budgets, implementing some of the suggestions that were placed in the National Commission of Audit report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The desire to cut government spending on aged care and to follow the edicts of the National Commission of Audit are behind this bill&mdash;not the spurious claims of the Minister for Family Services that there is some crisis in aged care that must be addressed. As Professor Gregory puts it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Entering a nursing home is a time of considerable vulnerability and little choice for most people . . . market forces could do little to ameliorate the psychological impact of being forced to consider an entry contribution at the point of entering a nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Other aspects of the amalgamation of hostels and nursing homes need to be considered. For instance, what happens when a person living in a stand-alone hostel, which is predominantly what we have in my electorate, is properly assessed as requiring a level of care akin to what we now would understand to be nursing home care, which requires a level of formal nursing intervention in the care of a person? How does the hostel go about supplying that level of care for a particular individual who might be one out? How does a stand-alone hostel make the adequate changes to the capital infrastructure of that hostel to cater for people who live in the hostels but move to that level of care requirement? These types of questions need to be answered by the government before this procedure is implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also need to know the answer to, as the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> shadow minister put it, the catch-22 situation of aged care centres getting certain classifications. An aged care centre has to be classified in a certain way to be allowed to charge the up-front entry contribution in the form of an accommodation bond but, if it is in need of capital infrastructure improvements to get that classification, it will not get the classification and it cannot charge the accommodation bond. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

I have an unfinished agenda, you might say, but not far from the top of it was substantial reform in the way that Australia's aged residential care sector is financed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I feel that in many ways our country, despite changes in the last year, is still at five minutes to midnight. To put it into perspective, just under five per cent of us will eventually need some form of residential aged care. In the absence of a cure, about eight per cent of us over the age of 75 will eventually suffer from dementia. At the moment, about 13.3 per cent of us are over the age of 65; by the year 2050, almost a third of us will be older than 65.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Referring, as the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) did, to the National Commission of Audit report produced by Professor Bob Gregory&mdash;a report I commend to all honourable members&mdash;at the moment the aged dependency ratio in Australia is 5.3 to 1. That means that there are 5.3 Australians between the ages of 15 and 64 for every person over the age of 64 or under the age of 15. Over the next 40 years that ratio will go, according to the present population growth, to 2.6 to one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, there were 7.8 million Australians who were working and paying taxes to support 6.2 million Australians who were relying, most through no fault of their own, on some form of social security benefit. In the absence of some change in the way that we raise finances, as I said in the Main Committee only a short time ago, and also in the way in which we structure our essential 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4928"> expenditures in health, education and welfare, those trend lines will cross within a decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This reform that the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) and the government are introducing and are determined to see to an end is about vision. It is about where Australia is going to be in the year 2030. It is about ensuring that we have a sustainable, affordable residential aged care sector and one in particular in which you, I or any other member of this House would be quite happy to live.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This reform is also about changing cultural expectations, and this is where I think many on our side differ from those on the other: we are saying to younger Australians, people perhaps in my generation, that they cannot blow all their money on holidays and nice cars; they actually have to start making some provision and giving some thought to who will be financing their care when they reach an age where perhaps they are going to need it. That, in a broad sense, is what the principle, the philosophy and, I dare say, the need for this kind of legislation are all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In government, the Australian Labor Party went to the 1996 election with a policy on care for older people. There were 210 words on Australia's future in residential aged care. I am not normally one that engages in ideological invective, but I will quote that policy directly. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor recognises that there are some issues to be addressed around hostel funding and the classification system in relation to dementia care needs. Labor will pursue structural reform of the hostel sector to improve funding for dementia care in particular and higher care needs generally to be implemented from 1996 to 1997.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">For those of us who are accustomed to reading political party policies&mdash;as I am, both from the outside of the parliament and indeed from inside it&mdash;that is code for the fact that the ALP, if it had been returned to office, would have done very much what we are doing now. Whilst many of the honourable and decent members, like the member for  Scullin, would disagree with that, I have little doubt that it was on the agenda for most of those who are knowledgeable about what is required in aged care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I turn specifically to some of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> details of the bill, perhaps I ought to remind the House that, in the budget, the government actually increased the amount of money available for aged care by just under six per cent. Home and community care funding was increased by just over six per cent. But members are quite right to point out that we are introducing a user&hyphen;pays system on a means tested basis for those who can afford it. That money can be spent only on the care of the people who will be contributing to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is introducing a rigorous planning system which will cover services to people in their own homes, services in residential care for people with low care needs and people with high care needs. I suspect, from reading the 210 words in the Labor Party's policy platform, we are also unifying the residential classification instrument, which means ageing in place and allows for the capacity of providers to either provide a range of services or specialise in particular areas, such as dementia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concessional residents are people who do not have to pay an accommodation bond, or at least would not be eligible for consideration of paying a bond, and full&hyphen;time or part-time pensioners who have not owned their home in the past two years and who have assets less than $22,500 a year. For a married resident, only half of the couple's combined assets are to be counted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also to be assisted residents, and they are those who can pay only a small bond, for which a higher daily subsidy will be paid by the government. Providers who do not meet the quota for concessional residents will face deductions from their subsidy. In other words, funding will not be provided for places that concessional residents should have occupied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Vulnerable concessional residents will be protected, more so than they are now under the present system. Aged care assessment teams will assess and prioritise prospective residents in a multidisciplinary manner on the basis of need. No-one is going to go into a care institution on the basis of anything other than need, because the ACATs, as they are known, will continue to fill the role that they currently do. People who cannot afford a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4929"> bond will not be asked to pay a bond and those who are eligible have no compulsion placed upon them to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Referring to the Labor Party model introduced into the hostel sector in 1988, 40 per cent of eligible people&mdash;people who were eligible to pay a bond&mdash;have not paid a bond. The resident going in and their family, or their lawyer, or whoever they may choose to negotiate on their behalf, have up to six months to negotiate that bond. That bond may be paid within that six&hyphen;month period and go into some prudential trust arrangements, which I will cover in a moment. That bond may be paid as a higher weekly, fortnightly or monthly payment or it may be taken as a debt against the estate of that person should they pass on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment, the reality of the situation is that only four per cent of people in nursing homes return home, in most cases to die. A person may negotiate a situation where the family home is maintained, they maintain ownership of it, and the bond, or at least the necessary draw down and interest that would have been paid on that bond, is paid from that person's estate once they have passed on. As I said earlier, it is worth remembering that there will be people eligible to pay a bond who will not in fact pay one at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third thing is that there will be a quota of 27 per cent applied to concessional residents. Importantly, in applying that quota, there will also be regional variations. So in some parts of Australia where it is clear that a higher quota may be required the department will negotiate with providers and state government agencies to allow for a higher quota. There will also be a higher daily payment of $5, about which we have heard so much, that will be paid for concessional residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Understandably, there are those who say, `If a draw down is $2,600 a year, six months in arrears, that would amount to $7 a day. So why isn't the government paying a concess ional subsidy of $7 a day?' The answer to that is, firstly, that they are working on the assumption that everyone will pay an accommodation bond, and they will not. Secondly, the assumption put by the opposition, and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> some people in the aged care sector who should know better, is that everybody will be paying a maximum draw down of $2,600 a year. In fact, there will be residents who will pay only a very small bond and their drawn down will be considerably less than $2,600 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The daily level of capital depreciation, as calculated by the department, is $4.62 a day. I think $5 is quite a reasonable and an adequate level at which to commence concessional payments. We should also keep in mind that the entire bill and its implementation is the subject of constant review and negotiation between providers and those who represent the interests of older Australians and those of us who are getting there. Eligible smaller services in regional Australia will receive a viability subsidy and may be eligible for a viability subsidy on top of the concessional resident subsidy in recognition of the higher costs that they incur and the economies of scale that they do not enjoy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prudential arrangements are important and they are enshrined in this bill to protect accommodation bonds. There are three components to the prudential arrangements. Firstly, the facilities must maintain a minimum level of assets in a liquid form so that bonds can be repaid as residents leave. Secondly, an industry fund will be established into which providers will pay a proportion of bonds to act as a lender of last resort should a provider's liquidity prove to be insufficient. Thirdly, insurance will provide coverage against particularly large claims and prevent the fund from becoming eroded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Specialist financial, actuarial and legal expertise is now developing the detail, with the government constantly also seeking the views of provider organisations and consumers. I do not think any legitimate provider or consumer organisation in this country could nominate an area of government activity that has been the subject of more rigorous and constant feedback by government than this one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also provides for ministerial discretion for approving alternative prudential 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4930"> arrangements in exceptional cases, which may involve some of the church and charitable organisations. Whilst I have a very high regard for that sector, I think that most of us in modern society are aware that not every organisation is necessarily beyond these kinds of prudential arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The prudential costs will present some cost to providers, but is that not part of the responsibility that is attached to the privilege of being able to charge accommodation bonds? I do not think it is unreasonable that providers pay a small amount and have a financial interest in seeing the prudential arrangements work, and work well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to the resident classification instrument, at the moment about 40 per cent of hostel residents have care needs that should see them in a nursing home. Under the current arrangements neither they nor the provider is reimbursed adequately for their care. The new instrument, which has been trialled with 20,000 residents in 400 facilities, will not only more equitably finance what have been hostel and nursing home services, now leading to their amalgamation, but it will also enable ageing in place to occur. So if someone has been in a nursing home for three or four years and suffers a stroke or some other intellectual or physical disability and is then required to relocate to a nursing home, under these proposals, once they go into the institution, whatever happens to them, they will be able to remain there. Equally, if not more importantly, when a husband and a wife go in after 40, 50 or even 60 years of marriage it means that both of them can stay in the same institution and neither will be required to move.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation will also allow long overdue increased funding for dementia. Providers will now attract appropriate funding for those people suffering from dementia and currently cared for in hostels. All existing residents already in an aged care facility when the bill takes effect will remain on their existing classification and only when that expires will they be assessed under the new scale. This will be after 12 months for nursing home residents and after six months for those currently in hostels.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are eight care categories in the new resident classification instrument. All but level 8 will attract a level of funding. Two broad bands will exist, the lower care level category being from categories 5 to 8 inclusive. Twenty-two questions will lead to the allocation of a waiting and subsequent classification of the resident. This is nothing new for those who run and work within nursing homes. ACATS will not be involved in classification but those aged care assessment teams will be involved in the reassessment of those in lower band categories for whom it is considered re&hyphen;allocation or reclassification may be necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Training will be and is being provided to providers. All 3,000 residential aged care facilities across Australia will be offered training in a number of locations around the country. One day sessions will be offered on aspects of the reform, but in particular the new RCI, a home study kit being sent in advance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly in this bill we are also establishing the Aged Care Standards Agency. This has involved providers, consumers and government in its development. Independent assessment of quality of care will be provided and monitored by ACATS. There will be regular publishing of reports on issues of quality and access and waiting times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the first time in the nursing home sector we are now going to have residents and their families, and perhaps their lawyers, standing at the door of a nursing home being asked to pay an accommodation bond if they are eligible. They will be saying: `If you think that I am going to pay a $20,000 or $30,000 accommodation bond to come into this institution you have got another think coming.' In other words, the families, whom I have found have had a very real interest in the financial affairs of their ageing relatives, will be saying: `I do not know if this is the sort of place I want my mother to be in. I don't know whether she should invest $30,000 in this and possibly be subject to a means tested daily fee.' In other words, the consumer is going to have a very real financial interest in the quality of what is being provided, as well as the Aged Care Standards Agency.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4931">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The way to ensure proper nursing care, by the way, is not through any structural or legislative program, but rather a program that ensures that standards are being met. Action will be taken against those who reduce levels of care. Apart from anything else, they will not be able to charge an accommodation bond. Amounts derived from bonds have to be used, can only be used, on the care of the very person who is paying the bond. It can only be spent on improving and maintaining the capital of the home in which that person is living.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bond can only be charged by a facility which has been accredited, which has met the necessary standards. The standard will be raised progressively over time. That will mean that providers will have to keep investing in their building to make sure that he or she can continue to charge a bond. Labor, in contrast, did not stop hostel providers under their system from charging accommodation bonds for substandard accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes are about the future. Governments, I think justifiably, are frequently accused of thinking only in terms of short-term political cycles. Those on the other side who are engaged in political opportunism at the moment need to hose themselves down a little and have a think about the kind of Australia that we are all&mdash;Labor or Liberal&mdash;going to be living in in 2020. If the government of the day does not have the political courage and intestinal fortitude to implement these reforms and do it now, then we are abrogating our responsibilities to the next and subsequent generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at Bob Gregory's report in 1994 and you consider that we then had to spend $1 billion bringing nursing home capital up to fire, health, outcome and design standards, when you consider that almost 40 per cent of residents in residential aged care institutions at the moment live with at least three other people, when you consider the demands of the generation behind them who have been accustomed to a standard of living  that those currently in homes did not enjoy&mdash;those who lived through the Depression and went to wars and did other things to make this country what it currently is&mdash;and when 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you consider what the next generation's expectations are, you realise that these reforms should have been made in 1988 when the Labor government, to its real credit, introduced reforms into the hostel sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, the point ought be made that, if this government were only about populism, do you think we would be doing this? If we were simply about appealing to primitive electoral instincts in people, don't you think that we would succumb to some of the populist nonsense that is being spread by some on the other side? Instead, the government is about making sure that we have a future in which older people get the care that they deserve and expect.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME><ELECTORATE> (Dobell)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(7.01 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in support of the amendments which have been foreshadowed by the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) as the Labor Party has serious reservations and grave concerns about the impact of this particular piece of legislation. First of all, to understand what this legislation is all about, you have to understand when it was announced and what it is really intended to do. It was announced on budget night last year. It is all about cutting back federal spending on aged care by half a billion dollars because the forward estimates produced in last year's budget show that in the first four years the budget will save $577 million as a result of the changes announced in this particular package of legislation and in one other change announced in last year's budget which also reduces federal spending on aged care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is driven not by some intention to upgrade the standard or quality of our nursing homes, as every government speaker has claimed in the debate; it is about trying to cut back federal expenditure on providing quality aged care for elderly Australians. I will explain that in some detail later in my speech. The government says that it is about trying to cut back government spending. So why isn't the government quite open and honest about its intentions? I think there would perhaps be greater acceptance in the wider community if the government was open and up&hyphen;front about admitting what is really driving these reforms. It is not about improving the quality of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4932"> nursing homes; it is about saving Mr Howard a few dollars so that we can package up some nice election promise come the next election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you realise that the failed savings rebate&mdash;which gives the directors of BHP $450 and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) $450 in this year's budget&mdash;would more than pay for the cutbacks that will be implemented by this legislation, and, if redirected into aged care, would obviate the need for all of this, then that makes it quite clear that the government's priorities are quite misdirected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures introduce two major changes. The first is the imposition of the up&hyphen;front entry fee or the up&hyphen;front accommodation bond, as the government calls it. The imposition of this uncapped, new, up&hyphen;front entry fee is going to mean that wealthy people who can afford to pay very large up&hyphen;front fees are going to have access to the best nursing homes beds. It is going to mean that those people who are less well off and are not able to provide that accommodation bond, that up&hyphen;front entry fee, are going to be relegated to the back of the queue. They will be the elderly Australians who are left with the poorest level of care in the poorest quality nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second measure that is implemented with this legislation is the imposition of additional daily fees for nursing home residents. The imposition of this new fee means that residents will be paying an extra 25c in the dollar for every dollar over the pension&hyphen;free area. This might sound reasonable to some of the hard&hyphen;hearted accountants on the government benches. We even had the honourable member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) proudly boast that full rate pensioners would not pay this additional impost on their pension. Thank God full rate pensioners do not pay, battling as they do on that very modest sum of money that they receive from the government for the years of working and paying taxes for all of their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If an aged pensioner or a service pensioner earns $1 more than $50 a week, then this  government says that they are going to impose an additional tax on those people. It will not be imposed on high income earners, it will be imposed on people who are earning 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $51 a week, which is a very modest sum of money these days when it has to meet the cost of part of their medication, their upkeep and their clothing. Fifty one dollars a week is a pitiful level at which to bring in this new, additional 25c in the dollar rate. That is in addition to some other ways that the government seeks to whack elderly Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have done a bit of work on the imposts that are placed on a pensioner in that position, where a part pensioner earns a little bit of money above the free rate. They not only get hit with income tax; they get hit with the Medicare levy, they get hit with withdrawal of that pensioner rebate and, as a result of this change, they are going to be hit with the 50c in the dollar reduction in their pension because of the social security means test and this new 25c in the dollar means test as applied to cover the cost of their daily nursing home fees. The all&hyphen;up cost of this is that the effective marginal tax rate, the effective withdrawal rate&mdash;the equivalent of the effective tax rate for these part pensioners&mdash;is going to be up in the range of 78c to 91c in the dollar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We certainly suspect the Mr Packer does not pay 91c in the dollar. I suspect Rupert Murdoch does not even pay 78c in the dollar. So how could we expect part pensioners on very modest sums of money to be paying effective rates of tax of between 78c and 91c in the dollar? That is what the government will deliver as a result of the imposition of this new 25c in the dollar means test on the daily nursing home benefit. It is outrageous that the government is seeking to impose these new imposts on people who are on very modest sums of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I would like to make is that there is a bit of a split in the government. Usually they stick to one particular line&mdash;I will concede that&mdash;but there are two groups within the government speakers on this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One group claims that no-one will have to sell their home. The other group is typified by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), and I made some notes from her contribution earlier today. She said, `What is so terrible about selling your home? If I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4933"> move, I sell mine. What is so terrible about having to sell your home to move into a nursing home?' That is what the honourable member for Hindmarsh said. I do not know if that is the view shared by other Liberal members who are in the chamber at the moment, but I think that sums up the feelings of a group of government members who are speaking in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is okay for the honourable member for Hindmarsh to say that. If she sells her home, she can negotiate the purchase of a new home, unit or property. But how do you think people seeking entry to a nursing home&mdash;often people who have been in hospital or have had a stroke; often people whose families are under enormous pressure at this time in their lives&mdash;would cope? I think it is quite unfair for the member for Hindmarsh to equate her circumstances with that of the family of a person who is trying to decide whether he or she should reside in a nursing home. In the words from the mouth of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, there is nothing so terrible about someone being required to sell their home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government says, `It's optional. It is not compulsory. This is just market forces. It's up to each person considering being admitted to a nursing home to reach agreement with the owner of the nursing home.' The problem the government faces is that it does not understand what the Corporations Law is going to do. We have some very competent officials in the advisers' box tonight, I am sure. They take very copious notes, and I would ask them to pass our concerns about this on to the minister so she can answer this question&mdash;a question we have raised in this House before&mdash;in her summing up to this second reading debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Corporations Law, if there is a for&hyphen;profit nursing home being run by a private entrepreneur&mdash;especially one that might be listed on the stock exchange&mdash;the directors and the management of that company have to do all they can to maximise the returns to the  shareholders. That is their obligation by law. If that for&hyphen;profit nursing home has one spare bed and it has to choose between a person who can afford to pay $200,000 for the up- 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">front fee, a person who can only afford to pay $88,000 for the up-front fee and a person who is disadvantaged and cannot afford to pay any up-front fee, the Corporations Law says the nursing home has to give the bed to the person who can afford $200,000, otherwise the directors of the company breach their fiduciary duty to their shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us just put the $200,000 to one side. Let us say there is a nursing home on the Central Coast that has decided they will charge everyone&mdash;whatever their means, however rich they are&mdash;$88,000 as their up-front fee. If a person is disadvantaged, the government will say, `Don't worry. We'll put in a bit of extra money per day.' That was fine until we found out last week that the generous sum of money the government is going to offer is only $3 a day. There is no way that $3 a day can make up to a for&hyphen;profit nursing home the amount they can earn from having an $88,000 bond in a bank account somewhere earning interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question I put to the minister is this: does she deny that the Corporations Law will require a nursing home proprietor in those circumstances to deny the disadvantaged person that bed? We have asked the minister that before, but this time we hope to get an answer. Because of the Corporations Law, the introduction of market forces with nursing home accommodation will mean that a lot of low income Australians, elderly Australians, will be very severely hurt by these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government members delight in referring to Professor Gregory's review of nursing home accommodation. They then go on to claim that Professor Gregory's findings on the capital needs of the nursing home sector justify the imposition of this market forces approach. The problem for the government is that, in chapter 5 of Professor Gregory's report, he particularly went out of his way to discourage the Australian parliament from heading down this approach of market forces. I would like to quote from what Professor Gregory said in chapter 5:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The circumstances under which clients seek access to nursing homes are considerably different from hostel clients. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4934"> </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Approximately 60% of nursing home admissions are from hospitals. This is one indicator of the fact that nursing home entry is often urgent, motivated overwhelmingly by the need for nursing care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"> The sheer size of entry contributions and the impact on a client's life of having to agree to sell assets to receive care would be a considerable barrier to entry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He then goes on to describe it as a measure which seems too harsh.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is completely misleading for members of the Liberal and National parties to claim that in some way Professor Gregory endorses the introduction of up-front fees. He does not. It is certainly wrong for Liberal and National Party members to say that in some way Professor Gregory supports or justifies the imposition of this new 25c in the dollar means test on part&hyphen;pensioners who earn only $51 a week. Someone of Professor Gregory's background and concerns would never argue that low income Australians should be targeted in that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the honourable member for Hindmarsh referred to the concerns that have been expressed by many of those involved in the charitable sector of aged care, she dismissed these people as `fellow travellers'. We presume she was not referring to them as being fellow travellers of the Communist Party&mdash;the old expression of the 1950s. We presume she meant they were fellow travellers of the Labor Party because they had had the temerity to criticise the government's decision and to express concerns about the impact the government's decision was going to have on low income Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pretty hard to believe that an organisation such as Community Services Australia, the national body for community services in the Uniting Church, is in some way aligned to any side of politics, when it says that the government subsidy of $3 a day is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an insult to our elderly and a slap in the face for charitable service providers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is pretty hard to challenge the view of the Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care  Association who said, on 27 May, that this will inevitably result in a two&hyphen;tiered aged care system. They said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem arises because of the Government's completely inadequate supplementary funding for concessional residents.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We have the Australian Catholic Health Care Association who said that they cannot support funding changes because:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">If the government is picking up the measly subsidy, then it is clear that you are much worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mr Jull interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister at the table is grumbling away there but I am sure he would not describe this group as being in any way associated with our side of politics. On 11 May the Alzheimers Association of Australia, the Australian Catholic Health Care Association again, the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, the Baptist Community Care, Churches of Christ, Community Services of Australia and the Salvation Army aged care services issued a joint paper expressing their concerns about the impact of the aged care legislation on Australians with low incomes. All of these are being dismissed by government members as fellow travellers when these are organisations and individuals that have put enormous resources and an enormous amount of their own time into trying to look after elderly Australians and trying to make sure that disadvantaged elderly Australians in particular are not left behind as a result of the changes that this government is seeking to implement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My other concerns in many ways have developed after I had a number of discussions with a person who lives within the electorate of Robertson. This gentleman's name is Mr Neville Boyce and he appeared before the Senate committee. Anyone who lives on the Central Coast knows that Neville Boyce is the former Chief Executive of the Central Coast Area Health Service. He very bravely attacked Labor and Liberal ministers for health over many years of distinguished service looking after the area health service. I would like to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4935"> read a few quotes from Mr Boyce's submission to the Senate committee. On page 1 he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having read the Aged Care Bill 1997 I would have believed, if the act had not come from the government, that these pages were written by the nursing home industry as they are so skewed to benefit the provider.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed changes will cause great distress to the elderly and their families. How can the present government, without a mandate, introduce means testing and a capital contribution at the end of one's life span when entry into the public hospital system is almost free to the richest people of the country?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Boyce goes on to make the point that on the Central Coast we are very fortunate to have high quality nursing home beds available to people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The danger that Mr Boyce has raised is that, if you allow the market forces approach, disadvantaged elderly residents of the Central Coast will be priced out of the market. Of course, it does not take long to drive from the electorate of Bradfield to the Central Coast and we can imagine that, before long, residents of the northern suburbs of Sydney will be able to pay very large sums of money for access to the beds of the nursing homes on the Central Coast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This a concern which has been raised by Mr Boyce in his submission to the Senate and it is a concern that I think should cause the member for Robertson (Mr Lloyd) to seriously rethink his strong support for this particular legislation. If that does not cause the member for Robertson to rethink his position I would encourage him to attend another meeting of the Self&hyphen;funded Retirees Association at the Gosford Central Coast branch who, I know, have grave reservations about the impacts of these changes on elderly Australians on the Central Coast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The crucial point is that the Labor Party's position is that we think nursing home care should be available equally to all Australians on the basis of clinical need rather than on the basis of their financial circumstances. It should really be considered the same as hospital care. If people need to be admitted to a hospital they are admitted. If people need to be admitted to a nursing home they do not do 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it by choice; they do it because of medical need and because they are assessed by the aged care assessment teams as having certain clinical conditions that require them to have that 24&hyphen;hour nursing home care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point I wish to make is that we expect that, unless something unusual happens in the Senate, this government legislation will pass in the not too distant future. The opposition will do all it can to try to persuade a majority in the Senate not to approve the legislation because we think it is unfair and it is going to hurt elderly Australians. But if, at the end of the day, we are wrong then we give every Liberal and National Party member of this House an assurance that elderly Australians in your electorates will hold you accountable in future days.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate. This is a bill which is long overdue but which the former Labor government never had the courage to introduce. We heard this morning the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), the shadow minister for social security, and opposition speakers since criticise this legislation. Many of the things they are critical of do not exist in the legislation. They are simply perpetuating a fear campaign that they have been spreading in the community for quite some time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing the shadow minister said is that this legislation creates a two&hyphen;tiered system. That is a complete load of rot. The funding arrangements contained in the legislation simply reflect the arrangements the former Labor government introduced with hostels. We have merely extended it to nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look who has commended this policy: the former Labor minister, Gary Johns. He has not been deceived by the tricks campaign of the member for Jagajaga. The shadow minister has also misrepresented the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), as is her wont, saying that he:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . believes and has said in the Parliament that his Government's plan to make people sell their homes to get nursing home care is the repayment of a debt. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4936">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government has never said people would be forced to sell their homes. No&hyphen;one is being forced to. We are simply asking those who can afford to make a contribution for their entry to residential care accommodation to do so if they can. What is wrong with that? If the member for Jagajaga had her way, people would not pay to enter nursing homes but taxes would need to go up to pay for nursing home upkeep or, as we saw in the Labor years, nursing homes would continue to deteriorate to significantly poor standards. But that would not bother the member for Jagajaga. If we can believe her utterances, she would be happy for the living standards of the aged to fall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the member for Jagajaga also failed to acknowledge was that, under Labor, 50 per cent of people freely chose to sell their homes before going into an aged care facility. The member for Jagajaga's comments ring hollow when you look at the facts behind what she has to say. She is a fearmonger, as we all know. If the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) wants to find the treacherous MP undermining his party and continually sniping, as was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> this morning, perhaps he ought to look no further than the member for Jagajaga because, on her record, she is the one to snipe and to scare, and she has been doing that during her term as a shadow minister.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition simply aims at scoring points for the next election. They are in for a really bad result. They have total disregard for what is responsible long&hyphen;term policy. This bill has been introduced by the minister for caring, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan). Amendments have been moved by the shadow minister for scaring, the member for Jagajaga, who has since her election to this place made it an absolute art form to scare the wits out of the most vulnerable in our society&mdash;the elderly people in our community. We have heard much misinformation from the opposition&mdash;both within this place and also out in the general community&mdash;about the aged care reform being undertaken by the government. It is a shame that the opposition have sought to score cheap political points from the government's genuine and necessary attempt to provide a framework for the future of aged care so that we have the best available sustainable provisions for the elderly today and in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It appears the opposition would rather Australia's aged live in deteriorating conditions without the funding that is required so desperately. They do not want to support this bill, but they offer no alternative as to how to provide for our ageing population. Nor do they explain how a Labor government would fund the provision of residential care and other services for the aged. Their opposition indicates they want Australia's aged to suffer in their final years in deteriorating accommodation without the significant funding necessary to maintain nursing homes. I should not need to remind the House that we are living in an ageing society and, as such, our policy focus should be on providing the infrastructure and resources that cater for their needs both today and in the future. If we do not address these policy issues today, the burden 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4937"> will be on future generations to make the tough decisions in the years to come which will meet the demands of the aged and provide the necessary funding so urgently required now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is a responsible bill. It ensures appropriate provision of residential accommodation for the aged which safeguards their quality of life. This bill addresses the key issues, ensuring access to residential aged care is based on need, ensuring entry contributions operate consistently and fairly and introducing effective and fair income testing arrangements to support all these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill ensures that those who can afford to make a contribution to the accommodation costs do so. Too often I hear people say that, while they desire a service from the government or someone else, they do not believe that they should be required to contribute to the cost of it. This bill requires those who can afford to make a contribution to do so. It is responsible legislation which provides for residents to take up their responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The contribution that will be made by those who can afford to is called an accommodation bond, and the bond will be given to the residential care provider. From that bond, the provider can draw down a maximum&mdash;as the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) emphasised here earlier today&mdash;of $2,600 per annum for a period not exceeding five years. That is a total maximum of $13,000. The balance will be refunded to the resident or their estate on departure. It is not an exorbitant contribution by any standards, but it is a contribution which will provide for the upkeep of the residents over time, without the burden being placed predominantly on the government. I cannot see why someone who can afford to provide for their own accommodation should not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those residents who are required to pay an accommodation bond will also be provided with alternative payment methods: as a lump sum or on a periodical basis or as a combination of both. Further, those who pay the accommodation bond will have their bond protected via the provision in the legislation for prudential safeguards. This will allow residents to enter residential accommodation 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> without fear of their contribution being lost in the event of the provider experiencing financial difficulty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Notwithstanding that, those who cannot afford to contribute will be protected by this legislation. As the minister has said previously&mdash;and repeatedly&mdash;financial disadvantage will not affect a person's ability to get the care they require. This legislation provides for income testing to determine one's ability to pay. That is the right course of action to take. Every residential care facility will be required to provide a minimum number of places for concessional residents&mdash;that is, full or part pensioners who have not owned their own home in the past two years and who have assets worth less than 2&half; times the single aged pension. The target will be 27 per cent of nursing home and hostel residents nationally, but the actual numbers will be calculated in each region, according to their local need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important aspect of this legislation is that it provides strategies for ensuring that the rights of aged care recipients and the quality of care are maintained and strengthened. The essence of the bill is to provide aged care recipients with the same rights as all other Australians. The burden will be on the provider to meet a basic standard of care in the interests of the residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation we are debating is timely. It will meet the needs and requirements of our elderly in the near future and beyond while ensuring their accommodation needs and standards of living are more than adequate and are funded appropriately. Older Australians deserve better than they received under 13 negligent years of Labor. This bill provides it. I commend it and the minister for caring&mdash;as opposed to the shadow minister for scaring&mdash;to the House.</PARA>

In doing so, I wish to highlight a point that was made in the inquiry that these practices were known to many people, that `People did know, but the warnings went unheeded.' On page 44 of the report, in talking about institutional life, there is this quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Institutional life is prejudicial to a healthy development of character and the rearing of children as good and useful men and women. The one fatal and all&hyphen;sufficient objection to the massing of children together under the necessary conditions of barrack life is, its utter variance from the family system recognised by nature in the constitution of human society as the best suited for the training of the young.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a quote from the 1874 Public Charities Commission of Inquiry. Another quote I wish to read into the record appears on page 123 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is not and never should be occasion for the Children to be taken away from their parents and farmed out among white people.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was written by J.C. Genders, editor of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daylight</EMPHASIS>  magazine, in 1924. On page 140 of the report, there is a quote from the 1930s:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I know many stock breeders who would not dream of crowding their stock in the way that these half&hyphen;caste children are huddled.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This was a quote from John McEwen, Minister of the Interior, after visiting the Half&hyphen;Caste Home in Darwin in 1937.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing that struck me in particular was that this practice was nationwide and continued for a considerably long time. A case that really struck home to me was the case of Paul, who in evidence said, `For 18 years the state of Victoria referred to me as state ward No. 54321.' Paul was born in May 1964. My youngest sister was born in September 1963. In the evidence he gave, Paul said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My Mother and I lived together within an inner suburb of Melbourne. At the age of five and a half months, both my Mother and I became ill. My Mother took me to the Royal Children's Hospital, where I was admitted.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Upon my recovery, the Social Welfare Department of the Royal Children's Hospital persuaded my Mother to board me into St Gabriel's Babies' Home in Balwyn . . . just until Mum regained her health. If only Mum could've

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Early in 1965, I was made a ward of the State. The reason given by the State was that, `Mother is unable to provide adequate care for her son'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When my Mother came for one of her visits, she found an empty cot. With the stroke of a pen, my Mother's heart and spirit had been shattered. Later, she was to describe this to me as one of the `darkest days of her life'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Paul then described how he went to a foster family. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I'd say to my foster family, `why am I a different colour?', they would laugh at me, and would tell me to drink plenty of milk, `and then you will look more like us'. The other sons would call me names such as `their little Abo', and tease me. At the time, I didn't know what this meant, but it did really hurt, and I'd run into the bedroom crying. They would threaten to hurt me if I told anyone they said these things.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Paul, in speaking about his mother, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">She wrote many letters to the State Welfare Authorities, pleading with them to give her son back. Birthday and Christmas cards were sent care of the Welfare Department. All these letters were shelved, the State Welfare Department treated my Mother like dirt, and with utter contempt, as if she never existed. The Department rejected and scoffed at all my Mother's cries and pleas for help.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Subsequently, Paul was discharged from state wardship in May 1982. Paul described what the officer said upon his discharge. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . his Department's position was only to protect me and, `that is why you were not told these things before'. He placed in front of me 368 pages of my file, together with letters, photos and birthday cards. He informed me that my surname would change back to my Mother's maiden name of Angus.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to commend the government for its announcement today of a three&hyphen;month extension of drought relief payments for farmers who have been suffering from exceptional drought. For several years much of eastern and northern Australia has been in drought. It took a long time to persuade the previous government that the drought was serious, that there was a crisis in the bush. Eventually, the former government could ignore the problem no longer, and all of Queensland and much of New South Wales was declared to be in the grip of an exceptional drought.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A range of emergency measures were put in place that have helped many farmers to survive. There was a full range of rural adjustment scheme measures. Also, the access to social security benefits was eased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has indeed been an exceptional drought. It has not just affected the marginal areas but, indeed, those that are normally more secure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following fairly general rainfall, the exceptional drought status was lifted from much of Queensland and New South Wales. All of my own electorate was declared free of exceptional drought except for one shire last year. The new government recognised that it does not rain cash, so they extended the eligibility for some of these measures to give farmers time to recover. An extra $160 million was provided to extend access to social security benefits to 10 December and then to 10 June.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These benefits do not pay farm bills, but they have enabled many farmers to keep food on the table and have enabled their children to go to school respectably dressed. These benefits would have expired in less than a week. But, with today's announcement by the government, this vital assistance will continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The drought, sadly, has not ended, with rainfall drying up in many parts of southern  Queensland. In the first quarter of this year, most of south Queensland has recorded rainfalls in the 10 per cent historic low range. The Queensland government is again declaring shires in my electorate drought stricken, including Kilkivan and Murgon shires which 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have rarely been drought declared in their history. With the end of the wet season now upon us and winter frosts arriving, the prospects are indeed poor. Cattle prices are appalling, grain prices are low and the weather bureau is now forecasting with, sadly, some degree of confidence that El Nino is returning and the prospects for good winter rainfall are poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government announced a new $198.9 million integrated rural package in the budget. This will replace the old rural adjustment scheme, which has been terminated following an unflattering review of its performance. The government intends to announce details of the new measures in this package later in the year, but this interim announcement today will help keep farmers afloat until the new measures are announced. Around 5,800 farm families are expected to benefit. Had this announcement not been made, their lifeline would have ended next week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For these growers, for these farmers, the government has acted with compassion. It has provided interim relief and they will now be looking forward with some more confidence to what this new integrated rural package will contain. I hope that it will provide not only measures to assist farmers with the management of their property but also access to some kind of welfare assistance as a safety net whenever emergencies arise in the future. No farmer wants to live on welfare. They do not expect to be able to access it every day, but there should be a safety net in place to assist them, as there is for other sectors of the community, when disastrous circumstances befall them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They also need counselling services. I call on the government to provide continuing funding to support the rural counsellors who are in place to ensure that they can assist farmers through these difficult times and, when there are those who need to leave the industry, provide them with the sort of advice and help they need so they can have an honourable exit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's decision today recognised the serious plight confronting many people in rural industry. It is only an interim measure, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4940"> but hopefully the measures to be announced in the integrated rural policy package will secure the future of the rural sector and guarantee hope for farmers for the future.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4940"><TITLE><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing Them Home</EMPHASIS></TITLE>

It is a very heart&hyphen;breaking report, and I commend all of those associated with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one particular case that I have been reading in this report that I would like to have in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record tonight, and that is the case of Millicent, who was taken from her family in 1945 when she was four years of age. Her parents were half-castes, she was one of seven children and they lived very happily together, but five children were taken away. They were taken to a protection area and, as she called it, to Sister Kate's, as the home was known. They had a very trying life, a very hard existence. The children lined up to have their parents come to visit them. Their parents did not come, and they were told their parents did not come because their family did not care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It then describes how she went through hell as a very, very young child. But, worse than that, it goes on further on page 116 where she said that, no matter what she had when she was young:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The worst was yet to come.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While I was in first year high school I was sent out to work on a farm as a domestic. I thought it would be great to get away from the home for a while. At first it was. I was made welcome and treated with kindness. The four shillings I was payed went to the home. I wasn't allowed to keep it, I didn't care. I was never payed for the work I did at Sister Kate's so you don't miss what you didn't get, pocket money etc.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first time I was sent to the farm for only a few weeks and then back to school. In the next holidays I had to go back.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I returned to the home I was feeling so used and unwanted. I went to the Matron and told her what happened. She washed my mouth out with soap and boxed my ears and told me that awful things would happen to me if I told any of the other kids. I was so scared and wanted to die. When the next school holidays came I begged not to be sent to that farm again. But they would not listen and said I had to.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I ran away from the home, I was going to try to find my family. It was impossible, I didn't even know where to go. The only thing was to go back. I got a good belting and had to kneel at the altar everyday after school for two weeks. Then I had to go back to that farm to work. The anguish and humiliation of being sent back was bad enough but the worse was yet to come.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This time I was raped, bashed and slashed with a razor blade on both of my arms and legs because I would not stop struggling and screaming. The farmer and one of his workers raped me several times. I wanted to die, I wanted my mother to take me home where I would be safe and wanted. Because I was bruised and in a state of shock I didn't have to do any work but wasn't allowed to leave the property.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When they returned me to the home I once again went to the Matron. I got a belting with a wet ironing cord, my mouth washed out with soap and put in a cottage by myself away from everyone so I couldn't talk to the other girls. They constantly told me that I was bad and a disgrace and if anyone knew it would bring shame to Sister Kate's Home. They showed me no comfort which I desperately needed. I became more and more distant from everyone and tried to block everything out of my mind but couldn't. I ate rat poison to try and kill myself but became very sick and vomited. This meant another belting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After several weeks of being kept away from everyone I was examined by a doctor who told the Matron I was pregnant. Another belting, they blamed me for everything that had happened. I didn't care what happened to me anymore and kept to myself. All I wanted now was to have my baby and get away . . .

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The death yesterday of Mr David C.S. Hong should be mourned by all Australians. David Hong was a great man. My deepest sympathy goes to his wife, Linda, his family and his colleagues, both here in Australia and back in Taiwan. His role as representative of the Taiwanese government to Canberra was  one he relished and his efforts in promoting stronger cultural and economic ties between both nations were producing great dividends for both countries. David was just 59 years old. He was a career diplomat with service including as Consul&hyphen;General in Cape Town, South Africa.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">David Hong died in the line of duty for his country. His death yesterday morning in Melbourne, following a stroke, has certainly shocked me and many others in this place. We shared dinner just a few days ago&mdash;the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> annual dinner of the Australia&hyphen;Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Group&mdash;and warmly bade each other goodbye, secure in the knowledge that we would no doubt see each other again soon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">David was one of the first people who welcomed me to Canberra, making a courtesy visit to my Parliament House office a year ago. This gesture summed up David Hong for me. He was a gentleman, a fine diplomat, a great representative for his country, and a strong advocate for both our nations. David and I met each other on countless occasions here in Canberra and also in my electorate of Moreton.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is certainly worth reflecting on the difficult post which David Hong held. Australia, like most Western countries, has a one&hyphen;China policy: we do not officially recognise Taiwan. David Hong could not be called ambassador for his country. Here he was called the representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office. He was like a rock in the middle of a raging torrent&mdash;the torrent being the maelstrom of mainland China, ever checking our adherence to our one&hyphen;China policy. David reflected upon this in his speech to the parliamentary friendship group just last week. I, like many others in this place, share his frustrations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">David Hong represented a nation of 21 million people, proudly democratic and aggressively free enterprise. He constantly tried to do things to improve the situation of official dealings between our two countries. It must have been frustrating to him last week to read headlines about the PRC ruthlessly working to suffocate Taiwan's links with Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No other country should tell this country who our friends should be. Given that Taiwan has the largest foreign exchange reserves in the world and is looking for places to invest, it is very much so in Australia's interests to promote strong ties with the Republic of China on Taiwan as well as with the People's Republic of China.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last April I was privileged to be a guest of the Taiwanese government as a member of a delegation from this parliament's friendship 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4942"> group. Along with colleagues from both sides of politics, including Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I met with key legislators, bureaucrats and, importantly, the captains of industry in Taiwan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many major Australian companies with operations in Taiwan&mdash;Readymix, Transfield, CSR and many others. China Motors is affiliated with Mitsubishi Motors in Australia and Japan and they now order 2,000 Australian made Diamante luxury cars for the Taiwan market each year. These cars are made in South Australia and are the top of the range of China Motors' fleet. This is another example of Australian jobs being created by the economic ties with Taiwan. In the southern industrial port city of Kaohsiung, there are strong links with Australia, particularly with people from my own electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The delegation visited the headquarters of An Feng Steel, coincidently on the day that local newspapers reported that the Howard federal government was giving the go&hyphen;ahead for a joint venture between An Feng Steel and an Australian company, Kingstream, to construct and operate a steel smelter at Geraldton, Western Australia. This is a multi&hyphen;billion dollar project which is going to earn a lot of money for Australia. The success of this project will trigger even more investment by other Taiwanese companies. Taiwan's `look south' foreign investment policy is very much so focused on Australia. This is important and good news. It is also part of the work done which was done by David Hong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Moreton electorate has more people of Taiwanese origin than any other electorate in Australia. So there are many people whom I represent in this place who share the grief that I have for the passing of David Hong. David  Hong supported and encouraged the efforts of groups in my electorate to promote friendship and understanding between all Australians, especially over the past difficult year as some have tried to raise racial tensions. Those groups include the Taiwanese Friendship Society of Queensland, the Taiwan Women's League and the ROC&hyphen;Australia Business Association.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to raise the report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families. The stolen generations inquiry, as it has become known, has brought to light the continuing devastation of the lives of thousands of indigenous people in this country as a result of policies and practices which shamefully continued until very recently in our history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For any of my colleagues in this House who have any lingering doubts about the morality or context of these policies, I recommend that you read the report. The report details many excerpts from evidence given to the inquiry by witnesses who suffered under these policies. Let me give you examples, firstly, from a Western Australian woman removed from her family at the age of 10. In her confidential evidence, No. 821, she told the inquiry:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was at the post office with my Mum and Aunty [and cousin]. They put us in the police ute and said they were taking us to Broome. They put the mums in there as well. But when we'd gone [about ten miles] they stopped, and threw the mothers out of the car. We jumped on our mothers' backs, crying, trying not to be left behind. But the policemen pulled us off and threw us back in the car. They pushed the mothers away and drove off, while our mothers were chasing the car, running and crying after us. We were screaming in the back of that car. When we got to Broome they put me and my cousin in the Broome lock-up. We were only ten years old. We were in the lock-up for two days waiting for the boat to Perth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further on, on page 204 of the report, she 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4943"> outlines details of what happened to her after she was taken. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was taken there because I was `half&hyphen;caste'. I started thinking, `Why do I deserve to be treated like this?' But as the years went by, I sort of accepted all that. We were treated differently to white and black people. We weren't allowed to go down to see our Aboriginal people, or go into the houses where the white people were. We just had to live around the outside of the house. They made us feel like we weren't allowed to do anything: no freedom of movement, even to think for yourself. They had to tell you what to do, and how to think.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We were locked up in the dormitories, and had to go and ask for anything. We had to go and ask if we could go and see our people. We were more or less like slaves, I think. We didn't think that was wrong. We just thought it was our duty. We did what we were told.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Years later, when we were grown up, our own boss&mdash;by this time we were married and having our children&mdash;we were having families and still couldn't go up and ask the managers if we could get married. They had to tell you who you had to marry. We didn't know what was their plans for us. We just lived and did what we were told.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was almost ashamed to be half&hyphen;caste sometimes. I had no confidence in myself, or how to make up my mind what to do . . . When I was growing up I wanted to be a teacher or a nurse. But you couldn't say that because you had to go to school and go out and work in the house, do domestic duties. That's what they said. We lost much of our culture, our language and traditional knowledge, our kinship and our land.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Speaker, this report represents the cultural genocide of a whole generation or generations of people. I certainly recommend it to you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dealing with these issues does not mean adopting personal guilt about past actions. The view that making a decent response to this issue somehow confers this guilt on white  Australians is a furphy being bandied around by extremists like the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and, unfortunately, more sensible people like the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in an attempt to cloud the issue and somehow try to justify their position of not having the leadership and the guts to make the right decision and properly compensate indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This cannot be brought down to dollars and cents. This is about the morally right thing to do. The fact that today's comments by Jose Ramos Horta and Mick Dodson have been criticised for bringing criticism on Australia I think is absolutely ironic. They cannot 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ignore this report. We as parliamentarians cannot ignore this report. People should not exacerbate the damage which has been done by condemning people for speaking out on these facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unfortunate that Australia's reputation will be damaged unless we do the right thing by offering an appropriate apology, a full apology on behalf of our nation, just as Tony Blair has made an apology for the Irish potato famine. If that is good enough, why is it not good enough for us when we are talking about events which occurred as recently as the 1970s? That is step one. Step 2 is to offer proper compensation for indigenous people. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4943"><TITLE><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing Them Home</EMPHASIS>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No doubt the report mentioned by the previous member, the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese), is of concern to all members of parliament and has been treated with all the compassion and sympathy that this government can offer. I commend the actions of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and cabinet in relation to that report. Its recommendations will certainly be considered in the normal parliamentary process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rise tonight with a grievance from J.K. Williams Contracting Pty Ltd, which is a small company in my electorate which is having trouble with the Australian Taxation Office. The Taxation Law Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993 introduced the investment allowance to kick&hyphen;start Australia out of the economic recession. At the time, unemployment was in double digits, economic growth was stagnant and the Australian economy was in dire trouble. Australia was in the worst economic recession for 60 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government asked Australian businesses, particularly small businesses, such as J.K. Williams, to help boost Australia's economic prospects. It offered a major incentive&mdash;the investment allowance&mdash;to provide an appropriate carrot for Australian businesses to invest in capital equipment. J.K. Williams duly heeded the government's call and invested substantial capital sums in equipment&mdash;two 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4944"> caterpillar scrapers from Gough and Gilmore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Were it not for the investment allowance, J.K. Williams would not have bought the equipment because J.K. Williams could not otherwise afford it. Therefore, in the terms of the government's policy, J.K. Williams did exactly what the government wanted it to do. J.K. Williams's actions were pro-business, pro&hyphen;Australian and should be commended. But, alas, J.K. Williams has become a victim of the ATO's obsession with legal form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In acquiring the equipment, J.K. Williams was careful to ensure that it complied with the highly complex investment allowance provisions. As you will appreciate, like all small  businesses with limited resources, complying to the letter of the law is extremely difficult. However, J.K. Williams did 100 per cent of the things in accordance with the spirit of the law and sought as best as it could to comply with the strict letter of the law. In fact, only a person highly trained in contract law would even begin to think that there may have been a technical failure to comply with the letter of the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">J.K. Williams entered into a written contract with Gough and Gilmore before 30 June 1990, which was the last date on which contracts could be entered into in order to qualify for the investment allowance. The equipment was delivered before 30 June 1995, which was the last day on which the equipment had to be installed and ready for use in order to qualify for the investment allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">J.K. Williams met with the National Australia Bank before 30 June 1994, and the  NAB agreed to fund the acquisition. However, because of the time delay between the making of the contract with Gough and Gilmore and the delivery of the equipment, the NAB and J.K. Williams agreed to finalise the form of the financing&mdash;be it a loan, be it a hire purchase agreement, a bank overdraft or a mortgage. It was not considered that it would do this until 10 months time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">J.K. Williams, Gough and Gilmore and the National Australia Bank have signed letters unequivocally stating there was a binding contract for J.K. Williams to acquire that equipment prior to the end of June 1994. The NAB at no point owned the equipment. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> contract was with J.K. Williams and Gough and Gilmore to purchase this equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Taxation Office has found that 10 months later a new contract appeared out of thin air. Somehow NAB entered into a brand new hire purchase agreement to provide these scrapers to J.K. Williams. That seems an incredibly pedantic and tight interpretation of the law which is exactly at odds with everything the legislation was introduced to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">J.K. Williams entered into the contract in good faith. Where a major tax incentive is introduced such as the investment allowance and where hardworking honest small business taxpayers such as J.K. Williams comply with the spirit of the law and seek as best they can to comply with the letter of the law, should as a matter of administrative practice the ATO seek to defeat the government's policy? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a privilege to be able to speak to the 1997&hyphen;98 budget of the Australian government. This budget builds on last year's budget, the first budget of the current government. Far from it being a series of disjointed activities placed as an annual event, what is happening here is a series of measured practices and initiatives taken to achieve a result that has been the focus and target of the government since its election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The targets that the government set itself prior to its election, and has followed subsequently, have been to reduce the deficit to get the huge interest payments that the Australian government and people are required on an annual basis to pay to foreigners and others off the agenda so that more resources can be devoted to the real needs of the Australian people; to focus on the needs of Australian families, especially those with children; to look at the needs of small business and ensure that the small businesses of Australia are allowed to flourish; to create a safer environment; and to take care of those people in need, particularly the aged. It is a very simple agenda and one that was the clear focus during the election campaign.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SAWFORD" NAMEID="3J4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3J4">Mr Sawford</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No jobs though.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SD4">Mr CADMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The employment factor is raised and rightly so. Of course, the job generation process, we believe, does not come from the expenditure on training programs or churning people through training, job club, new work opportunities and then back onto unemployment benefits. The real growth in jobs comes from the productive activity of real businesses&mdash;not government business&mdash;and particularly the small business sector. The focus on small business really relates to the creation of opportunities for young Australians. So that process, as you rightly point out, is a priority and thank you for reminding me that it is a  priority of the government. But it is not focused in the direction determined by the previous government; it is focused in the direction of long&hyphen;term prospects and permanent opportunities for people to achieve employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of this strategy, which is not an annual disjointed event but a series of measures designed to achieve a certain goal, I have outlined the goals that the government has set itself in its first term of office. The process is being given emphasis in the current budget by a series of significant highlights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first highlight that I would like to mention is the prospect of rebuilding savings: the savings in the public sector, the savings I have already mentioned that result from a substantial program of debt reduction&mdash;getting rid of the deficit, getting those huge annual interest payments of $9 billion or $10 billion that go annually out of the Australian budget and out of the system. It is a burden people and future generations do not want to carry. The strategy of almost halving the underlying budget deficit for this year and turning that deficit into a surplus for next year&mdash;the 1998&hyphen;99 year&mdash;is heading in the right direction.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4947">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are making possible the rebuilding of savings by encouraging individuals to save. The savings rebate initiative is a very significant initiative and it will give people the opportunity of gaining a tax benefit if they want to save. It is providing a central place for people to deposit any spare funds, whether it be superannuation contributions, part of a net income process, or investments that people want to make to be able to use that tax rebate. That is a substantial encouragement to savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also the changes to superannuation which have been at the upper end of the superannuation hierarchy, but I think they were significant nonetheless. I do not believe it is the government's intention to revisit superannuation on a regular basis. There is also the deferred pension bonus plan, which is another encouragement for people to save. So we have a savings strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are setting the right priorities by establishing a fair safety net for those people in need by implementing employment and training programs that are realistically based. My experience in my own electorate is that the programs which are now being implemented have every prospect of working very successfully. We have high community involvement in the electorate of Mitchell and we have a large number of people participating. In fact, 52 organisations participate in creating job opportunities and they are improving business prospects for the local community. I think that the government programs are going to work rather well. Some of them will need refinement. But, all in all, we have been able in our area to take advantage of the CES program which deals with people who are unemployed for 18 months or more&mdash;a very difficult client target. We have been able to deal with that very successfully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the environment, with the proceeds from the partial sale of Telstra we have established the right priorities for the care of the environment. As for culture and heritage, the federation fund will encourage the expression of Australian heritage towards the centenary of our Australian federation. There are also assistance programs for small business, which I would like to deal with in greater detail shortly. There is an emphasis on rural and regional Australia to provide opportunities for people living away from Australia's capital cities. All of these processes are designed as part of a continuum of activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it very interesting when I look back over the period since the release of the budget. The national media spent a total of three days examining the budget and then reverted to its  complete and absolute obsession with Wik and Aboriginal affairs. That was purely a matter of spectacularising the news.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Could I say to members of the Australian Labor Party that I am perfectly content with this process because while you guys are focussing on those headline issues, what is happening is that our measures are going into place. Our substantial changes to the Australian economy are being put down, block by block. One day these guys are going to wake up, if I may say so, Mr Deputy Speaker, and they are going to find they are facing an election where the commitments of the opposition of 18 months ago have been fulfilled in practice and promises completed and programs concluded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian people will then say, `I wonder where the opposition has been all this time?' They will realise you have been focused on peripheral issues, issues that are unrelated to the main needs of the Australian community. When the facts are laid out, come an election, your frenetic attention to apologies or saying sorry, question time after question time, and your frenetic attention to the images on television of a night&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. They are very encouraging to me, though. It is wonderful in this intimate environment to see they are so far off track. It is amazing to see that the Australian Labor Party has lost the plot. We are looking to a newer generation to generate within the Australian Labor Party new ideas and new prospects, but there are words like treachery flowing around the place today from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) who is saying, `This is treacherous behaviour that people should have ideas and have ideas different from mine.' But that is a side issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They will battle away on those things, which I think are peripheral issues, while the government is laying down the foundation on things like small business reform, change in opportunity, job creation through that process, opportunities for Australian families and redressing the deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the things that really matter to Australians, not the stuff that you are carrying on with. It is amazing that the Australian media have been so misled in this process that they have focused, as if in a feeding frenzy, on things which look good on television. I acknowledge that the pictures of nice Aboriginal people or angry meetings and all of these sort of things are very good television, but in fact they are unrelated to the real needs of most Aussies. Most Aussies are focused where the government is focused, and the government is focused very centrally on these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to outline briefly for the House some of the advantages of the current budget because I think that in some instances they need to be restated. Australian families will benefit by tax savings from 1 July, which is an excellent thing. Families with children and modest  to low incomes&mdash;the very group that the Australian Labor Party neglected when they were in office&mdash;will be really gaining the benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are these rebates going to be? Up to $450 per year on savings interest or personal superannuation contributions will go straight into the pockets of nearly six million Aussies. Faster Medicare claim processing and the introduction of electronic lodgment will make it simpler and easier for families. From 1 July a $450 rebate on the cost of private health insurance will be available to low-income people. There will be 28,000 outside school hour care places created in the next four years. That is in place as well as opportunities for families to exercise choice in the form of 44,000 child-care places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the things that we are doing while the Australian Labor Party is focused on Wik and Mabo and all of those things&mdash;the legal battles and the legal contests that will go on. Most people do not understand those and, in fact, those who have a partial understanding of them feel threatened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be greater Austudy access; $17.4 million over five years for improved health 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4949"> services in rural areas; a 25 per cent increase in domiciliary nursing care benefits; and carer payment for those who are looking after aged relatives or disabled relatives in their own home. What more empathetic and compassionate scheme could there be than this one which acknowledges the time given for the care of a relative, or somebody who is in need, in their own home? I acknowledge that there is certainly a benefit to the government in this process. But to pay tribute and to understand the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day application that a carer must have to the needs of others is a wonderful thing for this government to do. There will be $54 million extra for additional accommodation to support people with disabilities over four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those are the right focuses for the Australian government: tax concessions for families and better health opportunities, allowing people of modest to low incomes to maximise their benefits. We are even having newspaper reports now of women who are currently working saying, `If I weigh it all up, I have now got a real choice of whether I work or stay at home.' The goal of the government is to give women&mdash;particularly women&mdash;the choice of whether they will take part&hyphen; or full&hyphen;time work, or whether they will stay with their children and families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most women prefer to stay with their families, but economic necessity has created the need for them to do part&hyphen;time work. The government is giving people real choices in their lifestyles. I think choice in that area is the key to a successful and healthy nation, because our families are going to be based on proper decisions and not forced decisions&mdash;forced by some ideological concept of what a family should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small businesses also are boosting job opportunities and encouraging savings. They are providing a certainty of growth for the years ahead. One only has to look at the capital expenditure over the last quarter to realise that there is an engine revolving steadily and strongly to drive the Australian economy forward. The record expenditure on capital is going to improve productivity and opportunities in businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are changes to fringe benefits tax for small business and exemptions have been proposed. Changes to capital gains tax rollover will mean that a person, at the end of their working life, will be able to reinvest in superannuation, in proper savings, with no capital gains tax if they change their businesses or sell their businesses. People in small business can now develop their whole career. They can keep building up and selling small businesses and then use the proceeds of their final sale for their retirement. That is a real incentive for small  business; something that has never been there. At the end of the day most small business proprietors say, `The value of my business is my retirement benefits.' The government has acknowledged that and has extended relief from capital gains tax to the small business area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is more flexible industrial relations&mdash;and even more flexible industrial relations ahead, if the Australian Labor Party will understand what we are really doing and acknowledge that the common law does provide protection for employees. We are not about removing protection, but the crazy unfair dismissal processes for small business are crippling for employment, crippling for small business and denying them opportunities. You have to take the shackles off. I would like to be able to get into the Senate and tell senators how damaging their attitudes are to the future of Australia. Narrow&hyphen;minded pettiness and obstructiveness are occurring in that chamber. I know I should not reflect on the chamber, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4950"> consciousness of the relevance of what they are doing to the rest of Australia. They need to be enlightened as to how damaging this is. It could be that the place they live in is so lofty and so remote that day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day contact with the average citizen never occurs. I worry about that. If they had that contact they would not be making the decisions they are making.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reduced taxation compliance burden from 1 July is another initiative. The savings rebate that I have already mentioned is excellent stuff for small business, because they can invest in the savings rebate. So, all in all, this budget, which has been received quietly and without controversy, is a budget that builds on last year's budget. It builds for the future with another significant block in place in the areas of savings, opportunities for families, small business and job creation of a real kind. I think it is a very significant document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am rather pleased that the budget has not attracted a lot of attention. If it was a weak budget it would attract a lot of attention. But people have not been able to lay a glove on it. My friends from the other side of the chamber have not been able to lay a glove on it. Mr Deputy Speaker, I know that if you were to venture down to the more lowly area where we are, you would find that nobody could lay a glove on it down here either. So neither at lofty levels in the press, nor at the lower levels of crass politics can people lay a glove on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we see in place is a building block, building for Australia's future, with another budget to come before the next election which will be even better. We are seeing the complete trilogy of the first three years of the Howard government. That will be the first three years of many subsequent years of the Howard government. The plan is developing. People are starting to see that we deal with the problems as they arise, but the underlying necessities were the necessities that we annunciated when were in opposition and which we are now putting in place and building on. The Australian people are recognising the progress that is being made on their behalf.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to take part in this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1997&hyphen;98. During the time I have been in the federal parliament, I have seen many budgets come and go, but I have never seen one quite like this one. I have never seen a budget sink so rapidly from the public spotlight as the budget delivered by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on 13 May.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I listened to the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) and his valiant attempt to justify it and say why it has sunk, as I have listened to many members on the government side  talking about how good this budget is. It has sunk without interest. The government wanted to get it out of the headlines and that was why the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) raised the spectre of the GST.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Mitchell said that the opposition was raising questions about Wik and things like that, but who was it, when the flak came in about the budget, that was so desperate to get the budget away and buried? It was the Prime Minister who raised the spectre of the GST on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program. The media, being the media, ran with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are delighted that the Prime Minister has raised the question of the GST. Even in today's paper, the Treasurer is talking about a tax on every part of the process. I was in Canada earlier this year, and I have seen that tax. Believe you me, we will be highlighting to the people of Australia just what this government has in store.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would well know, Paul Keating as Treasurer would always wrap up a budget with a memorial line. He used to get derided for it, whether that was right or 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4951"> wrong. In presenting the 1988 budget, I well remember, as many will, his saying, `This is the one that brings home the bacon.' This 1997&hyphen;98 budget, the second of the Howard&hyphen;Costello government, brings home absolutely nothing. It is truly a directionless, shapeless and hopeless policy program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the budget is not as dramatic in that there are not as many cuts as last year, with a hack of $8 billion cut away so ruthlessly from public expenditure, the devil is in the detail. It continues the assault on most Australians. Pensioners, students, the unemployed, migrants, families, workers, businessmen, the sick, the disabled, our youth and indigenous Australians do not walk away bloodied, as they did last year, but they certainly walk away with a severe and very noticeable limp. They have all been taken to again by a Prime Minister who promised so much and delivered so little.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After just on 16 months in office, the Howard government has made Australians frustrated and angry&mdash;a far cry from being comfortable and relaxed. Australians are frustrated that economic growth has slowed; that unemployment has increased; that essential government services like Medicare, CES, tax and social security offices are to close; that industry assistance has been abolished; that labour market programs no longer exist; that elderly people will be forced to pay incredible up&hyphen;front fees to gain entry into nursing homes&mdash;something like $80,000; that students will need to fork out $100,000 to get a university degree; and that working families will be forced to pay increased child&hyphen;care fees to have their children looked after while they work, just to make it over the line each week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget fails to address the problem of unemployment. Unemployment, as the government continually reminded Labor when in opposition, is Australia's most overwhelming economic and social problem. Since the coalition has been in office, its record on jobs and unemployment has been dismal. Virtually no full&hyphen;time jobs have been created. The number of unemployed people has increased by 31,500. Long&hyphen;term unemployment is at its highest level for two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only so&hyphen;called solution the coalition has is limited to the work for the dole scheme&mdash;a con which went through numerous reincarnations before it was framed in proposed legislation. Work for the dole proposes to establish 70 pilot projects catering for 10,000 places in the 18&hyphen; to 24&hyphen;year&hyphen;old bracket. It is a con program which will do nothing to reduce unemployment, especially youth unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government laid its marker when it told us that its unemployment record could be judged after it had been in office for 12 months. In the first year of the Howard government, total employment grew by 89,000. In Labor's last year of office, total employment grew by 176,000. Male full&hyphen;time employment has fallen by 12,600 in this government's first year. Under Labor, it grew by 57,000. Long&hyphen;term unemployment fell by 45,000 in Labor's final year, while it rose by 44,000 in the coalition's first year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition clearly does not have the answers. Last year's budget, which axed public sector jobs, abolished labour market programs, cut schools training, slashed industry assistance and deserted regional and rural Australia, proves it. Instead of changing its responses in this budget, it is exactly the same response: cut, cut and cut again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said before that there must come a time when this country's economic advisers in Treasury and in the corridors of this place must accept that Australia cannot go on the road of doing more with less. The paper clip counting mentality which dominates the cabinet, the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4952"> major economic departments and the board rooms needs to be, and must be, shelved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year's budget and this budget are smokescreens for this government's attempts to imitate Thatcher's Britain. There is no need to try and imitate either Thatcher or Gingrich. Both Thatcher and Gingrich have moved on. Australia does not face an economic crisis. Australia has the lowest government expenditure in the industrialised world. It has a low level of government debt and a low budget deficit. We do not need to achieve a balanced budget, or a surplus, by needing to destroy essential public programs, without slowing economic growth and destroying services in regional and rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Throsby can expect nothing from this budget. They have been savaged and attacked in the areas of job creation, regional development, local government, education, Austudy, social security, child care and aged care. It is interesting that this conservative government targets the most disadvantaged regions for some of the most savage cuts. So much for governing for all of us. A most vicious assault occurred in the most ethnically diverse area in my electorate, Warrawong. Within a week, the people of Warrawong and the surrounding areas of Port Kembla, Berkeley, Lake Heights and Cringila were asking themselves what they had done so terribly wrong. What had they done to be so punished by this government? Within a week, two offices had been announced for closure. Warrawong will lose its Medicare and social security offices&mdash;a double whammy from this caring government!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the last election on one full day of campaigning, my Liberal opponent, who is a chicken farmer&mdash;the chicken man&mdash;came down from Liverpool where he has a chicken farm. He spent a day in my electorate. He came to Dapto and promised the people of Dapto that if he was elected&mdash;this chicken man&mdash;the Howard government would establish a Medicare office in the area. He was right to make this promise, in one way, because the Dapto area is experiencing enormous population growth. I have long been involved in a campaign, along with a group from the Dapto Senior Citizens Centre, to have a Medicare office established there. During or before the campaign, I spoke of the need for a Medicare office in Dapto. I spoke in this parliament; I arranged deputations to see various health ministers; I arranged for bureaucrats to come over there; and a lot of work towards the Dapto Medicare office was done in my office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much was made of the promised Medicare office. Remember when the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Illawarra Mercury</EMPHASIS> said that if the Liberals were elected, Dapto would get the Medicare office? So says the chicken man! History records that the Howard government was elected on 2 March 1996.  History will also record, however, that the promised Medicare office at Dapto did not eventuate. Instead, they have taken two Medicare offices out of our area, one out of my area in the electorate of Throsby and one from my colleague the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin). The Liberals promised that if they were elected, we would get one extra Medicare office in the area. What did they do when they were elected? They took two out of the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That they have taken the Social Security offices out of Warrawong can only be described as an act of monumental stupidity. Pensioners, young families, the unemployed, workers, students, the sick and disabled, will all be affected by these closures. These people were all on tight household budgets of their own before, but now the Howard government will force them to travel further to either central Wollongong or Shellharbour Square in the south to lodge their forms for the pension, unemploymeny benefit, child care and Medicare rebates, or just to ask for advice or information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the same response when, following last year's budget, the government closed the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4953"> immigration office in Wollongong. No matter that the Illawarra is, perhaps, the most ethnically diverse part of Australia. No matter how many people use the office and the services that are provided. Just tell them to hop onto a bus or train and take a two&hyphen;hour trip up to Rockdale in Sydney. This government does not care about individual circumstances. It does not care that people will be forced to travel further or wait longer to access the services that Medicare and the Social Security offices provide. The people of Warrawong will not give up without a fight, I can tell you that. There are plans to fight this closure, and a fight there will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it very interesting that this government, more than any other, enjoys official openings and blowing its own trumpet&mdash;and you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would appreciate this. And no&hyphen;one can hold a candle to Defence personnel for official openings, especially of a building&mdash;as you and I both appreciate. I have been through the budget papers because there is a little program that I am particularly interested in, and I notice that there is no mention of the Holsworthy Military Hospital complex. As a former chairman, and now the deputy chairman of the Public Works Committee, I have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of my invitation to attend the official opening of the $20 million state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art medical complex. The invitation is yet to arrive and I suspect&mdash;unless, Mr Deputy Speaker, you have got yours&mdash;that it never will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has been very quiet about the Holsworthy Military Hospital. It has recently been brought to my attention that the hospital has been, in fact, opened and operating for some months. The Holsworthy Military Hospital had been opened ever so quietly without the usual fanfare, as a contrast to the official opening of a similar complex at Enoggera in Brisbane where the Minister for Defence, Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) claimed all the credit for the medical facilities there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Holsworthy Military Hospital which is equally state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art, and worth almost $20 million at December 1994 prices, however, opened and is operating in near silence. Why is there this silence about Holsworthy? It would not be because a hospital is located almost on the runway of the proposed second Sydney airport, right under the flight path of screaming jets as they make their way to the runway of the proposed Sydney second airport. It is no wonder that the Howard government has kept the operation of the hospital a near state secret. It is no wonder that the Minister for Defence, Industry, Science and Personnel is seen nowhere near the place, and that there has been no official opening. It is almost like the situation faced by the New South Wales government in the opening of the M2 motorway. If the proposed second Sydney airport is sited at Holsworthy, then the hospital would be sure to close and $19 million of taxpayers' money will have been totally wasted. Is it any wonder that that is not mentioned in the budget papers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you manage to get the 2UE's Alan Jones offside in an editorial you know that you have made a blunder. The morning after the budget on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Today</EMPHASIS> show Alan Jones revealed that the centrepiece of the budget was a crazy con. The savings rebate was talked about for only 48 hours after the budget because the Prime Minister then began to talk about the introduction of the GST. This rebate is for the wealthy end of town and is not for the battlers. So much for the member for Mitchell when he came in here and said that we had brought up Wik to divert attention. It was the Prime Minister who diverted attention from this by introducing the question of the GST.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The maximum rebate is $450 per person per year. High income couples will easily qualify for the full amount, but the battler will, if he or she is lucky, get a massive 29c per week. In 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4954"> the majority of cases, the battler will get nothing at all. I can tell you that there are not too many people in the Throsby electorate who will be getting the $450. The Prime Minister was so embarrassed by the savings rebate that he said that he would not be claiming it, despite the fact that this rebate was introduced instead of Labor's superannuation contribution, which would have increased national savings and provided workers with adequate retirement incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We promised to make the rebate go where it should go: to the battler. Again, the Prime Minister is opposed. There is nothing but bad news in the savings rebate for retirement incomes. Workers now in their mid&hyphen;30s on average weekly earnings will lose around $110,000 from their retirement packages. Under this budget, people will also be forced to choose their illnesses, because this budget introduces a tax on medication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last few minutes available to me, I would like to briefly touch on the question of aid. Especially considering the massive cuts in last year's budget to aid, the cut this year of one per cent&mdash;which, in real terms, is about three per cent&mdash;in the aid budget is totally indefensible. Just as this government is sending the wrong messages on human rights, so it is sending the wrong messages on aid. The Simmons report on the aid program, to which the government has so far not responded, advocates an increase in the aid allocation. Yet this government has, in the last two budgets, cut the aid program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are now giving the lowest level of aid as a percentage of GNP since the early 1980s. At 0.27 per cent, we are even further removed from the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent. We should be increasing our aid budget, especially in relation to the population program and countries in this part of the world. We make much of talking about sending a message to this part of the world but, when we continue to cut aid, especially to the countries in this region, we are sending them all the wrong messages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also send the wrong messages in regard to Radio Australia. We spend millions of dollars with our embassies throughout Asia, keeping them open and so forth. I see that our embassy in Copenhagen and the office in Nauru are closing, saving over $1 million. But the cheapest and most effective way to get to so many people, especially the decision makers in our surrounding area&mdash;and, indeed, not only in our surrounding area but in all parts of the world&mdash;is through Radio Australia; yet we are going to cut that. I cannot see the economic sense of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can argue about very many issues&mdash;and there are, rightly, different points of view on various issues&mdash;but I do not think there could be any argument about the benefit of Radio  Australia; and from an economic point of view it is very much cheaper than embassies. Anyone who has been to those embassies will have seen the endless staff there and the millions and millions spent. I never advocate cutting the staff at embassies; but, if money is so tight, we could take a few people out of a few embassies and have the few million dollars needed to keep Radio Australia. Once it has gone, it will never be replaced. We have built up a tremendous service with Radio Australia that is respected throughout the world; but, for a measly million dollars, we are going to cut it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have listened to those on the government benches trying to justify this budget, but I know that their hearts are really not in it. The heart of the honourable member for Mitchell was not in it. I have not yet heard your speech, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I will. You cannot comment from the chair, but I know that government members have not got their hearts in the defence of this budget, because they know that what we are saying on this side is right. They have to justify it. I was a government member for 13 years and I know that you have to come in, and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4955"> the Whip gears you up and says, `You have to get in there.' `But I don't want to talk on it'. `No, no; you've got to get in there and defend it. Go in there. When you have got a weak point, raise your voice and shout a bit, but defend it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government members' hearts are not really in it. They cannot justify a budget which so cruelly punishes the poor and disadvantaged in our community. This budget lacks a vision for today and tomorrow; it lacks a vision for a more equitable society; and it lacks a vision for Australia's rightful place in the world.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second coalition budget is a major victory for middle Australia, those people that Labor forgot for 13 years. Less than nine months ago, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) brought down the first budget of the Howard government against a backdrop of financial mismanagement and gross neglect. The Howard government was faced with a $10 billion deficit, a huge black hole into which Labor had poured billions of taxpayers' dollars to prop up an ailing welfare system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of turning tail and retreating to the bunker, the Treasurer took stock and laid down a plan, a plan which will see this government turn around the debt and create a surplus in under three years. It is a plan to secure the future of all Australians, not just the noisy minorities and Labor's union mates; a plan to secure the future for all constituents in my electorate of Bowman and for all Australians who have worked so hard for so long without recognition for their efforts, until now. The Treasurer took it upon himself and this government to fix the mess that Labor had dumped this country into; and now, as we debate the coalition's second budget, we are starting to reap the benefits of this far reaching and inspired plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those who said it could not be done, just look at the facts: for the first time in nearly a decade, the government will not run up debt. In fact, in the coming financial year, we will repay over $5 billion of debt and, for the second year in a row, the Australian public can rejoice in the fact that there is no increase in income tax, no increase in company tax, no increase in wholesale tax and no lifting of the petrol excise. But it gets better. For the second  year in a row, the Treasurer introduced a reduction in taxation. As well as this, we have record low home mortgage interest rates and low inflation. All this, from a position just over 12 months ago from which the critics said we could not recover. We have recovered and we will continue to flourish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I wish to focus on a few points, namely employment, business and aged care, three areas in which Labor failed dismally and which we have accepted the challenge to fix. First, let us look at aged care reform. The shadow minister for scare has spent so much time in this House criticising our policy that I am sure she has not had time to look at her own party's record. Under Labor, the nursing home sector steadily declined. Why? Because the problem was too big for Labor to grasp. Again, we are here to clean up their mess. The coalition recognises the urgent need for reform. For this reason, we have introduced into this House an aged care reform package which will get the industry back on its feet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our package will provide better consumer protection, protection for those on low incomes, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4956"> protection for the family and protection for quality of life. Our plan for nursing homes is built around the needs of our aged and their families. It allows a greater diversity of care and more flexibility than Labor could ever manage. Our package will provide better buildings through the input of funds from accommodation bonds. Again, due to the neglect of Labor, many of our nursing homes are in shocking condition. Just look at the statistics. Over 40 per cent of residents share rooms with three or more people; 11 per cent of facilities do not meet fire hazard standards; 15 per cent do not even meet health standards. Why? Because Labor was too weak to introduce real reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They cannot claim ignorance. Their own report, written for them by Professor Gregory, told them the state of nursing homes. What was their response? Over a three&hyphen;year period, Labor actually cut capital funding for nursing homes by 75 per cent. Yet, the shadow minister for scare sits opposite and protests when we put forward a plan to fix the problem, a plan to provide quality care for our aged population. A population, I might add, that is growing at an alarming rate&mdash;a population for which Labor had run out of ideas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aged care is of special interest to me. My electorate contains at least 15 aged care facilities offering a variety of care and comfort. All these facilities will benefit from the government's aged care reform package. The population projection for Bowman for people over 70 is over 7,000. By putting a plan in place now, those who will require aged care in Bowman in the future can be assured it will be available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area of gross neglect is that of employment. Under Labor, this country witnessed the highest rate of unemployment since the Second World War. Unemployment rose from six per cent to 11 per cent under Labor, putting more than one million Australians out of work. What was their response? Put the unemployed through endless training courses in an effort to keep them off the unemployment statistics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Did the revolving door training method work? Of course, it didn't. If it did, unemployment would not be the problem it is today. Why didn't it work? Because Labor doesn't work. What the opposition does not understand is that, no matter how highly or diversely trained your work force is, if business is not working, neither are the unemployed. The coalition understands this and we are doing something about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Business, particularly small business, have been unwilling to hire more employees because the Labor Party has had them running scared. Remember the recession we had to have? Remember the unfair dismissal laws? Remember the high interest rates? Is it little wonder that  small business retreated into its shell? Only now are they beginning to be coaxed out again. Lower interest rates, reductions in withholding tax, relief from capital gains tax and savings rebates on income earned from a business are all measures introduced to help small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reform in the form of the Reid report addresses many of the issues confronting small business and, once implemented, will provide the environment for small business to grow, employ, expand and invest. Small business is often referred to as the engine room of our economy and I believe the recommendations in the Reid report will give small business the kick&hyphen;start they need to start producing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to this, the government has introduced measures to encourage business to take on more staff. From next January, the government will introduce a new $1,500 completion payment for employers when an apprentice or trainee achieves a certain level of competency. There will also be an increase of $250 in the recommencement payment for this competency standard to encourage employers to take on an apprentice or trainee who has had a previous 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4957"> employment contract terminated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will also fund the work for the dole scheme to the value of $21 million over two years. This fund will provide 70 pilot projects, comprising up to 10,000 places for the unemployed. A recent national survey of businesses showed that three in five businesses would be more willing to employ someone with experience from work for the dole than without it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had great pleasure recently telling the members of this House of a program currently running in my electorate of Bowman. Through this program, which is being run by the Redlands Employment Placement Service, participants have identified 105 unadvertised positions with small businesses in two months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The JUICE program&mdash;join us in creating employment&mdash;trains participants in the art of cold canvassing and then puts them on their bikes, literally, to seek employment. To date, 41 participants have taken part in the program. These are the types of programs that work and that get Australians back to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have approximately 5,000 businesses in Bowman. We also have approximately 5,000 unemployed. If every one of those businesses could be encouraged to take on just one more staff member, it would solve the unemployment problem in Bowman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many aspects of this budget will benefit the Australian community. We have introduced environmental programs, the likes of which have never been seen before in this country. We have announced the $1 billion Federation Fund, which will provide employment and restore pride in our nation. We have introduced discounts for students on HECS, and much more. However, in fairness to my colleagues, I will not take up any more time in this House and I have great pleasure in commending this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this budget debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) somewhat bemused by the antics of the government in its presentation of the 1997 budget. The speech of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) took less than 30 minutes to deliver and yet, in a wide&hyphen;ranging search of the budget papers themselves, the opposition has found many hours of unfairness within these documents. Of great concern is the fact that so much of what the Treasurer proposed is for 1998&hyphen;99. I wondered on budget night why he bothered to deliver a document at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to give a few examples, the private saving scheme is to be introduced in two stages from 1 July 1998&mdash;that is, after the next budget&mdash;and 1 July 1999, which will be after the next election. By then, we may well have a new government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The child disability allowance will be introduced from July 1998. The deferred pension bonus comes in from July 1998. The Federation Fund, which the previous speaker mentioned, which we actually need now to overcome high unemployment, will not commence until 1998&hyphen;99. I think we can truly say that, when the 1998 budget comes about, it will really be the deferred 1997 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would have been simpler to have sent us a letter and delivered it next May. Nevertheless, I believe there are hidden problems within the budget of 1997 that need to be exposed and commented on, no matter when they are due for implementation. The issues that need addressing cover child care, jobs, industry policy, superannuation, the no retirement bonus and pharmaceutical benefits.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4958">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I listened intently to the Treasurer on budget night and I am staggered that he and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) seem to have totally misunderstood the needs of parents in the electorate of Greenway. The budget fails to address the concerns of Australians most in need of assistance&mdash;the unemployed, families in poverty, the aged and the working poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government fails to realise that a large number of Australian families are living very close to the poverty line. A significant number of single&hyphen;income families with children, have gross household incomes, including income support payments, of less than $20,000 per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association, a trade union that takes a lot of interest in families and working women, has provided some data that indicates that a large proportion of working families with children are living on incomes that are just above the poverty line. Some 12 per cent of single&hyphen;wage earners and couples with children have incomes less than 10 per cent above the poverty line, suggesting that a substantial proportion of these families are at risk of poverty. The Brotherhood of St Laurence estimates that almost 200,000 workers are living in poverty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government's private savings scheme will do little to help these people. It is unlikely that the single&hyphen;income earner, on average weekly earnings, with two or three children attending school, with a mortgage to pay, and having to pay fares or run a second&hyphen;hand car to travel to and from work, would have sufficient savings to qualify for the maximum tax rebate on savings of $450. Clearly, this scheme is unfair, as the well&hyphen;off will be able to claim the $450, while most young married wage earners will not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister recognised the unfairness when he stated that he would not claim this rebate himself. In press reports only two days after the budget, a number of leading figures in the financial world were very critical about the effectiveness of the savings scheme. The president of the Institute of Actuaries was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government missed an opportunity to develop a long term vision to address the significant financial problems arising from an ageing population, increased health costs and rates of savings.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So the proposal fails on two major points: firstly, it is unfair to low&hyphen;income people; and, secondly, it fails to boost national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The so&hyphen;called savings scheme replaces the co&hyphen;contribution superannuation payment which the coalition parties promised prior to the last election. The three per cent plus three per cent co&hyphen;contribution scheme would have contributed an extra $400 billion to the national savings  pool by the year 2020, according to the shadow Treasurer, Gareth Evans. He has given an example of the effect of the abandonment of this payment on a worker aged 35 years, on average weekly earnings, when he retires at age 65. Under the Labor Party scheme, he or she would have received a superannuation payout of $280,000. Under the coalition policy, he or she will receive $170,000&mdash;a loss of $110,000 to that worker and his or her family. The tax rebate scheme hardly compensates for that loss.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, Mr John Randall, a superannuation partner with Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, estimated that the replacement of the co&hyphen;contribution with the savings rebate will halve the cost to the government, estimated at $3.76 billion over three years for the rebate compared with $7.43 billion for the co&hyphen;contribution payment. Clearly, this coalition government is asking working people to accept a lower standard of living in retirement so that they can balance the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Child care is a major issue in the electorate of Greenway because of the large number of two&hyphen;income families who are forced to work to make ends meet. I referred to the previous 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4959"> Labor government's excellent record in this field in my speech on the appropriation bill last year when I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the previous Labor government the Blacktown local government area was approved as a high need area for new community based, long day care places and outside school hours places. Under Labor, western Sydney had 361 places for every 1,000 children, compared with the New South Wales average of 326 places per thousand. Blacktown also had the highest relative level of long day care supply in western Sydney. Under Labor, the availability and the affordability of child&hyphen;care facilities increased considerably.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This good work has now been undone by the government in just two budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1996 budget the coalition government cut child&hyphen;care funding by $500 million, and the 1997 budget has seen another $321 million cut&mdash;that is, $821 million in just two budgets. Further, the 1997 budget has placed a ceiling on the number of child&hyphen;care places at 7,000. The reduction of the operating funding for long day care takes effect from 1 July this year. The reduction in the operating funding for care before and after school hours will cause the same problems for this sector as the withdrawal of the funding from long day care. These problems are: fee increases from possibly 25 per cent to 50 per cent; more administration; a reduction in the quality of child care; a loss of qualified staff; a reduction in the standard of vocational care; and failure to meet the needs of children with special needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I understand that a small number of low&hyphen;income families will benefit from the funding arrangements in this budget, most families will not. Clearly, the government has abandoned its commitment to working families who need child care. The government seems to have a policy mind&hyphen;set in operation that is determined to force women from the work force and families into the debtors court. Does anybody in the government actually care about children and families? Where, I ask, is the evidence for it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the strangest aspects of this budget, in view of Australia's entrenched unemployment, is its deferred pension plan. This scheme is designed to encourage people to stay in employment longer than they themselves intend to and this government is paying them to do so. This means that the jobs that would normally go to unemployed people are not now going to be available because of this government's financial inducement. This is not just some form of social engineering where the government is trying to rule out a particular retirement age. This has already happened where people are now losing their jobs at age 50 or over and are then considered unsuitable for further work. I believe this is a total disaster but the  government's move in this area is purely an economic move designed to save the government money by stopping people drawing on their pensions and the benefits that are attached to those pensions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Labor government already had the answer to our aging population with the compulsory superannuation scheme which this government is trying to destroy by not sticking to the pre-election promise to pay the co-contribution payment. My view is that if the government has spare cash to throw around, it would be far better to pay those over-50 people that I have referred to earlier that find themselves unemployed in those years between 50 and the normal retirement age of 65.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These days many people in this age group, which is the golden years of their life, find themselves on the industrial scrapheap with a mortgage still to pay, in many cases with children still to complete their education, with household items and furniture still to be paid for and at the same time are trying to make plans to move into a financially secure retirement. Many people cannot do this.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4960">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now move on to the pharmaceutical cuts. The pharmaceutical support for families and elders has suffered the same fate as child care&mdash;two years of massive cuts: $550 million in 1996; $700 million in this budget. I have received more phone calls from my constituents on this particular issue than on any other budget item. Many of the calls that I have received relate to the increased financial burden that these costs place on the elderly. Many new drugs will be placed outside the reach of ordinary families due to the introduction of the new drug tax of up to $20 a prescription. Other drugs have been taken off the PBS, forcing families and pensioners to pay the full cost of their medicines resulting in increases ranging from $2 to $4 per prescription.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I could then move on to education, we have seen cuts here again. We have seen a $72 million cut from vocational education and training. This is on top of the $183 million cut in last year's budget. But I want to refer to the hidden cuts to the funding for universities particularly in relation to the University of Western Sydney which is within my electorate. We have seen a one per cent cut in operating grants carried out administratively. We have seen the abolition of the Commonwealth industry places scheme. I understand a further one per cent cut to university funding in the years 2000 and 2001 coming on top of the five per cent cut announced last year will mean further difficulties particularly to new universities. For new universities that need growth funds to really get established, these types of cuts are unacceptable and will no doubt be roundly condemned by all western Sydney MPs irrespective of their political persuasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Local community organisations and business groups have lobbied the government prior to the budget. The Parramatta City Chamber of Commerce and Industry sent correspondence to Senator Vanstone on 28 April and said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The University of Western Sydney sits right in the middle of an area that contributes 8 per cent of gross national product. We currently have approximately 1.6 million people living in the greater west and this is projected to increase to 2.25 million by the year 2011.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are already significantly less opportunities for young people and mature age people to access tertiary education in the greater west than other areas such as Adelaide and Perth and we think the university should continue to develop and so serve the community.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The same correspondence from the Parramatta City Chamber of Commerce and Industry refers to the expectation of growing support and particular industry support for this university.  However, the letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Until the support becomes adequate, we urge that the University of Western Sydney be allowed to expand and develop as it has done since 1989 and in so doing serve the huge community of the greater west.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the same vein, the President of the Greater Western Sydney Regional Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mrs Betty Barrie, also wrote to the minister and I will quote from her letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The restricted number of higher education placements in Sydney's greater west forces many thousands of university students to travel long distances into the Sydney C.B.D area. This adversely impacts upon their travel time, their families, employers, personal health, traffic jams, the environment and the rail system that is already strained during peak periods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is time that the inequity in higher education resources within the greater Sydney area is addressed (as is now being tackled in the public health system). Whilst recognising that all universities can develop `valid' claims for funding, the case for greater western Sydney is overwhelming&mdash;the resources must in future be invested where the need is&mdash;where the people are&mdash;where the jobs are&mdash;where there is long term growth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">To put my interpretation on Mrs Barrie's letter, as the Labor Party is developing the beds for the west policy in respect of health policies in New South Wales, I am saying that we should 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4961"> also move to have university places moved to the west.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To further add to the argument in support of additional funds for the University of Western Sydney, I note that the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research has carried out a study on the effect of financial cuts imposed on the University of Western Sydney. The results of this study are reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 23 May. The report makes the following points relating to funding cuts to the University of Western Sydney: that they are likely to have a serious impact on the economic health and employment prospects in this area; that a one per cent reduction in funding would translate to a $3.3 million fall in gross national product; and it concludes that UWS's role is vital in providing higher education in western Sydney and that reducing its budget and student numbers would affect gross national product and widen the existing skills gap between western Sydney and the rest of the metropolitan area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In referring to these references to the effectiveness of the University of Western Sydney, I am appealing to the coalition government for additional growth funds for this university until it can establish links with business organisations, as the more established and older universities have done over probably up to 100 years that they have been in existence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to move on to the important role that the University of Western Sydney is providing in the field of Aboriginal education, and the effects that the budget cuts will have on these programs. These are cuts to travel allowance for the Aboriginal students who are attending university. The cuts are very mean&hyphen;spirited indeed in the context of the Australian reconciliation conference and of the debate on the stolen Aboriginal children that has been held in this parliament over the past few weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cuts will make it impossible for Aboriginal students from more remote communities to come to universities such as the University of Western Sydney, according to the Vice&hyphen;Chancellor, Professor Deryck Schreuder. He has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am deeply concerned that the cuts announced in this budget to take effect in 1998, will seriously affect the opportunities of Aborigines in distant townships and areas who want and deserve a chance to expand their skills, often so that those skills can be put to work for the benefit of their own communities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Ann Flood, the Director of the Gool an gullia Centre at the University of Western Sydney Macarthur, has said that the cuts have thrown into doubt the future of the Aboriginal rural  education program. This program draws students from New South Wales and southern Queensland. It involves a residential school for Aboriginal students at UWS Macarthur for five two&hyphen;week periods during the year, and DEETYA funding is essential for accommodation, travel and incidental costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the cuts, many students will be cut off from the scheme with only one year to go after studying for four years. Many more will be cut off midstream. In all, over 150 students will be affected. There are 16 graduates this year&mdash;graduates with education degrees who will go back to their own communities to teach. The benefit these graduates bring to the wider Aboriginal community is immeasurable and is a reflection of the commitment by the UWS Macarthur over a period of 15 years. Ms Flood said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cuts represent a huge step back on gains made in Aboriginal education in the last 20 years. The rug is being pulled out from beneath their feet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many things that I can speak about in this budget, but I do feel&mdash;as do most other western Sydney MPs&mdash;that we have to put in a special plug for the University of Western Sydney. I will conclude this part of my submission by referring to a letter from Professor 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4962"> Juchau, Dean of the Faculty of Management at the University of Western Sydney. His letter says in part:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to debate the coalition government's second budget as set out in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1997&hyphen;98, a budget that continues to deliver on our election commitments to families and small business and our promise to future generations to repay the debt that Labor left to them. That is the bottom line in this debate&mdash;the legacy of the debt and deficit that Labor left behind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all very well for members opposite to come into this chamber with their hands on their hearts and decry some of the reductions in government spending that had to be made. No&hyphen;one on this side of the House denies that some of these decisions have been tough, but we also say that they are fair. But it is blatantly hypocritical for the opposition to come here and carp and complain about cutbacks that were necessary only because of their own failed economic management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Labor came to power in 1983, foreign debt was $23 billion. Thirteen years later, it had grown to more than $180 billion; but they did nothing to address it&mdash;nothing at all. The coalition's first two budgets have begun to put us back on track and they have turned a $10.3 billion Labor deficit into a coalition surplus next year. This is the first time for more than a decade that this country and Commonwealth will not run up a debt. This year we will actually start to pay it back and we will repay over $5 billion&mdash;and that is without raising taxes. This is in stark contrast to Labor's attitude in government: big spending, big taxing and massive debts, leaving it all for our kids to worry about and pay back in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proud to be part of a government that takes a much more responsible approach to economic management. The families and small businesses in my electorate of Forde are certainly enjoying one of the most obvious benefits of the government's economic management, and that is the reduction in interest rates. We all remember Labor's record high  interest rates in excess of 17 per cent. It meant a second mortgage for my husband and me, and it saw many families that I knew lose their homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was very gratifying when, in my electorate only last week, a young gentleman in his early twenties came and told me to go down and give Mr Costello a pat on the back on his behalf, because he had been on the verge of losing his house when the interest rates dropped. He now saves an extra $300 a month and he said that that was the only thing that saved him from losing his house. That is what this government is all about: helping our young families get a start and letting them feel and know what it is like to have come true their dream of owning a house and home and starting their families off. We are giving them the best chance of that. So far, since the election in March last year, families with a mortgage of around $100,000 are saving close to $30 per month in interest rates. That is a huge benefit and, as I said before, many of the battling families in Forde asked me to pass on to the Treasurer their thanks for easing their burden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many more benefits to this budget and the government's very responsible and practical approach. One of the benefits I would like to focus on today in the remainder of my 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4963"> speech is the innovative work for the dole scheme. This budget allocates $21 million over two years to fund up to 10,000 places in 70 pilot projects. Prior to the announcement by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in February that the government would introduce work for the dole, this was probably the most commonly raised suggestion that I received from local residents. During the election campaign and after, people continually raised the issue. I am very proud to be part of a government that is listening to the community and delivering on what they want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bottom line is that work for the dole makes sense. It is not introduced as a panacea for unemployment and we have never claimed it to be. It is a practical and genuine way of involving jobseekers in the community, of giving them hands&hyphen;on experience and helping break the unproductive cycles that so many unemployed people, particularly long&hyphen;term unemployed, fall into. As the Queensland Premier Bob Borbidge said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It tackles a very serious problem in our community and it will allow a great many young Australians to seize the work ethic where they have been denied that opportunity in the past.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Even New South Wales Premier Bob Carr said on work for the dole:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Youth unemployment is a curse in our society and anything that provides a ray of hope and a training experience is going to be welcomed by all of us.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As it has been welcomed by the Australian public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate, like many others across Australia, I have been inundated with input and interest from local community groups, council and individuals who are very supportive of the plan and anxious to be involved. I have also been lobbying very strongly, on behalf of the communities of the regional townships of Beaudesert and Boonah in my electorate, for these areas to form part of the pilot scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Beaudesert and Boonah were hard hit by a closure early last year of the Australian Meat Holdings plant at Bromelton, following protracted industrial disputes under the previous government. The plant has formed the backbone of the local community for over 40 years. I am very pleased to say that the local community is rallying to attract other industries to the area and promote the many benefits of the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that note, I would like to acknowledge and thank the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) for recently agreeing to an  additional $200,000, on top of the $200,000 announced in December last year, to get the Beaudesert small business incubator up and running. The community is very exited about this project and they are gratified that the government has displayed such faith in them. I look forward at a later date to reporting to the House on the centre's success. There is no doubt that regional areas like Beaudesert and Boonah will benefit greatly from the work for the dole scheme.The beauty of this scheme is that it involves whole communities and provides benefits that go far beyond the individual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, I have visited a number of secondary schools around the country in the past six months as part of an inquiry into factors affecting youth employment. We raised the issue of work for the dole&mdash;and most of the time it was raised by the schoolchildren&mdash;and overwhelmingly the majority of the young people have been in favour of the scheme. They recognise that they will be given genuine work experience. Moreover, they believe it will help the younger generation regain the trust and respect of the older generation. I thought this was a particularly insightful comment. They believe that the older generation has lost faith in them 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4964"> and the media image is always that the young people do not want to work for the dole. They believe that this gives them the opportunity to prove their worth to all communities within Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These young people recognise there is a negative stereotype of young jobseekers in some sectors of the community, including many employers, for various reasons. They see this scheme as helping them to dispel the myth and prove that they are worthy members of the community who want to play their part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another observation was that the projects they will work on will be community&hyphen;based and will help young people to get to know their local areas, build civic pride and feel a sense of belonging that is so much missing today. There is no doubt that long&hyphen;term unemployment, especially for young people, leads them to feel very isolated and withdrawn from society. The work for the dole scheme draws them back into their community and lets them know that we value their skill and attitude and that we want them to contribute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, it has enormous psychological benefits. I know that there have been some people who argue that there must be structured training as part of this scheme. I believe these people are missing the point. Work for the dole is not about training. It does not pretend to be, and the government has committed over $1.7 billion over the next four years for increased apprenticeships and traineeships for our young people. Various training programs remain available to the unemployed and will continue to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Work for the dole is about discipline, commitment and work experience. I have no doubt that many people who participate in this scheme will pick up a variety of skills and there will be an element of training involved along the way. The point of the scheme is not to push people into another training scheme that will heighten expectations and ultimately prove to be futile, as Labor did during their time in office. They operated a system of revolving door training schemes, most of which failed miserably in terms of job placement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my constituents wrote to me recently congratulating the government on the work for the dole scheme. She had been unemployed for the past 14 years and her husband had been unemployed for the past four years, despite completing skillshare training schemes. Of those schemes, she wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems to be only providing jobs for the trainers. We've seen the published numbers of people that have been helped, but we do not believe it. We feel the unemployed were being "hidden" while on the training scheme.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This reflects the feedback I have had from many of my constituents who have been directly involved in the scheme and who have become disillusioned and frustrated&mdash;especially by the previous government's approach, which was basically to throw money at the problem and hope it went away. On the work for the dole scheme, my constituent writes that her husband has been saying for many years that he wants to do this to keep up his skills and to show employers that he wants to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems incredible to me that some critics have suggested that the work for the dole should be a comprehensive training scheme. As any employer will tell you, training is only one aspect that makes a good employee. In many cases, employers are happy to offer training themselves for jobs that they have. Of greater importance is the concept of work ethic and the ability to stick at a job, have pride in your work and have confidence in yourself. Sadly, many young people today are not given the opportunities to develop these aspects of themselves. How can they develop a strong work ethic if they have never been able to find work? How can they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4965"> know the commitment it takes, or the pride in a job well done, if they have not had the chance to go to a workplace and play their role?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Work for the dole does not provide jobs&mdash;and we have never promised it would&mdash;but it does provide skills, commitment and a sense of belonging right now. Real jobs will be provided in the coming years as the government's economic plan continues to deliver better deals for small business and encourage private sector growth and expansion. But, unlike the previous government, we are not prepared to sit back and let our young people languish on the unemployment heap until that time. Work for the dole gives them a focus and valuable work skills now which help prepare them as jobs become available. As I said in the beginning, it simply makes good sense. It has broad community support, including most job seekers, and many people cannot believe it has taken so long for a government to introduce such a scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Predictably, those opposite have been begrudging in their qualified support for the scheme. They realise that this has widespread community support but, as they have in the past, they want to make it more complex and discuss it some more, and basically delay its introduction. The Australian public do not understand this attitude. But perhaps we can gain an insight into the opposition's attitude if we look at comments by the ACTU President, Jennie George, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, shortly after the announcement of the scheme. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The union movement would be dead against any move by the government to introduce a work for the dole scheme.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">`Dead against'. It is clear to see why the opposition's position is so unclear on this commonsense plan. They are shackled by the union movement, once again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that the coalition government has no such shackles. The 1997 budget, with funding for work for the dole pilot, is part of a commonsense approach to meeting the needs of those Australians who are currently unemployed. As I said, we do not pretend for a moment that this is the panacea to the unemployment problem. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 12 February, political commentator Paddy McGuinness in his column said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labour market analysts who have studied the issues have long since agreed that any approach to lowering the rate of unemployment overall must involve not a single policy measure, nor a grand plan, but a whole suite of ad hoc and specially designed measures to deal with different aspects and segments of the larger problem.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Clearly, part of that `larger problem' is the erosion of personal confidence and the difficulty in developing a strong work ethic that occurs when people, particularly young people, have been without a job for some time. In fact, I think the psychological effects of unemployment&mdash;many of which can be addressed with an effective work for the dole program&mdash;are part of other larger problems such as youth suicide, which is appalling in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a member of the Family and Community Affairs Committee, I have had the opportunity to examine issues such as teenage pregnancy, family breakdown, juvenile crime and other social problems. Again, the work for the dole scheme will not solve these problems overnight but I firmly believe it will help many individuals and form part of a larger solution to these problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to reflect again on the record of the previous government on youth unemployment and debt. During its term in office, the youth unemployment rate was around 30 per cent&mdash;even higher in some regional areas&mdash;and debt ballooned. Labor had no answer except, as I said, to throw money at the problem, increase expectations, and cause a great deal of frustration and resentment. Our work for the dole does not purport to create jobs. Jobs will be created as small businesses grow and expand, as greater confidence is created through the sound economic management of this government, which is what the budget is all about. But, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4966"> as part of the government's commonsense approach, work for the dole will provide hope, skills and help unemployed people to be more involved and feel a part of their local community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The young and the long&hyphen;term unemployed deserve better than the revolving door training programs of the previous government. They are certainly getting better from this government&mdash;as are families, small business owners, and future generations of Australians, who will not have a massive debt to pay back because we are starting to address the problems of debt and deficit in a very responsible way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the people of Forde, I am pleased to strongly support the 1997 budget and to congratulate the Prime Minister for his personal commitment to the work for the dole scheme, as do many other young Australians of this nation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I assure the speaker who immediately preceded me, the member for Forde (Mrs Elson), that my judgment about the budget differs very significantly from her concluding remarks. The three primary objectives of the budget should have been job creation, family security and national savings. It has been recognised in the community generally that the budget sank without a ripple.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you well know, Mr Deputy Speaker, a person who represents the electorate of Throsby spoke earlier this morning and made a similar observation. When you refer to the Commonwealth budget, people now ask, `What budget?' The impact of the budget was minimal as far as people's understanding of it is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unfortunate thing is that, in terms of the impact of that budget, it will be very different indeed. It certainly will not be minimal. The budget does nothing for the three primary objectives&mdash;job creation, family security and national savings. Ross Gittins, an economic journalist for whom I have great admiration, wrote in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 14 May, following the budget, that, `This budget is a confidence trick.' Ross Gittins was right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before referring briefly to the three chief objectives, I suggest that this government is increasingly being recognised as a government that issues high&hyphen;sounding rhetoric but is, essentially a government of mimicry, gimmickry, cynicism and hypocrisy. I will give some  examples. First of all, to justify that unconscionable sale of one third of Telstra&mdash;perhaps yielding a total of $12 to $14 billion&mdash;it undertook to establish an electoral slush fund of $1 billion. Some of those funds have already been allocated, but by far the bigger proportion of it remains to be allocated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the observation that, if that money is going to be spread around Australia on various types of environmental restoration and protection schemes, I will be putting in a very strong bid for some of those funds to go to Lake Macquarie, which borders the greater part of my electorate, in order to assist in necessary remedial work in relation to that lake&mdash;the largest salt water lake in Australia. It is a magnificent natural feature and an important asset. It is in need of remedial work, and I expect that some of those funds will be applied to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member who preceded me referred to the work for the dole scheme. I find that expression offensive, insensitive and demeaning. Any other type of label could have been attached to it, but to call it `work for the dole' I find particularly offensive. It reflects unfavourably on the government that such an expression should have been used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any members and supporters of the government&mdash;including the member who preceded me&mdash;who are sensitive to many of the social problems and traumas associated with unemployment 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4967"> on the part of these young people will understand why I say that identifying assistance to them as work for the dole is demeaning&mdash;and it is demeaning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And now, of course, we have got packages&mdash;a number of important national initiatives appearing under that high sounding title, the Federation Fund. Most of those allocations would have been made, anyway. I am sure that there would have been a package put together that would have contained some of those. Some that have been announced&mdash;such as, the national museum and the Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander studies with a total cost, I think, of something like $70 million&mdash;I endorse. But out of that total of $1 billion, that still leaves $930 million in that slush fund and we on the opposition side will be observing very closely just what happens to that money. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, 14 May, in reference to the federal fund, Tony Wright said, `Bring out the whiteboards,' and we know what message that was supposed to convey.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said that I wanted to make some brief reference to the question of job creation. The budget forecasts a growth rate over the next 12 months of 3.75 per cent and a reduction in unemployment. Those two figures are incompatible, and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Treasury advisers, and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the government, their supporters and the wider community, know that they are incompatible. If we achieve a growth figure of only 3.75 per cent over the next 12 months, unemployment will grow. Why then, contrary to the advice, and with the material that would have been provided from the Department of Treasury, would those figures have been cooked up in the Treasurer's office, as they quite clearly were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the present time there are a quarter of a million long&hyphen;term unemployed people. That is the highest level of long&hyphen;term unemployed for two years, and the figure is growing. And this was the government which suggested that it would have some beneficial impact on the level of unemployment and, particularly, on long&hyphen;term unemployment. As a direct result of that government's budget, there are going to be another 16,500 public service jobs disappear, and that is in addition to the first instalment of 11,500 public service jobs which have already disappeared. The rhetoric of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) at question time has become a tired joke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year the government slashed more than 230,000 training places&mdash;and I emphasise the word `training'&mdash;by cutting $1.8 billion from labour market programs. But Minister Kemp refers to the work for the dole scheme and that miserable 800 places identified as being provided in the Green Corps scheme as though they herald a new era of grand vision and compassion. Members of the opposition and people in the wider community are not fooled by that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I get on to that savings initiative, I also want to make some very brief reference to the question of family security. It is in this area that the attacks have gone out in all directions. In housing, for example, there are about 230,000 families on public sector housing waiting lists in Australia at the present time. But despite that, this present government has cut the funding by $50 million from the Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the area of health, we know the limits that have been placed on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, and the requirement for people to take cheap drugs, even though those cheap drugs may not be useful for their particular ailment. And the total number of drugs, of course, has been cut significantly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the area of child care, there is going to be the imposition of a limit of 7,000 on new 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4968"> private sector places, and a limit of 20 hours per week for parents who are not working. People, particularly those single parents who are undertaking training courses and who are studying, now feel threatened by this, and they should because they are going to be very seriously disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now come to the question of national savings. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall the former government's proposal was that the second tranche of its tax cuts would have been paid in the form of a three per cent contribution to superannuation to match an employee contribution of three per cent. Under that compulsory type of superannuation arrangement, that would have represented the equivalent of nine per cent of total wages and salaries going into the superannuation funds. It was intended that that would increase to a total of 12 per cent in the early part of the next century. So that contribution was necessary as one of the steps on the ladder towards the total of about 12 per cent of wages and salaries being paid into superannuation funds. That represents literally hundreds of billions of dollars of national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The present government, despite the fact that at the last election it indicated that it would honour the undertaking that the Labor Party had previously given about the second tranche of that tax cut arrangement, has now repudiated that position completely. That arrangement was one of the great national policy initiatives of the Keating Government. I endorsed it then, supported it then, and I still do. It was doing two things: first of all, it was making it possible, with government support, for people to provide more adequately for their own retirement income, their own retirement security; and, in addition, it was going to make a major impact in the critical area of national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without a major impact in that area, there is very little possibility, as everyone knows, that we are going to be able to bring down the current account deficit, which is the most intractable problem that the Australian economy faces. The present government's record has been deplorable. As I said, it initially undertook to pay the tax cuts in full, then it repudiated that position. It is now going to use those funds for this crazy savings tax break.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget as a whole, as Ross Gittins and others have indicated, is a fraudulent document. In terms of its general forecasts, for example, observations have been made by well&hyphen;known  commentators, including Mr Chris Richardson, who is a former Treasury forecaster and now a director of Access Economics. He said the government's economic forecasts did not add up. I have already given some reasons why that was the position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the tax rebate on savings, we know that the proposal is that $450 per year, on tax day, will in effect be returned to people who have been able to earn interest on $60,000 at five per cent. They do not have to have saved that during the previous 12 months. All they have to do is to have savings equal to, say, $60,000 being held at five per cent and they will then qualify for a straight rebate of $450. Let me say this: there are not going to be many of my constituents who get $450 back, because they have not got $60,000 saved&mdash;nor will they.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tax rebate is not going to encourage savings. You will remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it was supposed to be the cornerstone of the budget. It was the core of the budget. It was the great initiative. It would make inroads into that problem of national savings. Even kids at high school know that savings are not a function of either interest rates or concessional arrangements of that kind. Savings are a simple function of income: if you have got the income, you can save and you will save; if you do not have the income, you cannot save and you will not save&mdash;and $450 a year will make no difference. In fact, it will reduce national 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4969"> savings. The point has been made that not only will it not encourage private sector savings, but as a result of the government applying its own revenue to that purpose it will reduce public sector savings. The overall result is that national savings will decline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tax rebate was the core of the government's budget: it would `increase national savings'. But it will do nothing of the kind. Even Treasury officials are indicating at the present time that it will not have the effect that it was supposed to have had. In fact, it will have a negative impact on savings and it is going to cost $2 billion over two years. It is also more likely to worsen the foreign debt problem, which is already accelerating under this government&mdash;the government that assured everyone that it was going to get the foreign debt under control. It has not done it, and it is not doing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government claims the rebate is a reward for thrift. My constituents can be as thrifty as they like, but they are not going to put away 60,000 bucks at five per cent. And there are some people in the community who could spend as liberally from their income as they possibly could and who would still not avoid putting away in excess of $60,000 in savings. High income earners will pick up the $450 even though they reduce their savings&mdash;and yet it is supposed to be a means of encouraging saving. As well, high income earners who have $60,000 put away at five per cent will pick up the $450 on tax day and can then take the $60,000 out of the bank account and go away for a holiday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we need any further evidence of the fact that it is not only inequitable but embarrassing to those people who will benefit from it, we had the absurdity of the situation just recently in the House of Representatives where the Prime Minister, in order to avoid embarrassment and to acknowledge the inequity, injustice and disgrace of that particular proposal, said that he would not claim it. Why will he not claim it? Because he would be too damned embarrassed to do so. He knows it is not justified and that it is only those people with high savings who are going to benefit from it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this amounts to is that my constituents, who will be paying their tax and not getting the $450, will be the people who are taxed and charged in order to transfer all of those $450 rebates to the high income earners who will benefit from them. To benefit, of course, taxpayers must already hold those savings which are already earning interest; and, to get maximum benefit, a taxpayer would need the $60,000 in savings in order to earn five per cent interest or to provide an interest income during the year of $3,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">High income earners are unlikely to be encouraged to do any further saving as a result of the promise of $450 each year, and the total impact of that particular provision will be nothing like the government has been suggesting. A taxpayer can also gain that $450 if they contribute $3,000 per year to superannuation; but that still does not include many of my constituents. If, instead of $60,000, they hold $30,000 in investments earning 10 per cent, that still does not include my constituents. In addition, I do not know what immediate impact the measure was supposed to have, because it will not even start to come into operation until 1 July next year and will not be fully implemented until 1 July 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Comments have been made by a number of commentators in relation to the rebate. I have mentioned some of those by Ross Gittins. The 17 May editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> said that the `inequity of the savings rebate has been dramatically conceded', in reference to the Prime Minister promising in parliament that he would not be claiming the rebate and his demand that the Opposition Leader, Mr Beazley, show the same restraint. I notice that the Prime Minister made no such demand against members of his own front bench, and so they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4970"> can all pick up their $450. Brian Toohey said, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun&hyphen;Herald</EMPHASIS> of 18 May, that wage earners&mdash;and my constituents are wage earners&mdash;`will also be helping to fund the rebate for multi&hyphen;millionaires who could easily spend the entire $450 on a single roll of the dice at a casino or on a few glasses of good red wine.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, that whole approach has been nothing short of disgraceful. I have heard the rhetoric in the chamber, I have heard it during question time, I have heard it in debate, I have heard it around the traps in public comments, I have heard it in public statements and in public speeches by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government introduced a budget which we saw sink without a ripple. People have forgotten the details but now the impact of those details, those elements of the budget, will be brought home to them very, very forcefully. There are those cuts to major social programs and as those cuts become apparent, as they start to bite, as people become disadvantaged by them, as they will be, then increasingly they will know very well the true nature of this government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak in this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1997-98 and to congratulate the government on bringing forward a second responsible budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two important themes that this budget builds on from the 1996 budget and they are no new taxes and a budget surplus by the year 1998&hyphen;99. It is very positive that we are moving towards a budget surplus because this country can no longer afford to run deficits. The level of government debt is this government's responsibility and we must ensure that we fix up the problems left by the previous government. We inherited a $10 billion current account deficit from them, and that was on top of an accumulated Commonwealth debt which exploded between 1990 and 1996 to $75 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, this budget is built on the premise that we will move towards a surplus. At the end of the first term of this government that surplus will be a $1.6 billion, and as we move into the next century we will be looking at accumulated budget surpluses of up to $5 billion. That will go towards repaying not only our current account deficit but also go some way towards repaying some of our Commonwealth debt. No individual or group can continue to spend more  than they earn be it a small business in Ballina, a pensioner couple retired in Tweed Heads, or a successful accountant in Byron Bay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the purposes of the asset sales that are happening, particularly with this one-third sale of Telstra, is to repay part of that Commonwealth debt that we have accumulated. Likewise, with the privatisation of the FAC&mdash;and we are actually retaining title&mdash;a lot of those proceeds will go towards retiring debt. No matter how much or how little money you earn, you should not spend more than you earn, and the same goes for a government. Overspending is irresponsible and it only serves to leave future generations with outstanding debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to add that it is interesting to note that the New South Wales government at the moment is contemplating privatising the power authority. That is breathtaking in the sense that it is valued at $22 billion. So asset sales are not unique to this government: it is happening with the New South Wales ALP government as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than increase tax, which occurred under the previous ALP government, we are actually including tax cuts in the form of a 15 per cent rebate on savings. This is progressive. Lower income earners, contrary to what was said by the previous speaker, have the most to gain because at marginal tax rates, and let us say for people on incomes between $5,400 and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4971"> $20,000, they will only be paying five per cent as opposed to 20 per cent. So it is far more beneficial for lower income earners on that particular tax scale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal by the ALP and the Democrats to means test this measure should be condemned. The National Party and the Liberal Party said during the election campaign that they would govern for all Australians. This savings rebate is available to all Australians. This is of particular benefit to the thousands of self-funded retirees who have decided that they will retire on the beautiful far north coast of New South Wales and who rely heavily on interest from savings, and also for people who are on part pensions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the area of small business, one of the great things that this government has done, particularly in the budget, is introduce changes to capital gains tax. The actual level of capital gains will now be up to half a million dollars. If you have a company, or if you are in a 50 per cent partnership with your spouse, then you will be able to roll over up to $1 million. This is particularly significant if you are a small business operator at Cabarita Beach, at Alstonville, or a surf board factory at Byron Bay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of those people employ labour. They sacrifice those savings, obviously, to pay superannuation for their employees&mdash;which they have to&mdash;and they do not provide for their own superannuation. Indeed, their own superannuation is when they come to sell their business. These changes to capital gains will mean that their final nest egg, when they do sell their business, can be rolled over. It is also heartening to know that the change in test has meant that you do not have to just transfer into like businesses; you can transfer into any business or roll into superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been changes, of course, to the FBT regime which was introduced by the previous government. There are no new taxes on taxis or on parking. There are moves to reduce compliance procedures, where businesses paying less than $25,000 per annum in tax can submit tax on a quarterly, rather than on a monthly basis. This goes hand&hyphen;in&hyphen;glove with changes that we have made to industrial relations, where we have a far more flexible industrial relations environment and, indeed, a much fairer unfair dismissal law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the most interesting point with small business and with the mums and dads and families of Australia is the interest rate regime which has brought about the lowering of interest rates  over the last 15 months. Indeed, if you look at the average Australian who has a $100,000 mortgage, with the fall in interest rates now, that is currently a saving of $225 per month, or the equivalent&mdash;if you want to look at it before tax&mdash;of $100 a week pay increase. That is what the $225 savings has meant, and that has come about because of the responsible policies of this government and because of the credit rating that foreign companies and foreign institutions are now giving to this country's monetary policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the area of employment, the coalition sees the success of small business as the key to solving the crisis that has happened not just over the last couple of years, but over the last decade in this country. It was obvious that during those 13 years of Labor you could not help the unemployed by milking business for more taxes and throwing money into unsuccessful training courses. This is not to say that they all were, but the premise was wrong. It was penalising the greatest employment generator, which is small business, at the expense of real long&hyphen;term job creation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of spending billions of dollars on labour market programs, many of which were grossly unsuccessful&mdash;particularly new work opportunities which have now come in at four per cent&mdash;there is a changing government focus onto apprenticeships. Two hundred and sixty 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4972"> five million dollars will be focused on 100,000 new apprenticeships. This is all part of $450 million going into national apprenticeship schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Changes will be happening next year with the combined service delivery agencies of the CES and the DSS and, of course, with the creation of the EPEs and the PEPEs which will give greater competition to the market and provide not just placement facilities but training. Fifty million dollars will also go to vocational education in schools; $24 million will go to one&hyphen;stop apprenticeship shops and, of course, there is the government's plan for the work for the dole scheme&mdash;and I do hope that I receive some of those projects on the far north coast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the area of education&mdash;and this is where we are getting right back to basics to solve our unemployment&mdash;we are working to provide better standard of education to the next generation of Australians that are coming forward into the labour market. To this end, this government is spending an extra $152 million, part of $3.75 billion in education for this year. This is part of a $14 billion project over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many schools have already benefited in the Richmond electorate, notably, public schools such as Murwillumbah High School and Pottsville Primary School, and private schools such as St Anthony's in Kingscliff and Shearwater in Mullumbimby. And I do hope to see special emergency funding for Ballina Christian School which I opened last weekend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the real focus in education is on improvement in the areas of literacy to give young primary school children those basic skills of reading and writing so that when they leave high school they are equipped and prepared to enter the labour market with adequate life skills. Unfortunately, there has been a deterioration over the last couple of years to an extent now that one in five young Australians who leave school are illiterate. Therefore, $560 million is going to three special programs: $160 million to literacy; $156 million to students with special learning needs, and $54 million to languages. Of course, there is an extra top&hyphen;up of $191 million to TAFE.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is the elderly that I would like to focus on because, out of 148 federal seats only three seats have a higher elderly population than does the seat of Richmond in the far north of NSW. Pensioners will have their rate of pension locked in for the first time by the Commonwealth legislation at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. In addition, of course, 10,500 veterans will become eligible for compensation for injuries or disease resulting from overseas service. Twelve additional areas of service have been included in the veterans' entitlements. Likewise, for older Australians, we reaffirm that there will be additional funding of $10 million over four years for people with dementia and their carers. Likewise, $14.7 million goes to funding the palliative care program, which is part of, obviously, a rather controversial debate that this parliament had recently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government assistance for home nursing will be boosted with a $16.60 per fortnight increase in domiciliary nursing care benefit, which is particularly relevant to the aged population that I represent. Also, 15,800 pensioners and part&hyphen;pensioners will receive approximately $110 million worth of federal government money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the area of health, I am particularly pleased that there was an announcement of $40 million over four years to support improvements in acute health care for hospital patients. In addition, $34 million will go to hepatitis C surveillance and education, the National Breast Cancer Centre and the national anti&hyphen;tobacco campaign. It is particularly important that we are having this debate at the moment in this parliament. Legislation which addresses nursing homes and aged care will be brought before the parliament. We have a huge demand for nursing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4973"> homes and hostels in my electorate, particularly in Ballina and Alstonville in the south and the Tweed region in the north.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For regional Australia, though, there has been a major plus and this is continuing from last year, particularly for highways. This year, in the Richmond electorate alone, $3 million of Commonwealth money is being spent on the Bangalow bypass; $20 million has already been spent on construction of the Chinderah bypass bridge; $107 million is committed to the Chinderah to the Billinudgel part of the Pacific Highway; $11.8 million is currently being expended on the Ewingsdale to Tyagarah section and $11 million on the Brunswick bypass. Capital infrastructure is pouring into the Richmond electorate at a rate that has not been seen since Federation. The diesel fuel rebate is another icon that has been protected within the budget. Of course, $1 billion will go to the establishment of the Federation Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of these initiatives within the budget illustrate that this government is looking for a budget which provides consistency, which provides a budget surplus and which can also deliver in the long term to make Australia a more sustainable country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is interesting is that there have been no new taxes in this budget, unlike what has happened in New South Wales recently in respect of poker machines. I would like to focus on the New South Wales ALP government's budget decision recently to increase poker machine taxes by a further five per cent to 30 per cent, which is in addition to tax increases already announced this year. This tax will cause the loss of hundreds of direct jobs and thousands of indirect jobs in the Richmond electorate. I am sure the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) will recognise the stupidity of this tax.</PARA>

The Tweed is the home of some of the biggest and most successful clubs in the state, including Twin Towns Services Club, Tweed Heads Bowls Club, South Tweed Heads Bowls Club, Seagulls Rugby League Club, Murwillumbah Services Club and Kingscliff&mdash;just to name a few.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Tweed Valley, there are 12 clubs with a total membership of over 100,000 people. These clubs directly employ 1,500 people with a total wages bill of $33 million. In addition, they spend $50 million per annum to suppliers and subcontractors. They donate over $4 million to sporting groups, charities, schools, emergency services and, in particular, to the local hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the lead&hyphen;up to the ALP state budget, Tweed and Murwillumbah hospitals were in great need of a major increase in funding to help reduce the hospital queues and the strain on our local hospital services. It is therefore ironic that instead of receiving a major funding boost from the ALP, one of the hospitals' biggest benefactors, the clubs, have been put in jeopardy. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4974"> Even the left wing of the ALP feel that what the New South Wales Right has been doing is absolutely disgraceful. Twin Towns actively donates funds to over 120 different local organisations, such as the Guide Dog Association, the rescue service, Lifeline and the child flight helicopter service. The Tweed Heads and South Tweed bowls clubs donate to another 100  organisations between them, including the Tweed Heads police and the Salvation Army.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 12 clubs in the Tweed Valley make a combined profit of $4 million after tax. They are already paying $20 million every year to the state government, including $16 million from poker machines. An increase in poker machine tax would take an extra $5 million out of the Tweed and turn this $4 million profit into a $1 million loss. A $1 million loss will result in the loss of 600 direct jobs and 1,500 indirect jobs. Such a level of redundancy would be absolutely devastating to the Tweed, which already has high levels of unemployment. Indeed, it would be devastating for many Labor heartland areas in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No population of 63,000 can withstand the removal of $5 million from the local economy or the overnight disappearance of 2,100 jobs. I will certainly hold Bob Carr, Michael Egan and local Lismore based MLC Janelle Saffin personally responsible for any loss of jobs as a result of this tax increase. I call upon some of the movers and shakers within the federal left wing of the Labor Party to show their true influence and reverse this decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of the clubs in the Tweed Valley are already at a very vulnerable point. Some have already closed, such as Terranora Country Club and Club Watersports. Seagulls Rugby League Club, which has a voluntary administrator, unfortunately yesterday retrenched over 100 people. My concern now is that this new tax increase could seriously jeopardise the overall viability of Seagulls, one of the icons of the Tweed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to the southern part of the Richmond electorate, I take this opportunity to mention the turnover and employment generated by Ballina RSL, Ballina Bowling Club, Byron Bay Services Club, Mullumbimby Ex&hyphen;Services Club, and some clubs outside my electorate, notably Lismore Workers Club and RSL. All of these clubs have done their sums and found that, between them, they stand to lose over $1.5 million in the Lismore&hyphen;Ballina region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call on the Carr government to review this budget measure. If they are too politically stubborn to admit their folly and refuse to drop this idea, then I call on the New South Wales Upper House to block this legislation. Lismore MLC Janelle Saffin can play a large role here,  as can some of her federal ALP colleagues. If she truly wants to represent her north coast constituents, if she really wants to do anything for the bar attendants, the musicians, the cleaners, the tradesmen, the carpenters, the cooks, the waiters and waitresses who work in these clubs, if she really cares for the thousands of pensioners who love their clubs for the good meals and great entertainment, then she will cross the floor and vote against increasing poker machine taxes.</PARA>

I could say that the direction in which we are headed is a wrong one, but the problem is really that we are not headed in any direction at all under this budget. It is not surprising that the headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  was appropriate in the week after the budget.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for drawing to attention the rudeness of those opposite on the government benches. My electorate is certainly made up of working people from over 100 different ethnic groups. When you walk down the main street of Marrickville where my office is located, you will find people from different cultural backgrounds all working together. The thing to emphasise here is that they are ordinary people, because these are the people that the Prime Minister and Treasurer have forgotten in this budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the whole, my electorate can be seen to be made up of lower&hyphen; and middle-income 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4976"> families and, I can tell you one thing for sure, not many of them will be able to take full advantage of the government's incentives rebate system. Perhaps the member for Richmond, with his background in share transactions and being involved in the finance sector might have mates welcoming the savings initiative of the Howard government, but certainly the average Australian will not benefit. The average Australian has savings of only a few thousand dollars in the bank and this translates to a rebate of less than $1 a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of those people living in Grayndler who are lucky enough to still have a job, close to 90 per cent are wage and salary earners. Not many of them will benefit from the incentives rebate system, unlike the 463 people in Australia with incomes of over $1 million per year with their average interest earnings of $52,000 a year. They are the winners from this so&hyphen;called initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, as Mr Howard so clearly pointed out in this very house a few weeks ago, people who have enough savings to attract the full $450 rebate do not need it. That is why he himself has said that he will not take this fee, but that is a poor excuse for public policy decision making. We now have self&hyphen;regulation of the taxation system regarding what rebates will be claimed, because this rebate is of little or no assistance to the bulk of the Australian population. It is of no use to pensioners, to the unemployed, to young families struggling to pay either the rent or the mortgage and to feed and clothe their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look to the people who work hard to save money and are therefore eligible for some rebate. What are they going to do with it when they get it as part of their tax return cheque? They are most likely to see it as a bonus and so go out and spend it along with the rest of their tax refund. This is hardly going to help national savings; is it? As Ross Gittins wrote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 15 May, the rebate is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . much more a reward for past and already intended saving than it is an incentive to greater saving in the future . . . Mr Costello's incentive involves a certain decline of $2 billion a year in the government's saving, offset by a smaller and uncertain increase in yours and my saving. It's thus certain to involve a net decline in national saving. What it's intended to save is not money, but votes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Let us talk a little more about national savings because, after all, the Treasurer tells us it is the government's most important economic objective arising from this budget. There is nothing in this budget that promotes national savings. At best, the government's plans will have a neutral impact. However, the most likely outcome is negative. That has been shown this week in the Senate where, in the economics estimates committee, Treasury has pointed out that they cannot guarantee and they do not think it will necessarily lead to increased savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, to the contrary, has abandoned its previous support for Labor's three per cent co&hyphen;contribution to the superannuation of workers. This co&hyphen;contribution would have added an additional $400 billion to national savings by the year 2020. Instead of supporting this scheme, which would benefit all workers, the government has substituted for it the savings incentive rebate that will only benefit some people. In other words, it is a reward for the coalition's natural constituency, those people on high incomes. The joke of course is that for these people the maximum benefit of $450 is chicken feed; it is just a gimmick. The government may as well have thrown in a free set of steak knives. Speaking of gimmicks, the pension bonus plan is another one. Here we have a government with no clues about how to address the unemployment problem in this country and yet they are encouraging older Australians to work longer. There is no logic in this move.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also announced that workers earning between $450 and $900 per month will be able to opt out of the superannuation guarantee and take wages in lieu. These are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4977"> among our poorest paid and most vulnerable members of the work force: they are women, outworkers, part&hyphen;time workers and often unskilled workers. Instead of protecting them by ensuring that they will have some retirement income, the government is throwing them to the wolves. From 1 July 1998, these people will be able to opt out of their superannuation contribution but only with the agreement of their employer. It is more likely to be at the insistence of their employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Low income workers and part&hyphen;time workers are often in a weak bargaining position. Many do not fully understand the superannuation scheme and many are from a non&hyphen;English speaking background. They may be told to opt out as it means less paperwork for their employers. They may also be told quite falsely that the extra money in their pay packet is a pay rise. The one thing this proposal is guaranteed not to do is help out national savings. The extra money may go into a bank account but in all likelihood it will be spent because the people it is directed towards simply cannot afford to save additional money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this is the plan the government has for its most important economic objective, I shudder to think what plans they may eventually formulate to deal with unemployment and industry. That is of course if the government ever gets around to formulating any plans at all in these two key areas. At a recent community meeting on the budget, held in my electorate, a member of the Australian Business Chamber told the audience that this budget had no vision or game plan to boost economic growth. The biggest missing ingredient was in industry development policy. The Business Council of Australia has said that the budget lacked both a broad national vision and any strategic policy for industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has shown no leadership over the closure of the BHP plant in Newcastle. The Prime Minister was not even informed earlier of the decision by the BHP board. Obviously he has little standing with this company. And where was the industry minister when this crisis hit? Firstly, at lunch, and then, when he finished his lunch, he could not attend a meeting in Newcastle because he chose to go to the opening of the Crown Casino in Melbourne. There he was, swanning about with the high society from the Melbourne Club down in Melbourne when the workers of Newcastle were having a meeting to discuss their future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike this government, the Labor Party does have a steel plan. The shadow minister for  industry and regional development has provided details of how to encourage value adding and investment in new technologies. Nor does this government have a clue on car tariffs. The fact is that the Labor Party has a plan&mdash;which has the agreement of many of the backbenchers sitting across the other side of the room, and it certainly would have the support of my agrarian socialist friends in the National Party&mdash;for government involvement to protect jobs and to protect the workers in those industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's record on unemployment is particularly woeful. The unemployment rate, when Labor left office in March 1996, was 8.5 per cent. The current rate is 8.7 per cent. The average rate of employment growth in Labor's last term of office was 700,000 new jobs created&mdash;2.9 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. The fact is that the mob opposite, the rabble interjecting here today, have created only one per cent of employment growth in their first year in office. Since last year's budget, 34,300 full&hyphen;time jobs have been lost. Unemployment in my electorate of Grayndler is up 58 per cent since March 1996. Clearly, neither the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, nor the minister responsible have a clue about the need for government involvement in employment creation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer in fact has had to revise down to 3&frac14; per cent his forecast for growth this year. This was largely due to the government's disastrous policy of slash and burn and contracting the economy which has slammed the brakes right on. It is an economy, I might add, that averaged a rate of growth in Labor's last year of office of 4.4 per cent, and it averaged over four per cent per year every year in our last term. If it is the accepted wisdom that the 3&frac34; per cent growth forecast for next year is not enough to achieve real jobs growth, then what is this government on about?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister himself at a Liberal Party fundraiser said that the way to keep job growth going was to create economic growth of four per cent, but the budget's own figures suggest not only will that not happen this year but that it will not happen in the lead&hyphen;up to the end of this decade. If you look at the last two budgets as part of a larger plan, the outlook is particularly depressing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Issues affecting my electorate include the government's new drug tax, which may save $561 million over four years but will particularly affect many Australians, particularly the elderly. The drugs affected by this new tax are used for the treatment of high blood pressure, cholesterol, ulcers and depression. People who need drugs for these conditions do not just get one&hyphen;off prescriptions every now and then. They are chronic conditions and they require ongoing treatment. People will have to pay more for medication that they need to stay alive. Pensioners in particular will be hard hit. They may be forced to opt for second&hyphen;class drugs that are not as effective in their treatment. Once again, we see the emergence of a two&hyphen;tiered health system. On top of this, 44 Medicare offices are to close&mdash;two in my electorate and one just outside my electorate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Wannon points out that there are none closing in his electorate. That is the point. The point is that this is a vicious government. This is a government that says, if you live in a working class area that votes Labor, we will shut down your facilities and access to those, but not if you are in a Liberal or National Party area. Have a look at where they have been closed on the North Shore of Sydney&mdash;there are very few. But the impact of their closure on the Leichhardt and Marrickville offices in my electorate is not just directly on the health system but is a further drain on the local economy in terms of employment and the access that those offices, which bring people into the local shopping centres, bring in terms of a multiplier effect on local small businesses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes to public housing will also have negative effects on the most economically disadvantaged. The government has spoken about removing double subsidies in rent assistance. However, the states and territories already take into account the income of all people living in the household and charge their rents accordingly. This change will adversely affect the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4979"> state's revenue from rental collections, but the big king hit for public housing is the cut to the Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement, which will mean that public housing stock will decline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again the government's free market ideology of letting market forces sort things out rears its ugly head. The private sector, particularly in relation to housing, is not motivated by quality and affordability but by profit. Accordingly, there are some areas which simply are not appropriate for the private sector to take over. Public housing, which I grew up in for the first 20 years of my life, is certainly one of those areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government continues its assault on child care in this budget. So far this government has cut $821 million from child care. Child care is now less affordable than it has been for decades. On top of that, you have the changes to the CES where unemployed people will actually be charged through the private employment placement agencies for assistance getting a job. I would have thought that that was one of the primary objectives of government and the minister (Mrs Moylan), in having to apologise for the third time for misleading parliament before the House this week, has shown that she just does not have a clue about the impact of these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of that, you have the federation slush fund being implemented which will provide, no doubt, in the coming years an opportunity for the coalition to spend money in marginal electorates, get out the big whiteboard, and that is no substitute for real public policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say something also about the impact of this budget on the aged. I will have something to say on the Aged Care Bill later on today. I think that the policy of this government, whereby the elderly will be forced to sell their homes in order to get nursing home care, is an absolute disgrace because for many people going into a nursing home is a very traumatic and distressing time. People who have up to this point been independent must now adjust to their loss of independence and privacy. The reality for most people is that, once they enter a nursing home, they are unfortunately unlikely to be able to return to their own home. However, for many of these vulnerable people, the fact that their home is still there gives them hope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I fear for people's longevity if they are forced to relinquish the one symbol of independence that they hold dear&mdash;their family home. Selling this home is such a final act. The government may as well be nailing the coffin down and saying that is it: your life is over. It is that sort  of impact that this uncaring government has towards the most vulnerable in our society which is highlighted by this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to conclude by talking about the changes foreshadowed in this budget and since by the Minister for Transport (Mr Sharp) on the insulation program for Sydney airport. The cutbacks are contrary to the government's promise, which was to maintain the previous government's insulation program. It is now saying the insulation will stop at Stanmore Road, Marrickville and some 2,500 people who were promised proper insulation against the impact of noise will miss out under that reconsideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that Sydney airport is still there. There is no funding in this budget for the creation of a second Sydney airport and, under those circumstances, it is just an outrage that this government would take away from people the insulation to which they were entitled and which they were promised. I urge all to campaign against this government budget. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, after listening to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4980"> honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese), I must admit that I was rather disappointed to hear the way he seems to have fallen back into the bad old habit of taking a patronising view towards some sectors of the community and the way he seems to be trying to reinvent the class war&mdash;something that I thought Australia was rather pleased to have got rid of. It really is most unfortunate to listen to someone having to resort to going back to things like the politics of envy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that all honourable members particularly on this side would say&mdash;and all the thinking ones from the other side&mdash;is that they really could not accept anyone from the Labor Party lecturing us on unemployment. After going out of office after 13 years with 8&half; per cent unemployed, I would have thought that all members of the Labor Party would be rather inclined to stay right off that subject with a track record like that. I do not think they would want to be talking about unemployment for a long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time he made some comments about the Treasurer revising down the growth figures to 3&frac34; per cent. Some of us have a reasonable memory you know and it was not that long ago when Labor was in power that the growth figures were actually negative. It was not that long ago and you have been around long enough to know that you only have to go back to the recession we had to have and the growth figures were negative. It is very disappointing to hear someone saying that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Getting on to the budget, the member for Grayndler seems to have completely missed the point about savings. He talked about the savings initiatives of the government which I happen to think are an excellent development, but he missed the whole point. It is all about encouraging people to increase their savings. He was trying to look backwards all the time instead of looking forwards. What he ought to realise is that the reason why the government has brought in this incentive for savings is to actually encourage people to increase their savings. It is not about trying to benefit people who may have savings now. It is all about encouraging those who want to get into savings to start to do so. As has been pointed out many times, it is capped, so in fact it will be of limited benefit to those on very high incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course when he raised the question about national savings, he seems to have completely overlooked one of the fundamental changes that have occurred with this government and that is the moving of the budget into surplus. Now what better way is there to improve savings than to move the budget into surplus? Likewise, as a contrast, what worse way is there to destroy national savings than to continue to run budget deficits? This is exactly what this government inherited from the previous government&mdash;a $10 billion black hole; a $10 billion budget deficit. Ten billion dollars was eating into national savings as a result of an irresponsible government that was of course rightly thrown out at the last election. It was thrown out by the people of Australia because clearly it no longer deserved the right to govern this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only is this budget all about building on the work that the Treasurer and the government already started in the last budget to bring this whole budget back into surplus in one parliamentary term, but it also in fact reduces as a percentage of gross domestic product the level of Commonwealth outlays. It reduces them from 27 to 23 per cent over the term of this parliament and it brings the level of Commonwealth outlays to the lowest level since the pre&hyphen;Whitlam era. In other words, it is the lowest level as a percentage of GDP in over 20 years. Indeed, that is a tremendous achievement and is something about which all members of the government and all members of the Australian public should be very proud. But in fact the story about the budget gets better.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4981">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the first time in over a decade that the Commonwealth will not have to borrow a single dollar. That is indeed a great achievement. By the year 2000, the Commonwealth debt as a ratio to GDP will have literally halved from the time that this government came into power. In other words, we are moving away from Labor's approach of deficit funding&mdash;of spending today, not worrying about it, just racking it up on the Bankcard and leaving it to the next generation; a `send the bill to the kids' type of approach&mdash;to a responsible approach to budgeting. This is something that all Australians should recognise as a very significant achievement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, this budget also builds on many of the achievements of last year. We saw the family tax cuts that came in on 1 January of up to $500 per family, specifically targeted at the very people that the member for Grayndler said he was so concerned about. I did not hear him talking about the benefits of these tax cuts. These are significant achievements and something that this government is very proud of.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the real achievements of this budget&mdash;building again on last year's budget&mdash;are the major incentives for small business. Also we have the changes to Austudy for families with two children studying away from home&mdash;something that will be of particular benefit to those in regional Australia and something that recognises that people in the country have significantly increased costs in sending their sons and daughters away to study, in most cases because they have no choice but to send them away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is more. We can talk about the new savings initiative or we can talk about the Natural Heritage Trust&mdash;$1&frac14; billion going to the environment&mdash;which brings environment into the mainstream, something that Labor, after 13 years, could not do; something that we have achieved that will have lasting effect not only for this generation of Australians but for successive generations of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have, in this budget, the Federation Fund&mdash;$1 billion dollars to build infrastructure projects of national significance&mdash;which is something that again recognises that this government knows how to run a decent budget. This is probably why I can feel very enthusiastic about this budget. It gives, as I was saying, great opportunities for small business. It gives business a chance to get going and that will lead to jobs, which we all recognise is such an important issue in Australia today. In fact, the paramount need is to get unemployment down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In getting small business going, we have to look at the right ingredients that this government has brought to the task. Firstly, we have got the responsible economic management that I have already spoken about that is getting the budget back into surplus. Secondly, we have got the low inflation rate that we are now working to lock in, and from that we get lower interest rates. We have seen four cuts to official interest rates since this government came in&mdash;four cuts that will give the sort of encouragement and build the confidence that is so important in getting business to start to invest and expand&mdash;leading to greater opportunities and greater job growth.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4982">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When some people ask, `What's this budget all about?' I would sum it up by saying it is all about building confidence: confidence that people will have to start to build their own futures rather than having to forever worry about what the government is going to do next and what the government is next going to get wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we talk about employment, it is important to note that last year, in the first year of the Howard government, we saw 130,000 new jobs created. When we look at what is expected in the coming year, this will increase to a further 200,000 jobs. So we are in fact tackling this whole issue head on. Unlike the Labor Party, who just threw buckets of money at the unemployed, never knowing how they were actually going to solve the long&hyphen;term problem, we have got in place lasting programs that are all about building sustained jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I will get back to the question of small business. There is a number of important issues that are all about getting small business going. We have already reduced the provisional tax uplift factor. While that may not sound a major change, it does in fact improve cash flow in small business by some $180 million&mdash;quite significant, I would have thought. We have also extended the incentives for employee share ownership and will be introducing quarterly group tax remittances for small employers&mdash;again, all part of reducing paperwork. That, in itself, is going to be worth $500 million in cash flows to those small businesses that have a group tax collection of less than $25,000 per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen fringe benefits tax changes that should allow the paperwork to be completely removed for about half of small businesses. We have seen changes to the industrial relations law, changes which are partly already through and partly still to come, and which will mean massive changes to the way in which small business approaches employment. I believe this will give tremendous encouragement to small businesses to increase their employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the real sleeper in changes has been the capital gains tax rollover provisions. These are something that the editor of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> spoke of in very glowing terms a few months ago when he described it as `probably the most significant change in decades to tax laws affecting small business'. What he was so enthusiastically talking about was that allowing the opportunity for people to roll over their capital gains when they sell one business and buy another was a real incentive for small business to really build up a capital base. If you like, when we talk about national savings, this is just another aspect of improving national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Robert Gottliebsen was saying, of course, was not just that the provisions are going to change the way small businesses approach their whole operations, because they will be looking now on how to accumulate a capital base; he was also talking about the changes that it will mean to the career paths taken by many of the best and brightest in this country. A lot of people will look at this opportunity and realise that with the change to the capital gains tax&mdash;rather than go into a major corporation where, as soon as they get up the management ladder, they very quickly find themselves with a marginal tax rate of 50c in the dollar&mdash;they may well be able to accumulate some capital in a much quicker and more effective way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also went on to point out that, in the current climate&mdash;as we have seen with the changes to many corporations, particularly in middle management, and the takeovers that have been occurring&mdash;there are many managers who reach the age of 45, say, and suddenly find themselves out of a job. Once you get past that age, it is not easy to find another job. So, in terms of career paths, Gottliebsen was really saying that the change to the capital gains tax law is going to lead to many of our brightest young people changing their whole career path and going into small business. That is a very exciting development, because we all know that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4983"> small business is where the new jobs are going to be. When you look at the changes that have occurred already in assisting small business to grow and prosper under this government, you will see a pretty exciting and pretty impressive line&hyphen;up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, we could talk further about the savings initiative. It is a very important element of this budget: not only does it provide incentives for people to save but it also encourages those who choose to increase their personal superannuation contributions by up to $3,000 per year, in that they will also be able to get the 15 per cent tax rebate. But, of course, it also applies to everyone, including self&hyphen;funded retirees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact of the initiative will, over time, be enormous. Not only that, but it will help to change the culture in Australia; it will help to rebuild the independence of individual families; it will provide the incentive to save for all the things that families probably want to do but have not been able to in the past, so that they can in fact save for their own futures, their own housing, better health care and better education. In short, not only will it be better for individuals but it will be better for the nation; and, with savings, it will help to attack one of the other major legacies that Labor handed on: the level of national debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the time that I have left, I want to go to another issue that I think is quite fascinating to see unfold: that is, the unravelling of the leadership of the Labor party. It all started just over a week ago with an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> by Glenn Milne headed `Alternative ALP thinking on tax offers some hope'. The article showed that there are some in the Labor party who are becoming increasingly disgruntled with the direction that has been taken by the old guard leadership. The article mentioned some very interesting comments made by the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). It says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a veiled warning to those in the ALP hoping to capitalise on societal unease and insecurity by offering a simplistic return to industry protection, tariff wars and tax subsidies disguised as industry policy, Tanner bluntly warns against a "a trip down memory lane arm in arm with Pauline Hanson".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The article went on to talk about Tanner's paper entitled `Populism and Rationalism' in which Tanner talks about how Labor has to `avoid becoming economically irrational, lapsing into mindless populism, recycling the policies of the 1950s and defining ourselves by what we do not like.' He went on to say, `We cannot afford to return to the 1970s.' Again, it has a very familiar ring with the way some of the old guard are operating in the Labor party these days. Mr Tanner rejects two specific ideas put up by fellow front benchers: Martin Ferguson's  proposal for job sharing, and Simon Crean's call for the reintroduction of tax breaks for research and development. I thought that was a fascinating start to what is now seen as an unravelling of the leadership of the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Monday we got another article by Glenn Milne headed `Labor's young braves are starting to get restless'. So it is widening. In this article Glenn Milne talks about those who are attacking the leadership. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In doing so they also risk fracturing the dominant forces standing behind Beazley, represented collectively by former Keating ministers and most prominently by Gareth Evans and Simon Crean.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The reason that this article has come on top of the previous one is that the problem is growing. This article talks about the challenge to Labor's leadership group being implicit in Tanner's paper about populism and rationalism, which was talked about in the previous article. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within the caucus Tanner's views are associated by backbenchers with a number of younger Labor MPs, including future leadership prospect Mark Latham, from the Right, and key Victorian factional figure Kim Carr, from the Left.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The member for Bruce (Mr Griffin) is one of the young future leaders of Labor. I am sure 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4984"> he is interested in all of this and I am sure he has read the article. The article goes on to talk about some of the difficulties that are starting to emerge and says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While Carr has internal party debts to settle with Crean in his home State, he, along with Tanner and Latham, also sees a new divide in Labor's approach to regaining office.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Note those words, `a new divide.' Clearly the leadership is unravelling. The article talks about Evans and that some are saying that he is doing a wonderful job overseeing this policy development. But the article also says that this is being dismissed in some sections of the caucus as `mere puffery.' And so the article goes on saying that `reversion by the Old Guard to the mantras of industry policy is driven by the union movements' continued preoccupation with a shrinking manufacturing sector.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What capped it all off was the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> today where it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Beazley threatens MPs over `treachery'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is all coming out&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Kim Beazley has warned his frontbench colleagues that he will sack anyone responsible for "treachery"</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Beazley gave a far more guarded version of the warning to Caucus yesterday</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Obviously, he cannot trust the caucus. He says one thing to the frontbench&mdash;yet that still gets into the paper&mdash;and when he goes to the caucus he is very careful. Clearly, we are seeing something fascinating. It is a changing of the guard and we will all watch for the next instalment. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

I refer him to the days of the Fraser government as there are some similarities between the Fraser government and the new Howard government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That does not necessarily mean I do not get to hear what goes on in there. I am saying that debate has become less and less important to the process, as was the case in the Fraser government. The debate is being propelled in the community by people who have  been appointed by the previous Keating or Hawke governments to positions of statutory authority heads or other positions. For example, the Chief Justice of the Family Court has been attacking Prime Minister Howard. The problem the government has is that the principal critics of the government are all being paid by the government. The debate is going on out there in the community and the government is getting criticised by the very people it is employing. That is exactly what happened to the Fraser government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It means, of course, that the darlings of the media in the ministry get promoted and their views get more and more currency. You see the type of people who are getting a run from the coalition. That will mean, in essence, that there is going to be a policy crisis, a policy freeze. We have some very important issues coming up shortly, including media ownership, the resolution of car tariffs, and textiles. There is also the prevailing issue of the reform of the taxation system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In speaking today on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1997-98, I want to raise a number of related issues for consideration by the coalition government. In laying down the budget the government has essentially sought to determine the direction in which we, as a nation, will head over 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4985"> the next year and beyond. I might also say that the growth figures published today have come in under expectation for the penultimate quarter for 1996&hyphen;97 which, of course, is another problem for budgetary forecasts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government spending affects the level of delivery of social programs and sets the environment in which all Australians, including both businesses and employees, operate. Fiscal responsibility is an essential element of good government. I applaud the coalition for its work in reducing the damage done to our national economy after 13 years of irresponsible financial mismanagement by Labor. But good fiscal management, however, is not simply a matter of balancing the books, rather, it is doing it in a way that gives us a chance to maintain society's expectations about prosperity, the standard of living and employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other features of today's figures on the growth of GDP has been the level of investment. Most of this has been capital investment and capital investment that may have a prejudicial effect on employment prospects in the immediate future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some things which this government has done in the budget for which they deserve praise, and I believe they deserve the accolades they receive from commentators in the media and elsewhere. However, there is a deeper concern that I have which is related to the government's ability to deliver the kinds of policies that are relevant to the community today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have all seen the growth of a very definite mood of discontent in Australian society. It demonstrates that people are frustrated with the type of government that has been on offer from the Labor governments under former Prime Ministers Hawke and Keating and in particular under Keating. Those governments were characterised by arrogance and elitism. This frustration is growing as people's expectations continue to be unmet under the current government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know members here would have heard from their constituents who say to them, as they say to me, that they do not detect any great difference between the Keating government and the Howard government. Whether that perception is entirely accurate is a matter of debate but the problem is that it is a perception out there, and they would know that that is the case in small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Labor government was captive to well organised, aggressive and vocal interest groups which were nonetheless unrepresentative of broad public opinion. Over the range of  its tenure, Labor has symbiotically utilised these groups to mould public opinion under the broad umbrella of political correctness. The problem the Labor Party now faces is that, once these people run out of other enemies, they will undoubtedly turn on those who have previously been complicit in their activities. This weapon is being used today to tell people who know that there is a problem out there that they should feel ashamed or guilty for voicing their complaints.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, one of the most disturbing aspects of this is that members of parliament are being attacked for representing those views. This has been the prevailing practice over a number of years. Members of parliament have been attacked for representing their constituencies, for representing the views of their constituents, because they have been out of kilter, or so it has been said, with the prevailing political correctness of this umbrella of interest groups that have dominated modern political activity in our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might give an example. The opponents of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) vilify law abiding citizens and call them racists or bigots because they want to redress an imbalance in our migration program which grew out of control. And they are not my comments&mdash;they are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4986"> the comments of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some church representatives tell people that they lack compassion when they complain about laws that allow some to gain benefits beyond their needs or the community's ability to pay them. I have even seen the coalition dismissing the views of people concerned at the unexpected economic effects of tariff reductions as belonging to a flat earth society, rather than seriously dealing with their concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many commentators put Labor's last electoral loss down to the Keating factor and summarise that as arrogance and being out of touch, I suppose. I believe that the ailment is deeper and is specifically traceable to a perception of failure by government to be more accountable to the wishes of the broader community. If this coalition government wants to retain office at the next election, it has a duty to identify the will of the people of Australia and act upon it&mdash;not to rule as though it knows what is best for us, or to limit access to policy input to those who are either its biggest campaign donors or, as I previously mentioned, who are actually employed by the government and who are now its most vociferous critics, which in my view is an absolute travesty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real Achilles heel for the government is small business. Despite the realisation that small business is a key to the coalition in terms of votes, its non&hyphen;parliamentary organisation has preferred to take the reality that donations from the big business corporations, the banks, the telecommunications lobby, the oil companies and so on are more important to the government's ability to actually wage an election campaign. Anybody who does not believe that ought to have a look at some of those donations and match them with the behaviour of the government once it got into office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had the hapless Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) trying to find strategies to boost small business from outside the cabinet, up against more powerful interests who prevailed in the Expenditure Review Committee to preserve the interests of those who are actually acting as a brake on many small to medium enterprises today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to turn, if I may, to law and order and crime. One of the biggest costs to the citizens of this country today lies in the steady growth of crime and our inability to stem it. I do not believe, even with this latest announcement of the campaign against crime and violence, the  government has yet made the link between the cost to our community caused by crime and our productivity, because there is no doubt that crime, and in particular the drug trade, is a distortive influence on the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of crime is widespread in the community. It can be evidenced in the budgets of the state and federal police and other agencies that support that fight against crime. It is also borne through the costs of running the Customs Service and the Australian Securities Commission and all those other agencies responsible for law enforcement areas. Higher insurance premiums, security alarms and monitoring systems are all a direct consequence of the growth of crime. Lost productivity and financial losses are caused by burglaries, damage to people and damage to assets. These are just a few of the obvious, glaring direct costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But a much larger proportion are the less obvious costs. The funding of our judicial system seems to be under steadily mounting pressure, as is legal aid in criminal matters. The cost of incarceration has grown to a level where the government no longer wants to bear the costs. Privatisation of the prison service is the economic rationalists' solution to the cost of operating gaols.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another way has been to apply fewer and shorter prison sentences. We routinely return 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4987"> dangerous or anti&hyphen;social individuals back into society where they can re&hyphen;offend with alarming regularity. We also now have a health system which, of course, because of the demographic changes, is more and more overburdened, but it is now being increasingly required to support the victims of spiralling violent crime and drug abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Drug trafficking and drug abuse in Australia today is at record high levels with no indication that there is anything that is going to slow it down. Children are dying of drug overdoses more frequently than ever before, and we have the minister responsible for the Australian Customs Service trumpeting an inaccurate and inappropriate message that we are actually winning the fight against drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it appalling that such an implication can be made when in his own home state heroin is now reported to cost $12 a hit and on average one person is dying per week of a heroin overdose. Last Friday I read an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> where a visiting US authority on drug abuse, Ms Jane Maxwell, warned that purer heroin was here over the long haul. She estimated that Australian heroin was now 60 per cent pure, compared to 16 per cent a few years ago. This has obviously resulted in more and more overdoses. The face of addiction has been changed by targeting affluent young people. She expected this to lift the rate of addiction and to increase demand for treatment services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recent meetings or hearings of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority has heard alarming evidence of the growth in the drug trade. The Australian Federal Police has advised the committee that worldwide profits from drug trafficking are now estimated to be between $200 billion and $300 billion a year, enough to dwarf the gross national product of many smaller nations. Interpol puts it at around $450 billion. Two recent seizures in Australia alone had the potential to return almost $1 billion from street sales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give you a couple of examples. A major recent drug importation was effected as follows: a 600&hyphen;ton ship was purchased in a European country by a company registered in another country; the vessel was crewed by a Spanish captain and Filipino and Belgian nationals; the drugs were collected off the coast of Pakistan; a trawler was purchased in Victoria to move the drugs from the mother ship to a landing site in New South Wales; expatriate Australians were recruited from South&hyphen;East Asia as crew members for the trawler;  and separate command and communication links for the mother ship and trawler were maintained throughout. The wealth, sophistication and international connections of these drug networks make them extraordinarily difficult to combat in any circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recent submission to the National Crime Authority inquiry from the Queensland police commissioner indicated that there is an extremely serious drug importation program being run through Western Australia which impacts heavily on drug distribution throughout the eastern states. This had earlier been estimated at worth around $1 billion annually.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Queensland police representative, Inspector McHugh, gave an opinion that the situation in relation to drugs is no better now than it was three, four or 10 years ago; in fact, it is worse. Similar statements have been made by the police authorities in Western Australia and Victoria. I am sure the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) would have heard the chief commissioner of the Victorian police, Mr Comrie, saying that we are awash in heroin. What are we doing about it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's response to crime and drug&hyphen;related crime has generally been to reduce funding to the bodies responsible for law enforcement or assisting in the fight against crime. In the last two budgets we have seen cuts as funding reductions in anticipation of so&hyphen;called 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4988"> efficiency dividends. But again, the result has been to reduce the effectiveness of operations run by the agencies. That was the evidence from the National Criminal Intelligence Service. It was also a concession made by Mr Smeaton in giving evidence to the NCA committee the other day at a public hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only exception to this in real terms has been this increase in NCA funding to deal with fraud and tax evasion against the Commonwealth's revenue raising. Now, that is fair enough. We would like to see that, but of course this can easily be interpreted as a cynical means of improving taxation outcomes, while neglecting organised criminal drug trafficking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware in my own state of Western Australia that these camouflaged budget cuts have resulted in a reduction in the resources available to the WA and Federal Police as well as NCA activities there. Extrapolation that the Customs Service must be similarly troubled is not unreasonable. I might point out that they do not bother sending over couriers any more; they just send it in containers. You might think for instance that through all of its efforts the NCA is wearing down the huge plantations around the country that were previously cultivating cannabis, but what is happening now is that they just send it in containers from Cambodia. Cambodians are now sending container loads of cannabis to Australia for our consumption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Secretary General of Interpol, Mr Ray Kendal, has estimated that only 10 per cent to 30 per cent at best of drugs being illegally trafficked were being detected. That does not necessarily mean being seized, but actually being detected by authorities. Mr Kendal illustrated the problems that are faced by western nations which have deluded themselves that they are winning the war against drugs&mdash;rather like the minister responsible for customs&mdash;because they are intercepting more drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless a nation is able to develop a strategy which complements reduction in supply with reduction in demand, people will always take the risks associated with trafficking. I might tell you that the evidence we have had is that the couriers who still come across from the south&hyphen;east Asian countries see it as an occupational hazard coming to Australia with drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of them actually write back to their peers in their home countries, inviting them to come across to Australia, pointing out that the accommodation in Australian prisons is much superior to what they might have at home and in fact they get paid while they are in prison.  What sort of country are we running when we are actually encouraging people to write to each other, tempting them to come over, bring drugs with them and if they get caught, they will actually have a bit of a holiday in Australian prison and come out with more money than they probably would have earned had they had a normal job in their home country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Kendall does not believe that legalisation is the answer, but that if you want a society that is free from drug abuse, certain coercive measures much be applied to make sure that people correspond to what the society wants. Legalisation and decriminalisation of drugs of addiction will not reduce demand for these substances. We have this other silly situation where, for instance, if you were to go into a newsagency and you are under 16 and the fellow sold you, inadvertently, cigarettes, he would be prosecuted. But we have got government agencies actually proposing that children under 16 should be able to access taxpayer funded shooting galleries so they can shoot up on heroin. What sort of crazy community are we running when we have those sorts of priorities?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Legalisation and decriminalisation lead to a general acceptance that use of these substances is somehow condoned under certain circumstances. Other means of reducing demand must be explored, with a view to breaking the profitability of drug trafficking in Australia. We have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4989"> this situation where we know who is bringing in the drugs. If you talk to the agencies, as I have, in questioning them at the NCA inquiry hearings, they will tell you who is responsible. But what are they doing about it? The Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board had a review report almost four years ago. They identified who is responsible for much of heroin importation: it is Chinese triad gangs, and they are distributed to a large extent by subordinate networks of Vietnamese. The problem is that they were identified four years ago and you ask the question: why is it so that this is still continuing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In view of this, I call upon the government to implement a true war against crime. Not this one that was announced the other day by the Prime Minister at $10 million, and most of that is going into all sorts of alternative programs. It needs to allocate large resources in the order of an additional $100 million each year to address the problem. Let me just say this: it is shown elsewhere overseas that when you start to implement a real fight against crime with all of the ancillary powers of being able to seize the illicit proceeds of drug trafficking and crime, then you can actually bring back resources and funds into the fight against crime by allowing the law enforcement agencies to mobilise those particular resources as part of the effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government needs to give law enforcement agencies the wherewithal to deal with the front end of the problem and social programs of resources to address the deeper social issues. I believe that costs can quickly be recouped by a reduction in the crime related costs in this country. They can also be offset by the stringent seizure and sale of the assets of those convicted. Seizure of assets has a dual benefit of preventing a drug trafficker from being able to use the tools of his trade&mdash;assets like a plane, boat or warehouse&mdash;from being used for further trafficking. The proceeds of the sale of a seized asset can then offset the cost or subsidise future anti&hyphen;drug operations. It is a technique being used with increasing success in other Western countries&mdash;in particular, in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I visited some years ago the police departments in the southern part of Texas which, of course, is an area where there are drug trafficking problems, amongst other things. They use those assets which have been seized very productively. For instance, they are able to use directly light aircraft and vehicles and trucks and other things that have been seized. They put them straight back into the program that they are undertaking to try to halt the trafficking of drugs over the border between Mexico and the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, $100 million is a lot of money. It sounds like a lot and it is. The problem is that a much more substantial cost will be borne by the Australian community if we choose not to wage an all&hyphen;out war against crime and, in particular, drug trafficking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to conclude, if I may, Mr Deputy Speaker, by making this observation about this problem. We should not kid ourselves that this is some sort of secondary issue&mdash;that it has nothing to do with running the economy. You can see it in the attitude of the ministers when they are answering questions about reductions. It is not a second&hyphen;order issue. This is a fundamental problem affecting all levels of our community&mdash;from the streets of Cabramatta and the suburbs of western Sydney and Melbourne all the way through to the leafier more affluent suburbs where one would assume that commonsense would prevail to prevent drug addiction or drug trafficking taking place. But in actual fact, it percolates through all levels of the community and, of course, it leads to a gross distortion in the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence, you have the corruption of the judiciary, the police forces, politicians and the Public Service. It forms an abscess, a cancer in our community that can take an

It becomes, as we have seen in the Wood Royal Commission revelations, something that is so deep&hyphen;seated&mdash;so immured in the community&mdash;that you can only reveal it and pull out some of the people responsible by pointing a camera at them and showing them in action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are faced with a very, very serious problem in this community and I might say that cutbacks up until now have debilitated the campaign against drugs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with much pleasure that I speak today on behalf of the government in respect of the Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1997&hyphen;98, the second budget of the coalition government led so ably by John Howard. I am reminded of the words of the song <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">It has only just begun</EMPHASIS> , and indeed it has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To be part of a performance government, given a strong mandate by the people of Australia to tackle the urgent issues that should have been tackled by the previous government and to put a stop to the waste and the mismanagement and the excessive spending of the previous government, is a very heavy onus and responsibility on the members of the government. We all accept this with great enthusiasm because we know that if we do our job well we will be able to make a very substantial contribution to improving the future of our children and grandchildren. Also, we will be able to address the urgent needs of the disadvantaged in this country and make our contribution on the world stage in areas where we should.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I travel around, I find people expressing some frustration and concern that some of the government's policies have not gone far enough or they have not yet felt the benefit of them. That reflects an understandable concern of the community, which has been faced with some devastating performances of the previous Keating&hyphen;Hawke&hyphen;Beazley governments. People wonder, quite frankly, whether or not governments are up to it and will be able to address the issues that need to be addressed and that they want addressed for their children. My answer to that is to look at what we have done. By all means, mark us and criticise us where they feel they should, but also take into account the enormous frustrations and obstacles that have been put in our way by this current parliament in effecting the urgent changes and reforms that we have a mandate to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I briefly remind members that the government went into the election with proposals to reform industrial relations, to bring in a new environmental package to address the urgent and overdue problems of degradation of our rivers and soil and to do a number of other very important things. After our election in March 1996, we proceeded very quickly to introduce legislation to achieve those ends and we passed that legislation quite speedily through the House of Representatives. From memory, it was substantially passed within the first two or three months of the Howard coalition government. You would have thought then that it would have been dealt with quickly by the Senate but, in fact, it was not. We all know that it was virtually the end of last year&mdash;December&mdash;before the Senate saw fit to allow through the government's legislation for which it had strong mandates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not really until January and February of this year, almost 12 months after the new government took office, that its core reforms in respect of industrial relations were enacted. Those reforms, I remind members, deal with urgent issues that have been stopping people taking risks and taking on new employees, especially young people. They centre on the lack of ability for small business to develop with their employees reasonable arrangements for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4991"> sharing of profits, for getting on with the job and developing and achieving the mission and the ambitions of people involved in small business in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reform of the unfair dismissal clauses was the subject of considerable opposition and frustration by the opposition and its friends in the Senate. Further proposals by the government as part of our small business reform package are to exempt small business in the first year from unfair dismissal claims for employees where the number of employees is 15 or less. That initiative is virtually a probationary system which any reasonable person would accept. If you take on a new employee there ought to be space for the two of you to resolve any uncertainties and ensure that both of you, the employer and employee, are comfortable and are certain that your destiny is to work together in the longer term. Some probationary period should be allowed which is a period in which both parties can terminate their relationship with each other if they find that it is not as they would wish it to be. Remarkably, we find that the Labor Party is still opposing those sorts of reforms and using its mates in the Senate to inhibit small business development and above all the opportunity to give young people a job, the opportunity for them to start off their working life and get out of the unemployment queues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to members and to the community of Australia that this government has done a lot, but there is a lot more to do. We have only just begun. I ask that those in the opposition and in the Senate who are supporting them take on board the need for this country to work together to get out there and do the things that are needed to be done so that we can in fact ensure that our children and grandchildren have a safe and secure future and that we do not have a continuing spiral of youth unemployment and, sadly, in some cases, youth suicide, this country having the fifth largest youth suicide rate in industrialised countries in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not accept that we should rest on that and I will not rest until we do all the things that we must do regardless of some of the opposition from some of these people to giving kids a job and the opportunity and a feeling that this country does offer them, as it has their fathers and grandparents before them, a good future and an exciting future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we managed to get rid of the last government, we found that this generation was facing for the first time the probability, if the previous government's management and policies  had continued, that we would for the first time be a generation handing the country over to our children with them having fewer opportunities than we did. The history of Australia has been that every generation, despite great difficulties and adversity, has always been able to hand over to their children the stewardship of this country with better opportunities for them than they had. Whilst there might not have been great opportunities for everybody, when that process occurred I am sure that all members would concede and agree with me that we are a proud nation and we have been able to give our kids more chances than we had. That is something that we should all continue to strive to do but up to 1993, after 13 years of Labor governments, we were the generation facing the awful prospect of not being able to continue to do that. Why? Because the government had overspent. It had spent more than its revenue and run the country into huge debt. There was a huge deficit of more than $10 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Might I just pay credit to John Howard for his courage in being able, with Peter Costello his able Treasurer, to bring that under control and in our second budget to be able to say to the Australian people that by the time we finish our first term in the third year, we will have in fact removed the deficit totally and will be in a surplus of something like $1.5 billion. That takes a fair bit of work, some pain and some disappointment to people. We have to grapple with the difficult job of assessing priorities and in some cases having to say `no' to some 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4992"> people for programs that you would, if you had the money, like to continue to give support to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very difficult and painful process, and it is not one that you get a lot of joy out of. But provided your vision is right, your mission is right, you know what you are doing and your priorities are right, you know that in the final outcome the country will be much more prosperous. There will be more opportunities for people and, as productivity, investment and savings increase with this better management, there will be more revenue for governments from that alone, simply by natural growth, and that will enable you to revisit some of the programs where you had wished you did not have to cut, but you had not had the funds to keep on going. So I think that is a very significant achievement and I congratulate John Howard and Peter Costello for their work in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also welcome the Prime Minister's courageous step to put on the political agenda the fact that this government, in its first term, will encourage and open up the debate on the reform of our very inefficient and very inequitable tax system. The stories about it are legion. One of them is the fact that you do not have to pay wholesale sales tax, for example, on caviar, but you do on basic food for the family. The anomalies are just unbelievable. There is no way that any contemporary member of the federal parliament, no matter what their politics, can justify the continuation of the horrendously inefficient, inequitable, anomalous system of tax with respect to wholesale sales tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is a country where no&hyphen;one can truthfully tell you how much tax they have paid through the day, between the time they get out of bed in the morning and when they finally go to bed at night. Sure, they know what their PAYE tax is if they are wage earners; they know what is taken out of their wages each week or fortnight. But they have no idea about the hidden taxes on the food that they use, the floor coverings that they walk on, the cosmetics that they use and the toothpaste and the toilet paper, and all of those things. They hop in the car, or they use other transport, and they find that the bowser price has a tax component, of state and federal taxes, that is more than 50 per cent of the total cost per litre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the states, we have a system of payroll tax which means that the more you employ, the more tax you pay. Imagine a young country like Australia sustaining a tax as we go into the next century which says, `Hey, guys, the more people you employ, the more we are going to tax you.' How about that? That is payroll tax. We cannot allow that to continue. Nor can we allow this country to have an inefficient tax system at the same time as we address the urgent issues of tariff reform and industry policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind members that we are a trading nation. If we said to Australia's farmers and producers that we had lost the trade opportunities for them overseas, it would mean that about 70 per cent of total produce by Australian farmers&mdash;in wheat and grain and all the other things&mdash;would be lost to world trade, because Australia's relatively small population, of about 19&hyphen;odd million, means Australians cannot possibly eat enough and consume enough of the farmers' produce. There are not enough of us to do that. That fact alone means that we have a very substantial part of our economy which produces more than we can eat and consume and which by necessity has to find a purchaser.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The farmers are doing a wonderful job. In the dairy industry, for example, just yesterday in my electorate there was an announcement that a company would spend an extra $30 million in developing new products which eventually will be exported into the exciting Asian market&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4993">Malaysia, for example, is about 90 per cent dependent on imported dairy products. We are fighting and jostling with other dairy producers of the world for those huge and growing markets. So we have to understand that we have to have a policy in industry which enables our traders to sell their goods overseas. Therefore, we have to have a policy that enables us to develop and to negotiate with other countries, some of whom have got no wish to help us at all, to ensure that we have access to their markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, if you take the simplistic view and say, `Let us stop them from importing into us; let us put up barriers that stop them coming into our country with their goods', you know what they are going to do because we are such a small player in the world scene. They are going to say, `Thanks, fellah; you won't let us in, or you have put up some barriers against us, so we are going to turn around and do the same to you, only worse.' The net effect of that is, of course, to decimate Australia. It will put many people out of business&mdash;many farmers and other people relying on their produce&mdash;because there simply will not be a market for our produce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, with respect to our manufacturing industries, such as the value&hyphen;added dairy industry which I just spoke about and so many others, they want to go out and trade in the world. They are getting better and better at it every year. But they have to have a policy which will enable us to negotiate with our world trading partners a reasonable access arrangement whereby we can say to them, `We have let you into us on reasonable terms so you have to let us in.' So by us becoming part of ASEAN, GATT and other arrangements, we collectively can bring on pressure, even though we are a very small country, to shame and shock them and do all sorts of things to allow us access into the larger world trade scene.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our government is facing some major decisions in those regards, and we will do a good job in those areas. I look forward with excitement to the announcements on the car policy over the weekend, or perhaps next week and, with respect to the textile and footwear industry, an announcement a little while after that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will briefly come back to my own electorate. When I stood for election I made some pledges that I would like to see some improvements in certain projects get off the ground. I  will quickly say that I have been able to do that because I am part of the coalition government committed to the development and the future of regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, we have been able to see the introduction of a very exciting new apprenticeship and vocational training scheme across regional Australia with one&hyphen;stop shops, simplified processes and more assistance to employers and employees. We have introduced&mdash;and this is a very exciting development&mdash;a new form of pathway where kids dropping out of school because they do not like the curriculum can start their apprenticeship training at secondary school, stopping the 30 per cent drop&hyphen;out rate which occurs in Australia at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those kids will have part qualifications for their apprenticeship trades when they walk out with their VCE in year 12. That will give them greater access to pathways for apprenticeships in small and medium sized business because they will be able to say they have experience and part qualifications and so are able to contribute much more when they start than in the old days. That is a very exciting process which I have had a little bit to do with, and I am convinced it will make a major contribution to many areas of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Murray&hyphen;Darling has been a very big part of my life, both in state and federal politics. I am very pleased to see the new heritage fund, the $1.25 billion through the Telstra process. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4994"> In my own electorate, because we are very much a part of the Murray&hyphen;Darling region, that will enable us to address some very urgent issues for all of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect to the freshwater research centre which I invite my colleagues from all sides of parliament to visit at Albury&hyphen;Wodonga&mdash;it is a fantastic set&hyphen;up&mdash;we have been able to get the funding problems resolved, thank God, so their work can continue for the benefit of Australia. In the defence area, we have capital commitment for new buildings and renovations at Bandiana&hyphen;Bonegilla in my electorate. This will reinforce Australia's No. 1 army logistics training centre for the Australian army defence system, and I am very pleased about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a personal level, we struggled for years, both when I was in state parliament and latterly in federal parliament, to get SBS television for my area of Australia. With the assistance of my colleague Tim Fischer, we were able to have it turned on on 14 May this year. Many people rejoiced. Unhappily, I have not yet got it for the whole of my electorate, but I will work on that. It is my wish that all members, whether they be Labor, Liberal or National, should be able to get, under a Howard&hyphen;Fischer government, SBS television for their constituents. We are working on that as well, and I think we will be able to deliver that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also have been able to address the urgent issue of not being able to get rural doctors and obstetricians in country areas. We have been able, with Michael Wooldridge's leadership, to introduce a number of very innovative ideas for scholarships and the like, which will help us address that very urgent issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In connection with retirees, we have new incentives for them. We have widened the tax rebate for low income self&hyphen;funded retirees&mdash;a long overdue reform&mdash;and I am very happy to report to you that constituents in that category have contacted me and indicated that they really appreciate the small extra assistance which is achieved there. Neighbours with exactly the same income, but with one of them on self&hyphen;funded retiree super and the other on a full age pension, now have the same tax base, whereas before they did not. We have addressed that matter, and I am very pleased about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am going quickly because my time is running out; but, with the reform of tax and the small business reforms, we have only just begun&mdash;as I said when I started my speech.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem with the budget as contained in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1997&hyphen;98 is two&hyphen;fold. Firstly, I am bound to say that this government is probably the most ideologically driven government that I have ever witnessed. It operates on a series of what are, for it, self&hyphen;evident truths. The fact is that the greatest single problem confronting Australia is unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The underlying philosophy and policies of this government are not going to resolve the problem of unemployment; they are simply going to compound and increase it. One only has to look at certain shibboleths which are dropped into the parliament almost automatically. How are they going to solve unemployment? They say they can solve it by their support for small business. Small business is going to be the answer to the problem. It is a pity that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) does not visit my electorate, which is like any inner metropolitan electorate in Melbourne, and see the real problems being faced there by small business.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4995">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Something that is always enunciated, particularly by the Prime Minister, the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello), is that if you deal with the trade union movement you will solve the problem of unemployment, because you will reduce the terrible things that the movement does to small business. The history of the trade union movement is basically that it has traditionally not had a great deal of impact in terms of small business. Why? Because, historically, the resources of the trade union have always been limited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was easier, for example, if you were an officer in the liquor trades union, to deal with and enrol members in the breweries because they were in one spot, in large numbers and in the larger hotels. By and large, it was not possible, given the lack of resources, to deal with the smaller businesses. The unions were not concerned with shop assistants in small shops, employing one or two people. Why? Because they did not have the resources to cover them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real enemy and the real problem confronting small business in my community and in many other parts of Australia is big business. It is the larger enterprises, given the nature of the competitive society in which we live, that create trading circumstances which make things increasingly difficult, both for small manufacturers and for small business. You have only got to see the impact of this in a community: there are always arguments going on when small businesses operating in shopfronts are threatened with the advent of a major supermarket and the creation of a major building complex.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business does have its own problems. But as for saying that if you solve all the problems of small business you are going to solve the problems of unemployment&mdash;when this government, by its very own actions, is compounding the problems of unemployment&mdash;no member has to do anything more than walk outside this House to see the problems that confront the people of Canberra, the national capital, and to see the number of public servants who have been dismissed but who started in the Public Service confident of the fact that they had a long&hyphen;term future and that they had the capacity to develop and grow in the various aspects of the Public Service and, in so doing, fulfil a major role not merely for the future of Canberra but also for the future of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whole areas of departments are being wound back. Within this parliament, functions that have been carried on since the inception of this parliament are going to be privatised and people who have been working here for years are being dismissed. Unless we are very careful, Canberra is going to become a ghost town, not a national capital. You have only got to walk outside and talk to any person who is involved in small business, who is concerned about the future of their children and where they are going to be employed. And what is it all about? It is about this view of how you run the economy, the concept of privatisation: if you privatise something, it must automatically be better. That, of course, is not demonstrated&mdash;not demonstrated at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, if you look at privatisation and its operation in that nation much beloved of many members of the government&mdash;Great Britain&mdash;what has been the impact of privatisation? Has it solved the problems of unemployment? Has it seen that there is a greater equity within that community? Has it rejuvenated the British manufacturing sector? You have just had a demonstration of the confidence of the average Englishman in the impact of privatisation with what was the greatest victory that the British Labour Party has had in its life. Could it be that they are all wrong? Isn't it the fact that they have seen the effects of privatisation? And what have they seen? They have seen the rich getting richer; they have seen the poor getting poorer; and they have seen Hyde Park becoming not full of tourists but full of people finding

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What fascinates me about our conservative opponents is how they love to wrap themselves in the flag and talk about the monarchy. However, what is the reality? If you look at our universities, we have a Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) who lives in fantasy land. The fact is, and I say it quite openly, I, like 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4997"> many thousands of Australians, could never have attended the university if it were not for the scholarship scheme brought in by the Chifley government. That was because we believed that institutions of higher education ought to be open to any child irrespective of their social class or background, that entry to universities should be on the basis of their ability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened to our free tertiary institutions, which we need to keep abreast of world developments in technology? If you are good enough you might get a scholarship, but fees are now the usual requirement. It is interesting to note that as a result of this government's policy, students at university courses in science and engineering, subjects which are critical for our future development, pay 50 per cent more in fees up front than those who are doing courses in the humanities. I do not want to knock those who are doing courses in the humanities, but one may well ask, if we are going to have a future in science and technology, why you have to pay more if you are a student.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, then there are the higher degrees. Every one of those has to be paid for in full. There are many people who will tell you candidly&mdash;leading scientists, leading engineers and leading medical practitioners&mdash;that if they had had to go through that particular structure at the time when they got their education, they could not have afforded it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our universities are becoming places for hire, for overseas students who have rich parents, and for borderline students whose fathers are rich and can afford to keep them there.

In my electorate, a school which was built at the time the very old school in Port Melbourne was erected did not have a proper toilet facility. Teachers had to line the kids up three at a time. There were problems with molestation because the toilet was not inside the school, but of course the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, our esteemed Dr Kemp, would not have visited that. Having fought off a decision by the department that the school ought to be closed and the property sold, what do we get? The state minister for education says, `No problem, you've got to do it. You will do it by getting a portable set of toilets.' The problem with this government is its ministers live in cloud-cuckoo-land.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will let the interjection pass. One has to be polite to unintelligent 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4998"> members of the government and supporters of the government. The real problem with this budget is it is driven by economic theory. It is not driven by looking at what is happening in Australian communities and Australian society on the ground. If you live in Victoria there is a great fear in our regional centres and in our community of a drought. Many country areas are under enormous strain. Employment is down. These issues have to be addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot cover everything in the budget, I know that. But the underlying thesis of this government is that you will diminish the Public Service, you will put out to the private sector anything that is not nailed down and in that situation you will deplete, over a period of time, your capacity to recruit first-rate people and bring them through the structure. These are the people who believe in the Westminster system and an integral part of the Westminster system is an independent public service. You build up a range of experience. What we are looking at is a situation where you have divested yourself of so much infrastructure that when a member of parliament wants to ask a question on the state of electricity or the water supply, the answer is, `Well, we can't give it to you because it is covered by a contract that says business&hyphen;in-confidence.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The infrastructure of our society which has been built up over the years is being depleted. The ranks of our Public Service&mdash;our senior and junior public servants who have an acquired knowledge and capacity&mdash;are being threatened. That threatens the institution and the operations of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget fails because it is not directed towards and will not solve the increasing problem of unemployment in our society. That is the biggest single problem which we face as a nation. It depletes the human resources and it depletes the capacity of our young to have hope for the future&mdash;they are the biggest single element in terms of unemployment statistics. We are closing our tertiary institutions to all of those except those who are exceptionally gifted or who have parents who can afford to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a budget which will take Australia into the future and it is not a budget which will give our young people hope and belief in the future of this great nation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I confess to having a concern at one time, from a purely archaeological standpoint, that history might lose for all time the culture and  thinking of the Kremlin in the 1950s, but I am pleased to see that the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) is assiduously keeping it alive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to begin my contribution to the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1997&hyphen;98 by asking this question: what is the single, pre&hyphen;eminent outcome of Peter Costello's second budget? What is the one message&mdash;the take&hyphen;out, if you like&mdash;or the one impression which this budget and the one that preceded it ought to leave in the minds of the Australian people? When you take out the haggling over individual program emphasis and accent, and when you silence the parochialism, the hackneyed rhetoric and the defence of vested interests by its critics, what is the core that remains?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget repays $5 billion worth of Commonwealth debt. The budget represents the lowest level of Commonwealth spending as a proportion of GDP since 1972. After inheriting an annual deficit of $10 billion, this 1997 budget, which is building on the frugality of its immediate predecessor, will allow us to actually deliver a $1.6 billion surplus in 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget confirms in the most emphatic and incontrovertible fashion the Commonwealth's commitment to fostering a culture of private and public savings. We are leading by example. This budget places Treasurer Costello and this government in a relationship to the private 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4999"> economy similar to that of John the Baptist to Jesus of Nazareth. Like the Baptist, the Treasurer has proclaimed, `He must increase and I must decrease.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of my colleagues have provided an able defence of individual budget measures. I want to take the opportunity that a debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) provides to highlight the contest of ideas taking place behind the budget documents. The budget draws out and crystallises the different world views of the two sides of this chamber. I believe that underneath all the sound and fury there is a contest of key ideas taking place here. As Ralph Waldo Emerson observed, `great men are they who see that the spiritual is stronger than any material force' and, most particularly, `that thoughts rule the world.' I propose to use the coalition's budget strategy to highlight both the differences and the areas of convergence in the fundamental ideas which guide the major parties in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to begin that discussion with an unequivocal affirmation of the principle which we on this side of the House subscribe to: that all our economic goals are proxies for social, personal and community goals. In the long run, it is the private economy and the private community which holds the best hope for redressing inequality, ameliorating human suffering and upholding human dignity. You cannot separate the strength of the domestic economy from the achievement of all the worthy human goals to which members on both sides of the House repeatedly affirm their solemn commitment. In the words of Victor Hugo, `social prosperity means the man happy, the citizen free, the nation great.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless the economy is sufficiently productive to yield a healthy surplus, there is no tax base from which to fund social programs. Unless there is sufficient incentive to reward and foster robust industry, there is no&hyphen;one to provide essential services. Unless the economy is growing with appropriate speed and certainty, there is no confidence to take on new employees or to invest in new technologies. This is the first and perhaps most fundamental point of divergence between the major parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members opposite either explicitly or implicitly seem to adhere to the view that the public sector can continue to spend indefinitely without reference to the impact of that spending on the health and vitality of the private economy, and without reference to the mounting debts which accrue. They uphold a rigid bifurcation between economic and social goals. They are fixated on short&hyphen;term spending programs, apparently blind to the impact of the government's rapacious demands on opportunities available to the private community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the long run, the two realms will always converge. The most powerful evidence of that convergence is the delivery, as a result of decisions of this government, of four successive interest rate cuts. Since March 1996, home loan rates have decreased from 10.5 per cent to 6.99 per cent. For a family with a standard mortgage of, say, $100,000, this equates to almost $300 per month of additional disposable income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I applaud and support the specific savings measures in the budget, I regard it as being overshadowed by the benefits which have flowed to the Australian community from our frugality and from the interest rate falls which have resulted. This raises the question of morality, of compassion and of what members opposite so frequently refer to as social justice. These are words which roll off the tongue with a kind of facile ease and are usually coupled in the mouths of the ALP by a righteous indignation at one program or another being reduced in its scale or reach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the chamber how much compassion is involved in spending the surplus of others? How much of the high moral ground can be occupied by making commitments you cannot fund 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5000"> and passing on debts to those who must follow? How is it socially just to so weigh down the productive elements of the community that they find no incentive to work or to save or to provide opportunities for those who most need them? As Edmund Burke sagaciously remarked, it is a general popular error to imagine the loudest complainers for the public to be the most anxious for its welfare. The ones who suffer the most from our economic mismanagement are those in society with least bargaining power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wealthiest 20, 40 or 60 per cent will always have sufficient means to provide for their needs but the young, the unskilled, the new migrants, are the most reliant on what is offered to them out of the surplus of the vitality of the private economy. While we can hide the unemployed in statistical obscurity or recirculate them through a revolving door of ineffectual labour market programs, it is the private economy that will give them real jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the ALP was in the driver's seat the wheels were spinning furiously but the Australian people increasingly looked out the window and saw that the car was not moving. By contrast, every measure in this budget is directed towards the empowerment of the private economy; the empowerment of the private citizen; the empowerment of the Australian family. It is a strategy which encourages wealth creation&mdash;the wealth of the nation, the common wealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, there has been some discussion in recent times about a convergence of ideas among the major political parties in Australia, and indeed around the world. But I submit that it is more of a conversion than a convergence. Worldwide, the parties of the left that remain viable have embraced the language of reform, of restraint and of productivity. In the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), you cannot proclaim your support for expenditure restraint in general but then resist and oppose every individual act of restraint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is plentiful evidence for this conversion at both the domestic and the international levels. The recent election of Tony Blair in England was cited by the previous speaker as being something to provide some encouragement. I suggest it confirms rather than refutes my thesis. The result was only achievable as a consequence of British Labour jettisoning huge chunks of its previous philosophy. In a dramatic shift to the right, the so&hyphen;called New Labour has lost all traces of radicalism and much of its former confidence that the state can act with cogency as an agent of positive social change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A convergence of economic ideas is also reflected in strategic cooperation. Boris Yeltsin made the dramatic announcement in Paris recently that Russia would disarm all its warheads now aimed at European cities. Russia is assiduously courting the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation for its defence and strategic future, as are most of the former Soviet states. NATO now faces the extraordinary problem, unthinkable a decade ago, of how to accommodate the large number of former communist states clamouring for membership. Few events could more completely confirm the failure of collectivism and the success of individual freedom and a spirit of enterprise. While I do not equate the ALP directly with communism, I do cite&mdash;although the former speaker would cause one to wonder&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You will recall that I was referring to Boris Yeltsin as an emblem of the convergence of ideas and the success and pre-eminence of the private economy and the spirit of enterprise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was just a matter of time before communism's philosophical bankruptcy would be matched 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5001"> by its economic bankruptcy. The United States won the Cold War because the domestic economy of the Soviet Union was insufficiently productive to meet the costs of the arms race. That may have been a disappointment to some of those in Spring Street in Victoria, now refugees to the Commonwealth parliament. To me it was something to find satisfaction in. The principle is that if you are going to have an arms race, you must be in a position to win it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principle was played out with the same certainty decades before when the Axis powers could entertain their aggressive imperialist ambitions only as long as they did not wake the sleeping giant of American industrial muscle. Ironically, the success of the raid on Pearl Harbor was the beginning of the end for fascist dictatorship. We are free today, speaking English, enjoying democratic freedoms, because America was able to project naval power into the Pacific and defeat our opponents at the Battle of the Coral Sea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The American soldier was neither bigger, stronger nor more intelligent than his opponent, but he was supported by an economy that was bigger, more productive and more adaptable than those of his opponents. At the height of the Lend Lease program, the shipyards in Delaware, the Great Lakes, Mississippi and on the west coast launched 597 Liberty ships in a 12&hyphen;month period because they had to build them faster than the German U&hyphen;boats could sink them. In that way the industrial muscle, the spirit of enterprise which has been a feature of the development of the American nation, came to the rescue of the free world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Defence of the realm is the first and indeed, I submit, one of the few inalienable duties of the state. While we now perceive no immediate threats to our sovereignty or territorial integrity, the lesson of history is that this happy state of affairs may be transient. I applaud our government's decision to quarantine the funding allocation to Defence in its first two budgets. I applaud the policy direction of the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) to redirect our resources from the tail to the sting, because the best form of defence is a credible deterrent&mdash;and credible we must be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Returning to my original thesis, we ought not to forget that the freedom of the citizen which flows from a credible defence capability is merely one of the human incidents which are themselves a consequence of economic productivity. There are no short cuts to quality of life. As Margaret Thatcher told the British trade union movement in the early 1980s, `If you want a German standard of living, you have to have a German standard of productivity.' I note that,  following the hard years of reform under Thatcher, England now enjoys the lowest rate of unemployment in the European Union. Hundreds of thousands of young Britons are in jobs today because of the hard decisions taken by conservative governments over the past 18 years. By contrast, over the channel, France now labours under the millstone of 13 per cent unemployment, because of the wasted years of complacent collectivism and class division under the leadership of former President Mitterand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that connection I salute the reforms introduced by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) in the Workplace Relations Act which, as part of the coalition's plan for a productive Australia, will help the economy to deliver real jobs to those seeking employment in western Sydney and in my electorate of Parramatta. The new age of industrial harmony and productivity highlights the ideological dilemma faced at present by the Australian Labor Party, because the heartbeat of the ALP is the ideas of collectivism and class conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take away the inevitability of hatred and dissension on the shop floor and you take away the raison d'etre of the ALP. However dressed up in the moderate language of `New Labour', its fundamental premise is class based antagonism. The great conundrum for the ALP and the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5002"> trade union movement is that so many thinking Australians no longer buy it. Their experience in the workplace is one of teamwork, cohesion and industrial participation. More and more sharing in the fruits of the enterprises, as we become a share&hyphen;owning democracy; they are subscribing to popular capitalism. This is the sanguine future reflected in Peter Reith's Workplace Relations Act and the budget's incentive for employee share ownership plans, which is another big tick.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the assault on the Australian parliament by the CFMEU and their union cohorts, the ALP has been doing a by now familiar dance of prevarication as the party trashed the Accord and tried to distance itself from a discredited trade union movement. The ALP without the trade unions looks to me very much like one hand clapping&mdash;they have all the same voice and force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The left of the ALP in New South Wales has again been outflanked and betrayed by the Labor Party's economic cross&hyphen;dressers who are now selling off the entire electricity generating capacity of New South Wales in a textbook expression of economic rationality. Poor old Mick Clough, your archetypal Labor man, the member for Bathurst: instead of retiring as an elder statesman of the party, he contemplates his future as an independent, presumably fighting the next election against a former ALP colleague whom he once greeted, in the cardigans of the trades hall, as `comrade' and `mate'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not envy even the considerable intelligence of the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) in his task of working out what it now means to be Labor. T.S. Eliot in his poem, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Hollow Man</EMPHASIS>, made the observation that, `Between the idea and the reality, between the motivation and the act falls the shadow'. The ALP is entirely overshadowed by the moribund nature of its philosophy and by the incessant navel-gazing which leads nowhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Evans has been asked to unravel the Gordian knot of the ALP's core philosophy. If you just look at the two responses of the leader and deputy leader of the ALP to the GST, you find the deputy leader and shadow treasurer coming out, with a clear statement of openness, to have a dialogue and discussion about major tax reform, immediately to be countermanded by the leader who ruled it out without further consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This reflects this questioning, this unknowing about what it really means to be Labor in a modern world. I note that the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) has suggested that Labor's  current regional development strategy can be likened to a road safety program of someone with a red flag walking out in front of motor vehicles. Can I suggest that if you are looking for a candidate&mdash;for someone to carry that red flag&mdash;the member for Melbourne Ports would be eminently suitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Working Australians have evacuated the trade unions in droves, in a haemorrhage of life blood that has left the movement looking wan and bereft of vitality. The workers have voted with their minds, with their hearts and with their feet. In 1976, the proportion of the work force who were union members was 51 per cent; today it is 31 per cent. It has been decimated and continues to decline year by year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the words of Ross Gittins, the trade union movement `exhibits all the signs of a sunset industry.' The crisis in the ALP at heart is a crisis of ideas. They committed themselves to an ideological path after the great shearers' strike in the 1890s from which they have never really emerged. They are locked into a straitjacket of philosophical concepts that are as outdated and as useless as the crank on the front of a motor vehicle.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5003">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP knows where it has come from: it knows its history, it knows its past, but it has no idea where it is going. As more and more Australians reject the path of tribal division, of confrontation, of bloodymindedness, they join hands with their employers to work for a brighter, more secure and more productive future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than highlighting the shared opportunities of economic growth, the ALP constantly focus on the inequality of the distribution of income. They say the benefits of economic development are not shared with sufficient liberality or equality, but their cure is always worse than the ailment. All their rhetoric about social justice amounts to nothing more than taking the fruits of the labour of those who earned it and giving it to those who did not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the long run it does not work and the hardest hit are those who need a job or those who need to keep a job. Labor rush about erecting further and higher obstacles to employment, savings, investment and growth. In pursuit of a doctrinaire, mathematical equality they reduce the size of the entire economic cake by quashing the spirit of enterprise, of risk taking, of entrepreneurship and of old-fashioned hard work. They destroy the private instincts of philanthropy, of community, and of neighbourly concern by building a Big Brother state with ever higher layers of bureaucratic baggage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Next year the Commonwealth budget will be in surplus for the first time since the rot began in 1972. That is the take-out of the first two Costello budgets, that is the bottom line. We may haggle over individual program decisions, over priorities, over accent and emphasis, but the fruits of frugality and stewardship are already apparent in the disposable income of almost $300 a month returned to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget reflects a holistic, coherent, practical, caring philosophy, which understands the inextricable connection between economic and social goals. In the words of Adam Smith, `Little else is requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism but peace, easy taxes and a tolerable administration of justice.' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have destroyed the savings mechanism we had. We were trying to put national savings together in this country. You have come up with the idea of focusing on one lot of people in the electorate, hoping that is going to give you some votes. You have destroyed the whole savings mechanism. Even the best commentators in the country are saying that we will not be adding to the national savings effort by the system that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has brought in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I first joined the parliament, I believed that we were elected to help members of our electorates to achieve a better life for themselves. For a short time between 1993 and 1996, I felt that the government was helping to put people back into work, was assisting those who needed more skills before joining the work force, was providing child care, was ensuring the elderly had proper and appropriate services and was getting the economy going. Business was expanding and new ideas were being developed. Now I feel that this current government is taking us nowhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment to the second reading motion moved by the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) points out that we are going nowhere. This government is in shambles. I feel totally ashamed of what is occurring in my country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How do I go back to the constituents of my electorate and say, `This government is looking after your interests' when jobs are going, when health services are closing, when older people are having to pay for their entrance into nursing homes and when creches are being closed or their fees put beyond the average working people's budgets? How can I say this is for a better life? I can't.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I look at reports in the press of how the government is handling itself in the parliament, I can see that they have got absolutely no idea of what is going on in this country. They have chosen to ignore the disillusionment and the resentment that are being shown in the electorate for these cutbacks&mdash;resentment which has thrown into prominence people like the present member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). And when it came time to put these unfriendly  and un&hyphen;Australian sentiments to bed, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) ran away. He did not want to face up to these ugly people who just happened to have a mouthpiece in the unfortunate member for Oxley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there was Wik and the stolen children report. All over the world, national leaders are offering statements of regret and apology for the misdeeds of their ancestors&mdash;Bill Clinton in the United States expressed regret for the many appalling incidents in the history of the Afro&hyphen;Americans; Tony Blair has apologised for the English not helping the Irish during the potato famine&mdash;not because they are taking all the blame for those acts for the present generation but because they acknowledge the fact that they happened and that many people's lives were very badly affected. We owe them that understanding and we owe them support now. It is a way of indicating that we are prepared to do better and to take a bit of the load that those people have carried because of our intervention and our destruction in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With Wik and the stolen children report, this government has had an opportunity to move closer to reconciliation. But what has the Prime Minister done? He has done nothing. He is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5005"> running away. It is too difficult and too demeaning for him to say, simply, `I'm sorry.' Is that what he is going to do when half the working population cannot find a job? Is that what is happening when those companies that might be establishing or expanding in Australia take themselves offshore because nobody is interested in them here?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The worst part of this is that the people this government is talking about helping are those people from regional Australia where jobs are hardest to come by. How is the government trying to help them? They have cut the regional development programs totally out of existence. There is no more regional development or infrastructure money. The labour market programs and the business support programs have all gone. They have cut funds to education and tertiary institutions. They have sliced into child-care funding so that many working parents can no longer afford child care. They have knocked off great chunks of funding to local government that could have been spent on infrastructure and other works. That would have involved creating jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is one thing that this country should be doing&mdash;it will have to start spending money to start putting some jobs in place. If you do not want labour market programs, you are just going to have to put money into infrastructure. If the private sector will not do it, then government is going to have to do it. At the moment that is not the accepted philosophy, it is the old philosophy, but that is the only thing I can think of as a way of getting jobs operating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, this government has knocked off great chunks of funding to local government. In addition, they are selling Telstra without ensuring the continuation of its community obligations. The government has not ensured that people in isolated and remote areas will have the same services as people in the city. I have raised this on many occasions and nobody will give me an answer to it. This government is just going to sell Telstra and the community obligations for the more isolated areas will be forgotten.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has put another 31,500 people around Australia out of work, and the people they are trying to appease with all these cuts do not like it either. Many are really concerned that there is no direction, no plan, no strategy to try to cope with the growing unemployment and the increasing dissatisfaction with the current policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was reading an address given last week to the Minerals Council of Australia by Rod Cameron of ANOP. He was commenting on the difficulties that the mining industry was having in gaining public understanding of what they were doing. Rod Cameron said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australians are demanding that their leaders produce a plan, a plan for industry that shows them how jobs will be created in the cities where they want them. Sooner rather than later, this government will realise that it must turn its mind to industry policy as the only way of stopping those hard won battlers being lured away by Pauline's siren song.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Cameron is only one of many commentators who are bemoaning the difficulties both industry and the community are facing. What is the good of having a budget surplus, but having no one working, our assets owned overseas and our public infrastructure in tatters? I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5006"> would submit that that is a pretty silly philosophy to hold, but it seems to be the one that this government and its members have. I call on the two backbenchers who are in this chamber at the moment to take it on board and to try and take it forward because we need to tackle those issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My state of Tasmania is heavily dependent on raw material development and export. We have a small population that is further declining and our economy is really devastated. Yet the member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith), according to an answer in question time today, is far keener in promoting the help his government has given to the Cocos and Christmas islands than in helping his own island state of Tasmania. When all the cuts to Tasmania were taking place, where was his voice? Where was his voice to intercede? Nowhere&mdash;it was found wanting. Tasmania needs a strong and active public sector to ensure that the private sector can get on with their job of developing their industries, their small businesses and their new enterprises with the knowledge that they have all they need to remain competitive, both with the rest of Australia and overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to particularly mention the unfortunate cuts to the ABC. In this 50th year of radio broadcasting in Australia, this government has celebrated that achievement by cutting the funding. Of all the measures most likely to impact on regional Australia, the most cruel are the cuts to Aunty. The ABC has been instrumental in getting news, current affairs, information, rural programs, music and the arts out into the areas that are not covered by anybody else. This is somewhat related to what I was saying about Telstra. The new generation of technology which will need to go into regional and isolated areas will be carried by the new technologies, the new cable systems. Without a community service obligation and without government making the marketplace do this, and making sure that it happens, we are going to be left behind. Some of the work that the ABC has done in the past will probably be lost as a result of these cuts. This will be in addition to the lack of service by a privatised Telstra as a result of not having community obligation in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also read with dismay in my local paper that Merv Asher committed suicide. Merv was a props buyer for the ABC for 20 years. His friends were sure that the recent cuts were the last straw for him. It is a very sad exercise. The government is preparing to chop 700 jobs, and in Tasmania this could have some really significant effects as we do not have that many employees anyway. Are we just going to be hanging off Victoria's coat&hyphen;tails? We will probably have no programming of our own and we will probably lose our studio. This will be tragic for many loyal and enthusiastic watchers and listeners of the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of their audiences come from country areas, and many listen late at night, either on shift work or lying awake in bed. Some love the programs that go out on Radio Australia. For some, those who are visually impaired and those who are bedridden, it is their only link with the outside world. The most stupidest thing I have seen in government policy for a long time has been reducing Radio Australia's footprint into the Asia region.</PARA>

For us to cut this and take most of Radio Australia out of the Asian area and make the ABC sack 700 people just as a mechanism to reach the goal of a surplus budget is silly and illogical to me, when

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to touch on the Tasmanian situation. Again, I am greatly concerned for Tasmania because of the sale of the railways. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) is presently in the process of selling Tasmanian Rail. We do not seem to have any plan or idea of having a transport system or strategy which will serve our state in any way. We are going to put parts of this railway system on the market, without understanding how the links work into the ports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There does not seem to be any idea that transport systems are best coordinated so that they link together, nor that you sometimes need to get trucks to rail or rail to ships and those sorts of things. I think we are heading into some serious difficulties with the way that the process is starting to be put together to sell the railways in Tasmania. I do not think the state minister has any idea where he is going on it, just as long as he does not have to do anything about it. He is basically stepping back and saying, `The federal government owns it and, if they wish to sell it, it is basically their business. Don't blame me.' That is a very bad way of handling his portfolio, in the sense that I believe that it is his responsibility to be saying things about the transport system, if it is not going to be handled correctly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to have the freight equalisation scheme remain to assist Tasmania. We need to have a second ship to transport goods and tourists. We need to stop playing around with local government in Tasmania and let them organise themselves into an economic base where they can achieve and give services to the people of their municipalities. But, with respect to the transport system, I call on the minister to look at Tasmania and the strategies we need to make our transport system work properly and efficiently in an integrated system, with some planning so that we can achieve our goals in the future and therefore create many of the jobs that we will need in the future&mdash;especially the ones that this budget is not delivering.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government budget objectives have been framed to achieve joint goals of achieving rising living standards and enhanced employment opportunities. At the same time, there is a commitment on the part of the government to meet its social responsibilities. The government is projecting a 3.75 per cent growth over the coming year and the Reserve Bank is in fact forecasting in excess of four per cent as we move into  our seventh year of continuous economic growth without inflationary or current account pressures. The reason this is achievable is the government's extraordinary fiscal consolidation program. The overall budget strategy is to sustain a prolonged period of economic growth, avoiding the boom and bust cycles of the past whereby, certainly according to the Governor of the Reserve Bank, most of the jobs in the last 15 years have been lost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are three basic public policy objectives that we are pursuing. They are, firstly, to maintain a low rate of inflation; secondly, to promote higher levels of public and private sector saving, and that of course is to finance investment and reduce reliance on foreign capital; and, thirdly, to progress economic reform in areas such as transport and communications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In reducing our need for foreign capital through increasing national savings and financing social infrastructure on income, we reduce our exposure to exchange rate depreciations, which in fact play a far greater role in restraining Australia's exporters than do tariffs. By repaying $5.2 billion in debt, the Commonwealth will not be out in the markets this year borrowing money and will be further contracting the stock of public sector debt. A look at the bond market perhaps tells the best story of reducing supply of scrip&mdash;prices being bid up and yields 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5008"> being pushed down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The March 1996 yield spread between the US and Australian government bonds was almost 300 basis points&mdash;it was 290, or 2.9 per cent. The current spread is around 100, which reflects an improvement in our fiscal position. Over the next four years, the underlying budget balance will improve by about three percentage points of gross domestic product. Having inherited a debt of $10.5 billion, we are now returning in 1997-98 to a $3.8 billion deficit. In 1998-99 there will be a $1.6 billion surplus and, by the year 2000-2001 a $10.7 billion surplus&mdash;an extraordinary achievement by any measure. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Debt accumulated by the Keating government was 19 per cent of gross domestic product at the time of the election last year. Under us, my children will go into the new millennium with their government running a $10.7 billion surplus. Outlays as a proportion of GDP were 27 per cent. By the year 2000-2001, they will be 23 per cent of GDP. To put that into perspective, at the time the Whitlam government came to power, federal government expenditure as a proportion of GDP was 20.5 per cent. By the time Mr Whitlam left power, it was 26.7 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I would like to focus on specifically, though, are revenues, which are forecast to drop slightly to 24.5 per cent of GDP, reflecting a cut in the Reserve Bank's dividend from $2.1 billion in 1996-97 to $1.2 billion, due largely to the strength of the Australian dollar over the past year. Again, exchange rate depreciation is having a big effect on Australia's economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the revenue side of the budget, we are forecasting $133.3 billion in revenues. That is composed of gross PAYE tax receipts that will raise $62 billion, of which $9 billion will be sent back to taxpayers in the form of refunds; the Medicare levy will raise $3.7 billion; company tax $18.5 billion, and fringe benefits tax $3.1 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the expenditure side, estimated to be $127 billion, health will cost us $21.4 billion&mdash;a rise, I might add, of 7.3 per cent on last year&mdash;going now to 15.1 per cent of total Commonwealth outlays, up from 14.2 per cent the previous year. Education outlays will be $11 billion, down slightly to 0.8 per cent, and welfare outlays will be a staggering $50.9 billion, a two per cent increase on last year. To put that into proper perspective, we will spend more on health, education, and welfare, at $82 billion, than all of the money that will be raised by taxes on income&mdash;PAYE taxpayers and company tax&mdash;which will raise in the vicinity of $72 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently in Australia we are taxing all of the things that we are trying to encourage: employment, productivity and savings, despite some very good initiatives in the budget to encourage it. The present taxation system is inadequate to meet the challenges and the needs for revenue raising for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the past 20 years taxes as a percentage of GDP have been relatively stable at about 30 per cent. However, major increases in public expenditure on health, education and welfare have not been matched over the last decade or so by revenue increases, but funded instead by the accumulation of debt and asset sales. With expenditure exceeding revenues, national savings have declined and states have been forced to reduce services. I think all of us in our constituencies know the impact that that has had on us, whether it be hospital services, policing, education or any of a number of things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The top marginal income tax rates have declined from 67 per cent in the early 1970s to 47 per cent by the early 1990s, while the minimum rates of tax on lower taxable incomes have increased to 20 per cent. To put that in plain language that the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) may even understand, that means that low&hyphen; and middle-income PAYE taxpayers have carried 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5009"> the burden of Australia's revenue raising. Wholesale sales tax, customs and excise duties were 34 per cent of revenues in the 1950s; they are now only 21 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Federal government collects about 80 per cent of taxes, but state and local governments provide in excess of 50 per cent of public services, 75 per cent of the public sector work force and 80 per cent of essential economic and social infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problems with Australia's current taxation system and arrangements could be summarised by the following and I know there are more. The first is that our international competitiveness is being significantly restrained by the nature of our current tax arrangements. Wholesale sales tax is levied in only six countries, of which we are one, and manufacturers are needing to pay tax on inputs whilst trying to compete increasingly on global international markets where they cannot simply increase their prices to cover taxes on inputs that are being paid here, nor indeed to cover the cost of tariffs that are being applied on imports which are then going onto input cost in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, our current taxation system is inequitable and I think many of the more thoughtful members on the other side would be able to recognise this. In 1994 the Australian Bureau of Statistics report by David Johnson and his colleagues found that the poorest 10 per cent of households spent 22.6 per cent of their disposable income on indirect taxes and that is an increase from 14.2 per cent in 1984. In contrast the wealthiest 10 per cent spent only 5.7 per cent of their disposable income on indirect taxes, a reduction over that decade from 6.3 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Bob Gregory and Dr Hunter from the Australian National University, in perhaps the most extensive study of income separation in Australia from 1978 to 1991, found that in that period of time, in the wealthiest five per cent of suburbs in Australia income increased 23 per cent, while for the poorest five per cent of suburbs it declined 23 per cent. In EPAC's April 1995 report on income distribution in Australia from 1978 to 1994, the bottom 10 per cent of income earners in Australia had a reduction in their income of two per cent; in contrast, the top 10 per cent increased by 23 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That anyone could suggest the current taxation system is not inequitable is to defy reality. You will not at the moment pay tax on crayfish, caviar or exotic fruits. You will pay, however,  an 11 per cent sales tax on biscuits, ice cream, confectionary and fruit juices. You will pay 22 per cent on soft drinks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the current taxation system is inefficient, it is also complex. David Koch, the well-known financial commentator advised me the average tax agent has to read 25 pages of new tax ruling or legislation every day just to keep up. Despite the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS>&mdash;which we heard today will increase by 20 pages&mdash;70 per cent of Australians use a taxation agent to prepare their returns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a shrinking taxation base, as I said earlier. We are currently taxing income and in a low-inflation environment, with all of the positive things that that brings in terms of interest rate reductions, we do not have bracket creep and that has a negative impact on government revenues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have falling tariffs and falling customs duty and of course that means reduced revenue for government. And thanks to the efforts of some Australians, fewer people are now smoking and are more discerning about the alcohol content of alcoholic beverages that they drink, so that we have had a reduced share of household expenditure on products for which we used to rely in no small way for taxation revenue. Wholesale sales tax has been applied to three 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5010"> goods&mdash;durables, motor vehicles and beer&mdash;and those three things are diminishing as a revenue source for Australian governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until the 10 per cent bed tax announced by the New South Wales Labor government, the services sector currently has not been taxed. The indirect taxation system is complex. If you ask anyone running a business, particularly a small manufacturing business, they will be only too happy to tell you. The tax burden is carried by low and middle income earners. Income tax is minimised by higher income earners, the self-employed and the well advised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Greenhouse emissions are something about which the world is becoming increasingly concerned. As a nation we are trying to come to terms with the United Nations framework agreement on greenhouse gas emissions. Australian manufacturers and those who have come on board the national greenhouse program, which brings together industry, government and private sector organisations, need to understand that we need to make, for many other reasons as well, Australian manufacturing as efficient as we possibly can if we are going to have, and make, a positive contribution to the world's environment in terms of greenhouse emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have a cash economy. The Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry in its submission to the tax summit last year estimated that the tax revenue being lost in terms of the cash economy was about $1 billion a year. But, as we have just heard from the Commissioner of Taxation in the last week, it is possibly in the vicinity of $3 billion to $15 billion. Whatever the arguments over the size of the cash economy, it is substantial and it is money that could be used to fund essential services. We have vertical fiscal imbalance also and whilst the states are raising less than half of the money which they are required to spend there is not likely to be major progress made in terms of health and education reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps more than anything else, what is going to change Australia's economic, social and political priorities is the ageing of the nation. A report that I would commend to all members is the National Commission of Audit report produced by Professor Bob Officer's committee last year. You will find in that that the aged dependency ratio in Australia at the moment is 5.3:1. That means that for every person over the age of 64 and under the age of 15 there are 5.3 people between the ages of 15 and 64. Over the next 40 years that ratio will go to 2.6:1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABS figures from last year are that 7.8 million Australians worked and paid taxes to support 6.2 million people who were relying on some form of social security benefit, most  of them through no fault of their own. If we do not change the way we produce wealth and the way we tax ourselves, those trend lines will cross in the next decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also know that about 13 per cent of us are over the age of 65 now. By the year 2050, about a third of us will be over the age of 65. In the absence of a cure, seven per cent of us over the age of 75 will suffer from dementia. In other words, we will have a significant number of Australians who will not be in the work force, who will not be paying taxes, but who will have increasing needs for health and welfare expenditure. In fact, Officer's report estimates that over the next 40 years we will have to spend 10 per cent more of GDP above and beyond real growth from where we are currently at just simply maintaining health and welfare services for the ageing population as they have come to expect and, I would suggest, deserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that is causing governments to review and reform Australia's taxation system is technology. I commend to every member of the House the electronic commerce task force report of the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board that was released in March. It is now possible, amongst other things, to run a business from Australia, transfer money overseas 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5011"> through the Internet, have your employees based in countries other than Australia, and buy goods from overseas and not pay excise when they come into Australia. And because of the digitisation of products that are being offered through new technologies, the distinction between goods and services is being blurred, which then makes it very difficult for the taxation department to keep up with tracking the transfer of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also recommend that honourable members have a look at the European Union Bank's home page which, amongst other things, encourages and invites taxpayers to Caribbean style tax shelters, which it is able to legally offer through the Internet. Australian manufacturers are paying wholesale sales tax on inputs. As tariffs decline, it is cheaper to move operations offshore and to save on sales tax that is payable on inputs. If you look at computer manufacturing, for example, if a regional computer system is located in Singapore, Hong Kong or New Zealand, no taxes will be paid on that computer; but if it is located in Australia, sales tax at 22 per cent is payable in respect of importation or local manufacture of that computer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Business Council's use of Access Economics modelling calculated the long run gains from reform of indirect taxes and subsidies to be in the vicinity of two per cent of GDP, or $10 billion. That is almost twice the amount of money that the Commonwealth government contributes to the financing of Australian public hospitals in one year. It is also the amount of money that the government has been forced to save in its fiscal consolidation program, and it would do a lot to fund the kinds of services which the member for Lyons (Mr Adams) and other decent people on the other side would like to see funded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until Australia's taxation system is simplified, it will be very difficult, if not impossible, for this nation to create more wealth. Until the tax system and tax base is broadened, any responsible government seeking to fund social infrastructure on income, rather than on debt and asset sales, has no choice but to necessarily review essential government funded services. It does not give me and some people on this side any pleasure to have seen some of the cutbacks in some of the areas, but it had to be done if we are not going to continue to indulge the present generation at the expense of our children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To maintain a welfare system that condemns the poor to permanent dependency and that is financed on debt and asset sales is an abrogation of our responsibilities to the future of our country. The purpose of any taxation system, ultimately, is to finance the establishment and  maintenance of social infrastructure, to support and protect those in society who have neither power nor influence, and to enable governments to strategically stimulate those sectors of the economy essential to growth and, with it, the creation of jobs. In essence, it is the poor who should ultimately be its greatest beneficiaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, in terms of the phenomenon that has become known as the `Hanson phenomenon'&mdash;referring, I presume, to the honourable member for Oxley&mdash;I think she and those who subscribe to her views need to understand that the world is currently contracting into three major trading blocks. Whether we like it or not, whatever our hankering for the past and some of the better aspects of it, if we are not a part of it, then my children, our children, will have no economic future at all. We need to understand that our future lies not so much in some of the industries that have characterised much of the latter part of the 20th century, but in knowledge based industries in particular and those that are going to be involved in the development of skills and expertise in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is legitimacy in the grief and the anger that people are expressing, and they see the member for Oxley as a lightning rod for the expression of that grief and anger about changes 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5012"> that few Australians want, and even fewer really understand. But the policies that are being espoused by the member for Oxley are morally wrong and economically irresponsible. The other point that needs to be made is that whilst the member for Oxley is exercising the right, as she sees it, to freedom of speech, the right to freedom of speech has never really extended to the right to demean, denigrate or alienate any section of this society. I feel that, whether it has been deliberate or otherwise, that has been the effect of many of the things that she has said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of us, in coming into the parliament, profess to be leaders of one sort or another. I think when we allow facts to bow to bias and prejudiced arguments to dominate public debate, when we feel that we have to follow populist views rather than lead public opinion, then the nation is vulnerable. I think most of the people who are following Ms Hanson are basically decent people. They are angry, they are hurt and they are grieving about the changes that they have seen, but there is also a section of that membership, of those people following, who are frankly evil.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we maintain silence, if we do not give Australians a confident outlook on the kind of future that we see ahead, if we are not able to articulate that in day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day life, then evil has found an environment in which it is likely to flourish. Our challenge is to explain and articulate a vision of Australia. Foremost in that, I would suggest, is a taxation system, and reform of it, to get some of those people away from Ms Hanson. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To me, the second Howard budget has disappeared like the proverbial stone that skimmed brightly across the lake, bouncing several times before vanishing without trace. It is a bit like the time when your father took you along to the beach or the lakeside and you picked out a little stone and you energetically flicked it across the lake. It made some splashes and then disappeared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the breast beating of the first Howard&hyphen;Fischer budget, the rally call to the troops who had finally won a battle and now had someone to blame for all the perceived wrongs of the Hawke and Keating years, there was an expectation out there in the electorate that the time  had finally come for some wise and sensible decisions in this second Howard&hyphen;Fischer budget. Perhaps there would be something in the way of hope for the many seeking relief from the despair evident in many parts of my electorate&mdash;I hate to say this&mdash;right across the length and breadth of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my mind the nation needed some new focus and, more importantly, the hundreds and thousands of long&hyphen;term unemployed needed to see that they were not going to be discarded and forgotten. In my mind they have been. Why do I say this? Firstly, because the many programs that were once there in place to enable them to at least have some opportunity to gain skills and some experience have been axed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the evidence of the impact this unemployment has on people's lives is evidenced if you ever visit my electorate office. Within less than a kilometre radius, in the Broadacre public housing area, with probably the highest unemployment and the highest youth unemployment in Australia, the evidence is there and the impact is there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing that really gets up my nose&mdash;and I am a pretty calm, sane, rational and reasonable 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5013"> person who does not go berserk in this place and does not cast aspersions on people&mdash;is the diatribe that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) goes on with. He so despises the programs that we had in place and he does it with such a venom and hatred that I am going to publicly invite him to occasionally come to our Parliamentary Christian Fellowship to share in the spirit and unity of purpose that operates so marvellously in our midst. Perhaps some of that benevolence will flow into his soul and he will see that it was not all bad. It is not all black and it is not all white.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It really annoys me. None of us have all the answers and I publicly admit that we made mistakes in the 13 years&mdash;I would be foolish not to say that&mdash;but there were some good things. My electorate consists basically of three areas: huge swathes of Broadacre public housing which were built by the state Labor government&mdash;for which I continually chastise them because they never learnt after building one and seeing it as a failure, and they kept replicating it; some middle class; then rural and remote areas in Tasmanian terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know for a fact that there were dozens of examples where Working Nation programs were the only opportunity for these people who were generationally long&hyphen;term unemployed. Before I came into this House I was a schoolteacher. I focused on working in disadvantaged schools in New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and some overseas areas. It was evident that education was the key, but there were generations of long&hyphen;term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our Working Nation programs we did at least get the people out of their houses and say to them, `Here is a challenge, come and at least have a go. You have got some skills.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was delighted, the Sunday before last, to go down to the South Arm Community Centre&mdash;it is a little community down the narrow neck in the southern part of my electorate&mdash;to meet with those people who raised $86,000 from amongst a population of a couple of hundred. They had been raising the money for years in the expectation that they would have a community centre where they could have the doctor visit and physiotherapy and a play group. It would also be a focal point for their young people. Hopefully, they can extend it and have a gymnasium so the kids do not have to be carted miles and miles up the road, and they could re&hyphen;focus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people came to us when we were in power and said, `How can we be involved in the Working Nation program? How can we get the state government and the local council involved?' They had this cooperative approach. Well, the evidence was there the other Sunday. We were all there&mdash;Senator Calvert, me, Mayor Cathy Edwards, and Peter Hodgman, the minister responsible from the state government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everyone said what a wonderful idea it was. The 18 guys who worked there for six months learned how to box for the slab, how to pour the concrete, how to erect the building, how to build doors and frames and all the other bits and pieces. They gained enormously. Quite a few of them, at the end of the program, were able to say, `Here is a photographic record of what I had done in order to have this building up and running.' But if you listen to the minister, these things do not happen. I am sure I am not the only person from amongst the 148 electorates in this part of the world who can get up and say, `I can give you concrete evidence that this has worked.' I can give you dozens of examples of similar things happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing really annoys me. The thing that is obviously missing from this and the previous 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5014"> Liberal budget is some compassion. When I went to the national prayer breakfast in Washington with John Forrest, the member for Mallee, in February of this year, Bill and Hilary Clinton said that they were working on getting rid of this payback mentality. Hilary said that every morning she used to wake up and think, `Who can I get today?' If we operate on that premise, this country will spend all its time navel gazing and ripping people's arms and legs off while the people that we are here to represent are going to suffer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, as I say, I would like the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training to visit our Parliamentary Christian Fellowship and share in some of the things that we do there. He would have loved today when we had a Maori speaker who challenged us all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The past 12 months of the Howard&hyphen;Fischer rule, as far as my electorate and most of Tasmania goes, has had as much impact as the first snowfalls that cover the highest slopes of many of the hills that dominate the southern part of my electorate. It looks pretty spectacular and impressive after the first snowfall but once the winter sun gets out the snow soon disappears from sight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why do I say this? I say it because I honestly think it is true. There is little of a positive nature that I can actually point to when constituents say, `Harry, what do you think about the budget delivered by the Treasurer?' I think to myself, `What can I say to them?' Can I say, `Go and work for the dole'? How many in my electorate of 90,000 are actually going to work for the dole? I would be lucky to get 100. I have 30 Green Corps, and a proportion of those do not even come from Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I went down to the Green Corps at Franklin in the southern part of my electorate, where there is a huge unemployment problem, especially among young people. I went along and talked to them because I was interested. I asked them, `You are part of the Green Corps: tell us a bit about yourself. How did you get involved? Where did you come from? What's your educational background? How's it all operating?' I was amazed when one bloke said, `I'm from Brisbane.' I said, `What the hell are you doing down here? Haven't they got Green Corps programs in Queensland that could cater to you?' He said, `Oh, I thought I would come down here and experience life in Tasmania.' I cannot believe that we are actually putting into place programs that do not benefit people within their own regions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue that has come to my notice&mdash;and it is one that the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams) mentioned today&mdash;is that of the ship bounty. We had a real arm&hyphen;twisting  exercise. We had to stop what we were doing and waste a hell of a lot of time, energy and effort in trying to convince people that we had a legitimate argument. One would think, when you are framing the budget&mdash;whether it be our side's or yours&mdash;that you would be out there talking to people and trying to understand what you are on about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have got six or seven Liberal senators&mdash;I am not too sure how many, but I could work it out if I went through their names: there are six of them, at least&mdash;and surely they must have told someone that this was the largest employer of people in Tasmania. If that goes, Tasmania&mdash;which has the highest unemployment in the country and a population which, it is predicted, will be less than 450,000 in about 30 years time&mdash;is going out backwards, and yet you are about to put the screws on to close it down. Where is the logic? This is without doubt the world's best high&hyphen;speed catamaran builder, and we are giving him a hard time, quibbling about a small amount of money&mdash;in fiscal terms, when we are talking about a national budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the quarantine issue? I know there has been an increase in quarantine surveillance and the like. But tell that to the Tasmanian apple and pear growers. The fire blight 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5015"> issue should never have happened. What impact has it had? We are the largest exporter of apples. We have been working for years and years. We have cracked the Taiwanese market and we were about to crack the Japanese market. We had a small shipment of Fuji apples ready to go, and what happened? We had convinced the growers, we were about to convince the government and everyone was about to sign off and, suddenly, bang! Up came the quarantine issue. AQIS let us down, despite the increased money, and we are now virtually back to square one. This year's shipment was put on hold, and we have to sell it on the Tasmanian or the Australian mainland market, and we have to wait. If you go down to my part of the world, where we grow almost all the apples in Tasmania, the increased production would absolutely amaze you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were some other things in the budget which really impacted upon my part of the world. When people say, `Well, what did it do, Harry?' one thing I need to put on record is the issue of child care. I quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 14 May:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government concedes this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the issue of child care&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">could be difficult for low&hyphen;income families who will have to pay full fees in advance for the first fortnight of the new system and intends to `develop options' to help those in difficulty.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When we were in government, we had a heck of a time convincing the bureaucrats in whatever the department was called in those days&mdash;it is now the Department of Health and Family Services&mdash;that there were pockets in Tasmania which needed some flexibility when it came to child care. Because of the make&hyphen;up of my particular electorate, which is broadacre public housing and rural and remote areas, we have community based child&hyphen;care centres. What did this government do? It took away their operational subsidies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The child&hyphen;care centre within a bull's roar of my office is subsidised by the local council in order to allow it to survive. The one at Cygnet is about to be built and it is almost bankrupt before it starts because of changes to the operational subsidy. The one at Huonville is being bailed out by the local council. The one at Geeveston is about to close. The one at Blackman's Bay, which is one of the best child&hyphen;care centres in Australia bar none&mdash;it has before school; ordinary child care, long&hyphen;term and part&hyphen;time child care, and after school child care&mdash;is going to lose $160,000 in operational subsidy. That services about half a dozen primary schools for after school care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So when my people say to me, `Harry, what do you think of the budget?' I cannot be too positive, and I am one of the most positive blokes you would ever find. Whoever thought this child-care thing up is a numbers man.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another thing that is going to impact is the public housing waiting list. The Howard government cut $50 million from the annual funding of the Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement. You come and talk to the people in my part of the world who are desperate for a house. It says in the<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Australian</EMPHASIS> article on 14 May that the cuts will reduce the amount of public housing being built. It may also force state governments to abandon the refurbishment of old housing estates. I have got heaps and heaps of them; probably a good third of my electorate live in these places. I would invite anybody, with this sort of weather, to come and spend a couple of days in Bridgewater, Rokeby, Risdon Vale, Warrane and Mornington and see the hopelessness and despair. They suddenly say, `The house has not been painted for 10 years. We cannot get ordinary maintenance done. What hope have we got now?'&mdash;they are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5016"> not very positive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another little cutting: another 16,000 jobs to be cut from the Commonwealth public service over the next financial year. I know all about this. I think I am one of the few politicians whose wife now works in Canberra. She works for the Commonwealth Department of Health and Family Services. Her job disappeared in Hobart and the only chance she had of a job was to come up here, so I go home to myself and come up to see my wife. I know what impact that is having on my family. What is it having on other people? At least we have a decent income to survive. We are running four houses and one of my two daughters is at university and the other one is trying to find some work after graduating in Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the PBS scheme, the cuts there are having an impact especially in the rural and remote areas of my electorate. It sounds fine to say, `Okay, we will have the old generic drugs,' but there are a lot of people who need a specific one and if they need it, why can't we give it to them? Surely to goodness in this day of modern technology we can sort out the rorters, the people who are doctor shopping and the ones who are hoarding the drugs. There ought to be a bit of compassion in some of these decisions. If someone has got problems such as blood pressure, depression, ulcers or high cholesterol, why can't they get the drugs? They have been taxpayers. But it is all down to the numbers game.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know there are some positive things in the budget. The House of Representatives Committee on Family and Community Affairs&mdash;that I am deputy chair of&mdash;heard the department today saying about all the wonderful things in the budget. One of them was increased funding of $406,000, I think, to promote birthing centres in rural and remote areas. I thought this was great and I dug a bit deeper. They said they were doing another pilot. I said that was funny because the hospital in Franklin had closed its birthing facilities down. It was a state government decision to force all the mothers to go and have their children somewhere else. There can be snow on the highway and you have to cross the mountain saddles but you have no choice. So the local hospital is now excluding the residents that live in the community and yet the Commonwealth government is supposedly doing all these wonderful things. Who is talking to whom? There needs to be some strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) spoke about restructuring the taxation system. I think we need a better, cohesive, interdepartmental interagency approach to specific  areas. I think this budget is framed&mdash;in fact, I know it is&mdash;with five or six big cities in mind, with the occasional little handout to the rural and remote areas to keep us all happy. I am not happy with it. I have not mentioned education and some of the programs there. To my mind we are focusing our money on the wrong spot. It ought to be down to the early education to give our kids an adequate foundation. We are pouring $32 million into looking at youth suicide&mdash;that is fine. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My electorate of Wide Bay has been going through difficult times. The small business environment has not been promising; we have got consistently the highest level of unemployment in the country; there has been drought and declining rural prices; and, particularly in the coastal parts of my electorate, the housing industry has slowed. So I was looking for a budget that delivered for regional Australia, that provided some hope and opportunity for business in my area to invest and expand, and that led the people who live in the region to have some confidence that there would be employment opportunities available in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a budget that delivers for regional Australia. It does offer hope and opportunity, and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5017"> it has not done it in the Labor way of seeking to buy low unemployment statistics. It has not sought to tax in order to spend. It has not done it in the way in which Labor would normally address these sorts of problems&mdash;by running up even more debt. This government knows that it is not governments that create wealth, but the toil of the Australian people and the efforts of individual people in business and industry. If our country is to prosper, it is essential that we provide the incentives and the rewards for people to engage in the kind of initiatives that are necessary to get our economy moving again. The 1997 federal budget provides the kind of economic environment that will encourage the businesses of Wide Bay to invest and expand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the feature of this budget is the improvement in the economic outlook that it offers for the years ahead. We have noticed today, with the improved quarterly growth figure, some further encouragement that there is some brighter future ahead. Interest rates are at historically low levels and we have a low inflation environment. Indeed, many people in the community are now going to have to start getting used to the idea that this country can return to an era of sustained growth and low inflation. That was the history of Australia in the 1950s and the 1960s, but was sadly lost in more recent decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much of the so&hyphen;called growth in our country has been artificial&mdash;it has just been reliant on inflation. Investments did not have to actually achieve a worthwhile return; they could rely on inflation to build the value of the investment. When we invest in the future with low inflation, not only will we sustain the real value of our investment, but it will be necessary for us to achieve real growth. The only way that can be done is if there is an economy which offers the sort of support and encouragement that industry needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The remarkable thing about this budget is its fiscal consolidation. A debt free budget&mdash;how long is it since we have had a federal budget which does not add to our growing national debt? The coalition government has turned around Labor's $10.3 billion budget deficit and expects a surplus of $1.6 billion in its next budget. That is a remarkable turnaround and it should be the headlines in the newspapers right across the country. Some people have complained that the budget is no longer on the front pages like some Labor budgets which hung around for weeks and weeks. Well, it is off the front pages because of what it is achieving. It is a budget without the horrors of previous years. There are no new taxes. Again, what a remarkable feature for a budget. How long it is since our country has had no new taxes in a budget?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that in the past, Labor governments have gone to the people at election time promising no new taxes&mdash;often to be followed by the biggest taxing budgets in history. But this is a budget which genuinely has no increases in taxes and yet has achieved substantial fiscal consolidation and reduced the deficit from $10.3 billion down to $3.9 billion. With the projected surplus next year of $1.6 billion, the government is to be congratulated on its achievements in restoring a balanced budget to our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that is not all. This budget actually pays back $5 billion of Keating's debt. Now, $5 billion is a very substantial sum, but when you realise that $5 billion is only about one&hyphen;twentieth of the total debt, it demonstrates for how long we are going to have to produce budgets of this magnitude and with this kind of repayment of the debt before our government debt is removed entirely. So the pain that has been endured over the last year or two has been worthwhile and all Australians should join with the government in the pride and pleasure of knowing that we are moving towards a balanced budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other remarkable feature about the way in which the government has achieved this balance is that it has not been done by raising new taxes, as would have been the Labor way. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5018"> In fact, real expenditure is down in this budget for only the third time in 30 years. The underlying outlays are reducing to the sorts of levels that we knew in the 1960s and 1970s. The government is getting its hands out of the pockets of the Australian people and balancing its budget by cutting its own expenditure, eliminating waste, finding more efficient ways of achieving its objectives and, certainly, learning to live within its means&mdash;something this country needed to do a very, very long time ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a budget without features, without hope and without opportunity. It offers real advances for rural and regional Australia. I want to concentrate my remarks on the benefits to regional areas of the 1997 budget. The budget includes a commitment of $4 billion worth of expenditure in regional Australia. Despite having a balanced budget and despite reducing the call on the nation's gross domestic product, $4 billion is earmarked for expenditure in rural and regional areas. The government is to be congratulated on that recognition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A tax rebate of up to $450 per taxpayer will be available for interest earned on savings, superannuation and other investments or investments in small business. This measure is likely to assist around six million taxpayers and will reduce our reliance on foreign borrowings. It will also, by providing additional financial resources in this nation, help protect Australian companies from foreign takeovers. It will provide a pool of resources to assist investment in local industry including, of course, local industry in Wide Bay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be Australian money more readily available to assist and support Australian industry. When there is a need for a capital influx in a company somewhere around the nation, there will be Australian funds available rather than having to borrow offshore. When equity is needed, Australians can invest rather than having to sell off our companies to countries overseas and that will be particularly welcome in regional areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The expectation in this budget is that unemployment will fall nationally to eight per cent. In my own area, when this government came to office the unemployment rate was 20 per cent. Labor's legacy to Wide Bay was 20 per cent unemployment. A projected lowering of the unemployment rate is very good news indeed and there is $20 million in the budget to assist depressed regions which are experiencing high levels of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no doubt that Wide Bay will be particularly targeted for projects under the work for the dole scheme, for which $21 million is provided in this budget. Around 10,000 places will  be available for young people in the 18&hyphen; to 24&hyphen;year&hyphen;old age bracket and naturally the scheme will target rural and regional areas with high levels of unemployment. I have at an early stage volunteered my region for some of these pilot programs and I am sure that there are many young people who are looking forward to the opportunity to contribute something to their community for the unemployment benefits that they are receiving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is increased expenditure for rural health, another issue of considerable concern to regional Australia. It is quite deplorable that, despite the fact that there are scores of doctors in capital cities who are working below the poverty line or not working in medicine at all, there are regional and rural communities right around the country which cannot get adequate medical staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A new Hervey Bay hospital is being officially opened in my electorate in the next couple of days. This is a magnificent hospital and it would be the pride of any private hospital system in the country. You walk through the entrance foyer to be greeted by fountains, gardens and lavish surroundings like those you would expect to see in the most luxurious of hospitals. But this is a public hospital. I would have thought it would be a wonderful place for any doctor 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5019"> to work. But the Queensland health department have had to recruit 11 doctors from England to help staff this hospital, and it has been difficult to attract specialists. We are not talking here about a dusty, dry, remote, rural community. We are talking about a fast&hyphen;growing regional city on the beach with a magnificent lifestyle and perhaps the best climate in the country. And yet, doctors will not move from the capital cities to work in an area such as this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why the government's rural health initiatives are so important. They are important not just for remote communities but also for fast&hyphen;growing regional cities that have been unable to attract the medical expertise that they surely have a right to expect. There is $17.4 million in this budget targeted for rural and remote area health priorities, including the extension of specialist medical training in rural areas and the development of innovative models for service delivery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Medicare offices will stay open throughout regional Australia and there will be 400 new Medicare agencies to provide, for the first time in many country towns, services which city people have taken for granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is particular emphasis on the need to upgrade Australia's quarantine services. There have been many incidents over recent times of lapses in our quarantine barriers. A $76 million boost over four years for quarantine will be warmly welcomed in fruit&hyphen;growing areas such as my own, but all Australians will benefit from the protection provided to our unique Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are a remote country and we suffer many disadvantages as a result of having to trade with people far away. Our shipping costs add burdens. The time taken in travelling to promote our products is certainly a liability. But our remoteness has one major advantage and that is that our country is largely free of the pests and diseases which plague so much of the rest of the world. We need to protect that advantage and guard it zealously. This new boost to quarantine expenditure is an important recognition of the new government's commitment to ensuring that our industries remain free from the scourges that are endured by so many people in other parts of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regional roads will get a significant funding boost with $800 million provided for the national highway system&mdash;and around 90 per cent of that money to be directed to rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly welcome, in my own electorate, the announcement that $14 million is being provided in the budget for the long&hyphen;awaited Gunalda Range reconstruction. This has to be the worst part of Highway 1 anywhere in Australia. It is a winding, narrow mountain strip and its reconstruction was promised by Labor more than a decade ago. In fact, they promised it at every election during which I have been associated with the federal parliament. But they have never delivered. They promised it at the state level. They have given I do not know how many starting dates, but they have never delivered. The $14 million provided in this budget will hopefully allow the project to get under way this financial year. This will remove one of the worst accident spots and one of the slowest parts of the national highway anywhere in Australia. So I welcome this commitment to road funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is, of course, much, more included in the budget of particular interest to regional Australia. The regional telecommunications infrastructure fund will provide $250 million to help regional businesses and communities take advantage of the technologies that are available and provide to country people the same sorts of services that cities have taken for granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another $48 million for the regional forest agreements. That is important, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5020"> particularly for those states that do not have Labor governments, because it is quite obvious that the New South Wales Labor government has no commitment whatever to the forest industries. It is important that we get these agreements in place in other states, so that there can be security and protection in the long term for those vital forest industries. That is particularly important in an electorate such as my own, which has a very large forest industry and which has been so concerned now for years that Labor governments at state and federal level are likely to remove access to their resource and deny any kind of future growth or maintenance of those industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is $1.2 million for the new regional minerals program to help encourage the expansion of mining ventures and, as I mentioned earlier, a $20 million assistance program for depressed regions. I welcome also the changes to Austudy, which will be of particular benefit to regional and rural Australia. The changes will particularly benefit families with more than one child eligible for Austudy and remove a disadvantage that was present in the rules for larger families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is $2.8 million to continue the credit care program to help communities set up credit unions where banks have closed. That, again, is not an issue that is just confined to the remote areas. There are many banks closing in my own electorate, and I have now got a number of towns left entirely without banking services. I welcome the credit care program as a way of providing a means for people in smaller rural areas to be able to carry out financial transactions in their own area. The government's commitment in that regard is warmly welcomed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is of interest to note also that this budget commits the government to a new integrated rural policy package. Following the mid&hyphen;term review, the rural adjustment scheme is to be phased out later this year. But $198 million has been committed in the budget for the new integrated rural policy package. That is an especially welcome initiative. Despite the efforts of governments in the past, despite the well&hyphen;meaning intentions, no doubt, of many, there is still much pain in the rural sector and, particularly, there is much adjustment that will be required to ensure the future prosperity and viability of Australia's farms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This new package must provide measures to assist farmers with their management, but must also provide assistance to people by way of welfare payments when they face exceptionally difficult times. Farmers do not expect and do not want to live on welfare, but there is a need  for the same kind of safety net for the rural sector, for farmers, as applies to others in the community who fall on difficult times. It is also important to provide an effective rural counselling service, because some people have to face, and make, very difficult decisions about the future of their farming operations and sometimes they need some assistance in that regard. I trust that the government will find the necessary funds to ensure that there is an effective network of rural counsellors right through the nation to provide help and assistance where it is needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget does indeed provide a number of opportunities for new hope and optimism in regional and rural Australia. Naturally, everything cannot be achieved overnight. But I hope that as regional areas start to come to grips with what this budget contains, the potential that is available for them to reinvest, to reinvigorate their business and industries, there will be new hope for the future and that rural and regional Australia will adopt a more positive and aggressive attitude towards their future. Australian regional areas contribute much to the wealth of this country&mdash;most of our export income. They contribute to our gross domestic product way beyond other sectors of the community. They are entitled to assistance and recognition 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5021"> of that contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget delivers to regional Australia. This budget gives them an opportunity to go on and continue to contribute to our nation. But it also makes it clear to those who live outside the capital city that the coalition government cares and wants their lifestyle to be improved and be in keeping with the rest of the nation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second Howard&hyphen;Costello budget, brought down on 13 May 1997, is a political rather than an economic document. The first budget in August 1996 cut hard and deep but seemed to have been reasonably well received in the electorate. The 1998&hyphen;99 budget, the last for this parliament, will be designed as an election sweetener.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a long tradition in Australia that new governments blame predecessors for the horrors of their first budget. `We had no idea,' the new treasurers say, eyes blazing with outrage and sincerity, `how bad the economic situation was when we came in. We had to take desperate measures, which were entirely due to the previous government.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor said it in 1983&mdash;coming in after a period when John Howard had been Treasurer&mdash;but with good reason. In March 1983, unemployment and inflation both stood at 11 per cent and the deficit in current dollars amounted to $25 billion. The coalition did it in 1996, and keep saying it. Governments generally have a honeymoon period in their first months in office. Tony Blair in Great Britain is currently reaping the benefit of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before turning to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1997-98, it is worth pointing out the extraordinary resemblance between the Australian election of March 1996 and the British general election of May 1997, but with party roles reversed. In both cases the incumbent Prime Minister had unexpectedly won a previous election&mdash;1992 for John Major and 1993 for Paul Keating. The economic indicators were good but, essentially, the electors had decided they wanted a change and did not listen to the economic good news. Coincidentally, British Labour's 44.5 per cent of the popular vote in a first-past-the-post election was exactly the same as the ALP's two-candidate preferred vote in an election conducted on a preferential system. The ALP primary vote of 38.7 per cent was far ahead of the Conservatives' 31 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The biggest story in the media coverage of the 1997-98 budget was a 15 per cent taxation rebate on savings, designed to be the centrepiece in a program to encourage national  investment. The objective is certainly desirable and necessary. National savings and investment are unusually low in Australia, well behind the OECD average. As the Treasurer (Mr Costello) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rebate will apply to the first $3,000 of taxable income from savings however derived. For example, the rebate would apply to the whole of the interest earned on $60,000 invested at 5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Alternatively, the rebate can be claimed in respect of any payment of personal contributions into superannuation up to $3,000. A person who pays $3,000 into superannuation will get a $450 tax rebate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">However, barely three weeks after the budget, the Costello savings rebate is no longer talked about. It has disappeared into the fog.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Vince Fitzgerald, who conducted an important inquiry into national savings, disputed from the start whether the plan could be effective. David Connolly, formerly a Liberal shadow minister, thought it absurd. Some `deep throats' made it clear that Treasury was profoundly sceptical that it could work. When tackled on this in question time the day after the budget, the Treasurer replied, `What the Treasury policy is doesn't matter to the government.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Senate estimates on 2 June 1997, the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr Ted Evans, directly 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5022"> contradicted government claims about the savings rebate, saying that it may backfire and lead to lower national savings. He conceded that the $2 billion cost of running the scheme could exceed any increase in savings by individuals. He agreed that the rebate could be obtained in full by taxpayers who had not increased their saving, or had reduced their savings in any given financial year, which is rather an interesting concept of what an incentive is. He also agreed that only a small number of taxpayers might be benefited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The timing of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in raising the possibility of introducing a GST if the government should be re&hyphen;elected in 1999 was universally regarded as a diversionary tactic, a smokescreen, to divert attention away from the now discredited savings rebate, and also from the issues to be raised at the Reconciliation Convention and the 10-point Wik plan on native title and pastoral leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The revival of this issue was even odder because it had the potential to damage the Prime Minister who had several times unambiguously ruled out GST as a possibility&mdash;it was no longer on the agenda. One of Ted Evans' predecessors as Secretary to the Treasury, John Stone, who had held that position when John Howard was Treasurer, gave a less than flattering review of the budget in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 29 May under the heading `Lame Budget has Howard ducking for cover'. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commentators generally agree that the Prime Minister acted on national television on May 18 to restore tax reform to public prominence in an attempt to divert attention from his Budget failure five days earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet taken as a whole, the overwhelming impression of the Government's approach to the taxation system is of an incoherent hodge&hyphen;podge of bits and pieces tricked out to appeal to this or that special interest group.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Wonderful to have friends. The tariff debate, now concentrating on the future of the motor vehicle industry in Australia is taking place in a grossly misleading way. The hard line economic rationalists, very contemptuous of economic nationalism and/or self&hyphen;sufficiency, give the impression that Australia is resisting movement towards lower tariffs in a context of rapidly increasing globalisation. But in our region Australia ranks with New Zealand as the most accessible market of all in automotive manufactured products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current tariff level for imports is five to 25 per cent and the projected figure for the year 2000 is five to 15 per cent&mdash;leaving aside the proposed Moore modification of the Productivity Commission's majority report. Part imports are not linked to local investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The US has a five per cent tariff on cars, 25 per cent on trucks and six to seven per cent on parts, with bilateral restraints on Japanese imports, and the benefit of NAFTA. In market accessibility it is in the No. 2 category, behind Australia and New Zealand. Japan is in the No. 3 rank, with no tariffs, but very significant market cartels are, in practice, far more significant than the tariff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hong Kong, which has no car industry, is also in the No. 3 rank, imposing a tax between 30 and 90 per cent on imports. Singapore is in the No. 5 rank, with no motor manufacturing, but a tariff of 45 per cent and a tax of 175 per cent. In the No. 10 category, the most inaccessible are China, India, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely consistent. With the pre&hyphen;emptive announcement by Senator Alston before the budget that the ABC would lose $50 million, the national broadcaster found itself between a rock and a hard place. In its submission to the Mansfield inquiry, it decided to offer up Radio Australia and Australia Television&mdash;a tragic mistake, taken up by Bob Mansfield who admits, with characteristic candour, that he had very little exposure to either.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It gives a very contradictory signal about Australia's engagement with Asia. Even though Radio Australia has been reprieved, in a sharply reduced form, Australia Television's screen will go black, even though it has a selective, but powerful influence, at very low cost. There seems to be a real determination by the Howard government to cripple the ABC, denounced as an outlet for `political correctness'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A columnist in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> observed, correctly, that this government did not have an agenda, it had a hit list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am mystified about the Prime Minister's main complaint about the ABC, which is that it has a narrower range than the commercial television and radio networks. A narrower range? Can he be serious? The ABC is aiming at the long term, the value laden and, I would hope, the highest common denominator. The ABC's range includes news, current affairs, sport, talkback, serious music, opera, ballet, satire, science, state and federal political reviews, foreign  affairs, education, book reviews, rural affairs, theatre reviews, serious films, commentary and critical analysis, and health. Many of those functions are duplicated by SBS, but only the first four are taken up by commercial television networks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Metropolitan commercial radio has a very narrow range of news, popular music, talkback and sport, wedged in between advertisements. Commercial television, driven by ratings and appealing to the lowest common multiple, rejects the idea of appealing to a diversity of interests and sticks heavily to a formula where night-time television is dominated by imported drama or infotainment series, sport and glorified home videos, such as the hugely successful program on home improvements. This, to the Prime Minister, is a broad range.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One can understand his enthusiasm for offering the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> to Kerry Packer on a platter, because the Prime Minister has no taste for the critical commentary found in the columns of both papers. He is not Robinson Crusoe in that. Every Prime Minister is hypersensitive to criticism and satire, but I think it is something that should be encouraged. Thomas Jefferson wrote in a letter in 1787:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5024"> government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I basically agree. GTV9's news on Monday, 26 May perhaps illustrates the broader range of commercial television which the Prime Minister commends. This was the day when the Australian Reconciliation Convention was opened in Melbourne. The first item on the news was the recent accident involving Mr Sam Newman, a Channel 9 sports luminary. The Reconciliation Convention, involving the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), ranked as the sixth item.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister might well concede that this shows the benefit of competition: without competitive pressure, Channel 9 might otherwise have decided to ignore the convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How extraordinary that the Prime Minister should be intervening in the affairs of John Fairfax Ltd, talking it down, warning of instability&mdash;which turns out to be news to the board and to its chairman, Sir Laurence Street&mdash;and retailing the pure, unvarnished Packer line, because there is direct political self-interest involved! In sharp contrast, he refuses to take strong action with BHP over the proposed steelworks closure in Newcastle. Unlike John Fairfax Ltd, this is apparently just another commercial decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I pointed out in last year's budget speech, CSIRO appeared to do well. The Treasurer said then, `The government will provide another $115 million in the budget over the next four years.' In the 1997-98 budget, CSIRO's new allocation rises from $471.1 million to $439.4 million, an increase of 5.3 per cent. Good news? Well, not quite. What the budget documents failed to mention&mdash;a regrettable oversight&mdash;is that CSIRO suffers from the impact of increased efficiency dividends&mdash;based on the fallacy that the pursuit of knowledge is a fixed or finite target, like building a bridge&mdash;and a requirement to repay asset sales.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Governor&hyphen;General appears to be on the government hit list for what seems to be the appalling misjudgment of making calls for national unity and justice&mdash;not items that appear to be conspicuously high on the government's priorities. Referring to the scandal of Aboriginal health was seen to be in the worst of taste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The drip method of leaking has been used against him, as it was with his former High Court colleague, Sir Ronald Wilson, Chairman of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. In my 25 years as a member of parliament&mdash;five in Victoria and just on 20 years in Canberra&mdash;I have never seen parliamentary institutions subjected to so much sustained attack. Many of the wounds are self&hyphen;inflicted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a major confusion between democracy and populism which, if continued, could be a threat to the spirit of democracy and to the whole political process. Just as the `Joh for Prime Minister' phenomenon in 1987&mdash;which actually damaged the present Prime Minister very badly&mdash;caused great but temporary damage to the political process and then disappeared as the mirage that it was, one might hope that this might be true of contemporary phenomena.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say something about the current controversy about Aborigines&mdash;the question of a national apology and, of course, the report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS>. David Marr, in a very passionate piece in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> last Saturday, 31 May 1997, made the penetrating comment that perhaps we were congratulating ourselves too much on the passage of the 1967 referendum. Australians, he thought, were pretty good at cheap gestures, actions 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5025"> that did not cost anything but made us feel very good, that did not actually alter power relationships at all. As he said of the referendum campaign in 1967, the aim was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to bring back black Australians into the Federation. But what followed&mdash;land rights, black health, justice for Aborigines&mdash;cost white Australia money and a little land. These programs were contested all the way. The politics was tough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet for much of the 30 years since the referendum, a decent compact operated in Canberra not to take party political advantage of the persistent racism that both sides of politics know is out there. All their polling tells them this. We're celebrating the anniversary of the referendum with that old compact in tatters. The Howard Government boasts this achievement as the end of "political correctness".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I want to quote, very briefly, something from the report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS> , and I want to draw attention to the controversy that has been written about whether the use of the term `genocide' might be appropriate. I notice a number of people thundering away in letters to newspapers, but I think it is worthwhile just reading this part from page 271 of the report. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Genocide does not necessarily mean the immediate physical destruction of a group or nation. The Polish jurist Raphael Lemkin was the author of the term and the major proponent of the United Nations Convention. He defined `genocide' as `a coordinated plan of different actions aimed at the destruction of the essential foundations of the life of national groups, with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The objectives of such a coordinated plan would be `the disintegration of the political and social institutions, of culture, language, national feelings, religion, and the economic existence of national groups and the destruction of the personal security, liberty, health, dignity, and even the lives of the individuals belonging to such groups'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Does that sound familiar? The quote continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lemkin defined genocide to include `deliberate separation of families for depopulation purposes subordinated to the criminal intent to destroy or to cripple permanently a human group'. Genocide, he said, typically comprises two phases: the destruction of the cultural and social life of the `oppressed group' and the imposition of the national pattern of the `oppressor'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If we make the distinction, a very striking distinction, between what we might describe as slow genocide and rapid genocide, we would have to say it is not the genocide that we are familiar with in the period from 1943 to 1945 in Europe with the annihilation of the Jews and some other minorities, but I must say that the Lemkin definition does sound to me to be pretty accurate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that I felt more disturbed about as a member of parliament&mdash;even more disturbing than some of the noises off from the northern part of the continent&mdash;has been the way in which the drip method has been employed against this report, a very deliberate and a very familiar attempt which people on both sides would be aware of, to poison the waterhole. That attempt was made so that when the document comes down, people could say, `Oh well, you can dismiss that out of hand. The people involved in it actually have an emotional feeling related to it. You couldn't take anyone seriously who felt emotionally about it. It was headed by a former High Court judge who gave up his job on the court and devoted himself to the cause of human rights.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Watch this space! The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has had its budget very savagely cut in this budget and I notice that the term of the chairman expires on 30 June.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Howard government's second budget is good news for the 130,000 residents of Lindsay. It reinforces the fair but necessary measures announced in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget that set about restoring Australia's financial affairs after the parlous state in which we found them on 2 March 1996.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5026">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Keating government's legacy to the electors of Lindsay was a $10.3 billion deficit. It was a disgraceful performance of mismanagement and wasted opportunity. With the recession we had to have in 1991 the Labor government spent $11,493 million more than it took in revenue. In 1992, they spent $17 billion more than they actually took in in revenue. In 1993&hyphen;94, another $17 billion was spent over and above revenue. That was paid for from assets sales and loans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To get an idea of what $17 billion means to the average person in the Lindsay electorate, it would take a person on $30,000 a year 566,666 years to pay it off&mdash;and that is if they worked from the day they were born to the day they died. In other words, it would take 7,762 lifetimes to pay off a $17 billion debt. And the Keating government clocked that up in one year! The zeros that wander around this building have struck me, in the short time that I have been here, as scandalous and I am determined to see Australia back in the black before I leave this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994, $13 billion more was spent than was taken in revenue; in 1995, another $10 billion. Last year, under our 1996&hyphen;97 budget, that deficit was reined back to $6.8 billion. This year, with this budget, it will be reined back to $3.8 billion. By the following year, we will be $1.5 billion in the black&mdash;for the first time in 10 years. That is an incredibly significant achievement for one term in office. It has taken the Liberal government one term to turn around the finances of Australia from a $10 billion hole to a surplus of nearly $2 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How was that deficit racked up? It was racked up by toadying to union movements and minority and vested interest groups. Labor's arrogance and extravagance had no end. It was basically a matter of, `We won't consult you, we won't listen to you. Don't you worry about that&mdash;we know what is good for you. Here it is, you'll love it.' The people of Lindsay did not love it. It was very obvious on 2 March, and abundantly clear by 19 October, that the people of Lindsay had had enough of Labor's spendthrift ways with their money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear to me when I leave Canberra. I drive all the way up the Hume Highway, turn down the northern road into Penrith and there, in the roads, we know where the taxpayer's dollar is going. Thankfully, with our charter of budget honesty, it cannot happen again. The  figures for 1996, 1997 and 1998 show that Australia has a bright future and that this government will turn our finances to surplus after just one term in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we are not here for one term; we are here for a long term. Our policies, as announced in this budget and others, are showing a direction for the next 10 or 15 years. We are making long&hyphen;term plans. We do not intend to make plans from budget to budget, or from term to term, or election to election. We are settling into a very long and stable period of government, which the electors of Australia desperately need. There is one key statement in the Treasurer's budget speech that I wish to reiterate today because it is the one that hardworking people in the electorate of Lindsay, and indeed all over Australia, fully appreciate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the forthcoming year, the government has no net borrowing requirement. In fact, for the first time in nearly a decade, this year the government will not run up a debt because the underlying budget deficit is made up from asset sales such as the one&hyphen;third sale of Telstra. In the coming financial year we will repay it. We will repay over $5 billion of debt. That is a significant turnaround and a significant meeting of the trust of the electors of Lindsay. Any further sales will retire debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is unlike Labor, which came to government on a platform of non&hyphen;privatisation, huge 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5027"> government industry and huge government involvement in service provision and in industry. Then, when the crunch came and they could not meet their bills, `Let's sell the farm. And let's not sell the farm to pay off debt or to recover from recession, let's sell the farm to spend more money that we don't have, so our future generations can have an even bigger debt to pay off.' I am afraid the logic just did not gel with the electors of Lindsay who, on $30,000 a year, are trying to pay off a mortgage and get three kids through school and give their spouse an option, or choice, of workplace or home based activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to save; there is absolutely no doubt about that. If your government is not saving, what incentive is there for you to do that either? Herein lies the terrific incentive in this budget, which is a 15 per cent tax rebate on savings. It is an incentive. The idea is that now that it is available, people will actually take that measure of saving, something they have not done in years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Lindsay are pretty fed up and tired of putting their money in the bank and then seeing any interest they get go in tax, bank charges, fees, transaction costs, government FID and BAD. There is very little incentive for people to save and it is imperative that they do. They save for their retirement, they save for their children's future, and they save to provide a capital base within this country that we can invest with so that we do not have to keep on going offshore for foreign investment or foreign government loans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget measures announced by the Treasurer on 13 May lock in interest rate reductions that have been delivered since this government was elected. For the average person in Lindsay with an average mortgage, their mortgage interest rates have come down $240 a month; that is $60 a week for the average mortgage payer. That $60 a week is an enormous benefit straight away, cash in hand, to the voters of Lindsay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to discriminate between that and the incentives given by Labor. Labor gives such wonderful incentives as the $50 cash&hyphen;back. For each child going to school&mdash;regardless of whether they attend Barker College on the North Shore and get driven to school in a Bentley&mdash;you will get $50 back. But for the kids out in Lindsay they get $50 back and, guess what? Their parents had to pay the tax so government could then administer it, put it into the schooling system, which is not funded anyway, to deliver these services, and then give them  $50 back. If you add it up, Mr Deputy Speaker, they probably taxed them 70 bucks to give them the $50 cash&hyphen;back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our cash&hyphen;backs are based on the fact that we do not take it from you. You get a 15 per cent reduction on interest on your savings. You get rebates back on your private health insurance. You get rebates back where the government does not actually take the money; you do not pay the tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The families of Lindsay are predominantly young and hardworking, with a determination to succeed on their own. They are not the sort of people who expect government handouts. They can do it on their own. If the government just leaves them with enough cash at the end of the week to get ahead, they are quite happy to make it alone. They have responded to the fact that the federal government keeps its commitments&mdash;unlike the former Labor government, which kept its l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w promise, or maybe its promise on the M4 tollway! That was a classic Labor promise! In fact, when they delivered on it, only 21,000 motorists of the 1.8 million people who live in western Sydney actually accessed that rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Lindsay respond to the notion of less government interference in their lives. They respond to the fact that this federal government is prepared to live within its means. They 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5028"> are reassured by the fact that taxpayers' funds will be spent wisely&mdash;with consideration for those less fortunate in society&mdash;and, most importantly, spent fairly&mdash;on a needs basis, taking those most disadvantaged first. Middle class welfare and access to aged care when people can afford to pay for it themselves are things of the past. We have to do it tough over these three years. We have to pay for a lot of mistakes that Labor made. We are doing it tough; we are making all the tough and fair decisions. The people of Lindsay are confident of their future and their children's future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the first time ever, this government has introduced legislation to maintain the pension at 25 per cent of the male total average weekly earnings. This reinforces the government's commitment to maintain the income of aged pensioners. It will be going up with the CPI. This is unlike the Keating government policy, which introduced a sales tax between 1993 and 1996. In fact, the revenue collected from sales tax by the former federal government between 1993 and 1996 went up by 40 per cent. That was coming out of the pensioners' funds when they trundled along to the supermarket to buy their goods. If the basket of weekly shopping goes up by $10 per week, that has a major impact on a pensioner. They cannot afford that. This measure has frozen all tax rates; they are not going up. And guess what? You actually really do get an increase in your average weekly wage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the deferred pension bonus plan, people can actually work past the age of 65. They can work to the age of 70, which again gives people a choice. You are not mandated by government that, at 65 years of age, you are totally useless and are to get out of the work force. It does not compete with people of 18 years of age in the youth market, because generally somebody at the end of their working life is not really after the type of job which someone just starting out is applying for. As long as they can continue in gainful employment for 25 hours per week for five years, they can retain their activity in the community and can contribute and pick up a nice bonus at the age of 70. This is another example of the government providing options for individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Carers also receive a significant boost in this year's budget. The rate of the domiciliary nursing care benefit will be aligned with the child disability allowance from 1 July 1998. This increases the rate of the benefit payable by over 25 per cent. It provides carers who care for  loved ones in home based care rather than nursing care with an extra $16.60 per fortnight. That may not seem much to members opposite, but it sure makes a difference to the electors of Lindsay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Funding of more than $54 million over four years will be provided under the Commonwealth&hyphen;state disability agreement. This will allow 500 additional families to access personal care and accommodation support for a person with severe or profound disabilities. People with disabilities have been sorely neglected under Labor, and those wrongs are being redressed in this budget and in future initiatives under this government. It is not something that we can remedy overnight, because there is just not the money to do it, but it is there on the agenda. We plan on 10 to 15 years in government, and those things are in train to look after the most disadvantaged in our society, regardless of race, religion, ethnic background or any other distinction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the vision of the Howard government which is inspiring people today and giving a lot more confidence; the dynamism, the futuristic compassion, trustworthiness, patience&mdash;a lot of things we did not hear for a long time under Labor. All we heard under Labor was arrogance, toady, tired, lacking in ideas, ideologues, locked in. Suddenly we have a fresh, new 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5029"> approach&mdash;people who are not bound by previous statements and who do not say, `We have to do it this way because we always did it this way.' We have a fresh bunch of new ideas, we have got some visionaries and some futuristic people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's child&hyphen;care policy is based on equity and choice. Women at work, in training or seeking work get priority in child&hyphen;care assistance. Tens of thousands of new places have been funded for child care and, whether they are private or community based child&hyphen;care services, they are all being supported. A tremendous diversity and choice is becoming available in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the environment, we have the Natural Heritage Trust Fund. We expect $1.25 billion to be available this year, of which $1 million has already been set aside on a grant of trust so that it will come to the Hawkesbury&hyphen;Nepean river system. That river system is one of the jewels in the crown of the electorate of Lindsay. It is a fantastic rowing venue. It is a training venue for the Olympics coming up in the year 2000. It has tremendous potential for future tourism for Penrith. However, the extent of river nutrients in the area and the number of exotic plants and other aquatic plant species are damaging the viability of the river system. It is close to one of the biggest cities in Australia and up the river is one of the major water sources for the city of Sydney. It is an important environmental feature that does need funding and assistance to maintain viability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The $1 million, and probably more, has already been given in terms of a number of projects put forward from the community. The people of Lindsay have said, `Listen, I want to be involved too. I care to go down to my backyard and do some landcare projects, and do something for South Creek, for Werrington Creek, for Mulgoa Creek,' which are all tributaries into the Nepean River in my area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opportunities for our region to participate in the 2000 Olympics are also going to be enhanced by the overall economic strength of this budget. Small businesses are well placed to create opportunities to cater for the demands of overseas visitors at this major sporting event. We are already implementing the Greater West Sydney Games as an initiative to get small businesses involved and focused on the potential for that event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With low interest rates&mdash;and if we hold them there, and if we stop a wages explosion and allow growth to keep interest rates down&mdash;small business has a chance to just breathe. Unfortunately, it has appeared for the last 12 months as if we have been doing CPR on something that Labor had killed off five years ago. Luckily, there is a spark of life and we are bringing things back to a good healthy future for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have previously informed the House of the Greater West Sydney Task Force, which is a group of members of this House&mdash;the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron), the member for Macarthur (Mr Fahey) and the member for Macquarie (Mr Bartlett)&mdash;who are getting together to coordinate the development of the area of western Sydney. The task force will certainly be putting forward projects for the Federation Fund which will greatly enhance our region, which has been sorely neglected under Labor&mdash;as can be seen by Bob Carr's attitude to it, by Keating's attitude to it and by the previous member for Lindsay's attitude to it. Finally, the people of Lindsay have a member who is part of a government that is prepared to do something for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the appropriation bill to the House. It has taken the determination of the coalition government to steer a path that assists those in need in our communities, that reduces the impost of government and reverses the years of Labor waste and mismanagement. It is a good
