<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address my remarks to two appropriations in particular. The first of those concerns the government's plan to construct Sydney's second international airport at Holsworthy, a subject which would interest the member for Hughes (Mrs Vale)&mdash;in fact she is so excited she has had to take a seat at the mere mention of Holsworthy international airport in her electorate. The second issue is the government's plans for deregulation in the petrol industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Holsworthy airport has been the major controversy in my electorate and, indeed, throughout the suburbs of the south&hyphen;west of Sydney. I think the original community reaction was one of disbelief&mdash;the idea that, having gone through such an extensive airport debate in Sydney for some 18 months without any mention of a Holsworthy proposition by the coalition, straight after the election it would be on the drawing board. Residents could not believe the deceit and the way in which they had been misled by the coalition with its extensive promises about airports. Thereafter, disbelief has mobilised itself into protests and agitation. An extensive campaign is being launched against the airport and the government's folly in trying to site it at Holsworthy, so close to large residential areas in the south&hyphen;west.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to praise the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Macarthur Chronicle</EMPHASIS> newspaper, which covers a large part of my 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> electorate and also the seat of Macarthur, for its active support of local residents in their opposition to this crazy airport scheme. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Macarthur Chronicle</EMPHASIS> launched a phone-in inviting local residents to make known their protest, and the newspaper has asked me to table in the parliament the more than 500 responses that came from residents voicing their opposition to Holsworthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also wish to praise, while I am mentioning the depth and strength of community opposition, the work of the South&hyphen;West Sydney Community Alliance, in particular its chairperson, Mr Jim McGoldrick, and all the volunteer workers who have done so much to contribute to this campaign, and also the Campbelltown Anti&hyphen;Airport Committee in my electorate, headed by Mr Leon Warren and all its volunteers who letterbox, hand out at local railway stations and organise community meetings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose there is a feeling in some parts of the community: `This is such a bad proposition, it couldn't possibly happen.' People are tending to disbelief with regard to the ultimate proposition of Holsworthy airport, but other residents know that the government would not have this on the agenda unless it was a serious proposition and they have been able to mobilise a huge swag of public opposition to Holsworthy. That opposition is well voiced by the phone&hyphen;in to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Macarthur Chronicle</EMPHASIS> newspaper and the transcript, which I have here, of more than 500 residents ringing in to voice their opposition to the airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said often that he wants to listen to middle Australia. I can take just a small portion, a representative portion, of the airport hotline remarks to convey to the Prime Minister and also to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) the extent of opposition to this plan. This is what middle Australia in my electorate and also in the seat of Hughes and in the electorate of Macarthur is saying about the government's plan for Holsworthy. Wayne Steveson of Ingleburn rang into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Macarthur Chronicle</EMPHASIS> hotline and said:</PARA>

These local papers have a valuable role in voicing community opposition on major issues, and I am very pleased to accept the invitation of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Macarthur Chronicle</EMPHASIS>  newspaper to raise this matter in parliament on their behalf, to seek to table the transcript and to convey to Mr Howard and Mr Sharp the sorts of views that are being expressed throughout the electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the second issue I wanted to raise: the government's plan for the deregula 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion of the petrol industry.When the federal government talks about terminal access it only means physical access&mdash;the right to purchase wholesale petrol but on terms and conditions dictated by the oil majors. The Trade Practices Act needs to be amended to entrench competitive price access into the laws of the Commonwealth. This would apply the same market principles which the oil majors apply to themselves through the horizontal sharing of terminal facilities. This is the great irony of the current market structure&mdash;petrol purchased from a BP franchise might actually have been supplied by a Shell terminal. The majors are willing to lower their costs by sharing terminal products between themselves but they will not allow the retail sector to lower its costs through competitive wholesale pricing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Downstream access more than ever is essential to fair competition in the petrol retail sector. Woolworths is  presently establishing itself as another vertically integrated major with access to cheap wholesale petrol. Predictably enough it has also established horizontal alliances with the other majors. Unless branded and franchised stations can also access cheaper wholesale petrol they face closure at the hands of Woolworths. The federal government, despite all its election promises, has endorsed the closure of 3,000 service station small businesses with the subsequent loss of some 15,000 jobs in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This rationalisation should not proceed on such an unlevel playing field. This is the purpose of establishing downstream access. Small petrol retailers will not need the resources of a Woolworths and have to establish their own terminal infrastructure to competitively access wholesale petrol. Existing service stations in country towns will have the same terminal access rights as any new competitor. The Senate is considering an amendment this morning which would deliver this legal access right and the basic principles of fair competition for Australia's petrol industry. Those amendments sponsored by the Labor Party in the Senate would shift market power from the large oil multinationals to the small business retail sector and consumers. It 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="873"> is by far the best way for this parliament to deliver cheaper petrol prices to Australian motorists, farmers and businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Three days ago I mentioned how these reforms have the potential to lower petrol prices by up to 6c a litre. It is now possible to quantify the benefits beyond the per litre rate. In fact they can be quantified to the extent of $1 billion per annum. That is the cost of the vertically integrated nature of the petrol industry in Australia&mdash;$1 billion that sits in the coffers of the big petrol companies. By breaking up the vertically integrated control of the industry, that $1 billion surplus would effectively transfer to the pockets of Australian motorists, farmers, tourism operators and industry throughout the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is how that $1 billion calculation is arrived at. Each year in Australia motorists purchase approximately 18 billion litres of petrol. Of that, some 75 per cent is sold through franchised service station outlets. The wholesale price of fuel to those franchisees is controlled by the setting of the maximum endorsed wholesale price by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Included in the MEWP is an allowance to the major oil companies of 7.1c per litre for marketing. Freight costs are also set by the ACCC. Franchise service station operators are prohibited from sourcing fuel from other than franchisor oil companies. Franchisees are always charged the highest wholesale price for fuel simply because they are a captive market. That wholesale price is then reflected in the retail price charged to motorists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the wholesale price capping the companies are allowed no more than 7.1c per litre for marketing. The companies are not required to demonstrate that this amount, which equates to more than $1 billion, is expended. Ironically, the companies have long sought to increase the amount but it has been contained under price surveillance to that level. However, in the absence of the wholesale price cap companies would seek to and would in practice secure more than 7.1c per litre through the market. The means of the oil companies achieving this would be through the exclusive supply ties that they have with their franchisees. That is, the wholesale price 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to franchisees would rise and they would in the absence of being able to source fuel elsewhere have to pass that cost on to motorists. This 7.1c per litre is in effect the cost of vertical integration within the fuel industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, the difference between the Woolworths buy price and that of the major oil companies is approximately 8 to 9c per litre. Woolworths' capacity to buy fuel that much cheaper is therefore evidence of the low cost operation of that company. As to the cost of the vertical integration and the tied arrangements in the petroleum industry, that cost might be calculated as follows: eighteen billion litres of fuel are sold to motorists each year; of that, 75 per cent is sold by franchisees&mdash;the equivalent of 13.5 billion litres per annum. Oil companies are allowed 7.1c per litre plus freight, so assume an average of 8c per litre excess wholesale price allowance to oil majors&mdash;that is, 8c per litre of petrol sold through the pump. The total cost to motorists is $1.08 billion per annum, and that goes to the major petrol companies through the vertical integration and control of this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It should be noted further that BP, Shell and Mobil are all foreign owned companies. Australian Petroleum Pty Ltd, while majority Australian owned, is approximately 37.5 per cent foreign owned. Therefore the $1.08 billion vertical integration dividend to the oil companies is not being returned in the main to investors in Australia. Virtually all the profits generated from that dividend are being remitted to head offices overseas, with a consequent impact on our balance of payments. So there is no doubt that major benefits will flow to motorists and petrol consumers throughout Australia from breaking up the vertical integration of this industry&mdash;from in fact establishing a downstream access regime. I hope that that is the result of the Senate deliberations this morning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to ALP price watch and some of the remarks that have been made regarding our campaign by the Ampol company in particular. Ampol has made a number of claims in the media in recent times which need to be challenged and exposed by this parliament. For instance, it has held out 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="874"> terminal access as one of the reforms in which it is engaged but in fact it is offering terminal access for new customers only. Old customers do not get that access right. In practice it has little meaning indeed. Ampol also promised not to increase its prices through the Australia Day long weekend  but I noted a shabby practice&mdash;a swindle on farmers&mdash;in the Young district of New South Wales. While Ampol may have maintained their wholesale price at the midweek level they engaged in a practice in the Young district which should be investigated by the ACCC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Farmers in the Young district, Australia's biggest cherry growing region, in the middle of their harvesting, were being charged more than 80c a litre by Ampol&hyphen;Caltex for property delivered super petrol while the service station price remained at 77c. Normally the delivery price would be well below the pump price due to bulk purchases that farmers make. Ampol&hyphen;Caltex was also charging 2c a litre more than the market price for diesel fuel. It is perhaps more than coincidental that the price hike by Ampol&hyphen;Caltex came at a time when farmers in the Young district needed to consume large amounts of fuel at the peak of the cherry season. Independent fuel distributors explained the increase by pointing to the way in which Ampol subsidised service stations in country towns where Woolworths has started to compete at the pump but then, at the same time, increased the home delivery price to restore its profit margin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a worrying trend. If the oil majors are to compete against Woolworths in country towns by slugging farmers by increasing the home delivery price on petrol as an effective cross&hyphen;subsidisation of their pump price, then that is a practice which needs to be halted. Why should farmers, at the peak of their season, be penalised for the fact that there is a new competitor&mdash;Woolworths&mdash;in the town petrol market? This is matter that National Party members opposite, instead of engaging in chitchat, should be doing something about. It is a shameful thing.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the Australia Day long weekend just passed. You were in government last Australia Day long weekend and you should be aware, as someone who prides himself on being a National Party member, that farmers in the Young district were paying prices 3c and 4c more expensive for home delivered petrol than at the pump in town. Here they are, buying in bulk, and paying more for that practice. This is a business practice engaged in by Ampol, and perhaps other oil majors, which must be halted. Farmers should not be penalised for the fact that Woolworths might be competing at the pump in country towns. Ampol, clearly, was cross&hyphen;subsidising its town pump price by charging farmers more for their home delivery. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have not heard a word or a peep out of the National Party regarding that practice. Where is the self-styled spokesperson, the member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran)? He says a lot of things about petrol, but he is normally apologising for the big petrol companies instead of standing up for the consumer rights of farmers and other primary producers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to Ampol's claim to transparency with its fuel prices. It has made a great deal in the public arena of the fact that it is placing its fuel prices on the Internet. Let me explain some of the facts in practice. On Friday, 24 January the average monthly prices posted on the Internet by Ampol were for the month of November 1996, some two months earlier. Thus those prices bear no relation to current retail prices, irrespective of what Ampol may imply it posts on the Internet. There is no transparency. There is no relevance in putting prices on the Internet that are dated by seven to eight weeks. Ampol posts on the Internet average monthly prices for city and country for each state, for the Northern Territory and for the ACT. These prices are average prices for all Ampol&hyphen;Caltex sites for a whole month, after the event. These prices are not present retail prices or dealer buying prices on offer; they are historical prices of no relevance or practical use to consumers making a market judgment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ampol does not post on the Internet actual retail or real wholesale prices at its sites on a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="875"> daily or other fluctuating basis. All it does is list daily a single national wholesale price which may bear no relationship to transacted prices. These price averages do not reflect the price&hyphen;volume relationships and very low price&hyphen;volume sales locations artificially reduce the more prevailing widespread prices. These posted after&hyphen;the&hyphen;event average wholesale prices do not equate to actual retail or wholesale prices experienced by consumers and retailers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the price list may not equate to any other dealer's buying price because of the way in which Ampol's market area pricing system operates. Under this system, an individual dealer's buying price is determined according to prices set by Ampol nominated reference sites in the vicinity of the Ampol dealer. However, the composition of the pool of reference sites is subject to change without reason and does not necessarily include all of the sites in the vicinity of the dealer. Thus a market leader, such as Liberty or Burmah, may not be included and the Ampol dealer may find himself at a competitive disadvantage compared to those sites.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the other oil companies, the point that retailers constantly make about rebates or price support is that these are paid retrospectively, usually a month or more in arrears. Retailers must pay the full listed wholesale price on the day that they purchase their fuel from the company and then claim the rebate at a later date. Thus, by the application of retrospective rebates, companies can affect the outcome averages for their prices, notwithstanding that consumers may actually have paid more than the average would suggest. In the case of Ampol and Caltex dealers, a retrospective rebate is not paid. Buying prices are determined by the MAP system, which may still mean that any one dealer's buying price is not competitive or reflective of average prices quoted after the event by Ampol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For Ampol to say that it does not have equity in particular distributorships does not mean that it has no control over the distributor's buying price. Just as Ampol's retailers have a MAP system, so do its distributors. The nominated reference pool of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> depots for distributors' prices is  subject to change without notice or reason and may not include all the distributor's competitors. Thus, while Ampol's list price may not change over a specified period, the distributor's MAP buying price may well change. To that extent, Ampol clearly has the central control over such prices in that it determines profitability of distributors and, through this part of the price mechanism, the prices themselves. Petrol prices in Melbourne during December and January&mdash;something you would be interested in, Mr Speaker&mdash;showed that, for much of that time, dealers were actually operating on an average negative margin and were to receive after&hyphen;the&hyphen;event rebates. To that extent, their prices were clearly controlled by their suppliers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition's petrol price watch scheme will provide a much more reliable, comprehensive and truly reflective indication of retail petrol prices than that posted by Ampol on the Internet. Ampol's Internet adventure is no more than the application of modern technology to old pricing practices by which consumers are mystified and confused. They get no practical benefit from prices that are dated by some seven to eight weeks. What Ampol really needs to do is to allow its retailers access to fuel at the lowest price it sells at. What is the point of posting a historical and misleading average if the company will not sell fuel at that price in the current market circumstances?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of these issues in the petrol industry lean towards the technical and complex. They are very rarely dealt with in detail by the parliament. But I trust that, by explaining the way in which Ampol price transparency is effectively meaningless, by explaining the historical nature of the prices, by explaining the swindle that they placed on farmers in the Young district over the Australia Day long weekend and by explaining the limited access that they are offering to their terminals, the parliament might come to a better understanding of these petrol industry matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one golden rule in the petrol industry: if the oil majors, the big petrol companies, make a claim in the public arena, check it out. Do not allow the complex nature 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="876"> of this industry and the pricing system they have established to act as a barrier to establishing the facts and the true nature of this industry. It is vertically integrated in its ownership and control, and only downstream access can produce major benefits for consumers. Those benefits, as I have quantified, come to more than $1 billion per annum. It should equate to savings to motorists of the order of 6c per litre. These are major reforms which the parliament should support if we are to act in the public interest. With all the government's talk about small business, it needs to produce petrol reforms that do something other than deregulate in the interests of the big petrol companies. It needs a downstream access regime that assists the service station small business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by pointing out that those reforms also have the potential to substantially lower petrol prices throughout the country. I seek leave to table the transcript from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Macarthur Chronicle</EMPHASIS> hotline regarding the second Sydney airport proposal at Holsworthy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning I wish to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1996&hyphen;97 in so much as it deals with the payment of legal fees by the Commonwealth for the member for Fremantle, Carmen Lawrence. That section of the bill is a provision of $49,776 for legal costs incurred by or an account of acting for Dr Carmen Lawrence in relation to the Marks inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth going through the chronology of events that led to the Carmen Lawrence defence fund being established by the Australian Labor Party and the fact that the action has now been taken by the solicitors Dunhill Madden Butler against the Commonwealth for the payment of those legal fees. It is worth establishing the fact that the Labor Party set up the Carmen Lawrence defence fund for a number of reasons and that even up to this date in 1997 those legal fees are still unpaid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In June 1995, the cabinet decided, after some deliberation, to pay Minister Lawrence's legal costs. The then Attorney&hyphen;General, Michael Lavarch, announced on 20 June in that year that the government would intervene 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in an action to question the legality of the Marks Royal Commission in the High Court and that the Commonwealth would fund that challenge. On 21 June, the next day, the coalition indicated that they may not support the payment of Minister Lawrence's legal fees in their entirety, and from that point on the Commonwealth government at the time was on notice that there was a very real possibility that, in fact, the opposition and potentially the Democrats would not pay Minister Lawrence's legal fees for that section of the appeal to the High Court that dealt with the appointment of the Marks Royal Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, on 28 September in that year, the opposition announced that it would not support an appropriation for Minister Lawrence's legal fees, and Senator Spindler from the Australian Democrats confirmed, too, that he would insist on parliamentary approval for the payment of her legal costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A month later, on 26 October, the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) was tabled by the government in parliament regarding Minister Lawrence's $800,000 legal fees, and another month later, on 28 November, the parliament voted down the appropriation for $240,000 for challenging the legitimacy of the Marks Royal Commission in the High Court. The Australian Labor Party inevitably accepted the amendment because they realised that it would be defeated in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that time, the government was well aware that the parliament, the supreme law making body in the Commonwealth, was not prepared to make an appropriation available for the payment of Carmen Lawrence's legal fees. However, from that time various senior ministers&mdash;Carmen Lawrence, Gareth Evans and Kim Beazley&mdash;made many statements about the issue of Carmen Lawrence's legal fees. On 29 November, Carmen Lawrence said that the cabinet decided that the bill should be met. On the same day, Kim Beazley said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not our intention to fund that element of Mrs Lawrence's legal expenses by any other method than ultimately a recourse to parliament.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The question I am raising this morning is whether, in fact, at the time Minister Lawrence and Minister Beazley were well aware 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="877"> that, in fact, the Commonwealth may have committed themselves to paying the legal fees of Carmen Lawrence and that many of these statements were disingenuously made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It became more farcical as that month wore on, with Gareth Evans making statements like, `She could be faced with bankruptcy', in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. On 3 December, Mr Beazley was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Deputy Prime Minister Kim Beazley says it is imperative the Labor Party ensure that Carmen Lawrence is not bankrupted by having to pay legal fees arising  out of her court challenges to the Marks Royal Commission. Mr Beazley confirmed that Dr Lawrence would have to step down from parliament if she were made bankrupt.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then there is a quote from Mr Beazley:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We could not let that happen, absolutely.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And he said that the then Health Minister was a terrific political asset. Apart from whether Mr Beazley would repeat the assertion that she was a terrific political asset today, the fact remains that at that time it was quite possible&mdash;in fact, I am quite certain&mdash;that Mr Beazley, Mr Evans and Minister Lawrence were all aware that the cabinet had said that they would pay the legal fees for Dunhill Madden Butler and were probably aware that it may be the case that they would be forced to pay them regardless of anything that the parliament or anybody else decided. So the argument could be made that Minister Beazley and others were happy to circumvent the superiority of parliament over the cabinet in forcing payment of the legal fees of Carmen Lawrence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But two days later, after the statements about bankruptcy, on 5 December the Carmen Lawrence defence fund was established by Gary Gray, the general secretary of the Labor Party, with two other trustees. From that time, money flowed to the Carmen Lawrence defence fund from such luminaries as the former member for Bass, Silvia Smith, who will be remembered by members, and from many unsuspecting members of the public who were led to believe by the ministers of that government that Minister Lawrence was likely to face bankruptcy if the Carmen Lawrence defence fund was not established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure you can see the incongruity of the statements by the ministers as to the bankrpu 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tcy of the then minister, Carmen Lawrence. The Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund was established in great excitement and a plethora of, `We have to save Carmen Lawrence because she is imperilled by the wicked, evil former opposition'&mdash;which is now the government&mdash;and in the knowledge on their part that the cabinet had potentially committed themselves to paying those legal fees. The only absolute amount of money that we know has been paid into the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund was $100,000, which Joan Kirner confirmed in January or February 1996. Other media reports suggest that the amount is closer to $244,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, by 28 November 1995 the opposition had voted down the $240,000 component of Carmen Lawrence's legal fees associated with her challenge to the legitimacy of the Marks royal commission. From that moment, Labor figures such as Gareth Evans and Kim Beazley claimed that the opposition could drive Carmen Lawrence to bankruptcy. The Labor Party said they would not let that happen. On 5 December, the Labor Party established the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund, its trustees being Gary Gray, Joan Kirner and John Della Bosca. From 5 December, the ALP conducted a public campaign to raise money for the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Three questions therefore arise. Firstly, as the legal fees have not been paid to Dunhill Madden Butler, where are the proceeds of the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund? Are they sitting at Curtin House earning interest? If so, why haven't the legal fees been paid by the defence fund? Secondly, does the Labor Party expect that the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund will not have to pay the legal fees? In which case, has a fraud been perpetrated on those who donated to the fund believing they were doing so to stave off the potential bankruptcy of Carmen Lawrence? Thirdly, if the ALP expected that they would not have to pay, why were figures such as Gary Gray, Gareth Evans and Kim Beazley promoting the idea that Carmen Lawrence faced bankruptcy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's position is that the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund was established to pay the cost that parliament refused 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="878"> to pay and that the fund should be used for that purpose. As far as the government is aware, no payment has been made by the fund. The public and the donors to the fund may well ask why the fund has not been used. They may also ask about interest earned on that fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not intend to take up the time of the House at great length this morning but to simply put on the record some of these issues to do with the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund. This is the first opportunity we have had to do so in the parliament, and it arises because Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1996&hyphen;97 lists payments for legal fees for Carmen Lawrence's legal actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final questions one needs to ask about the current members of the opposition are: why did Kim Beazley and Gareth Evans whip up hysteria about Carmen Lawrence's alleged potential bankruptcy when they knew as cabinet ministers that the bills may have to be paid by the Commonwealth? Why did the ALP establish the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund when they believed that the Commonwealth was responsible for the legal costs? Was the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund a ruse designed to deflect attention from the issue of Carmen Lawrence's veracity and create sympathy for her? Even the trustees of the fund, as late as yesterday, confirmed that they believed the Commonwealth would not have to pay. Gary Gray, your general secretary, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the trustees have never assumed responsibility for paying the legal fees&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the trustees of the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">we have always believed they were properly incurred by the Commonwealth. We did endeavour to raise as much as we could.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So Mr Gray has confirmed that when the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund was established on 5 December 1995, the trustees of that fund believed that the Commonwealth was responsible for paying the legal fees. They then set out to conduct a public ruse that would raise vast sums of money from the public based on the idea that Carmen Lawrence faced potential bankruptcy when, in fact, she did not. Members of the public who 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> donated to the fund could be forgiven for being livid. They were led to believe that Carmen Lawrence was in danger of being bankrupted.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I stand here today after winning the Fraser by&hyphen;election on behalf of the Australian Labor Party. The people in my community of Belconnen, Gungahlin, Jervis Bay and Wreck Bay have bestowed upon me a very important responsibility to represent their interests in this national parliament. It is a responsibility which I take very seriously. I hope to, and will, do my utmost to represent their interests in this parliament. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="879">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My community has faced some very tough times recently. They have reflected their perception of those tough times in the vote expressed in the by&hyphen;election. I will touch on the by&hyphen;election results briefly. A number of prominent Liberals weighed into the by-election campaign, including people such as Gwen Wilcox, the former local Liberal president, Tony De Domenico and others. They supported a candidate, an Independent, Cheryl Hill, who described herself as a Liberal and an Independent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This by-election was about Liberal ideology versus Labor values. The community in this by-election rejected the by&hyphen;product of the conservative agenda. It expressed grave concern about where we are heading. People now feel less comfortable and relaxed than they ever have before. Labor received an eight per cent swing to it. The Independent Liberal almost halved her primary vote. Whilst in government Labor was criticised for not hearing the message sent to it from the Canberra by-election, I encourage the present government to listen to what the community is saying from the Fraser by-election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another pleasing outcome of the by-election was the performance of Ms Alice Chu, who was an Independent standing on a platform of racial tolerance and recognising the importance of a culturally diverse immigration program. Canberra is one of the most culturally diverse cities in the nation. Also in the by-election were two candidates standing on an anti-immigration platform. I am pleased to say that Ms Chu absolutely blitzed those candidates in the results of the by-election. Mainstream Australia has dispensed anti&hyphen;immigration politics to the toilet bowl. We hope that it remains there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other interesting facets of the by-election result was that the pro&hyphen;GST candidate polled extremely poorly. The electors have said yet again that they are not interested in this form of regressive taxation. The National Party leadership will be relieved to hear that the candidate supported by the shooters did not poll particularly well in the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have many people to thank for the good result in this by-election. Firstly, I would like 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to thank my father and mother, who are present today in the gallery, and my partner Kylie for their tremendous support. I thank campaign directors Rob Allen and Doug Thomson; the workers on the campaign, Joy Nicholls, Naomi Knight, Simon Banks, Shane Wells, Sue Robinson, Abraham Gubler, Larissa Stoljar and Robyn Nash; and my Labor colleagues Bob McMullan, Annette Ellis, Martin Ferguson, Nick Sherry, Carmen Lawrence and Jenny Macklin for their efforts in the campaign. A very special thanks goes to the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, who played a very significant part in the by-election campaign and was responsible in no small part for its success. I would also like to thank Gary Gray for his advice and support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I record my appreciation for the efforts of my predecessor John Langmore, whose integrity and commitment contributed to a better Australia. He left some fairly big shoes to fill. The reason I took on the challenge of seeking to fill them was the distress caused to me by the distress caused to my community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Little is known about Canberra by politicians, despite the fact that many politicians visit and partly live in the ACT, about this city. Conservatives perhaps often encourage Canberra bashing. It is a popular pastime outside this city. Many do not understand, for example, that Canberra has a larger private sector economy than public sector economy. Many do not understand the great potential of this city.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A commonly held belief about Canberra is that it was built because Sydney and Melbourne could not agree on where to house the nation's parliament. It is a misinformed view of Australia's history. The fact is that the states were uncomfortable about one state and one state only becoming the centre of the Australian universe. The concept of a national capital enabled Federation to take place where no one single state benefited beyond the others. I look forward to the day when the country's next Prime Minister will be in office and housed here once more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I return to the difficulties and troubles that my city is facing. We have lost over 5,000 jobs since the election of the new government. Almost half of them have been in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="880"> private sector. For three consecutive months last year&mdash;in August, September and October&mdash;youth unemployment reached 50 per cent and above in the ACT. The ACT has the highest youth unemployment of any state or territory in this country. Almost half of the job losses in the ACT have been in the private sector, as I have said. One leg of our economy, the public sector, has been chopped off at the knee, it is true. The other leg, the private sector, is falling off. We have had a 50 per cent increase in bankruptcies and a 50 per cent decrease in public sector job ads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The largest personal investment that ordinary Australians make is in their house. The value of homes in this town is falling. Analysts tell us where the problems come from. It is not surprising that even the very conservative economic think tank, Access Economics, has declared that Canberra is in recession. Reportage by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> of Access's statement is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACT has gone from a weak year to a rotten one as the full force of budget cuts to the public service take effect. The ACT is officially in recession. Output fell in the JUNE and SEPT quarters of 1996 and the private sector is feeling some of the public sector pain.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">BIS Shrapnel, not known precisely for its radical thought, also agrees. Frank Gelber, the chief economist, said to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>  in January that the big economic factor at work in the ACT was still the effect of the Howard government's 1996-97 budget. Mr Richardson, the director of Access Economics, predicts that at least another 3,000 public sector job cuts are yet to occur. That will mean 3,000 families without an income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is interesting in all this is that the private sector in the ACT has not picked up. The private sector in the ACT has not benefited from privatisation and contracting out. Information technology is a case in point. The big contracts coming out of job losses in IT in the public sector have not engaged jobs in the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Youth unemployment, as I mentioned, is the highest in the country. Unfortunately, it has not particularly been helped by the Green Corps. I think we have managed to get something like a dozen jobs out of the Green 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Corps in the ACT, but under Working Nation we had hundreds. With $4.3 billion slashed from education and training over the next four years I am afraid things will not get better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Funding cuts to higher education have hurt Canberra in a number of ways. In Canberra, higher education is a fairly significant industry. Many students come from outside the ACT to study here. We have had redundancies as a result of the funding cuts and consequently a reduction in the quality of training. The increase in HECS and the reduction in Austudy are discouraging students from taking on important courses like teaching and education. Cuts to skillshare, and privatising the delivery of skillshare, will hurt those people who cannot gain entry to higher education and cannot find employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to move now to health, which is another significant issue raised by electors in the by&hyphen;election. Labor has, and has always had, support for a universal health care system. We would like to guarantee that everyone has access to quality health care, not just the privileged. That is why Labor delivered the Medicare system. The people of Australia agree with us. They agreed with us in 1993 when the previous leader of the then opposition promised to slash Medicare. The current government at the election promised to keep it, but Medicare is under the scalpel and it is my view that it is suffering the death of a thousand cuts. Over four years, $3.4 billion is being carved off the federal health budget. You cannot slash health without delivering a body blow to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is sad to observe a drop in bulk&hyphen;billing. In the June quarter we had a figure of 80.8 per cent, followed by 80.6 per cent, followed by yet another drop to 80.5 per cent&mdash;the first time in five years that we have had a drop in bulk&hyphen;billing for two consecutive quarters. And what is the state of bulk&hyphen;billing in the ACT? It is less than 65 per cent, the lowest in the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Public dental care has been destroyed in my community. The scheme set up by Labor to improve public dental health and to shorten waiting lists has been dismantled. In my community, pensioners now have to pay up to $200 a year for public dental treatment, as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="881"> do kids. That is a big slug for people on low incomes. According to the local Liberals, waiting lists will blow out from six months back to the bad old days of two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cuts to the pharmaceutical benefit scheme are hurting. A constituent I talked with in the course of the by&hyphen;election campaign has the misfortune of suffering a very debilitating disorder. She tries to support her kids as best she can on her pension, but it is a tough struggle. From time to time she finds it difficult to pay for her medication, to pay for her pain&hyphen;killers, so sometimes she goes without. What kind of society are we becoming, if we have people in the community in pain because of cuts to health?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard considerable discussion in this chamber about nursing homes. A number of older people in my community, and in the community in general, have expressed grave concern about the prospect of having to jump through financial hoops in their twilight years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for child care, unfortunately we have seen community child&hyphen;care centres under a lot of pressure. They have been laying off workers as a result of that pressure, and this has caused a reduction in quality child&hyphen;care. That is no good for working men, and it is certainly no good for working women&mdash;and it is not particularly great for the kids themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industrial relations is another issue raised by people in the community. We have seen some fairly significant shifts in industrial relations. It is proposed to strip back a number of basic conditions such as training, study leave, disciplinary procedures, the provision of basic amenities such as tearooms, showers and lockers, and even something as simple as the provision of a notice board. They will all go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a recipe for confrontation and disputation of a more intense nature. The new law prohibits payment for periods of industrial action. This will force employees to take strike action when previously they may have only taken some bans or other small limitations. This law forces the parties to escalate their differences; it forces the parties to lock in to positions which are very difficult to get out of.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that responsible employers in Australia are not particularly interested in great confrontation. That is why they all jumped out of Jeff Kennett's system and ran to Labor's federal system. We saw Jeff get a bit petulant about that. He accused employers of wimping out on the ideology which he wanted to unleash on the industrial relations system, but the problem for some of the ideologues in the community is that business is there to do something. It is there to make money; it is not there to push wheelbarrows&mdash;and that is probably a good thing, too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that working Australia should work collectively, employers and employees together. The focus should be on productivity, not on confrontation. The focus should be on delivering a high wage, high quality and high value added economy. That should be our focus. The focus should not be on screwing down costs, on screwing down wages or on screwing down standards of living. We have seen that approach taken internationally, and it has failed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to unfair dismissals, I will briefly say that it is really more bureaucratic than it has ever been before. It requires employees to understand if their employer is a registered Australian corporation, if they work under a federal award and, if they are an employee of a territory or of the Commonwealth government, it requires the payment of a $50 lodgment fee, which is a pretty tough ask for someone who has just been sacked. It requires employees to sift through about 20 pages of forms, explanatory notes and applications for waivers, fees and so on to determine which path they are going to take in the dismissal process. Whilst the Liberals have preserved some of the protections that Labor implemented, some of the things that they complained about when in opposition, the outcome of the unfair dismissal changes has been a much more bureaucratic system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I would like to reflect upon a few differences, I suppose, that have engaged me and encouraged me to the Labor ranks. As I understand the Liberal ideology, it is one that supports the realisation of individuals' potential. Labor understands that no person is an island, that we live in a community; in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="882"> fact, partly we are defined by it. We know that an individual thrives if they are encouraged and are provided with opportunities. We know that individuals find it harder to thrive if they are kicked when they are down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that a society's success is measured in terms of how we treat the most powerless and what the standard of living for ordinary Australians is like. That is the measure of a society's success. The measure of a society's success is not the performance of society's most powerful. That is why Labor supports caring for sick people. That is why Labor supports training young people. That is why we support caring for aged people. That is why we support providing opportunities for unemployed people and people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my view that there is little to be gained from blaming the victims of social and economic dysfunction. There is little to be gained from things like dole diaries and work for the dole schemes, however they might be characterised. At the end of the day, what young people need and what people who are looking for work need is job opportunities. What people need when they are in the work force is a good quality and standard of living. That is the measure of our society's success, not how far we can screw down their standard of living and not how far profits can go up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My objective in parliament is to fight for a better future for my community, which is suffering under the brunt&mdash;it always has done, but it is suffering like it has never suffered before&mdash;of cuts to federal expenditure. My objective in parliament is to fight for a better future for my community and to encourage people to think about how we gauge the success of our efforts in this House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to congratulate the member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel), before the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) gets up there, and welcome him to the parliament. I hope that he has a long and fruitful career, although I believe his colleagues from the ACT may be worried about his career shortly because of the redistribution of seats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested in a number of things the member for Fraser had to say about the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the success of the community and what is a successful community, and so on, because I think he is pretty much atypical of what we have seen from the Labor Party in the last 12 months&mdash;that is, they are in a position of denial. They are in a period of denial. They deny the result of the March election last year; they deny public opinion at the moment; they deny that they have no policies; they deny everything about themselves. In fact, they believe their last 13 years in parliament was a period of greatness for Australia, when the opposite is true in that we met record levels of debt and record levels of unemployment. This is what we were faced with over the last 13 years. The Labor Party have yet to accept and acknowledge the fact that the community has given them the message; they have refused to accept that message.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Unemployment is a very serious issue in Australia, as the member for Fraser mentioned. Unemployment is a major concern and has been for some time. As I said in a speech yesterday, productivity is one of the reasons for unemployment in Australia because the more productive we become the less work we need to produce. Being more productive means less work, which means fewer jobs. As the member for Fraser mentioned, the importance of jobs for the community cannot be understated. This is a very important aspect of the entire nature of employment, and we should be considering some solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government took this approach: `Things will work out. We have an accord with the ACTU, accord 1, accord 2, accord 3, accord 4, accord 7.' Still we had no resolution to the unemployment problem. During the last three years, they came up with the Working Nation program to overcome the `idle nation' aspect of their policy. But Working Nation was glorified too much. There was an increase in the number of unemployed, and unemployment amongst our youth was at an all-time high. There are approximately 100,000 young people who are unemployed, including 30,000 who have been unemployed for six months or longer&mdash;mostly because of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="883"> the policies of the Labor Party whereby they reduced apprenticeships in Australia and forced people to stay on at school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I saw an advertisement the other day for a salesperson for a newspaper. It used to be a job that someone who left school could pick up. They were wanting someone who had a degree to become a telephone salesperson. A degree in what, I am not too sure. Jobs these days require a degree. You get a lot of vice-chancellors these days talking about whether universities are just producing people with a piece of paper and whether they should return to the education institutions they used to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raised an example of this in the last parliament when one of these programs was advertised in my electorate. It was called `fun in the sun'. This program was advertised as being desperate to find young people to spend six months of fun in the sun. The Royal Life Saving Society was conducting the program. The program was called an aquatic care program. This is what it was advertising:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To further your experiences, throughout the program, we will be taking time off for surfing, windsurfing, body boarding, canoeing, abseiling and a variety of other cultural experiences.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">According to the advertising pamphlet of this job program managed by the Labor Party, these cultural experiences will include fishing, sailing, powerboat driving, snorkelling, and pool and river care. I really have to question how many job opportunities there are in the community for abseilers, canoeists and wind surfers. They had a six&hyphen;month program to do all those things. Young people would, in fact, join this program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The constituent who came to me and raised this matter with me had a skin problem; he was very vulnerable to skin cancer. He went to the Labor Party programs employment people and said, `I can't do this program.' He was told that he should do it. `I can't,' he said, `because I suffer from skin cancer.' They said, `No, unless you do it, you will be taken off benefits.' So he was forced to go along. He did not do any sunbaking. He did try the windsurfing and the body boarding but he wore a full&hyphen;length shirt and a sunhat all the time. He said that he enjoyed the canoeing but was a bit upset by the abseiling. This 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> particular person who enjoyed that six months on the work program remains unemployed because he has not seen any jobs in the paper for abseilers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the sorts of programs that were around. They were false programs; they were not real programs. We had people going into these programs for six months, but the real reason for this was to hide the unemployment figures. Once you put these people into a work program, you take them off the unemployment figures. So when they were saying that we had a reduction in the long&hyphen;term unemployed, what was happening was that these young people were going into these sorts of programs. At the end of the six months when they could not get a job as an abseiler, they would have to go back on the unemployment figures. But they would not go as long-term unemployed; they would come back as new entries to the unemployment figures. The former government was able to manipulate the figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The results are&mdash;if I remember rightly some of the figures I have read&mdash;that about 45 per cent of the unemployed are young people. The importance of young people to this nation cannot be understated. We have a very important task to nurture our young people from the day of birth right through to their adult years, because they are the future of our country. They are the future decision makers, the future policy makers and the future leaders of our community. Unless we look after them and show them some hope in a future, what will our country end up being? If we provide no hope at all to our young people, what return will they give to our country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to pay particular attention to our young people in our policy making. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard), before being elected, guaranteed that young people's interests would be brought into the senior part of government when he was elected. Youth affairs policies are now being dealt with at the cabinet level rather than at the ministerial level. We on this side of the parliament take youth affairs very seriously. As I say, the youth are the future of our country. We have to consider that they should be participating in the community.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="884">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> One of the very serious concerns in the community at the moment is crime. I am sorry to report that there are some serious issues of crime within my own electorate of Cowan, and a lot of these are drug related, which must be a serious concern to all Australians. A recent report from Western Australia found that 89 per cent of juvenile detainees were drug users and that 47 per cent used drugs every day; 27 per cent used cannabis daily in 1992 and 58 per cent in 1995; 11 per cent used amphetamines daily in 1992 and 17 per cent in 1995. That shows that there has been an increase in drug usage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report goes on to say that one-third of the population has used cannabis&mdash;it does not say how many have actually done the drawback on cannabis but it does say they have actually used it. Ecstasy is an increasing element in our community and it has been found that seven per cent of the population are using ecstasy. Why are young people turning to drugs? Is it out of disillusionment, boredom or lack of opportunity? Perhaps it is. We need to start thinking about some issues regarding young people and start seeking some solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One solution that we as a government have determined is to give young people a chance. There has been a lot of discussion about this working for the dole scheme. In my view we are coming at working for the dole&mdash;unemployment benefits&mdash;in the wrong way. In my view, we have to start looking at our terminology because there is no benefit at all in being unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) the other day said that he was out of work for three weeks. With the deepest respect for the member for Bradfield, I do not think three weeks is a long enough term to understand that there is no benefit in being unemployed. In my earlier days I have been out of work for over 12 months, and I can tell you that it is a debilitating experience to be unemployed. There was not the need to go on the unemployment benefit at that time but, as I say, it is really not a benefit. I think we should be thinking about changing the terminology `working for the dole'. Perhaps we should be calling it a program of civil service, working 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for civics, community service or something like that&mdash;applying for civil service would be a good name for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As provided by the government, this work for the dole scheme will be a pilot of 20 to 30 projects in regional and rural areas with high levels of unemployment. It is expected that several thousand young people will work in the projects under these pilots. We will be able to test both voluntary and compulsory options at the pilot stage; that is, whether we wake make this compulsory or voluntary. We will seek submissions from local communities that wish to undertake projects involving partnerships with government, such as service bodies like Apex, Rotary or Lions which are very good community organisations; local businesses; local welfare groups like the Salvation Army, which does a great job in Cowan; and young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The program will focus on the community based projects that provide direct benefits for local communities and worthwhile work experience for young people. In the electorate of Cowan, this does not mean painting rocks but it might mean working in some of the urban bushland that we need to regenerate in our electorate&mdash;and we have a lot of it. There is very serious concern about regeneration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is expected that the projects will cover a wide range of areas, including tourism, the environment, restoration of buildings, community services and charity work. Does this charity work mean that, if some aged person is bedridden and cannot get down to the shopping centre to pick up some groceries, that might be part of it? I think that young people would find it very beneficial to be able to do that sort of work. That might be possible if it is part of this pilot scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work for the dole scheme&mdash;as I said, involving civil service or civic service&mdash;is not a labour market program or a job subsidy program. It is not a case of resurrecting the failed Working Nation programs because this may lead to real jobs, unlike the abseiling jobs I was talking about previously. While some projects may include a training element, the object is to instil the discipline of the workplace and help to break the cycle of unproductive activity and isolation many 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="885"> young people experience. Young people on this particular program will not displace other workers, which has been a concern of some commentators. Participants will be paid at the relevant award rate for their age. The hours they work per week will be calculated by dividing their unemployment benefits by the hourly award rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This scheme will be administered through the employment, education and training and youth affairs portfolio which, as I said before, is now in the cabinet. It will help instil a work ethic in young people, which is very important. I have a family member who has been out of work for three years, through no fault of his own. He has been constantly trying to get work. In fact, he works voluntarily for me and we have been trying to help him gain employment. He needs to get a work ethic. These sorts of programs will help people like him do that. He has recently been appointed to a bank, which is great news.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What sort of reaction have we had? There is an editorial in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> headed `Real Jobs', which says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister's proposal for about 30 work&hyphen;for&hyphen;the&hyphen;dole pilot projects for young people can do no harm if it is accompanied by a strict evaluation of their effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They are supportive so long as we have a measurable response. There was also a response from the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Bob Carr, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  on Tuesday, 11 February, which says he would:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`look sympathetically at any scheme that comes out of the Federal Government. I mean youth unemployment is a curse in our society and anything that provides a ray of hope and training and experience is going to be welcomed by us.'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Here is a Labor Premier&mdash;a futuristic Labor Premier judging by his comments there&mdash;who is looking forward rather than back. He is not in a state of denial as we have seen of those on the other side of the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald Sun</EMPHASIS> yesterday&mdash;a paper which is read by a lot of people in Melbourne: about 600,000&mdash;there are something like 25 young people all giving their views about working for the dole, this program of civil service. Most of them say it is a very good project. I will just pick out a couple of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them. Michael Carne, who is 18, from West Footscray says it is `a good idea'. Lena Li from Hawthorne says `I think it's pretty good'. Ivy Carver, 15, from Hawthorne says `It doesn't give you time to look for other jobs, so what's the point? I'm against it, but if I was desperate I would probably do it.' Aaron McMurray from East Melbourne says `It's a good idea because most people don't look for jobs. They should still be available for volunteer work and the hours flexible.' So there is a cross&hyphen;section of thought from young people in Melbourne; most of them agree with the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we have had some negatives. We have had the opposition spokesman on industrial relations, Mr Bob McMullan, saying that the proposal was half baked and meant young people would get nothing for their extra efforts and costs such as those associated with travel to work, work clothing and lunch at work. The opposition spokesman obviously wants us to go back to the Working Nation programs and for young people once more to go into the abseiling work program or the sunbaking work program or the canoeing work program. He would rather see a return to that. I think that is called denial of reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ms Jennie George from the ACTU said that Mr Howard's proposal would put the blame on the victims of unemployment rather than creating labour market programs that could assist the community. The ACTU should never speak about employment programs because they are one of the reasons why there is increased unemployment in our community at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Cowan, for instance, we are working hard to promote youth unemployment schemes. I recently opened a JPET scheme in Wanneroo in conjunction with the Wanneroo accommodation service. This is a program which is helping young people who are at risk. It is a highly worthwhile national program, which is being used as a pilot program in our area. Mr Andrew Hoare from that program, with whom I have worked closely on a number of programs&mdash;the most recent being a drug project that we put together for young people; not to use drugs, but to educate others about them&mdash;says that the program will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="886"> be very beneficial for the area and very helpful for young people at risk. He is fully supportive of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last four years we have had four young Aboriginal people working in our electorate office under a program, two of whom have moved on to government appointments. One is working for the Premier at this very stage. I have also had a number of young people working in my office on work experience, so much so that when school holidays come around these young people for some unknown reason want to spend their school holidays working in my office. Maybe it is the cups of tea or the biscuits we supply. They really enjoy coming in and getting access to computers and to work experience. I think that if they were getting paid by the government under an unemployment scheme and were able to get access to work experience that would be very helpful to them. Most of the people who have come to work for us in our office are now working elsewhere. It is a program that I am very confident will work so long as it gets the support of all those in the community who are concerned about young people. As I said before, young people are our future. We need to address their issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I started this particular speech I talked about the denial of the Labor Party. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) recently wrote in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> about the results of the state election in Western Australia, saying primarily that the opposition leader, Dr Gallop, is right on track, that the strategy they used in that election was correct and that `they're back'. Unfortunately, they are not back in government, they are still in opposition. Until they realise the reasons why they remain in opposition they will never come back.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This bill forms part of a complete package of legislation designed to give a legislative framework for the introduction of a superannuation contributions surcharge for high income earners. The other components of the legislative package which I will also introduce to the House today include: the Superan 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="887"> nuation Contributions Surcharge Imposition Bill 1997, the Termination Payments Surcharge (Assessment and Collection) Bill 1997, the Termination Payments Surcharge Imposition Bill 1997 and the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The superannuation system has been inequitably biased in favour of high income earners. Those high income earners have been benefiting from the concessional taxation treatment of superannuation to a much greater extent than low income earners. The introduction of the superannuation contributions surcharge for high income earners is this government's response to ensure that the superannuation system is more equitable for all Australians, while also ensuring that superannuation remains an attractive savings option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From budget night 1996 all employer and deductible personal superannuation contributions made by, or for, high income earners are now subject to a surcharge of up to 15 per cent. The surcharge applies only to contributions made after the budget announcement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The surcharge will be phased in over the income levels of $70,000 to $85,000, with the surcharge effectively increasing by 1 per cent for each additional $1,000 of income above the $70,000 threshold. The $70,000 and $85,000 thresholds will be indexed from 1997-98 to the increase in full&hyphen;time adult average weekly ordinary times earnings&mdash;AWOTE. This indexation is to ensure that low and middle income earners are not affected by the surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Income for the purposes of the surcharge is defined in the legislation to mean taxable income plus all employer and tax deductible personal superannuation contributions. Subject to data limitations, the retirement income modelling task force estimates that about 355,000 taxpayers will be affected by the surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Collection Mechanism</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Superannuation providers will be required to send to the Australian Taxation Office&mdash;ATO&mdash;details of contributions received in relation to each member. The reporting date will be 31 October each year. For the 1996-97 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> year the date is extended to 15 December 1997 to allow superannuation providers additional time to collect information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As members lodge their income tax returns, the ATO will match details of their taxable income with the information supplied by superannuation providers. Where, as a result of the level of a member's adjusted taxable income, a surcharge liability arises the ATO will assess the amount of surcharge and will periodically send assessments to the provider who holds the member's contributions. The superannuation provider will then debit the member's superannuation account with the surcharge liability and will remit that amount to the ATO within one month of the assessment. From 1998 an advance instalment of surcharge will be payable on 15 June. The advance instalment will be 50 per cent of the surcharge assessed in the previous year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Alternative measures of collecting the surcharge have been put to the government. The government has given careful consideration to those suggestions. The alternatives suggested all involve an unacceptable increase in compliance costs for employers, small business and all Australians. A number of these alternatives involve transferring the reporting obligation from superannuation funds to the significantly larger number of employers. The government believes this would represent a substantial increase in the compliance burden of small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Significantly, the administrative requirements on superannuation funds under the government's approach are essentially similar to the processes that superannuation funds already undertake as part of their normal business operations. Against this background the government has decided not to depart from the broad approach to collection of the surcharge outlined on budget night.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Unfunded Defined Benefits Schemes</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As unfunded defined benefits schemes are not funded until the benefit is paid, the surcharge cannot be collected from these schemes each year as the liability is assessed. Rather the surcharge liability is to be accumulated and will be payable at the time the affected member's benefit commences to be paid. To prevent unfunded defined benefits 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="888"> schemes being advantaged by this deferral of the surcharge, interest will be payable on the accumulated debt.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Financial Implications</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is estimated that the revenue impact of the package of surcharge legislation will be $434 million in 1997-98, $500 million in 1998-99 and $526 million in 1999-2000.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The bill amends the taxation laws to give effect to a number of 1996&hyphen;97 budget measures designed to prevent tax avoidance and address abuse of certain tax provisions and anomalies in the tax law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also amends the interest withholding tax provisions, as announced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in June 1996, in an effort to inject further competition into the Australian financial market and, in particular, the home lending market and update the provisions to reflect current overseas financial arrangements.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="890">
<PARA STYLE="Para">Amendments Related to Net Capital Losses</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will amend the income tax law to rectify anomalies in the capital gains tax provisions dealing with the carry forward and transfer of net capital losses. These measures were announced in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the existing capital gains tax provisions, taxpayers are able to carry forward net capital losses into a later year of income for recoupment against future capital gains which, as with the carry forward of revenue losses, is subject to a number of recoupment tests. These tests prevent capital losses incurred by a company from being recouped where there has been a substantial change in the beneficial ownership of the company since the losses were incurred and the company does not carry on the same business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the existing capital gains tax provisions operate so that taxpayers who carry forward net capital losses into subsequent years are taken to reincur those losses in each subsequent year. The effect of this anomaly is that the recoupment tests for company taxpayers do not achieve their intended purpose. That is, a capital loss is able to be recouped even where beneficial ownership of a company has changed substantially since the loss was incurred and the company does not carry on the same business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This defect flows through to the provisions permitting the transfer of net capital losses between resident companies within the same 100 per cent owned group. A further defect is that, in certain circumstances, the recoupment tests applying to the transferee company are less stringent than those applying to the transferor company. This contrasts with the revenue loss transfer provisions which require both companies to satisfy the same recoupment tests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendments will ensure that net capital losses attach to the year of income in which they are incurred and are recouped or transferred within a company group in the order in which they were incurred. In addition, where a net capital loss is transferred within a company group, the transferee company will be required to satisfy the same recoupment tests&mdash;for example, the continuity 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of ownership test or the same business test&mdash;that apply to the transferor company.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Withholding Tax Avoidance</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of the 1996&hyphen;97 budget, the Treasurer announced that the general anti&hyphen;avoidance provisions, part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act, were to be extended so that they can apply to non&hyphen;resident interest, dividend and royalty withholding tax in order to provide a mechanism to effectively counter withholding tax avoidance schemes. Four other specific amendments were also announced which will further assist in preventing abuse of the withholding tax provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will not allow the income tax base to be continually eroded by artificial arrangements which attempt to get around the withholding tax provisions. However, the measures do not reflect any change in the government's policy on withholding taxes but are intended to give effect to existing policy by addressing tax avoidance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Dual Resident Companies</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will amend the income tax law to provide that certain dual resident companies which are in substance non&hyphen;residents cannot take advantage of their dual resident status for the purposes of the operation of specific tax concessions and anti&hyphen;avoidance measures at a significant cost to the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Removal of Standard Superannuation Contribution Limit</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill removes the option for employers with 10 or more employees to elect to calculate the maximum deduction they can claim for superannuation contributions made for the benefit of their employees by reference to a standard contribution limit. All employers will be required to determine the maximum amount of allowable deductions for superannuation contributions based on the ages of individual employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The standard contribution limit was introduced for reasons of administrative simplicity. However, the standard contribution limit has been subject to abuse with some employers claiming deductions for contributions on behalf of particular employees well in excess of the age based limits. The abuse has come at a cost to revenue and the government 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="891"> believes that the standard contribution limit can no longer be justified.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Leases of Luxury Cars</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another measure in the bill relates to the taxation treatment of leases of luxury cars. The cost limit for depreciation of luxury cars that was first enacted in 1980 has been effectively circumvented by leasing arrangements under which the lessor is largely unaffected by the limit. A common avoidance technique is to ensure that the lessor is a tax exempt or other tax preferred entity such as a loss trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new measures will treat leases of luxury cars in much the same way as other forms of vehicle finance. The lessor will be treated as having disposed of the car to the lessee at the beginning of the lease and having lent the lessee the money to buy the car. The lessor will be taxed only on the finance charge component of the notional loan to the lessee, but not on the actual lease payments. If the lessee uses the car for income producing purposes, the lessee will be entitled to deduct an appropriate proportion of the finance charge component. No deduction will be allowed for actual lease payments, but the lessee will be treated as the car owner entitled to taxation depreciation allowances. The amount of depreciation allowed will be reduced under the depreciation cost limit rules.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Interest Withholding Tax and Related Provisions</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will implement the government's commitment to amend the section 128F interest withholding tax exemption to increase competition in the Australian financial market. The end use in an Australian business requirement in the existing section 128F will be removed. The requirement that the debentures issued by an Australian company must be widely distributed on overseas capital markets will be replaced by a public offer test. This amendment will extend the exemption to borrowings in offshore wholesale capital markets. Division 11 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 will be amended to exclude its application to interest paid offshore in respect of bearer debentures which are issued offshore. The interest on such debentures will be subject to interest with 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> holding tax. Division 11 will also be amended to provide an exemption for bearer debentures issued by an offshore banking unit. The interest withholding tax collection procedures will be amended to ensure that they are consistent with the royalty withholding tax procedures. Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the amendments insisted upon by the Senate be agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996 was introduced into the parliament last year to give effect to a 1996 government election policy commitment to extend the time before new migrants may obtain access to certain social security payments and other benefits. The bill also implements legislation aimed at clarifying information gathering from the parties, clarifies that income data from different financial years may be used in the single data matching program cycle and makes other minor technical amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the bill was first considered by the Senate, the Senate made a number of amendments to the bill relating to the two&hyphen;year migrant waiting period provisions. This House subsequently disagreed with some of those amendments and the Senate was so informed. The Senate has now agreed that it will not insist on making amendments that would have meant that there would be no migrant waiting period for these benefits: the carer pension, the widow allowance, the disability wage supplement, the mature age allowance, special benefit, partner allowance, mobility allowance, the provision of a senior's health card and health care cards under the disadvantaged persons scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, the Senate will not insist on amendments that would have maintained the exemption from the operation of the waiting period that currently applies to a person who was a member of a couple immediately before entering Australia and whose partner has been an Australian resident for at least 26 weeks, also the amendments for a shorter waiting period for a parenting allowance or a number of consequential amendments to some of the definitional provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the Senate still considers that there should be no waiting period for either a maternity allowance or more than the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minimum rate of family payment. With respect to the maternity allowance, the government has reconsidered its position and now agrees that it should not be subject to a two-year waiting period. On the matter of the maternity allowance, it is a payment made to assist families to meet the costs involved in the birth of a child. It is not an income support payment, and, to that end, the government considers that it should not be treated akin to the minimum rate family payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consistent with its election commitment, the government had never intended that the minimum rate of family payment, previously known as the family allowance, should be subject to a two-year waiting period. On the other hand, the government did consider that there should be a two&hyphen;year waiting period for more than the minimum family payment and that it had an electoral mandate to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, in the interests of facilitating the passage of the bill, the government indicates that it will not oppose any Senate amendment that would ensure that no such waiting period was imposed. Likewise, whilst not conceding that certain provisions relating to newstart allowance, sickness allowance and youth training allowance would be retrospective, the government is prepared to recommend to this House that it would agree to amendments still insisted on by the Senate that would have the effect of the two-year waiting period applying to people claiming those allowances who had not entered Australia and being granted a permanent visa before royal assent to the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In reconsidering the bill, the Senate also agreed to a number of amendments moved by the government that the government had previously intended moving but had not been able to do so because of earlier Senate amendments. Those amendments would give effect to a number of recommendations set out in the majority report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the bill including exempting special needs relatives, refugees, former refugees, family members of refugees or former refugees and innocent illegals from the carer pension migrant waiting period and ensuring consistency in treatment of subclass 820 and subclass 826 visa holders. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="894"> government recommends the bill be agreed to with those amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="894" TIME="11.17 a.m." SPEAKER="Kerr, Duncan, MP" NAMEID="RH4" ELECTORATE="Denison" PARTY="ALP" GOV="0">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RH4">Mr KERR</NAME><ELECTORATE> (Denison)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(11.17 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition regrets that the government has succeeded in a process which will mean that there is now a two-tiered welfare system in Australia and that those who come to this country will be faced with circumstances which will mean that they have not got available to them the range of support that is  available to other Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most distressing of the changes is the imposition of a two&hyphen;year waiting period on special benefit, a payment only available as a last resort when all other avenues have been exhausted. It is certain that it will mean that emergency relief agencies will have to pick up the pieces in this area. I note that, in the budget, supplemental appropriations were made to make sure that agencies such as St Vincent de Paul and other private agencies did have available to them some additional resources to meet that cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter of some great regret that this parliament will be complicit in a process which will see the need for a number of people who are going through a period of resettlement in this country not having available to them a proper process&mdash;a safety net&mdash;under the law and being forced to have recourse to those private charitable ends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has pledged to introduce a form of safety net which obviously is intended to be less universal than that which applies for special benefit but has, thus far, declined to make available the detail. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) was pressed repeatedly in the Senate to give that detail. She said that, while she had circulated a draft of the regulations that she was proposing to introduce, she was not willing at that time to make that detail available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would have helped the conclusion of this process were that detail available to senators in that place, and certainly it is a matter that I would wish to comment on. There will be considerable unease amongst many in the community until the minister does produce whatever set of regulations the government intends to proceed with.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The withdrawal of support from people who have been welcomed to this country as permanent residents in the vital period of their settlement is going to cause problems. It certainly may backfire in the sense of the withdrawal of support, which assists people in that period of settlement when they are most vulnerable. If it does result in people making a poor start to their life in this country and, if they do not leave but battle on and become long-term welfare dependent, as a consequence we will have bad policy compounded with bad results and any short&hyphen;term savings outweighed by the long-term damage that is done socially and economically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only benefit for the passage of this legislation is that it will no longer give people such as Senator Newman, who used some outrageously populist language, excuses to make disgraceful comments such as referring to new arrivals in terms of `those people are being offered the opportunity to ride on the backs of battlers from the day they arrive'. The mean spiritedness of the government's original proposal&mdash;which included excluding eligibility for, amongst other things, the double orphans pension, child disability allowance and the failure to make provision for full family payment or maternity allowance&mdash;shows the way in which this government was intending to operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has now emerged is that the Senate has agreed with the government to enable a two-year waiting period to apply to a range of benefits, which, essentially, almost covers the field. There are a couple of areas where the Senate has dug its heels in, and the government has accepted at least two of those. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The law now will, indeed, be making available full access to family payment, which was a commitment by the then opposition before the last election and which it was plainly reneging on. The Senate has insisted on that being still made available, as it has in the case of the maternity allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Might I say that there are a couple of small technical points on which I would appreciate the minister's assurances. The leader for the Labor Party in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, referred the Minister for Social Security to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="895"> case of class 309 and 310 visas. These are new visas which were introduced and, because of the technical way in which they have been expressed, I think as the law currently stands, there was the prospect that, in fact, two two&hyphen;year waiting periods would apply. The minister said that she did not need to take the matter on notice, that she could give an assurance to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) that there would only be one two&hyphen;year waiting period which would operate as of the date of arrival in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would appreciate the minister at the table, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) firstly confirming that and, if it is possible for him to indicate the mechanism that the government proposes to use to actually achieve that end, because I think it would require either an amendment to this act or to the regulations in order to secure that. I would appreciate that being made known to the House. Although, of course, we would not stand on this matter in terms of preventing the disposition of this matter at this time, it is obviously one which would be useful for it to be known so that the matter could be concluded finally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that really is the weight of what we would wish to say. This has been an exhausting process for the parliament. There have been some words uttered in this debate, particularly by Senator Newman, which I am sure she ought regret, if she does not regret. That being the case, we now have a situation where there will be a two&hyphen;year waiting period and that will apply across a range of measures, excluding only matters which I think the Australian community at large would have said would have been so mean&hyphen;spirited and so stony hearted as to have really not properly been put on the agenda in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it extraordinary that the government, for example, sought to eliminate the double orphans pension from the start, or not to comply with its own commitment before the election to make available full family assistance through the family payment. Concerning its own concession in relation to maternity allowance and child disability allowance, they 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> should never have been put on the table in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will, by accepting the matters that the Senate has insisted on, also concede the fact that these matters should not be introduced retrospectively. I think it is important that this parliament discipline the government to act in a way which is consistent with its previous undertakings and a philosophy that generally commends itself to both sides of this parliament. It has been a near universal rule of public policy that, with one exception&mdash;the exception of the taxation area where I think it has been conceded that, from the date of an announcement, taxation measures will be allowed to take effect so that the revenue is not defeated&mdash;there ought not be a concession to government to enable it to act in a way to withdraw people's entitlements in a retrospective manner. The insistence on this and its acceptance by the government, I believe, is at least a worthwhile outcome as a result of the way in which this matter has been proceeded with.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) for his comments. If I can pick up a couple of them fairly quickly, we may be able to clarify some matters. I might put myself at issue with him in relation to some of the points he has made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue that was first raised, which was access to special benefits, while the term `special benefit' is being used, when we originally developed the policy in this area we referred to it as a special allowance to distinguish it from special benefits as we had known them, and that was the clear intention. The special benefit, while it is available on a more restricted basis than other benefits&mdash;that is clear&mdash;in our view, was never intended to be available as a form of benefit for those people for whom assurances had been given that relatives were sponsoring them into Australia and that those relatives were going to meet their needs, where people clearly had the capacity to meet those needs, but, because they were willing to put the relatives on the streets, the person may well be able to meet the special benefit test.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="896">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, what we stated in our policy we would do is accommodate those situations with a special payment where changed circumstances had arisen in relation to the sponsor after arrival. So what we were looking at was a situation in which the sponsor may have died and would not be in a position to continue to provide and meet those needs. The sponsor may have lost his or her job and was not, therefore, in a position to meet the obligation that they had assumed. So while refugees and those who come through the humanitarian stream were always exempt from these provisions, where we were dealing with people who come through the skilled categories and had the capacity to look after themselves and those people who come through the family categories, and there is a sponsor, then the sponsor, clearly, has an obligation to accept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difficulty that we have had&mdash;and it has been acknowledged over a long time&mdash;is that not all sponsors meet their obligations. Some people sponsor where they have no capacity to meet their obligations. One of the things we are going to do is to reassess now the very basis upon which the assurance of support scheme operates so that it is clear what the obligations are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said to my officers that in undertaking this review they should also look at the extent to which people have the capacity to meet the obligations. In other words, we should not encourage people who have no capacity to continue sponsorship when we know that when the relative comes they are not going to be able to meet the obligation. Whether or not a bond is continued, whether you give access to the person who was sponsored and who is not being assisted to those funds, may be something we can look at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there are fresh questions there, as a result of the passage of this legislation, of ensuring that people know what the obligations are when they are involved in the sponsorship process. I am going to ensure that these matters are brought to people's attention at the time they are undertaking the sponsorship obligation. In relation to the guidelines, Senator Newman said yesterday:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is true, but the timetabling of that is such that I will certainly do whatever she does in the other place. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS>  The suggestion was made that this matter may backfire on the government. I am sure people will come forward and say, outside of changed circumstances, that they are in a very difficult situation. That is why the assurance of support scheme has always been there. It needs to be reviewed to ensure that people understand that the assurance of support scheme means what it says. I do not think it will be a matter of backfiring in the minds of the Australian public when people come out and say, `I sponsored my relative, but I did not know what I was doing, and there is now an obligation that I am asking my neighbours to accept.' I just do not think that will be accepted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reference was made to us reneging on a commitment to the way in which this matter was brought forward. The former government made changes to the way in which payments were made, particularly to family payments. The maternity allowance was a new payment that arose after the policy had initially been developed and costed. We brought it forward in the expectation that the form in which it was first proposed would be the form in which it would be adopted. That is the basis 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="897"> upon which it was costed by Finance as part of the consideration of what was then known as the Fightback package in which this initiative was first announced. On our part, we do not regard it as reneging on a commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I can reiterate the words that I used before, the reason we are acceding to these matters is not a reconsideration on our part of the issue but to secure passage of the bill. In other words, we agreed not to press these two issues&mdash;which, in terms of the savings involved, were relatively minor&mdash;not because we agreed we had made some error but to secure passage of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final matter raised was the issue of the two&hyphen;year entry permit which the parliament has acceded to for spouse entrants and de facto partners and also for those in the interdependency class. In relation to those visas, there was a specific amendment&mdash;No. 10&mdash;which was designed to ensure that the person would wait only two years before being eligible for social security payments. Our understanding is that the legislation, as it is now being enacted, will require a preclusion period to access of benefits for a two&hyphen;year period. The time runs from the time of entry and a further period will not be required to be served for any period of later permanent residence that is granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is my understanding of what the amendment was intended to do. The officers are nodding at me. That is the assurance that Senator Newman gave to the parliament. If it is found that that objective was not achieved, obviously we will look at the matter again. I thank the honourable member for raising this matter and I hope that we can now agree to the bill in the form that the Senate has finally agreed to it.</PARA>

However, this is a matter that has commended itself to considerable public attention. A set of draft guidelines was the subject of discussion and comment in a Senate inquiry earlier. The government has had ample time to settle the terms of those regulations. Its failure to do so, in a circumstance where it now has the parliament's approval to change the law but has not yet made known to the public the nature of the safety net it has promised from the outset, is a matter of grave concern. I simply ask the minister to give such assurances as he may that this matter is not going to be allowed to fester and that we will have those regulations before us for consideration not just in the Senate but in this House without delay.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

That is what the government was committed to. It is important to us to have them on the table, discussed and preferably dealt with in a way that we can all agree upon.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the amendments be agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">For the benefit of the House, the government amendments moved and passed in the Senate relate to the commencement date. I will refer to a couple of those issues for the benefit of members of the House. I spoke to the shadow minister earlier. The opposition has no problems with the government amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The advance payment of the service pension income support supplement is related to the commencement date. The variation to the Defence Service Homes Act 1918 changes to the date of royal assent. In terms of the advance payments of service pension income support supplements, there are three parts to this budget measure. One part will increase the maximum advance payment available to pensioners who also receive a war widow or war widower's pension. Another part will introduce a limitation to one advance payment in any year. Lastly, a purpose provision is to be removed. There is very strong support for this measure. Just prior to Christmas, in the expectation that this bill would receive the attention of the Senate before we rose at the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="899"> end of last year, there was an enormous lot of interest in these changes to this veterans' affairs legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to touch on the Defence Service Homes Act 1918. There are three defence service homes measures that were to commence from 1 January this year. As this bill was not dealt with prior to the House rising at the end of last year, that commencement date of course could not apply without it being retrospective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extension of eligibility for defence service home loans to those who served in operational areas of Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia and Somalia, and whose first service commenced on or before 14 May 1985, is catered for in these amendments within the bill, although not the amendments we are considering at the moment. There is the extension of eligibility to veterans and veteran widowers of World War II ex&hyphen;service women, notwithstanding any previous assistance as a veteran. Further, the reduction of the interest rate for new additional advances goes from 10 per cent per annum to either 6.85 per cent per annum or a rate resulting in borrowers paying no more than the effective interest rate of 6.85 per cent in the majority of circumstances. I note, too, that is certainly a welcome measure for those people with those loans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other measures in the bill as a whole, one of which I would like to refer to. Once this bill receives royal assent, it will enable the government to increase payments to Victoria Cross recipients to bring payments from our government into line with those paid to Victoria Cross recipients in the United Kingdom by their government. I do not think there is any opposition to the proposition that this will in fact be a retrospective payment, backdated to August 1995, which was the date on which Victoria Cross recipients in the United Kingdom received an increased allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are three Victoria Cross recipients in Australia who are still alive: Sir Roden Cutler, Keith Payne and Ted Kenna. I think all in this House will agree that this bill will ensure that we will be able to continue to maintain the value of their award. It is a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> continuing way of honouring our commitment to those who received our highest military award.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to thank all those who have participated in the debate in this House and in the Senate. I also wish to thank the shadow minister for ensuring that there has been quick passage of these amendments through the House. It will enable us to continue to honour the service of all those who served, and it will continue our commitment to ensure that, wherever there are anomalies or wherever we can seek to amend the Veterans Entitlement Act, we improve and build on the commitment that we have given to those who served this nation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will take the opportunity to make some brief comments. I join with the minister in his few words in relation to the Victoria Cross recipients who are still alive. It is clearly a bipartisan matter that every assistance should be afforded them and that the VC should continue to be regarded with the highest esteem in our nation.</PARA>

That was a fitting thing for the nation to provide, and I know it was done on a bipartisan basis on that occasion. It is appropriate that we ensure that the standing of this high honour is maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the record, I should note the opposition's regret that a number of amendments that we sought in the Senate were opposed by the government&mdash;in particular, the abolition of the earnings credit scheme. We sought the abolition of the concessions on the first $2,000 or $4,000 of financial assets under the deeming. The government did not support us

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In resuming my contribution to the debate on the telecommunications bills I will deal with a couple of key areas. One is the question of Internet access and the problem created by the fact that Telstra is not only the carrier but also an Internet service and access provider. This gives Telstra an extraordinary ability to be able to control the marketplace in which Internet services are offered. I am pleased to see that the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) is at the table because this impacts on small business. This is an area where small business can be quite significantly affected, particularly those small businesses that are actually involved in the provision of Internet services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the ludicrous situation where Telstra is more or less expected to govern itself in providing fair access to the facilities that the Internet service providers need in order to conduct their own businesses, at the same time competing with Telstra in the same marketplace. That is an extraordinary conflict of interest. It provides Telstra with an extraordinary amount of control over the marketplace in Internet access. As a former member of the Liberal Party and as someone who values competition policy, I believe it is an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="901"> absolute disgrace that the government is prepared to allow this to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that this problem arose under the previous government but, of course, it is a matter that has developed at some speed over the last few years, so I suppose one could offer the excuse that they were not prepared for it. This is now well documented. There is a Senate committee of inquiry looking into it. At the end of the day, anybody with a remote interest in this issue could have foreshadowed that there was going to be this almost incredible conflict of interest in relation to the services and responsibilities of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs would well know, this is an area of small business that is growing rapidly. It employs principally younger people&mdash;another aspect of coalition policy in relation to employment. Yet we have the situation where the independent Internet service providers are forced by this government to offer their services knowing that they have to rely on the carrier to provide them with the resources and then compete against the carrier in the same marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that that was an absolute contradiction of the government's commitment to competition policy. If there is going to be fair and open access to telephony and data transmission services and all the related areas, then quite clearly Telstra should withdraw from Internet service provision&mdash;certainly access provision&mdash;or there ought to be some means of regulating what is clearly an unsatisfactory conflict of interest. I would be interested to know whether the minister for small business is himself interested in contributing to ensuring that the small businesses involved in this are not being unfairly manipulated by Telstra's control of the provision of services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect is the question of timed calls for Internet access. Telstra is talking about timed calls because they say that the use of data transmission on untimed charged calls interferes with residential calls, with voice calls, and is a drain on the profitability in the provision of voice calls. In actual fact, there is a very good level of information to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the contrary to show that data transmission, which often occurs at non-peak periods, contributes to reducing the cost per call of telephony. The concept that Telstra would introduce timed charges for Internet access is another extraordinary potential abuse of Telstra's position as the carrier and Internet service provider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the minister who is here, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs&mdash;although, it would be interesting to know the views of the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Warwick Smith) on this&mdash;how on earth Telstra would propose to detect data calls so that they could provide time charges. It begs the question whether this would involve some means of identifying the numbers that are using data transmission on a regular basis. How will they do this in the absence of any technological ability to detect data transmissions on that basis at present? It is a well-known fact in the industry that Telstra is not in a position to do it and therefore would be required, in order to achieve this, to identify the numbers using data transmission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had the situation the other day where it became known that people who use mobile phones on the digital network are able to be located thanks to the fact that every so many seconds there is a transmission between the phone that is switched on and the exchange or the nearest station. This means in essence that the location of any person who uses a digital telephone&mdash;bearing in mind that the analog telephone network is to be abolished in due course&mdash;may be able to be identified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a former policeman, one could argue that this is a great step forward in law enforcement. But, as someone who is thoroughly opposed to Big Brother and those sorts of aspects of George Orwell's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nineteen Eighty&hyphen;Four</EMPHASIS>, this presents an awful scenario for the future where, by accessing the telecommunication carrier's records and the continuous monitoring of where particular phones are located, people's movements can be detected. I would have thought that that was anathema to the vast majority of Australians who value greatly their individual liberty and freedom to move around.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="902">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are going to see this in any way expanded then, in my view, this would be to the detriment of our free and democratic community. I just hope that will be knocked on the head as soon as possible. But I wanted to make the point that if they are going to expand that by identifying people who use  data&mdash;in other words, by using the numbers of the people who use the Internet&mdash;then this is another step towards a Big Brother scenario where the telecommunications carriers become accumulators of information about citizens that can be used by government agencies in goodness knows whatever functions in relation to the movements and the conduct of business of those citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want touch on one last aspect of this particular area: Telstra's universal service obligations. The government claims that they will preserve universal service obligations on the part of Telstra. My view is that when you read the speech of the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, on the question of universal provisions you see the fairly ambiguous nature of what he had to say. When you look at who is advising the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), you see that some of the advice he is receiving is anti-USO preservation. Then it is understandable that there is an ambiguity about the commitment to universal service obligations post&hyphen;July 1997. Those members of the National Party, or those members representing regional or rural electorates, ought to be really looking at this very closely indeed, because it is my view that USOs will be progressively withdrawn post July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might also point out in relation to service obligations of the telecommunication providers that a section of the community in my electorate, which is within the metropolitan area of Perth, already have timed call charges. They have always had timed call charges. In fact, because of the zoning arrangements within the Perth metropolitan area, they are still paying timed call charges notwithstanding that the metropolitan area of Perth&mdash;in other words, the area that is considered to be the suburbs of Perth&mdash;has spread to touch their areas. It is an absolute disgrace that we have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a situation where in my electorate, a city electorate, we have consumers who do not pay timed call charges living within a few kilometres of other consumers who do pay for timed calls. I have yet to see any rational explanation by Telstra for this other than the fact that we have this zoning system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I have small businesses in my area who are obliged to ring and pay for timed calls to contact other branches of their business within Perth, within the same metropolitan area. It seems to me incredible that a government that is committed to charges for untimed local calls should allow this situation to prevail in the Perth metropolitan area. It is indicative of perhaps the real attitude of the government in relation to USOs, timed calls and other aspects of telecommunications telephony provision that this has not been stopped over a long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we well know, at the end of the day it is the asset values of Telstra that are going to bring the greatest return to the government through its sale. These built-in subsidies&mdash;like the ability to site telecommunication towers and to dig cables wherever they want to&mdash;are an addition to the net asset value of Telstra when it comes to be sold. One does not have to be Albert Einstein to work out that a government that is going to rely on the Telstra sale to do a lot of other things is not going to interfere unduly with those particular rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any backbenchers on the government side who consider that what is being enacted in this legislation is going to change the situation ought to think again. I can tell you that, in my view and I think in the view of a number of other people, the telecommunications towers and the cabling will continue on as it has done in the past. I notice with interest the technological aspect of the changes to the telecommunications towers. I can tell you that has been the excuse used in the past by the telecommunication carriers. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was not that long ago that telecommunications services in Australia were provided by three legislated monopoly carriers: OTC, Telecom and Aussat. Although the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="903"> Davidson report in 1982 favoured increased private sector involvement and competition within the Australian telecommunications industry, it was almost 10 years before Optus Communications entered the market, with Vodafone becoming the third mobile operator in Australia in 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In short, this legislative package of telecommunications bills encourages and facilitates the industry transition from one still dominated by government monopolies to one driven by vigorously competitive markets. Although our telecommunications industry is small compared with many other developed countries, it is one of the fastest growing segments of our economy, increasing from 2.6 per cent of GDP in 1989 to an estimated four per cent in 2000. Internationally, Australia ranks only behind New Zealand amongst OECD countries with the highest telecommunications growth rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians are the world's hungriest consumers of emerging technologies. Consider the following: in mid-1995, there were over two million mobile phone subscribers in Australia. By the end of 1996, that number had jumped to around four million customers. Among the OECD countries, only the Scandinavian nations have experienced a faster growth rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, Australians represent approximately one million of the 60 million or so Internet surfers worldwide and have the second highest level of computer usage in the entire world. According to British Telecom Asia Pacific, whereas voice&mdash;as distinct from electronic data such as the Internet&mdash;accounted for 90 per cent of phone traffic two or three years ago, that proportion is down to 70 per cent today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the United States, phone lines already carry more electronic data, such as the Internet traffic, than voice data. The rest of the world seems to follow that trend. In fact, according to Telstra, Internet growth is set to overtake telephony on its national and international networks by 2000. Australia has approximately 16 facsimile machines per 100 workers, which is well ahead of the United States and Europe which have eight fax machines per 100 workers. It is just behind 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Japan which has approximately 17 machines per 100 workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Further, Australian consumers have much greater access and are comparatively bigger users of electronic funds transfer at point of sale&mdash;or EFTPOS as it is commonly known&mdash;than our counterparts in other technology friendly countries such as Japan, Germany and the United States. Approximately 96.4 per cent of Australian households have at least one telephone line. Based on the high penetration rates of telephones, televisions and personal computers, the International Telecommunications Union, the ITU, in Geneva names Australia as among the top five countries with the greatest potential to profit from the developments in superhighways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To make the most of technological changes, as well as the ongoing growth in the telecommunications industry, Australia needs this package of legislation, together with the related post&hyphen;1997 legislative reforms which set down the appropriate pro&hyphen;competition and pro&hyphen;user framework for this dynamic industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government strongly believes that, if Australian businesses and consumers are to derive maximum value from a dynamic telecommunications industry, three principles are critical. Firstly, Australia must have a world&hyphen;class telecommunications infrastructure, based on the latest mix of market driven technologies. Secondly, our industry must be open to a multitude of service providers with equal access to carrier facilities. Finally, we must have a competitive telecommunications market focused on driving prices down and the quality of services to consumers up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each of these principles is reflected in the key parts of these bills. Firstly, one of the fundamental elements of the bills is the introduction of a truly open market for telecommunications infrastructure and services. There will be no limit on the number of carrier licences that may be issued. Amongst other elements, the bills provide that a condition for obtaining a licence for carriers is an industry development plan, unless exempted. The government believes that this will maximise the opportunities for Australian industry. Network rollout obligations will, thankfully, not be imposed on new carriers. Distinctions 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="904"> between fixed and mobile services under the existing legislation are removed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, a significant feature of a multicarrier environment is that competitors inevitably will make use of each other's networks. The government recognises the importance of guaranteeing all Australians seamless end to end telecommunications services&mdash;a telecommunications network which allows any to any communication. The legislative framework includes a full interconnection and access regime between carriers, service providers and their customers, the objective being that any user can communicate with any other user regardless of choice of carrier. That prevents us from going down the tragic path that has developed in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, a key component of this legislation relates to the shifting, except where clearly inappropriate, of the responsibility of regulation to the industry itself. The government believes that greater reliance on self&hyphen;regulation through industry developed codes is particularly important in a rapidly changing industry such as telecommunications. However, the government also recognises that, in certain circumstances, industry consensus may not be possible. In such circumstances, the legislation includes safeguard provisions to enable the regulator&mdash;the Australian Communications Authority&mdash;to establish standards or to arbitrate an outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, the legislation demonstrates the government's commitment to ensure that comprehensive and effective mechanisms are in place to promote and protect the rights of consumers and fulfils our undertaking prior to the March 1996 election&mdash;in the statement known as Better Communications&mdash;to establish a world&hyphen;class consumer framework. The customer service guarantee sets out requirements relating to the connection of services, rectification of faults and keeping of appointments. It also sets down a streamlined means of compensation when these requirements are not met. The universal service obligation is further clarified and updated and aligns the universal service regime with the post&hyphen;1997 multicarrier environment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation also extends the untimed local call obligation so that residential customers, such as those in my electorate, will have the right to untimed non&hyphen;voice local calls&mdash;for example, facsimiles, e&hyphen;mails or connections with an Internet service provider&mdash;and voice calls. Businesses will have the right to untimed local voice calls. That is very important not only for local businesses but also particularly for players in various industries in some of the smaller cities around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, we must recognise that this legislative package will not transform the telecommunications industry overnight. While this is historic legislation, change of this magnitude is an evolving process. The coalition government firmly believes that the results of legislative change will be lower prices and better services for customers, both in the quality of service and in the development and implementation of advanced telecommunications services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This package of bills fulfils the government's election commitment as set forth in Better Communications. It brings about telecommunications reform that encourages a degree of competition unprecedented in Australia and sets down a framework of world&hyphen;class consumer protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have received late notice of some proposed amendments from the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), who is not in the chamber for this debate today. I would briefly like to address one of the amendments that he has proposed. Specifically, it refers to the maintenance of the 1 July 1997 cut&hyphen;off for carriers' exemptions from state and territory planning laws. There is very little that can be said on the proposal from the honourable member for Dobell, because his proposals are nothing more than a cunning stunt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On many occasions allegations are made across the House and very few people actually refer to the real meaning of an allegation, so I have reached for my <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Oxford Mini&hyphen;Dictionary</EMPHASIS>&mdash;which, of course, is an authoritative source. I found the definition of `cunning' to be `skilled at deception, crafty, ingenuous'. If we go to the accusation of it being a cunning stunt, `stunt' is defined as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="905"> `something unusual or difficult, done as a performance or to attract attention'. Out of this debate we have discovered quite conclusively that relevance deprivation syndrome is communicated by methods other than election losses. It is very regrettable that the member for Dobell should try to play this cunning stunt by introducing some less than sophisticated amendments to the motion for the second reading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I can suggest is that Australian Labor Party has great form on this matter, especially in relation to its suggestion that there should be a cut&hyphen;off for the carriers' exemptions from state and territory planning laws. As I walk the streets of my electorate&mdash;all 42 square kilometres of it; the second smallest electorate in the entire nation, which is perhaps why I am carrying a few pounds more than some may recognise&mdash;it is hard to believe that any government would permit the erection of overhead cables, the erection of black guitar string like spaghetti from household to household across the views of people living in the local streets and across the building line of buildings. There is only one group of people who are responsible for that: the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can say with absolute confidence that if there has been a simple example in this House of enormous hypocrisy then it comes today through the member for Dobell, who has not even turned up to the debate, putting forward amendments which are suggesting that the Australian Labor Party is the guardian of the rights of local government. It was the Australian Labor Party that in 1991 legislated so that local government had absolutely no power to stop the erection of the overhead cables or to stop the telephone towers which sprout up like undisciplined mushrooms across our electorates. It is the Australian Labor Party that must accept absolute and complete responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an old saying that when an ancien regime is about to collapse it makes a dying statement. The dying statement of that regime is effectively a very good example of why it is failing. The failing of the Australian Labor Party towards the end of their time in government was their failure to recognise their 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mistakes. They failed to recognise where they went wrong. The Australian people said in March last year `You've got it wrong' to Paul Keating and to his mates in New South Wales. We know there are not very many of those mates at the moment; he is short of good friends. He can always speak to the telecommunications companies who have benefited from the 1991 Telecommunications Act, which permitted the carriers to have absolute carte blanche across the skies of Sydney and, in fact, across the skies of the entire nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party, particularly the honourable member for Dobell&mdash;who is usually more informed about these things than he has been on this occasion&mdash;to come into the House and put up a number of amendments which fly in the face of exactly the tune that he has been singing for the last six or seven years is an affront to the people of Australia. It is particularly an affront to the people of my electorate, who have had enough of the overhead cables and the mobile phone towers. There is only one group of people responsible for that, and it is the people that gave the immunities to the carriers in 1991. Thankfully they are on the other side of the House, they are in opposition, and it will take a hell of a long time for them to come back over here.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) referred to his 42 square kilometres being strangled by the black spaghetti of the cabling process. Thank heavens I do not have to see that visual blot on the landscape as I drive around my 22&half; thousand&mdash;or thereabouts&mdash;square kilometres. I think that the way that rash of cabling has been rolled out with very little planning in the process is an indictment on the former government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These series of telecommunications bills will usher in a new era of telecommunications in the country, a brave new world of communications competition. These measures will probably be passed with little but token opposition, as we know both the coalition and the Labor Party are slaves to deregulation and competition policies, whatever the cost in jobs lost, services rendered and assets forgone. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="906"> Adherence to open slather competition combined with changing technology are perhaps two of the key reasons why unemployment in this country is so high, why youth unemployment is as high as 30 per cent, why middle aged, middle management jobs have been shed in the telecommunications industry and the power industry, to name just two in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I am making is that there can be a downside to deregulation and open slather competition. More people are waking up to that fact, and as time goes on I would like to think that government in this country will realise the need to move forward but to also look after our most important asset&mdash;our people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout last year I was one of the most outspoken critics of the partial privatisation of Telstra, for that reason. Telstra is one of the major employers in my electorate, particularly in Bathurst. It is my very real fear that as the telecommunications market is opened up many of those rural jobs will go. Certainly many hundreds of new jobs will also be created in the industry, but the new players in this industry will not be tripping over themselves or their cabling to come to regional centres like Bathurst. We all know that Australia is one of the most urbanised countries in the world and the cities are where the money is to be made, and that is where the new players will be heading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have only to look at the effects that the deregulation of the banking industry is having on rural communities. In the cities you will see aggressive new competitors like that favourite of the Treasurer (Mr Costello), Aussie Home Loans. We have heard this week that it is moving into the business market. It has no branch network, extremely low overheads and is eating away at the market share of the major banks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To compete with this lender and other new entrants with low overheads, the major banks have had to seriously cut back their branch networks and, of course, country towns have been the hardest hit. In western New South Wales more than 40 banks have closed over the past few years, and they are still closing their doors. Sure, Aussie Home Loans is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> providing a great service and no doubt employing hundreds in its Parramatta headquarters, but the bush loses out in this brave new world of banking competition. Never have our banks made so much money by employing so few. The face&hyphen;to&hyphen;face advice local bank managers once provided in the bush is disappearing, so the chances of more farmers getting into trouble with loans and bad lending practices is increasing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> A good phone system is so essential in the bush these days because country people seem to spend half their time hanging on the end of the phone trying to get through to some toll free number to carry out basic business or find out about services in places like Sydney. Austudy is a classical example at the moment. Only this week the Western District Health Fund in my electorate has been told by the health department that it cannot increase its fees because the department believes its management costs are too high. Never mind that Westfund still charges significantly less than the major health funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The department ignores the fact that Westfund also has a large branch network providing essential face to face services and jobs in country towns in my electorate and the neighbouring electors of Macquarie and Parkes. The health department says, `You don't need these branches. You can do it all over the phone. Just put in a toll free 1800 line.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, that is the mentality in the corridors of power in Canberra. It is also the type of attitude that country people detest. Country people have been missing out for a long time, and it is essential that they do not miss out on the telecommunications revolution. We are already seeing that they are missing out in crucial areas such as Internet access simply because, while city people tie up phone lines all day surfing the net, country kids have their time rationed because calls to the nearest Internet provider often incur STD rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dobell (Mr Lee) said, when referring to the opposition's amendments to this bill last evening, that the government is already expressing concern at the cost of upgrading rural services. I really have grave doubts about the advantages that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="907"> country people, particularly in the short term, will enjoy from this competitive new situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is hardly surprising that as a member for a country electorate a large part of my time is spent dealing with telecommunications related complaints. While I commend many aspects of this series of bills, in some respects it seems we are effectively signing our names on the dotted line with so much of the fine print still to be sorted out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the more welcome initiatives contained in the Trade Practices Amendment (Telecommunications) Bill&mdash;one of the 11 bills in the cognate debate&mdash;is the clause that will hopefully encourage carriers to share infrastructure such as trenches and communication towers. That is a very positive move that probably should have happened years ago before all these mobile phone base stations started popping up everywhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate at Mount Lambie, between Bathurst and Lithgow, there are a plethora of towers all 500 metres away from a particular property. Not only is it a vision blot on the landscape but, with so many questions still being raised about the potential health threats from these sorts of communication towers, you can understand why the residents are alarmed. I am sure most of my fellow members can tell similar stories. I heard the member for Moore (Mr Filing) talking in the House earlier this week about a series of phone towers in front and behind a school in his electorate and the distress that that has caused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the concern expressed by the opposition, especially by the member for Dobell, over the extension of the cut&hyphen;off for three months is of particular concern because an orgy of cable rollouts and mobile phone tower constructions will obviously occur in that period and local government will be able to do precious little about it. I wonder what the low impact control is that the minister is supposed to have discretion over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately in my electorate we have so far been spared the blight of pay TV cables being strung up along all the streets, as the member for Northern Sydney alluded to had happened in his electorate. How absurd was the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> environmentally friendly solution to the Sydney aerial cabling shemozzle by making the cabling grey instead of black. What an environmentally sensitive solution that was. Again this is a problem that should have been sorted out by the previous Labor government and to start trying to bring some sense to the situation now is shutting the gate after the horse has long gone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly though, while the bill says that telecommunication carriers must give their competitors access to facilities and suggests, in the case of disputes, that it will be left to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to try to arbitrate, it does not exactly spell out how long the parties involved have to try to negotiate a solution before the ACCC intervenes. Councils will be rolled by the costs of litigation brought by the heavyweight telecommunication providers. That is what I mean by signing on the dotted line while the fine print still has to be sorted out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can you honestly see two aggressive telecommunication companies reaching a settlement on sharing each other's facilities? It is a bit like asking the Prime Minister, John Howard, and the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, to agree to share the same line at the same time. It is a pretty fair bet it is not going to happen. This is just one example of a crucial detail that still has to be sorted out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another example is the set period that time carriers will have to rectify faults or problems with services. I think the temptation will be to say that if customers are not happy with one carrier they can vote with their feet and take their business elsewhere. But what happens in country areas where there is no competition and people still rely on Telstra?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This time last year in my electorate a small rural exchange near Bathurst broke down one weekend leaving about 40 customers without phones. It just happened to be one of the most dangerous weekends for bushfires last summer. It took Telstra until Monday to alert the dedicated local staff to get the exchange working again. Clearly, that sort of response time is not good enough. A working tele 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="908"> phone can mean the difference between life and death, which goes without saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While Telstra remains government owned and Australian owned, for a short time only, I was at least able to write to the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) and have this poor response highlighted in the hope it will not happen again. But, once we wash our hands of Telstra and leave the whole system open to the market forces to dictate what happens, I will guarantee such problems will only get worse in the bush. Believe me, I am not having a go at Telstra. The local work force, which has been cut back severely in recent years, is working very hard to try to provide a first rate service and management is always more than helpful at a local level when it comes to trying to resolve problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another problem that still has to be sorted out is the portability of telephone numbers. Last year we saw the Prime Minister officially call Optus's first local call customer, once again heralding, as we were told, a new era in competition. But, according to recent news reports, Optus is well behind in its targets in signing up local call customers partly because at the moment,customers cannot change companies and keep the same phone number. Obviously, if you have had the same number for years you are reluctant to give it up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am told that the lack of phone number portability is not really the fault of the industry or the regulators but more to do with the technology. Still, it is another example that, unless we get all the factors right, the brave new world of competition may produce great headlines for the business pages, maybe even greater profits for big business and the new shareholders of Telstra, but perhaps questionable benefits for the community, particularly in rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, I do not expect country phone customers will enjoy the benefits of local phone call competition in the near future&mdash;if ever&mdash;because, again, the profits are not there and the residential density is not great enough to warrant companies such as Optus stringing up their cables. Already country phone customers are severely disadvantaged when it comes to making local calls as Telstra's local 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> call zones are seriously out of date and it refuses to look at any changes. Most companies review their tariffs and policies on an annual bases, but Telstra still insists that its local call zones, which were drawn up more than two decades ago, are still appropriate or, to use its words, generous by world standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate we have the ridiculous example where you can make a call from Bathurst to Orange, or vice versa&mdash;a distance of 50 kilometres&mdash;for the cost of a local call. That is good. Yet, if you live in the village of Millthorpe, between Bathurst and Orange, you pay STD rates to call someone in Bathurst. Similarly, if you live in one of the small towns in the Cabonne Shire surrounding Orange&mdash;towns like Cumnock, all much closer than Bathurst is to Orange&mdash;you have to pay STD rates to call Orange.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you lived in, say, Canowindra back in the 1960s when the call zones were drawn up, it would not have mattered because you could have happily transacted most of your business in Canowindra and never ventured to Orange more than once or twice a year, and very rarely would you have needed to make an STD call&mdash;or a trunk call, as they were back then. But these days, as we all know, small country towns have suffered as a result of cutbacks by government, banks and other enterprises. The rural downturn has contributed and, of course, improved transport has made regional centres much closer. I am not suggesting we go back to the horse and cart, but I am suggesting regional and rural Australia will receive very patchy benefits from this improving technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result, in the case of Canowindra, residents today do a lot of business with Orange and every phone call they make incurs an STD rate, and Telstra does not want to know about it. I have raised it with Telstra, but it argues that its old call zones are very generous and very appropriate despite the fact that they are decades old. It would be nice to sit back like a coalition MP and say to angry constituents, `Don't worry, competition will fix it. Soon you will have a choice of local call carriers and prices will drop.' Don't hold your breath. Competition is not coming to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="909"> rescue and country businesses and consumers will continue to suffer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While metropolitan Australia moves into the information superhighway of the 21st century, small town Australia struggles with technology and policies already more than 30 years old. These bills also leave open the way for the phasing out of the analog mobile phone system by the year 2000, although they are also opening the way for the minister to intervene and grant an extension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would strongly urge the minister to open the way up now for analog services to remain in country areas. The mobile phone services have been a boon to farmers, allowing them to carry out business from the tractor seat. Digital services in country areas have proved to be inadequate and fail to provide the same coverage as the analog service. Areas like Rylstone&hyphen;Kandos, already battling bank closures and depleted hospital services, still cannot get a word from Telstra on any sort of mobile service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Assuming these bills are passed, it will be up to the communications minister to take a very active and vigilant role to ensure that, as we head down the path of deregulation and competition, policy changes are designed to benefit all Australians. Certainly, provisions have been made in these bills for cross&hyphen;subsidies, but that will not be enough on its own. The fine print that still has to be sorted out must make sure that, wherever people live, big business interests are not put ahead of the community's interests. With these quite strong reservations, I do commend the bills to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

As I said when the member for Hunter was not in the House, the former Labor government delivered a dusty old goat track, not the information superhighway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, service costs will be regulated by price control under the Telstra Corporation Act or the Telecommunications Bill 1996&mdash;much to the dismay of the Labor scaremongers. To be specific, price controls are structured to deliver real benefits to rural and remote customers as well as customers in urban areas. A price ceiling of 25c applies to untimed local phone calls from private phones and 40c from public phones. A range of services supplied to residential customers are subject to a price cap of CPI&hyphen;X, meaning their price must decline in real terms. This shoots down the argument put forward by the member for Hunter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hunter on that same day, 8 May 1996, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">amongst others&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) and all other honourable members on the other side of the House go to the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) to complain that telephone and other telecommunications services such as payphones are being wound down in their electorates, do you know what they will be told? You guessed it . . . `We cannot intervene.'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Intervene means listen. The member for Hunter had everyone guessing wrong; this minister does listen, and will continue to listen to the people of regional and rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a more personal note relating to listening, I would like to recall an incident in February 1996, during the election, when I was approached by the members of East Maitland Community Residents Action Group headed up by an energetic lady, Aisne Ballard. It seems that they had been lobbying for the reinstatement of the public phone in Morton Street, East Maitland. In the course of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this lobbying, both I and the then shadow minister, Richard Alston, met with Anna Rebiro, May Bull, Rita Fitzgibbon&mdash;no relation to the member for Hunter&mdash;Mary Barrett and Bill Ballard from the action group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems that they had contacted the former member for Paterson on more than one occasion. But there was never a follow up, any action or letters of support from this member. Yet these are the very people that Labor purported to look after. They even claimed them as supporters! These people are ex&hyphen;blue collar workers who reside in public housing, and some of them have seen the better side of 60, but Labor abandoned them. They just did not want to know about the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But guess what? We welcomed them with open arms and we have listened, and we will continue to listen. I am glad to hear that the member for Hunter and the member for Lyons (Mr Adams), who is now in the chamber, are the only Labor representatives of the people in regional and rural Australia. I do not think that the people of Australia could put up with any more such representation than what they have from that side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the previous government had removed their payphone&mdash;for some their only means of verbal communication with relatives and services. Considering how much the Labor government claimed to care about rural and regional Australia and how much they represented and supported the battlers in Australia, the local member, the former member for Paterson, walked away. He did not want to know about the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that payphone is now operating; we delivered because we and Minister Alston actually listened to what the people had to say. We can go on. The former member for Paterson made much to do about the need to improve mobile telephone communication in the Hunter, but again, remembering their commitment to regional and rural Australia, what did they deliver? You guessed it: nothing!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The member for Lyons said in this House on 21 November 1996:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="911">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of these isolated areas barely have telephones or decent television reception, let alone lines to allow such things as electronic data transfer.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So only a small proportion of regional Australia currently has access to mobile phones. There will not be an increase in infrastructure in the less populated areas after privatisation. Even if there was, the mobile phone does not allow the same interactive communication that is available on the Internet or e&hyphen;mail.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have to say you are wrong there. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It does not allow CD&hyphen;ROM.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not know how you use a CD&hyphen;ROM over the telephone, but that is nitpicking. Here is the classic part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It cannot give access to the information systems of the world in the same way that is possible with a physical cable. Without Telstra's current ability to cross&hyphen;subsidise services, the regional areas will be forgotten and discounted and they will not receive the roll out of the cable.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I watched a TV show a couple of weeks ago. Just by chance I got home early enough. It was a TV show called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sliders</EMPHASIS> . It sounded interesting. Let me quickly describe it to you because it is about the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept that. You would think that they had been in opposition for 13 years, not in government. Perhaps these two members on the other side are too embarrassed to admit it. Since then we have had a dawning of a new era for the bush, because since 2 March we have listened and we have made it easier to hear the people in the bush. I am proud to report that this government and the minister, whom the member for Hunter accuses, has listened again and did deliver in the form of a digital mobile telephone tower for Gloucester.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday I had the Mayor of Gloucester, Barry Ryan, and the General Manager, Norm Macleod, visit me in this House to discuss matters about regional and rural Australia, particularly their area. Let me report that they were ecstatic that this government has listened and has delivered a digital phone tower. Now up in Gloucester we have first&hyphen;class, quality mobile phone services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So where do we as a government stand with regard to regional and rural communications? Allow me to educate those representatives on the other side that are part of the true believers band. This government recognises the key role telecommunications play in rural and remote Australia and the need to foster the development of a robust, competitive and efficient industry. To facilitate this, the government has initiated a three&hyphen;pronged strategy: introducing open competition and enhancing consumer safeguards, achieving this by allowing specialised or regional service providers to enter small markets and target the needs of rural and regional users. By doing so, licence agreements and costs are minimal. There are a few restrictions on technologies and, while protecting the community's interests, service obligations are not onerous and are consistent with those applying to larger companies in other advanced economies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be no barriers to satellite operators including low earth orbiting satellites, a technology specifically designed with a view to servicing sparsely located regions and capable of increased access to handheld mobile services in the remotest of areas. In addition, the government's regional telecommunications infrastructure funds will be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="912"> available to be used to encourage the use and development of telecommunications services and facilities in regional areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The RTIF will be established as a trust fund, at $50 million per annum over a five-year period, commencing in 1997&hyphen;98. Allocation will be on a pro rata basis to each state according to the population living in remote and rural areas. Therefore, the RTIF has been structured specifically to be community driven and assist regional communities in the identification of needs and development of innovative, sustainable solutions unique to their particular needs. Let me assure this House that I will be putting up my hand for the people of Paterson, as I am sure the member for Lyons and the member for Hunter will be for their areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The goal of the RTIF is to provide rural users with high speed data communications, the Internet and utilisation of mobile telecommunications. As a result of increased competition, service providers are likely to increase their interest and expand into rural and remote Australia. Telstra will be digitalising its future mode of operations and is looking at providing high capacity network access for remote customers through its remote Australia telecommunications enhancement program. Yet, not to be left out of the race, the `Yes' company, Optus, is spending tens of millions of dollars doing the same, emulating the goals of the RTIF. Competition is very healthy and may we have much more of it in our area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, another government initiative is the customer service guarantee which will provide real benefits for rural and remote customers. Customer service guarantees require service providers to comply with the ACA determined standards and will apply to both universal and other service providers. In essence, service providers will be required to join and comply with the telecommunications industry scheme, protect personal information and the content of the communications, provide access to emergency calls free of charge, provide directory assistance services&mdash;and, as we heard the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) say in this House yesterday, at no fee&mdash;provide itemised billing and provide carrier preselection and dialcode override.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Having said all that, on 19 February that minister for communications, Minister Alston, who does listen&mdash;who the member for Hunter claims will not listen&mdash;will be visiting the electorate of Paterson and, during the day, will be visiting Dungog, a town not 70 kilometres from the heart of Newcastle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This township, despite their many pleadings to the former member for Paterson and the government, still has no mobile phone service. But I am determined to deliver. Let me assure you again: we are committed, as we said in the election, and we will deliver. We will deliver a mobile phone service to the people of Dungog and the rest of rural and regional Australia.What do those who claim to be the only members in this place capable of defending rural Australia say right now?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me comment on some of the pretty broad ranging aspects of what the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) had to say. They were pretty broad. They do not really deal with many of the issues for people that live in regional Australia or live in the bush, issues like digital data capacity on which a report came down a week or so ago that the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) has been trying to shunt away. When the member for Paterson has the strength to take up this issue and tackle Minister Alston in the party room on the issue of what the people in the bush are going to get, then I will give him some credit. But to just come into the House and to say a lot of words is not going to achieve the result that people in the bush need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue before the House is a huge package of legislation which currently regulates the communications industry and overhauls the current industry structure. My interest is in respect of a small part of this, but it is the most important&mdash;that is, the universal service regime. This includes a section on universal service obligation. The member for Paterson is now scurrying out of the chamber. He will not sit here and listen to what I have to say. No, he was able to attack me while I had to sit here, and you gave him good protection, Madam Deputy Speaker.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="913">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the biggest problem is the definition and the future definition of the standard telephone service. In the past we have had a universal service obligation that basically set a standard telephone service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue is an evolutionary thing. It was something that was coming up to whatever government was in power at this time. It is not a matter of saying that the past government could have rectified or could have done something on this. This is a matter of evolution, and the process is ongoing. It is coming up to decision&hyphen;making time now. Decision&hyphen;making time happens to be while you are in government, and you have to make that decision. How you make that decision about the universal service regime is going to be the key to what happens in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going from a standard telephone service obligation to a digital data capacity is what it is all about, especially in parts of my state of Tasmania. If we do not achieve a broader perspective than what the universal service regime says now, we will not be able to pass into the new era and get on the superhighway and all that that encompasses. It will leave our industry, our educational facilities and everything else far behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister that was being praised by the member for Paterson set up a committee to give him some ideas and to give him a report on this matter. He put quite a lot of people on that committee, called the Review Group: people from the National Farmers Federation, consumers of telecommunications and all the main operators in the industry&mdash;Telstra, Optus and Vodafone. He really set up a pretty powerful group to review the very essence of his legislation. He also has had some relationship over a period with a bloke named Professor Henry Ergas&mdash;a visiting professor at the Centre for Research in Network Economics and Communications, University of Auckland&mdash;in relation to academic studies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That review committee, that is, everyone from the National Farmers Federation to the major carriers, to consumer organisations&mdash;this would be all news, probably, to the member for Paterson&mdash;came down with a review that said that we should go to a universal obligation that incorporates digital data 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> capacity, that is, to put people on the Internet in the bush, to give them the opportunity of connecting to the superhighway because, unless we put that obligation in, there will be no way, in a system that is driven by the market, that we will have any opportunity of achieving that in the bush because the economics will not stack up and places like my state of Tasmania will probably miss out. Four hundred thousand people will not be a big enough market, let alone all those other small regional centres that a lot of people who sit on that side of the House would claim to represent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So they are not across the issue. Otherwise, as I said, like the member for Paterson, they would be in the party room, into the minister saying, `What does this actually mean for us out in regional Australia?' It means that those in regional Australia will fail to achieve their potential and or to have the opportunity of using modern communications for the future economic development of their regions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So after setting up this high&hyphen;powered committee and getting an old friend, a professor, onto the committee, he then accepts the committee's report. But there is a minority report from the professor from New Zealand, who cans what everybody else has done and says that the country cannot afford it, that it is going to cost $200 million, et cetera. So he comes in to wipe off the bush, to wipe off regional Australia. That was his job. I think he probably got a bit of a shock that the rest of the committee came down with a proposition which actually looked at the overall wellbeing of the country. They came down with a recommendation that the service obligation should include a digital data capacity. Of course the professor, the one&hyphen;man band with the one&hyphen;man band report, came down with his report. The minister lifted that report up and tried to give it as much status as the other nine people who sat on that committee. By doing so, he failed regional Australia and he failed the bush in every way possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, you have to change your position, and the member for Paterson and the other members on that side of the chamber have to take heart, get into their party room and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="914"> basically make sure the minister does the right thing by the service obligation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The process has been extensively written up and I wanted to touch on a couple of the things put forward by Professor Ergas in his dissenting report, in which he really did pay out on the rest of the committee. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, Steve Lewis wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Providing access to digital data services for all Australians by 2000 could impose a capitals cost to the telecommunications industry of up to $2.5 billion.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I was mistaken. I said $200 million, but $2.5 billion was his claim. To go back to the quote, the $2.5 billion would `lead to higher charges for residential consumers'. He is trying to say that everybody else is going to have to pay more to give this obligation to regional Australia. So he is running the minister's line and, I guess, if the minister's line is being run, that is the government's line, and that is the line of all those members from regional Australia because they are taking no different view. The member for Paterson did not take any different view in here this morning&mdash;so they are running the same line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting to see the response to that from some of the other people who were on that committee. The assistant director of the National Farmers Federation, Ms Julie Austin, had something to say in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 30 January:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am very disappointed that Henry Ergas has put in a dissenting report, having gone through six months of informed debate on this review.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So these people of high capacity and of concern and understanding of the industry, who put in a lot of work for six months, have come down with a recommendation to government&mdash;and the old professor, who was put on by the minister to carry the day, has lobbed in with a little report to try to break up what everybody else has done. The minister has tried to use his weight to lift the report up as well but, of course, he has failed miserably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has failed miserably because people are aware that, if this obligation is not changed and the government does not have an obligation to regional Australia, they will be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the losers. It just fits into everything else that this government is doing to regional Australia. They are tearing every government service out of it and they have been doing that since the last budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The review committee came down with a recommendation. After taking good evidence, they emphasised the need for the universal service obligations to include digital data capacity, so we can go from the old telephone with the old copper wires to a cable that can carry all the new forms of communications into a business or an education facility in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You just cannot do that with a mobile phone, and I do not think the member for Paterson is aware of that. I do not think the mobile phone has the capacity to deliver that service. But I know that is the line that has been fed to all the members on the government back bench&mdash;that is, `Everything is all right because everyone will have a mobile phone.' If you are going to have a mobile phone, you will pay time charges on that as well. So what about the regions? It is a little more complex and difficult than that. Unless it is done by Telstra, unless it is done as a service obligation right across our country, one heck of a lot of people are going to miss out on the opportunity of utilising this new technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the few things we were able to fight for in my electorate in Tasmania was the opportunity for people to utilise the new technologies and communications so they could become a part of the new world superhighway. That was slashed by a fellow Tasmanian, the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">About 250 old Social Security computers were going to go on to the tip, but we had them installed in community organisations, in the back of town halls and in supper rooms in halls out in the byways of my electorate and in other parts of Tasmania, so that kids who had no access to computers and communities that had no access to networks were able to come in and utilise that CIN network&mdash;the community information network, as we called it. Those kids out in the isolated areas of my electorate got the opportunity to talk to kids 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="915"> in the United States of America. They did not have those opportunities before then, but of course that idea was a little too far and too visionary for ministers in this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government gave that idea a good old slice as the budget ran its course through the mysterious budget holes and black holes that kept emerging throughout the government. Now those black holes are starting to emerge on the ministers as they sit on the front bench every day. More black holes start to come across them. Even a black veil, I would say, is starting to emerge. Which ministers today will have a black veil dragged across their faces and will need other government members to stand and defend them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Will we have the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) coming in to the House again at 7 o'clock tonight? Well, parliament should rise at about 6, so will he come in at 5 o'clock today? Will he come in here to justify or rectify what he has said during question time? Will he have to make another explanation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister cannot stand up during question time and answer questions. He has to equivocate. He has to go back and check what he said and then come back into the House sometime later. The Prime Minister really has lost the plot. He does not know what is happening inside his government and has lost the overall role that he should be playing&mdash;that is, governing Australia.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A whole variety of communications issues really do pose as a real difficulty throughout Tasmania.

If you leave it to market forces to deliver it to regional Australia, it will not happen. The government will be condemned for doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of whether we are going to have to pay for calling 013 has not been ruled out yet. The minister in the Senate yesterday, in answer to two questions, said that it is still up there, and the Prime Minister had only said that it was something he would have to have a look at&mdash;another `look at'. The Prime Minister is becoming known as the `mirror'&mdash;`I will look into it and get back to the parliament.' It has not been ruled out, so that is another charge that could come in, and that should not happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Consumers Association said that digital capacity is a vital tool for Australia when we are entering the 21st century. It is interesting that this discussion, as I have said, is being based around the dissenting report and not the main report.

And rightfully so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you put in six months of hard work, along with people from the industry and the consumer base, you would naturally be pretty disappointed when the minister puts more emphasis on one person's dissenting report&mdash;which everybody can see is a political exercise&mdash;than the work which otherwise is done on a fair&hyphen;dinkum basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has failed to give regional Australia an opportunity.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to join this debate on telecommunications. As a member, and a former candidate, I have been confronted with the situation where telecommunications carriers have had powers of land access and blanket&hyphen;style immunities&mdash;emergency powers, in effect&mdash;from both state and local planning and environment laws.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It seems that in return for the financial risk that is associated with any major infrastructure development, the ALP made special access and immunity provisions for telecommunications carriers in their 1991 telecommunications code. The immunity provisions quite sensibly included such things as koalas and migratory birds but amazingly took no account of the concerns that local communities had about the potential health effects of mobile phone towers and took no account of state and local planning laws which relate to visual amenity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That immunity that the carriers have enjoyed has witnessed overhead cabling being duplicated and telecommunications towers being erected without reference to the local community. Fortunately, in South Australia there has been a strong emphasis on linking underground power to environmental or traffic issues. Installing underground power lines in new subdivisions has been made compulsory under state law since the early 1980s. Recently the state government announced a doubling of funding for undergrounding of powerlines, which is expected to result in 20 kilometres of powerlines being placed underground each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the aim of this legislative package that any future development will necessarily incorporate extensive community consultation. After 1 July 1997, carriers must follow state and territory planning laws, with a three&hyphen;month exemption for installations which have already received approval and have commenced construction. It is my belief that a lack of meaningful consultation with relevant communities has contributed in large part to the atmosphere of distrust and uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill recognises that in the 1990s communities are more concerned with urban and environmental amenity and that the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> community is less inclined to accept the exemptions telecommunications companies have enjoyed in the past. The previous code allowed unreasonable behaviour. Unreasonable is surely the only way that you can describe Vodafone's decision to erect a mobile phone tower near the Mitcham Community Court&mdash;40 metres away from a kindergarten. Before they applied for approval to put the mobile phone tower at that site, their preferred option was to install a tower right next to the Mitcham Girls High School.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That decision has placed the kindergarten's future in jeopardy and has resulted in a community which is frustrated at the lack of avenues of appeal they have against a telecommunications carrier. In fact, the last resort of the local community has been to picket the site for the last two months to prevent construction of this tower. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I am aware that a South Australian government investigation concluded in the early part of 1996 that `there are no substantiated or convincing biological effects that could lead to adverse health effects from exposure to radio frequency around base stations', I am pleased to be able to report that the government has committed $4&half; million to the National Health and Medical Research Council for further research over the next five years into the possible contribution of mobile telephone towers to health problems, such as childhood leukemia. While the jury is still out, my sympathies lie with the parents of young children who wish to err on the side of caution. I do not think that is an unreasonable stance.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">It must also satisfy the ACA that the facilities are relevant to the local network and of necessary advantage to the local community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In speaking in favour of the collection of bills that will govern the area of telecommunications after 1 July this year, I believe it is important to state clearly that the government is firmly committed to maintaining the universal service obligation. That is, under the telecommunications carriers universal service obligation, a standard telephone service must be made available to all people in Australia. It has never been the government's intention to water down such a regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) released just last Thursday two reports assessing whether the standard telephone service should be upgraded. The minister established the review to assess whether the rapid changes in technologies and increased usage of advanced communications, like fax, e-mail and the Internet, warranted upgrading the standard telephone service. The minister has been `particularly concerned to ensure that any change to the current arrangements does not impose undue costs on users of the ordinary telephone service'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from questions surrounding the issue of a universal service regime, the minister's comments illustrate the difficulty of legislating in an area where new technologies are literally emerging on a daily basis. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 21 January stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The telecommunications industry (is) headed for an unprecedented shake&hyphen;up in the next twelve months as new `Internet&hyphen;voice' technologies mature . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hard on the heels of OzEmail's `voice over the Internet' announcement by former Prime Minister Paul Keating, US based voice/data specialist Micom has announced a product that allows high&hyphen;quality voice traffic over the Internet.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For traditional telephone companies, the new technologies represent a significant threat to their long&hyphen;held franchises for lucrative, long distance phone traffic.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . (With) cheap, Internet&hyphen;based telephone calls will come a forced overhaul of the telecommunications industry on a global scale.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, no sooner has the target stopped and the legislator has been able to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> look down at the existing code with a view to amendment than the legislator has looked up only to find that the target has moved again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In such an environment, the responsible task of government is to set up a framework which will be able to accommodate ongoing rapid technology changes. Such a framework requires sound principles, and I am pleased to be able to report to the House that this package of legislation has incorporated such principles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The central theme of this legislative package is that the full benefits of a truly competitive market in telecommunications will be gained only when all carriers and service providers, including Telstra, are given the flexibility to engage in normal competitive conduct. Australian consumers will benefit from such flexibility. As stated above, attempts at codifying rigid regulations are exercises akin to reaping the wind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Underlying this central theme of competitiveness is the clearly enunciated and logically consistent principle of governments being vested with the power to prohibit the various forms of anti-competitive conduct. I speak here specifically of the Trade Practices Amendment (Telecommunications) Bill and the recognition contained therein that total reliance on general trade practices law to constrain anti-competitive conduct might in some cases prove ineffective in avoiding the rapid damage to competition that this type of conduct could cause. This bill recognises the large residual market power that Telstra still has and seeks to supplement part 4 of the Trade Practices Act by increasing the ability of the ACCC to respond swiftly where anti-competitive conduct is evident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The likely benefits of competition are innumerable, but let me highlight one probable development. The Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> recently reported that the cost of long distance telephone calls from Adelaide will be cut by up to 48 per cent when AAP Telecommunications enters the residential phone market this year. The article said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Like other telecommunications carriers, AAPT is waiting for the July 1 deregulation of the industry, which is expected to increase already stiff competition.  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="918">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . AAPT would offer cheaper rates than Telstra's standard published rates, with discounts of up to 48 per cent for calls to `top 10' countries&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">which are countries like the UK, the United States and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Discounts for national calls would start at 21 per cent off Telstra's standard rate, compared with at least 30 per cent off for large business customers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In closing, I would like to state that the open market entry arrangements envisaged by this package will not be implemented to the detriment of consumer and community welfare. Customer protection obligations applying to existing carriers&mdash;obligations such as the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, requirements to provide operator and directory assistance services and itemised bills, untimed local call obligations and the proposed customer service guarantee&mdash;will be extended to service providers as appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly pleased that the powers and immunities of the carriers have been addressed and that carriers will no longer be able to ignore state and local planning laws. I am pleased that the deficiencies of the ALP's 1991 code have been addressed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did notice that the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) was in here doing a little bit of bleating.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people who heard the PM make the commitment on ISDN to rural and regional Australia and those people who heard the PM at that Optus launch in Chatswood last year could not be blamed for being surprised when they picked up their newspapers today.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You could not blame people for being a little surprised by the absolute inability of the Prime Minister to make any further commitments to rural and regional Australia, by his inability to assure them that cost reductions as a result of competition will flow on to rural and regional Australia and, of course, his inability&mdash;thanks to a bit of unhelpful assistance from his own minister&mdash;to assure Australians that in future the aged in our community, or those who may be sight impaired, will have free 013 services.</PARA>

We have the Prime Minister in this chamber giving some assurances about 013s and yet at question time in the other chamber on the same day, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) was saying something a little different.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the member for Paterson may not have the capacity to keep track of the processes of both chambers of this parliament, but it would pay him to get up a little bit earlier in the morning and, following his diet induced walk, to check the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Then he may not come into this chamber ill&hyphen;informed and suggest that what I am saying is wrong, because what I am saying is absolutely right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When he was in the chamber earlier today speaking on this package of bills he was informing us all that Senator Alston will be visiting his electorate next week. I think that is wonderful because that visit will get coverage in my electorate as well, which of course neighbours the electorate of the member for Paterson. I look forward to hearing Senator Alston's apologies to the people of regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope the member for Paterson will ask the minister to explain to the people of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Hunter Valley why the legislative package before the House today will remove all explicit restrictions on price discrimination by telecommunications carriers. I hope he will ask the minister to explain what that is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why, once again, have National Party MPs and Liberal MPs representing regional electorates been so unprepared to defend their constituents? Why, once again, is the government legislating to widen the gap between the haves and the have&hyphen;nots, to widen the rift in the opportunities that exist between those living in our capital cities and those living in rural and regional Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is difficult to talk about this package of legislation without referring to the Telstra sale. I know members like the member for Paterson will point out that it is a partial sale, but I say that it is a partial sale&mdash;for now. I cannot talk about these bills without referring to the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill. I point out, once again, how that bill is going to disadvantage rural and regional Australia and how, once again, it will mean that kids, in particular, in rural and regional Australia will have limited opportunities vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis their city counterparts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Labor Party is not opposed to the basic principle of the bills before the House. We support open competition in the telecommunications industry. The shadow minister has already stated that for the record. He has also moved a number of amendments which qualify our support. We will support those amendments very strongly in the Senate to ensure that this package of bills, once dealt with by the Senate, is much fairer and protects the interests of rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Labor government started this process and the Labor Party remains strongly committed to it. Part 7 of the new bill poses some of my greatest concerns. Part 7 is about community service obligations and, in effect, that makes part 7 the most crucial component of the bill in terms of the interests of rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part 7 deals with universal service obligations which ensure that rural and regional Australians enjoy the same sort of service that those in the city enjoy. That has been the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="920"> basic principle underpinning Telstra's approach in the past. It is something which, I would have thought, both sides of politics would support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt some members on the other side will say, `Oh, yes, but part 7 is only a photocopy of part 13 of the 1991 bill.' That may be true, but they have missed the point. It is now 1997. When the 1991 legislation was drafted we were dealing with different standards in communications. The world has moved on. Telecommunications is one of our fastest growing areas in terms of technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The period between 1991 and 1997 was a significant period in the telecommunications industry. Technology has moved very fast. It is no good photocopying part 13 of the old bill over to part 7 of the new bill and saying to the opposition, `Look, what are you bleating about? This is your bill. We are setting up the same standards that you intended to put in place.' That is crazy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During my contribution to the second reading debate on the bill that proposed the partial sale of Telstra I said that, if Menzies had had the audacity&mdash;and, as conservative as he was, I do not think it ever entered the mind of Menzies to flog off our telecommunications systems&mdash;to privatise the Postmaster&hyphen;General's Department and set in place within legislation the standard telephone service which existed at the time, we would still be turning that little handle and wondering whether the exchange lady was listening in. It is exactly the same thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot apply the standard of the Menzies era to 1997, nor can you apply the standard of 1991 to the current situation. That is preposterous. The member for Paterson smiles, and I know he is doing so because he agrees that people in his electorate&mdash;in Maitland, Port Stephens and in Dungog, in particular&mdash;who have children studying want to access the Internet and all the things that go beyond it&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just made the point that the telecommunications industry changes very quickly and so entrenched in any legislation must be an opportunity to constantly review what is the standard telephone service. We have gone well beyond the day when the telephony handset represents what should be the expectations of Australians, we need a lot more today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does Senator Alston say about all of this? What is his response? He said, `That's okay, we will deal with this by regulation. To show what a nice guy I am I will set up a review group.' He did set up a review group. With great fanfare last year he announced his review group. I must say it included, as you have pointed out, Mr Deputy Speaker, a lot of eminent people and a lot of people well placed to, on balance, determine what in 1997 and beyond should represent a standard telephone service, what should be the expectation of people in terms of the standard telephone service in light of the fact that technology is moving so fast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you pointed out, Mr Deputy Speaker, the review group included people from Telstra, from Optus, from Vodafone, from the Australian Telecommunications User Group, from the National Farmers Federation and, most importantly, Mr Jock Given, a respected director of the Communications Law Centre at the University of New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, as you also pointed out, Mr Deputy Speaker, the group also included a Professor Henry Ergas. We all know by now, of course, thanks partly to your contribution, Mr Deputy Speaker, that Professor Ergas actually&mdash;</PARA>

He is the guy who has a hotline to Senator Alston's desk. I am told on good advice that he is the only person who can pick up a phone to Senator Alston's office at any time and get straight on the line. He is the one calling the shots.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the result of the review group's deliberations? Well, nine out of 10 members of the group recommended a significant expansion in what should be the definition of a standard telephone service, taking into account both the fast moving technology and the cost constraints of providing a decent level of community service obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Professor Ergas did not agree. He delivered a one-man dissenting report. This should not come as any surprise. We learned on that day why it was that the visiting professor&mdash;we have had one of those in here before&mdash;was put on the review group. He was put on there to do a very important job. Remember, they want to sell one&hyphen;third of Telstra. Who is going to buy one-third of Telstra if they have to supply the sort of community service obligations that nine of the review group want to impose? It is going to be difficult enough to flood the market with something like Telstra and expect people to take up shares, but who is going to show an interest if a prospective purchaser is going to have to deliver to rural and regional Australia decent standard services? Who is going to show an interest?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It all becomes very clear what Professor Ergas's role on the committee is. You do not have to take my word for it. The member for Paterson, indeed, does not have to take my word for it. You have only got to read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 30 January where the headline is:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Professor Ergas is saying is that you are not going to sell a third of Telstra in an already struggling market if prospective buyers are going to be expected to provide the sorts of community service obligations that have been recommended by the overwhelming majority of the review group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do not talk to me about whether the legislation is passed or not. That is hurdle number two.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very briefly, there are really two explanations for Senator Alston's reluctance on these community service obligations.

There were a number of points in his speech which I would like to refer to a little later on in the debate. I would like to thank him for at least acknowledging that the previous Labor government did fail to keep up with changes in technology. He talks about `How are we supposed to know what is going to happen down the track?' When you are the government there is an element of anticipation and an element of planning that needs to take place. The ALP was caught in the wake of technological change and, at least, the honourable member for Hunter has had the decency to own up to something which his colleagues have failed to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the lead&hyphen;up to the 21st century, the legislation being debated will be the foundation on which the future of the telecommuni 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cations industry in Australia will be built. The need for the package of bills is self&hyphen;evident. In our modern society, the ability to communicate quickly and easily with others is no longer a privilege or a luxury but a right, even a necessity&mdash;be it in business or socially.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the member for Hunter would agree with that, considering that he was referring to the rapid advancements in technology. We have seen some of those rapid advancements and, of course, Australians generally have a propensity to use the latest products and services that are available. Those services are certainly far different today from what they were yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Communications pioneers of the last century and early this century, such as Edison, Bell, Marconi and Baird, would all be amazed at the advances and the integration of their early inventions into what is now considered the superhighway. In fact, as recently as last Tuesday, three modern superhighway pioneers&mdash;Australian professors Rodney Tucker and Allan Snyder, and Dr Gottfried Ungerboek from Austria&mdash;were honoured by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for their major contribution to modern telecommunications in the form of optic fibres. It is truly a significant achievement, and those three gentlemen rank with those that I mentioned earlier on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Information technology, of which telecommunications is a large and vital component, is in fact the fastest growing industry in the world. My electorate of Deakin is part of Australia's largest IT region. It is because of such growth that governments must respond quickly to the changing environment&mdash;respond, as the member for Hunter has stated, before we as a government are left in its wake and before the needs and the rights of the public are forsaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party, through its original 1991 bill, failed to respond to, failed to anticipate, the new world order in telecommunications. These bills will certainly redress the wrong, redress the balance that is so sought after by the Australian public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislative package will provide an environment, as of July 1997, in which 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="923"> Deakin businesses and consumers will get maximum value. It is based on a world&hyphen;class infrastructure using the latest technology, access to a range of service providers all offering in a competitive manner diverse and innovative services. And, of course, it will do this through contestable market strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward to the providers passing on any possible benefits to the people of Deakin and to other Australians, whether it be in the form of an increase in quality, lower prices or diverse products and services. A failure to do so is a breach of the expectations and the promises so readily created in the mind of the public by many of these providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's telecommunications framework enables any number of businesses to operate as carriers. Existing distinctions between fixed and mobile services will be removed and, importantly, new carriers will not face an imposed burden to build their own network. If they did, we would not have two cables strung up and down Maroondah Highway or Whitehorse Road through my electorate but potentially three or four. We would not have 36 mobile towers but potentially 100 within the 59 square kilometre region of the electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My comments today will concentrate on three key aspects of the new framework: firstly, the community and consumer safeguards, including untimed local calls; secondly, anti&hyphen;competitive conduct; and, thirdly, the powers and immunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within the framework, the Telecommunications Bill 1996 provides world&hyphen;class consumer and community safeguards. The bill's provisions are more comprehensive and better developed than those originally introduced by Labor&mdash;which in itself is an acknowledgment of Labor's failure to deal with the issues at a time when it first introduced its bill.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, we now have around 20 consumer safeguards included in these bills. Some are improvements on existing mechanisms; some are new. I would like to briefly refer to a few of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The universal service regime allows for the ready upgrade of the universal service obligation. The honourable member for Hunter spent most of his speech denigrating that service obligation. The standard telephone 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> service review addresses the needs of people with a disability. Mandatory industry standards, emergency call services, the provision of operator and directory assistance, and itemised bills are all safeguards that are included within the current framework. Of course, another one is the highly politicised issue of price controls. The untimed local call obligation that we promised has not only been maintained but extended. Residential customers have been given the legislated right to untimed local calls for non&hyphen;voice as well as voice calls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of anticompetitive conduct, the benefits of a truly competitive market will only be gained when all carriers and service providers are given the ability to engage in normal competitive behaviour. To stifle such competition will not deliver the benefits demanded by the public. However, the government has determined that some competition regulation should remain to counter the residual market power which incumbent players have over any newcomers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, will be able to respond swiftly where anticompetitive conduct is evident. It can do so by taking direct action against conduct which substantially lessens competition or which otherwise breaches key trade practices provisions. One regulatory mechanism that is available to the ACCC is the ability to seek an injunction and issue a competition notice but only where certain breaches take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aspects of this bill address the issue of the powers of carriers and immunity from specific requirements. The new code strikes a balance between on the one hand giving the community a greater say in the rollout of infrastructure, and placing telecommunications into state based land planning regimes, and on the other hand ensuring that Australia gets a world class telecommunications infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wide&hyphen;ranging immunity provisions for `prescribed activities' have been rejected by this government. The far-reaching powers afforded to the carriers and providers under Labor's 1991 bill have been wound back. This is a recognition by the government that local communities have a greater emphasis on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="924"> urban and environmental amenity. The look and feel of their local landscapes is rightfully very important. The power to be able to exercise some sort of control, through the planning regimes in each state, is extremely important and affords them a say in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in saying this, the framework must allow the Commonwealth some limited rights of intervention. These rights of intervention exist in particular areas such as low impact facilities, maintenance and temporary defence facilities. All of these will be subject to a code of service. The new rules, in part, continue with established telecommunications policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One area that deserves special attention, and which has received such attention by many speakers this morning, is that of pay television cabling. It is significant because of the problems that have arisen from the failure of the previous Labor government's code, the failure by the previous Labor government to acknowledge the blight, the anxiety and the uproar that such cabling would cause in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate, the community's objection to the rollout of broadband cable and mobile towers has been well recognised and expressed to both the minister, and to me, by my constituents. Hours of consideration and negotiation have gone into this package. Government backbenchers have listened long and hard to the voices of their electorate. The honourable member for Hunter and the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams) readily denigrated the minister. But, to his credit, he has listened to the backbenchers and he has welcomed their input in the drafting of this bill. Following the concerns of individuals and councils within the Deakin electorate, the framework now includes new obligations on these carriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Three important obligations worth mentioning are that there is to be no broadband cabling unless specifically authorised by the relevant state or territory authority; the carriers must collocate their towers unless it is not technically feasible; and undergrounding at major intersections is to take place and, where 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> possible, if undergrounding facilities exist, that is to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The environmental amenity of some parts of the Deakin electorate has clearly been affected by the intrusion of overhead cabling. Residents throughout my electorate and, in particular, those in the environmentally sensitive areas, such as in Blackburn, Mitcham and Ringwood North, have complained bitterly about the intrusion of cables and towers into their streets. Fortunately, pockets within the electorate have been spared the ugly blight of the cables&mdash;pockets such as the Bellbird area in Blackburn, which has a heritage classification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To install the cables, what has had to take place is that nature strip trees have been pruned, in some cases with obvious overenthusiasm, in some cases in a unilateral manner, quite contrary to agreements that have been struck between the local council and the carrier. At one stage, peak hour traffic on the Maroondah Highway was stalled because of a carrier's arrogant and devil&hyphen;may&hyphen;care approach to directives from the local council and, in fact, even from the police.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who can the people of Deakin, my constituents, thank for such intrusion? They can only thank one particular body in Australia and that is the Labor government, now in opposition. That is whom they can thank and their outrage will remain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the electorate is not alone. Many suburbs throughout Melbourne and Sydney have been the focus of Optus and Telstra's rollout. Until last December, of course, local communities had been powerless to act in any strategic manner. Labor's policy failures, as with failures in other areas, will continue to be felt by the residents of Deakin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately for my constituents, a combination of factors, such as the agreement between the carriers, the Labor government's failure to acknowledge its consequences, the legally binding nature of the agreement and the investment of $18 billion on infrastructure and network, has meant that there is no significant turning back possible in those streets. There can be no pulling down of cables at this stage, but I certainly look 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="925"> forward to the day when those cables do come down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the Local Government Authority in Victoria remains critical of the new bills. But it is easy for the local government authority to be so dismissive and rattle the sabre when someone else, in this case the federal government and, in turn, my constituents, the taxpayers, would be asked to make financial restitution to the carriers, or foot the bill for undergrounding. While the cable rollout in the cities of Whitehorse and Maroondah is virtually complete, it is my hope that Deakin's pain will not be wasted and that suburbs in other capital cities and regional centres will benefit. To many Australians, the growth and power of telecommunications carriers and providers creates a sense of apprehension and unease. I look forward to these significant obligations and safeguards creating a higher level of consumer confidence in our telecommunications providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, as time goes by, the significance of the work of those early communications pioneers, Edison, Bell, Marconi and Baird will be a distant memory. Our pride in Snyder and Tucker may also dim, but the need for governments to respond to the fast paced world of the information superhighway will escalate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward to the increasing competition, to the new products and services demanded by consumers but, above all, I and the public look forward to the safeguards which all of us, the technological minnows, the technological dinosaurs, require as our security blanket. I commend the bills to the house.</PARA></SPEECH>

That was the responsibility of the previous Labor government and it has now become the responsibility of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are sections of this legislation that the opposition is prepared to support since much of it was designed by us. But let me say this too, there are vast sections of this legislation which were not designed by us, nor would they have been designed by us. There are sections of this legislation, too, which effectively repudiate an undertaking that was given by the present Prime Minister (Mr Howard) prior to the last election.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard two contributions to this debate today. I heard a contribution from my colleague, Joel Fitzgibbon, the member for Hunter, and I heard a contribution as well from Bob Baldwin, the member for Paterson. The interesting point of contrast about those 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="926"> two contributions was that Joel Fitzgibbon, the member for Hunter, took the fight right up to the government. He is concerned about the access that his constituents will have to this modern technology. He knows that to a very large extent there are many areas in his electorate for which it will not be available. He took the fight to the government. However, the member for Paterson, Bob Baldwin, came in here and did not cease issuing excuses for the fact that the government has been so deficient as far as this legislation is concerned and so deficient in the whole area of developing telecommunications technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I referred as well to that very firm, unqualified undertaking that had been given by the present Prime Minister to rural and regional Australia, to provincial Australia, to all of those people who were prepared at that time to put their faith in the word of the present Prime Minister that they would have access to those services. We know that Senator Alston, the minister, has been backtracking ever since. What we want to know, on this side of the chamber, is how many of those representatives on the government benches who represent rural and provincial Australia have hammered on Senator Alston's door, have raised the issue in their party meeting, have insisted that that obligation, that undertaking, firm and unqualified as it was, would be delivered to their constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They need to go back to their electorates, either this evening or tomorrow, and answer to their constituents about the position that they have adopted in here. Of course, there are so many of them who could have taken the opportunity to defend the government but found it impossible to do so, absolutely impossible to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will not allow the government to get by on this. The National Farmers Federation, for example, agreed to the part privatisation of Telstra on the assumption that the Prime Minister would deliver that promise. All of those people in rural and provincial Australia who delivered votes to present government members did so on the basis of that obligation that was given, that their kids, like kids in the leafy suburbs of the North Shore, would have access to all of that high tech telecommunica

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I think all Australians will welcome the fact that in January 1977 employment increased by 38,400. There were 38,400 new jobs created in the month of January 1997, bringing total growth since June 1996 to 106,400 persons. Since March 1996 there have been 158,900 jobs created in the Australian economy. Youth unemployment fell by 11.4 per cent in January and the youth unemployment rate fell from 30.4 per cent to 27.3 per cent. I hope the Labor Party welcomes that fall in the youth unemployment rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the budget forward estimates and the forecast that was made of employment growth of two per cent throughout the year, the seasonally adjusted data shows that employment growth in the seven months since June 1996 has averaged around 15,000 persons per month. For the remainder of 1996&hyphen;97, employment growth needs to average around 12,000 persons per month to achieve the government's forecast of two per cent growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABS release on the labour force today also makes the point that, since the sampling technique changed, they have noted a change in responses and the ABS is considering whether or not the methodology will be revised with a possible cumulative effect on the estimate of employment, revised upwards, of between 36,000 and 54,000 people. That is a matter for the ABS and the ABS is considering that at the moment. If the ABS were to revise up the mean of those two figures, the budget forecast for employment would be met already.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government does not say that we can rest on our laurels in relation to employment or unemployment. There is a lot of work to be done. There is a lot of work to make sure 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that we continue to encourage small business, that we continue to have that low inflation and low interest rate environment and that we continue with programs such as that the Prime Minister has announced on the scourge of youth unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think all Australians&mdash;and I hope both sides of this House&mdash;will welcome the news today on employment and will welcome the fact that those budget forecasts are on track. As it turns out, there is every reason to believe they will be met, if not more so. I hope that this House welcomes the growth in relation to employment. As I said earlier, one cannot dwell too much on one month's figures only. But what we have seen over recent months is a positive trend in employment, good jobs growth in relation to those opportunities but, of course, continuing work needing to be done to improve job prospects for all Australians.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday in the House, the honourable member for Melbourne asked a series of questions, in conjunction with the Leader of the Opposition, which were designed to give the impression that I and Senator Herron had been involved in an inappropriate act; that is, that we were in fact providing some inducement or bribe to people on the board of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="929"> Civil Aviation Safety Authority. This was recorded by the member for Melbourne in a press conference held after question time. This was a breach of section 73 of the Crimes Act and, in fact, we were guilty of a crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, I have today listened to an interview with Justice Fisher, who is chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Justice Fisher was appointed by the former Minister for Transport to that position. You have to remember what the claims were. They are that I or Senator Herron was illegally inducing or bribing Ms Hollows to leave the board and that we had said that, if she left the board of CASA, she would get another job in the Aboriginal health area.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition had two chances. He was not only minister for employment&mdash;and he failed miserably in that portfolio&mdash;but Minister for Finance. He was the Minister for Finance who did not have the guts to stand up to Paul Keating's big spending policies that led to $70 billion of accumulated deficits, drove interest rates up and destroyed so many small businesses and jobs around Australia&mdash;a gutless Leader of the Opposition who has not got the guts to support the policies that the government is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> putting in place to help the young unemployed people who were the victims of his policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most encouraging features of today's statistics has been the fall in full-time unemployment amongst young people. Teenage unemployment&mdash;are you listening to this, because you obviously did not pick it up last time?&mdash;fell from 30.4 per cent to 27.3 per cent, a very significant fall. We do not want to make too much of one month's figures, but the fact is that that is a very significant fall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are still too many young people unemployed, and many of these young people have become entrenched in unemployment and isolated from their communities. That is precisely what the government's work for the dole scheme is designed to address. It is designed to bring many of these young people out of isolation and to give their communities the opportunity to work with them, to bring them back into community life and to restore their self-esteem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no surprise, of course, that the Leader of the Opposition is against this scheme, because the unions have told him that they will not cop it and he is too weak to do anything about it or stand up to them. Today's jobs figures are just a step along the road to rebuilding employment opportunities in this country, but they are encouraging news.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for her question and the fact that she did indicate she would ask a question on this topic.

They were there pursuant to our arrangements and our obligations under SEATO and it was separate from our involvement with the Vietnam war.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ubon is in fact a Royal Thai Air Force base, and there were two reasons that were considered specifically by the Committee of Inquiry into Defence and Defence Related Awards dealing with why they did not recommend that the Vietnam Medal be awarded but did in fact recommend that the ASM 1945&hyphen;75 with clasp Thailand be awarded. Indeed, that award is being made, recognising the service they gave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason that the committee recommended that the Vietnam Medal could not be awarded was simply that the area designated for the award of that medal did not include Ubon within its perimeters and the committee did not consider that it ought to be changed. The second reason related to the rules of engagement which were set down for that particular contingent. They were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That no aircraft will be directed to investigate any identified contacts unless specifically requested by the Royal Thai government and, secondly, that no aircraft will attack unless fired upon.</PARA>

As the Labor Party has demonstrated with its response to the government's proposals for work for the dole, as the Labor Party has demonstrated in relation to Hindmarsh bridge and as the Labor Party now demonstrates in relation to the two-year waiting period for migrants, it is utterly out of touch with the concerns and aspirations of mainstream Australian taxpayers.</PARA>

Yes, I have seen those criticisms and in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>  this morning there is an article headed `Reforms threaten meat exports'. At the outset I want to reassure the House that the Commonwealth's planned reforms are in fact all about improving food safety and quality as a vital investment in this country in securing new and existing markets. Industry and government together recognise that consumers here and abroad want and demand ever higher standards of food safety. Better processes will be required in the future to meet those rising expectations. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The approach that we are adopting, the so-called HACCP based system, agreed by all Australian governments, already implemented in Victoria and increasingly now being picked up by the other states, is now used extensively worldwide in food production right across the region. The point that needs to be understood by some of these people, including Ms Felicity Rafferty, is that the game has moved on. Things change. I know that sometimes that is hard for people like to Felicity to recognise, but these are the not the old days where visual inspection of carcasses was the best way to secure food safety in the meat industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These days the safety and quality issues of the 1990s go to the heart of things like micro&hyphen;biological contamination and residues. They need much more sophisticated approaches to pick up. So, in short, criticism from Felicity Rafferty of the CPSU is a travesty in this area. It is really all about protecting a job&mdash;her job&mdash;and the few hundred people that she represents, regardless of the implication for the 50,000 other Australian workers, most of them in the regions, who work in this massive Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great irony in all of this is that in referring in her rather emotive and sensational way to the tragic deaths that we have seen in America and in this country from things like E.coli in recent times, she overlooks the very real probability that those sad deaths would have been avoided if the system that we are developing had been put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is about protecting and enhancing our export opportunities. It is hardly going to put consumers at risk or implement processes that cannot be justified here or internationally. Apart from anything else, we have seen from the international experience what BSE has done to consumer confidence amongst meat eaters. We are putting in place total quality control systems which will remain under the watchful eyes of government employed regulators. Those measures are designed to maximise, not minimise, our opportunities in our markets here and aboard.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Last November I became concerned that there was very little consensus or goodwill in the private health sector. So back then I convened the first in a series of round table discussions with hospitals, doctors, insurers and consumers to see whether there could be common ground found on a number of issues. I am pleased to say that the last meeting occurred yesterday and consensus has emerged on a number of issues which I think will be very positive for consumers. They are simplified billing, informed consent and guidelines for contractual negotiations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first is simplified billing. Anyone who has had a stint in a private hospital will know the torrent of bills that turns up after a hospital stay. My last experience with that was two years ago when my son had a two day stay in intensive care. I got something like 35 bills for that two day stay over the next five months. That is what over 10 per cent of people put as their major reason for dropping private health cover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Doctors, hospitals and funds have agreed to cooperate on a number on trials looking at different methods of simplified billing. It may not get down to just one bill, but it offers very real prospects of, for the first time, being able to do something that is very positive for consumers. It also recognises that the present system is totally unsatisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing is informed consent. Most people find it nearly impossible to find out how much they will be up for for an episode of care. While individual surgeons may give 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their fees in the out&hyphen;of&hyphen;pocket expenses, you cannot predict what the anaesthetist, the radiologist, the pathologist and the other doctors working in the area are going to charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have agreed to set up a group to design and trial different procedures to give informed consent for the public. It may be in the end that the public will, at best, only be able to be given a range of expectations because you cannot always predict what is going to happen post&hyphen;operatively. There is also goodwill here and a willingness to accept that the public has a right to have some idea of what they are going to be up for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, hospitals and funds have agreed that there should be some guidelines for contract negotiations particularly when this impinges on the rights of consumers. Negotiations between hospitals and funds are quite new. They are still exploring their ways. I get a torrent of complaints from insurers and then I get exactly the same complaints about the insurers from the funds. In the end though, they both should be interested in the public. I do not want to see the public getting squeezed or forgotten in these contract negotiations. I thank all parts of the health industry and also the consumers for their excellent input. Hopefully something worth while will come out of it for the public.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Griffith for his question. It would be well known to many that he is a great supporter of local government having spent nine years on the Brisbane City Council. In the current financial year, 1996-97, the Commonwealth provided $1.2 billion in grants to local councils. This was an increase in the 1995-96 level of nearly $47 million. It is an increase that represents a four per cent increase, and that is in both dollar terms and real terms. The increase honoured a major election promise and undertaking of the coalition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The FAGs pay for approximately 10 per cent of all local government income and some smaller regional and rural councils receive up to 50 per cent of their income from these grants. Using the Australian Local Government Association classifications of urban, rural and urban regional councils, in 1996-97, urban councils received $385 million, urban regional councils received $323 million and rural councils received $475 million. The total grants to rural and regional councils is, therefore, $779 million. This represents 67 per cent of the total Commonwealth grants to local councils.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important point is that, of that nearly $47 million increase in 1996-97, rural and regional councils received 77 per cent, or $35 million, of that total increase. These are untied funds. They are funds that are used by councils to build roads and bridges, health clinics, regional centres, maintain parks and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="940"> do a whole range of other things such as collect garbage and other essential services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This funding is helping to generate jobs. It is recognised that it helps to generate opportunities in small business.

<PARA STYLE="Para">This fiasco that we have before the House today is the culmination of a prolonged vendetta pursued by the Minister for Trans 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="941"> port and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) against the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. He has sought resignations from board members. He has attacked them publicly in this House and outside this House. He has accused them of putting their own interests ahead of aviation safety in Australia. He has undertaken a war by press release against his own safety authority. He has grossly distorted the events that have occurred in regard to the resignation of Dr Liddell from the authority and the Falcon Airlines crash in order to blacken the names of the directors of Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Never with any specific charges. All the time smearing&mdash;never with any specific charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we have a situation where we have a formal `show cause' letter which he has sent, dated 28 January, to enable him to sack the board. That letter has been sent to all four board members. It is 19 pages long, and I have a copy of it here. Two of these members have four months to go in their positions. If it is not bad enough that he is engaging in this outrageous campaign of vilification and smear against the members of this board, now we have a situation where it has been uncovered that he and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) have been seeking to induce the resignation of some members of the board by offering them other positions, clearly in contravention of the ministerial guidelines and quite possibly in contravention of the Crimes Act as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the past year the minister has done the following things: he has asked in person, he has asked in writing, he has asked directly at a meeting of the board, for their resignations. His answer as to why he had to do this: `I have obligations to other people.' I would urge you to remember that quote. He claimed that they had no experience relevant to aviation, including Dr Clare Pollock, who is a safety expert. I would remind him that the name of the authority is the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. But, no, she has no relevant expertise. He misled the public about the board's role on the Ita Buttrose program. He effectively said the board gets out there and checks the planes, which, of course, it does not. It has a supervisory role.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get you the transcript if you like. It has a supervisory role; it is not the hands&hyphen;on part of the organisation. He accused the directors of putting their own interests ahead of aviation safety and that they were nothing better than a rubber stamp. He has grossly represented actions of CASA, things that the board had nothing to do with and things that imply no culpability on their part&mdash;clearly smearing them, as we saw again today, with tragic events that occurred before they were even members of the board. He has even issued press releases attacking his own authority. He has given no warning of these attacks. He has never met with the board since that initial time. He has ignored letters from CASA and he has never made any specific complaints or charges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The board was not there when the Seaview and Monarch disasters occurred. Now they and Leroy Keith are pursuing a reform program to fix up the problems that do exist in the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, and all the minister can do is attack them, undermine them and try to get rid of them by devious means such as trying to induce them through offers that are effectively corrupt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now he has gone right over the top. On 28 January, each director was sent a `show cause' letter as to why they should not be dismissed. I have a copy of this letter and it is an extraordinary document. Is there anything in there about gross incompetence? No. Is there anything in there about impropriety? No. Is there anything in there about breaching the Civil Aviation Safety Act? No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is in there? Let us have a list of just a few of the things: failing to provide a copy of the annual corporate plan, even though, in accordance with an instruction from the previous minister, the board was not to provide that plan until after the Seaview commission reported, which turned out to be October 1996. And, in spite of that, they have already got a draft to the department for their comment. But they have failed to provide a corporate plan! Taking a different view on certain aviation safety issues from the Bureau of Aviation Safety Investigation. They have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="942"> the temerity to have a different view on a few technical issues. Failing to respond to requests from the minister's adviser Mr Wallace for documents. These requests were made on 14 January, 15 January and 17 January&mdash;not 1996 but 14, 15 and 17 January 1997. In other words, we are going to dismiss independent board members of a statutory authority because they have failed to respond to a request from the minister's office for a document within about five or six working days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final example is that they are attacked because, when they were asked for material regarding the Falcon incident in Queensland, he complained that they gave too much. Only 1&half; of the five folders was relevant. That is a ground for sacking. But there is much more. It is a very entertaining document when you read it, I can tell you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The really big surprise is that what he is proposing to do is clearly unlawful. I have already indicated in question time today the legal advice from Blake Dawson Waldron, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A large number of the matters raised in the minister's letter appear to be relevant to management matters which would not usually be dealt with directly by the board. The minister's actions are quite seriously flawed and would, if challenged, be held by a court not to have provided procedural fairness to CASA or its board members.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a failure to take into account relevant considerations, failure to properly particularise the complaints, errors of law, a possible ground of apprehension of bias . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I understand Justice Fisher has written to the Prime Minister asking that he disqualify the minister for transport from acting as judge in this case because of his previous attacks on the authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This advice&mdash;and it is a hell of a lot more substantial than the flimsy one page that came from two hours work yesterday&mdash;concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His decision, if he takes it, will be an unlawful exercise of his statutory powers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Now the whole tawdry, smelly story comes to a conclusion. What has been occurring has finally started to come out with the minister's improper approaches to members of the board to try to suborn them, to try to get them to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> resign from their positions by other means. Bit by bit the truth has been dragged out, and the true measure of his desperation is emerging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 6 May last year, board member Gabi Hollows met with Senator Herron, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, and with Tim Fischer&mdash;the postman, Mr Fischer the postman&mdash;in the Prime Minister's office. He delivered a letter from Senator Herron to her. We have all seen what is in that letter, since it was finally tabled last night after Senator Herron quoted selectively from it. In fact, he quoted almost all of it except the key sentence and then refused to table it. I wonder why he did that. Could it have perhaps been a guilty conscience or was it just coincidence? The key sentence is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have discussed this matter with my ministerial colleague Mr Sharp who has assured me that he will be amenable to you retiring from your responsibilities on the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority in order to be available for an appointment in the area of Aboriginal health delivery.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Oh, the unctuousness. He is amenable. The generosity. The condescension. He is amenable to Ms Hollows resigning when in fact he has been chasing her and her fellow board members relentlessly throughout the whole period preceding this letter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then Gabi Hollows meets the minister for transport and&mdash;what a coincidence&mdash;he says, `I'd like you to resign from the CASA board. Oh, by the way, I've got a great idea. Why don't you go down the corridor and there is the minister for Aboriginal affairs, my good mate. I think he can line up a job for you.' Of course, according to the Prime Minister, this is just pure coincidence&mdash;total coincidence that all this is occurring. What is it? It is actually the old one-two. The two ministers saying, `Right, we've got a problem here. John's got a problem, so John will fix it up. We get Gabi Hollows in&mdash;bang, bang, away we go. Yes, no worries, we're going to look after you,' and his problem is solved. But, fortunately, Gabi Hollows did not take the bait. She knew what was involved; she knew what this was all about.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="943">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be said, and it already has been said, what is wrong in appointing Gabi Hollows to a position in Aboriginal affairs? Nothing. There is nothing wrong with doing that. But that is not the issue. The appointment has to be on the basis of merit alone&mdash;merit only, not on the basis of extraneous considerations like `Will she do something else? Will she resign from another position in order to do that?' That is not on the basis of merit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real reason for this offer is shown by the fact that it was a general offer. It was not a specific offer. Senator Herron did not say, `There is this position involving these tasks, this remuneration and this time.' It was a general offer in a letter. The true nature of this offer was `I want you to get off the Civil Aviation Safety Authority board.' That was the true motive for the offer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ministerial guidelines at page 11 state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . government appointments are to be made on the basis of merit, taking into account the skills, qualifications, experience and any special qualities required of the person to be appointed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What was the qualification required of Gabi Hollows in this instance? It was that she agree to resign from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority board. Nothing else. Nothing of that nature is in the ministerial guidelines. It does not say that it is okay if you offer an appointment to somebody on the basis that they do you a favour somewhere else&mdash;for very good reasons. The fact that she was not appointed only adds further weight to the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We turn now to the question of the Crimes Act. Contrary to what the minister has said today, I have not made accusations directly that he has breached the Crimes Act. I have raised the issue and said that the Prime Minister has to ensure that this is properly investigated. There are issues there that need to be investigated and they have not been investigated properly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 73(3) makes it an offence to offer any benefit to a Commonwealth officer in order to influence them in the exercise of their duty. Section 88 says it is an offence to corruptly offer a benefit to a person regarding an appointment to a federal government office, and there are various other provisions of a similar nature. The question is: is there 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> going to be a proper examination of the behaviour of this minister and of Senator Herron to determine whether or not any offences have occurred? Are witnesses going to be interviewed? Is anybody going to be asked what has actually happened? Is Gabi Hollows going to be asked what has happened? Is there going to be any form of inquiry? `No. We will give the letter to a lawyer in the Attorney-General's office and that will do.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What have we ended up with? We have ended up with a single page&mdash;the quickest, the shortest, the dirtiest piece of legal advice in legal professional history, and, believe me, there is some competition for that award. We have got a piece of legal advice that does not consider the discussion between the minister and Gabi Hollows where he admitted that he made the offer. It is not considered in that advice. It does not consider the discussion between Gabi Hollows and Senator Herron. It does not ask what discussions have occurred between Senator Herron and the minister. Most particularly, it takes no examination whatsoever of the extended pattern of the minister's attacks on the Civil Aviation Safety Authority board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a bit like asking somebody to investigate the fact that Chris Skase has bought a yacht and not telling them about all the other issues that are part of the transaction. That is what they have done. They have just said, `Here's the letter. Get us off, and that'll do.' The Prime Minister has refused to recognise this situation for what it is, and it is straightforward&mdash;it is job trafficking, it is influence peddling and it is gross impropriety. Now the minister says that it is all innocent; we are misinterpreting this; we have the wrong end of the stick; we do not understand; and the letter can be interpreted in another way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet when he was asked yesterday about any other instances, first off he said no. He did not respond when I asked a general question about all instances. Then when I asked specifically, `Any other apart from Gabi Hollows?', as the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) says, he said, `I am not aware of any other situation.' Then when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) asked the same 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="944"> question, `I cannot think of any other situation.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today the truth started to emerge: there was another situation. The minister admitted on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> that there were discussions with Dr Clare Pollock. Her version was that she was being told that consultancies would be available, that she would have the opportunity for consultancies if she resigned, but, of course, she could not take them while she was a member of the board. His version is that she was being told, `Don't worry. If you resign, it will be okay. You'll still be able to get consultancies. I won't victimise you. You won't be prejudiced.' That is his version. But he has not told us why he raised the issue in the first place. Why did he raise the issue in the first place? He has not answered that at all. What he also has not acknowledged is that, even on the minister's version of events, this is an inducement. It is a negative inducement saying, `If you resign, I won't victimise you.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also dealing with a person here who, I would remind the minister, is one of his unqualified board members, one of the people who should not be on the board because they do not know anything about aviation safety. They are in the wrong place. It is perhaps worth asking the question: if she is unqualified to be on the board, how is it that she is qualified to do consultancies for the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation? How is she qualified for those? The answer is, of course, as I said before, that Clare Pollock is an expert on safety, on human reactions, on human behaviour in safety generally and an entirely appropriate person to be on that board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that he has sought to use the statements of Mr Justice Fisher today in his defence. Mr Justice Fisher spoke carefully but I think we had better let him speak for himself and, more particularly, we had better let Clare Pollock speak for herself, but she does not have the opportunity to do that at the moment. I think she will talk to an inquiry. I think she will respond and give her version of events, but all you are doing is preventing that sort of inquiry from occurring. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minister has misled the parliament on three occasions. Three strikes and you're out, Minister, on this issue. On three occasions you have failed to fess up to this. In spite of the new evidence, the Prime Minister says the case is closed. We have looked at one aspect of the first instance but no, the case is closed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have two instances so far, but there is a third at around the same time&mdash;at the board meeting&mdash;and he admits it. He quibbles over the meaning of it, but he admits it. If there were any other government appointment or work that would be more conducive or convenient for them, he was prepared to look at it. The response from the chairman was, `We're not time servers.' He knew what the minister was talking about. `Do you want a pay&hyphen;off?' That is what he was talking about and Justice Fisher said no. There were people taking notes there. Will we get those notes? Will we actually get an inquiry to determine precisely what occurred? So far the answer is no.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reply from Mr Justice Fisher makes it very clear what the proposal was that the minister made to him, and what it indicates is that there are three instances which cannot be explained away by innocent misunderstandings as he seeks to do. Within a month, he has innocently ganged up with Senator Herron on Gabi Hollows to try to offer her a job in Aboriginal affairs if she resigned. He has innocently suggested to the board, `If you need something else, I can look at it.' He has innocently suggested to Clare Pollock, `What about consultancies?' Doesn't it strike you as remarkably coincidental that all of these innocent things are going on in such a way. This minister has the competence of Billy McMahon and the credibility of Richard Nixon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The true picture is that he is a minister who will stoop to any lengths to get rid of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority board in order to pay off the political debts that he owes to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, to Dick Smith and Boyd Munro, who have supported him and the coalition very strongly at the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key question in all this is: will the Prime Minister accept that there are new charges? Will he accept that yesterday's so&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="945"> called inquiry was a farce, an absolute joke, that set new depths in his unwillingness to confront the misbehaviour of his ministers? Will the Prime Minister initiate a judicial inquiry into this whole tawdry, scurrilous affair and, particularly, will he stand the minister down? If he does not, then he stands before the Australian people for what he is, the man who is called Honest John in the same way as redheads are called Bluey or tall blokes are called Tiny. That is what Honest John means. He is the man who paraded around with the great standards that he said he would introduce after the Keating government, but he allows grossly improper behaviour and will not do anything about it. He allows behaviour which may be illegal and he will not do anything about it, not even initiate an inquiry. And the best defence he can come up with is Barry Jones and Gareth Evans! There is one key difference. That was not ministerial conduct; that was conduct within a political party. That was not taxpayers' money being offered to people as an inducement to step down from a board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If ministerial standards mean anything at all, now is the time that the Prime Minister has got to act. He has to call the ministers to account, stand them down and call a judicial inquiry, or will he continue to tolerate the welter of sleaze, job trafficking and influence peddling that is rapidly overcoming the government? It is up to the Prime Minister to determine what he is going to do. This minister should stand down and acknowledge his wrongdoing. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`this House censures the Labor Opposition for its failure when in government to put in place proper arrangements for guaranteeing aviation safety in Australia and the member for Melbourne for misleading the Australian people'. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We have seen a display in the House this afternoon and yesterday of how incompetent and inappropriate the Labor Party was in government and now how incompetent and inappropriate they are in opposition. Their track record on aviation safety management is nothing to crow about. We have heard today, and yesterday, from the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). Yesterday he was ably assisted by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) who, incidentally, and interestingly, did not appear in the attack today. I wonder why the Leader of the Opposition did not appear in the attack today, unlike his involvement in it yesterday when he participated in the attack on both me and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason the Leader of the Opposition was not part of the attack today was simply that he knew&mdash;like everybody on this side of the House knows, like most people on the Labor side of the House know&mdash;that the opposition is flogging a dead duck. The Leader of the Opposition knows&mdash;like everybody else in this House and everybody in the Australian public knows&mdash;when it comes to administering aviation safety in this country, who has credibility and who has not. Everybody knows the Labor Party in government had probably the worst track record of aviation safety management in the history of this country. The reasons for that are evident wherever you want to turn in recent years. I am fascinated that the person seconding the censure motion of the honourable member for Melbourne today is the former Minister for Transport, the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton), who was responsible during most of the period that the Labor Party was in office during the 1990s for aviation safety in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fascinating to recall highlights&mdash;some would say lowlights&mdash;of the previous Labor government's management of aviation safety while in office. I guess two outstanding things spring to mind in the history of Labor's management of aviation safety in this country. They are words that are household names around Australia. They are Monarch Airlines and Seaview Air. Monarch Airlines was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="946"> operating a commuter service between Sydney and Young in the early 1990s. Unfortunately, on 11 June 1993, Monarch Airlines crashed within about a kilometre of the Young airport on a very bad Friday evening. In the subsequent publicity that followed, and in the coronial inquiry which investigated the preconditions or causes of that crash, it became quite self&hyphen;evident that the failure of the aviation safety regulator was a major contributing factor to that crash in which seven people lost their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Which government was responsible for establishing the aviation safety regulator in Australia at that time? Which government was it? The Labor government. Which ministers were responsible at the time for the implementation of the reforms that established the Civil Aviation Authority? Which ministers were they? Let me think for a moment. Oh, Senator Gareth Evans was Minister for Transport and Communications at the time of the establishment of the Civil Aviation Authority in 1988. What is Senator Evans doing today? Oh, he is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition here in the House of Representatives. Who else was around at the time? The then member for Swan, who is now the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), was also minister for transport through this period. Who else was minister for transport through this period? The former Treasurer in the Labor government, Mr Willis. So sitting on the opposition benches today is a living history of the reforms made by the previous Labor government in civil aviation regulation in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that, as a consequence of those reforms, they established an organisation which let down the travelling public of Australia. That was self&hyphen;evident in the coronial inquiry into the Monarch crash and it was self-evident&mdash;even Blind Freddy could see it&mdash;in the commission of inquiry undertaken by Justice James Staunton into the Seaview crash, which occurred on 2 October 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My involvement in this goes back to the night of that Monarch crash. That crash occurred within a mile of my farm at Young, where I come from. It was the place I learnt to fly at. I knew six of the seven people who 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> were on board that aircraft. For that reason and because it was in my electorate and they were primarily my constituents, I took an interest in it. The story of incompetence that unravelled before our eyes was amazing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people would not believe me when I first started to tell the story, but I felt it was important for us to do that. And we did it. I did it on 9 May 1994 in this House. I highlighted all of my concerns. I described an airline which I felt was an accident waiting to happen, another Monarch. That was Seaview. Seaview Air, I said, was `a danger to the travelling public' if I can remember my words at the time. Of course, five months later, having made all these claims in the House and having brought them to the attention of the then Minister for Transport, who is now the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith, and having seen the government take no notice whatsoever, a Seaview Air plane crashed on 2 October 1994 with nine lives lost. In the commission of inquiry that followed, it was quite apparent that a contributing factor to that crash and the loss of those nine lives was the failure of the aviation safety regulator to do its job properly, to do the job that it was paid for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was sad but true that, because of the inefficiency and incompetence of that aviation safety regulator, a number of people lost their lives. So the importance of getting aviation safety right is burnt into my heart. It sits in my conscience every day. I am driven in my present role as Minister for Transport and Regional Development to make sure that I get aviation safety regulation right in this country. It is quite obvious to anybody, as it was obvious in those two inquiries, that there is a serious problem. Yet what did Labor do? It changed things by establishing two separate authorities. On 1 July 1995, the former CAA became two organisations: Airservices Australia and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority&mdash;strange that because that is precisely what I recommended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the reforms undertaken by the former Labor government were those reforms I outlined in my speeches in May and June 1994 in the House. So when it comes to who has a track record in this area, I think I, and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="947"> indeed this government, have an admirable track record on being alert to the needs of aviation safety regulation in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some scurrilous and outrageous suggestions have been made yesterday and today by the honourable member for Melbourne in the parliament and outside. He has been ably assisted by the Leader of the Opposition. He claims all of these things, including that I and somehow the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) have been involved in some criminal act&mdash;some act of bribery; some act of inducement. That is absolutely and utterly wrong. When the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) investigated the matter yesterday, asking the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) to provide advice, the Chief General Counsel of the Attorney-General's office, Mr H. Burmester, gave his advice. I will read it, because it is instructive for us to hear it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have asked for advice as to whether or not a letter signed by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs on 6 May 1996 and addressed to Ms G Hollows . . . gives any cause for concern that an offence may thereby have been committed against Section 73 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Crimes Act 1914</EMPHASIS> , or any other provision of that Act, or any provision of any other Act of the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 73 has, in my opinion, no application to the facts and circumstances set out in that letter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additionally, in my opinion, there is no other provision of that or any other Act which would apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, I consider that there is nothing contained in the letter which would make it necessary or appropriate for the matter to be referred either to the Australian Federal Police for consideration of investigation, or to the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration of prosecution.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In that opinion from the Chief General Counsel of the Attorney-General's office is the truth of the allegations made yesterday by the honourable member for Melbourne both inside and outside the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rest of the allegations and the confirmation of the Chief General Counsel's view came today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World Today</EMPHASIS> interview with Justice Fisher, the chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Justice Fisher makes things quite clear in the interview with Fran Kelly. She talks of the letter written to Ms Gabi Hollows. All that Justice Fisher can 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> find to say about that letter was that we were not necessarily trying to offer her anything or to induce or bribe her, as has been suggested by the honourable member for Melbourne, but that we were trying to charm her. That is a significant difference from the innuendo cast by the honourable member for Melbourne yesterday and ably assisted by the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the second person that the honourable member claims I tried to induce or bribe to resign from the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, the question from the reporter is this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And in terms of Dr Clare Pollock. Was there any kind of inducement that you're aware of offered to her?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Justice Fisher says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Inducement? No. But discussion? Yes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Isn't it a terrible thing to have a discussion. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I understand it, the minister has given his version of the discussion and I think it broadly accords with what I was told.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is, what he was told by Dr Clare Pollock. The reporter then says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So in fact that was no offer of consultancy jobs if she stepped aside from the board&mdash;rather a reassurance that she would not be locked out of those kinds of jobs, if she stepped aside?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Justice Fisher's answer was this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was certainly no offer of a job.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The substance of their attack is that it is an outrageous thing that I, as Minister for Transport and Regional Development, who is ultimately responsible for aviation safety in Australia and for the millions of Australians who travel by air every year, would want to have people who know something about aviation to oversight the aviation safety regulator. This is a great shock. Goodness gracious, why didn't you invent the idea? If you had, I am sure that you would have done it. But you were too busy, in your time in office, appointing people who were not appropriately qualified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only one of the non-executive directors of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority has aviation expertise. It is my intent that all those who travel on airlines around Australia every year&mdash;those millions of Australians&mdash;will be able to get on a plane knowing that the safety aspects of that aircraft are being oversighted by a board of people who know about aviation and who can assure Australia that we have the safest aviation regulation regime anywhere in the world. At present, with the people who do not have those qualifications, that assurance cannot be given.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How characteristic it was this afternoon that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), rather than defending himself against the serious charges that have been made, sought to mislead this House. He sought to be untruthful in his dealing with this matter by suggesting that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority&mdash;a body formed only in July 1995&mdash;was responsible in some way for those awful, terrible crashes. What a disgraceful, untruthful performance from this minister.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister knows and the House knows that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority was formed in direct response to the inadequacies that were shown in the coronial inquiry and the royal commission which we in government set up. They recommended the establishment of the authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister went further than that. He went to the point of saying that the directors of CASA were people who were associated with this linage, when of course these directors did not take office until 1 July that year. Indeed, they had been in office for barely nine months when he became minister and commenced his campaign to see them eliminated from that authority and removed from office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to that, the minister said this afternoon that the chairman of the authority had made some remarks on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The World Today</EMPHASIS> which favoured the arguments that he had been putting forward. But the minister misquoted absolutely the transcript of the interview. The minister quoted this question as asked by the reporter, Fran Kelly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So in fact that was no offer of consultancy jobs if she stepped aside from the board&mdash;rather a reassurance that she would not be locked out of those kind of jobs, if she stepped aside?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then he should have continued to the next line, which was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Justice Fisher:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">  No, I don't quite put it that way.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Nor did the minister give the rest of the quote, where Fisher continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was said to her, I think, that she was in the wrong place. If she wasn't on the board she would be able to accept offers of consulting work with a number of relevant institutions and boards. That was the way it was put.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the way the inducement was put. That is the way this minister behaved. Let me say that, when it comes to devious and nasty conspiracies, it would be hard to top the performance of the Howard government with this exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a motion against a minister who is obsessed and prepared to stop at nothing to get his way. This is a motion against a minister who, from his very first day in office, set out to get the Civil Aviation Safety Authority board. This is a minister who 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="949"> nominated them as his No. 1 target and who began on that very day to apply the pressure on them to force them to resign. He waged, it is fair to say, a relentless campaign to destabilise that board, and he used continual media stories and briefings to attack their competence and to undermine them. This is a minister who sought to intimidate the board into resigning by publicly denigrating them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the minister was thwarted in his evil intent, what did he do to the board? He adopted a two-prong strategy initially. The first prong of the strategy was to amend the legislation. He introduced amendments, and those amendments went to expanding the board so he could put his additional nominees on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we know, at the very same time he was doing that, he was covertly seeking to induce the board into resigning. He set the scene when he met the board in the first instance and told them that, if there were any other appointments or work more congenial or convenient to board members, he as minister was prepared to look at it. He set the scene by saying, `Board members, put that thought clearly in your mind. You must go. But if you don't go, then opportunity knocks. Just come and see me. You've got to go but, if you go voluntarily, the world is your oyster as far as additional government appointments are concerned.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister was not prepared to do it all himself. It was not all his own work. He was prepared to recruit the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) as his agent and he was prepared to use the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) as his messenger boy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He hit on Clare, that is right. As the minister was forced to admit on the ABC this morning, he discussed potential consultancies in his area of responsibility&mdash;that is, with the department of transport, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation and CASA itself, the very organisation he was forcing her from the board of.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She is well qualified to earn money from CASA, but she is not entitled to sit on its board. Once more, what is happening&mdash;nod, nod, wink, wink? She needs to resign from this position if these wonderful opportunities are to come her way. When you read the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="950"> transcript of John Sharp's interview this morning on the ABC program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>, it is clear that Clare Pollock's problem is not her excellent qualifications; it is the fact that she is not Dick Smith. That is Clare Pollock's problem and that is this government's problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the job offers were rightly rejected, what did John Sharp set about doing? When he could not get his way, inducing them from the board, he set about to sledge them from the board, to drive them from existence on that board. The 19&hyphen;page letter, that concoction, is a document that would do a star chamber proud. I have never seen a more wretched document. It is a charge sheet, but only the latest outrage in his long campaign to hurt this board. This is what Blake Dawson Waldron had to say about this advice:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Minister purports to terminate board members' appointments we, Blake Dawson Waldron, are of the opinion that his decision will be an unlawful exercise of his statutory powers. He has embarked on a course of action seriously flawed which would, if challenged, be held by a court not to have provided procedural fairness to CASA or its board members. It could lead to real damage being suffered by not only the parties directly involved but also CASA and hence the public's confidence in the authority and its vital operations.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what is Blake Dawson Waldron had to say. While we are on legal opinions, let me place another one before the House this afternoon, not from the Crown law officer asked to give a narrow interpretation on a letter and forbidden from looking at the surrounding circumstances but from a leading member of the Sydney criminal bar who today has provided an opinion which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are many ways to seek to influence or affect a Commonwealth officer in the exercise of his duty or authority by promising or offering any property or benefit other than by an outright express bribe. The suggestion made by the letter on its face is oblique. When it is considered in the context of the provable circumstances the suggestion becomes quite blatant: "If you resign from the Board we'll find you a job in Aboriginal health." What matters as far as criminality or impropriety is concerned is the nature of all the conduct, the intention behind its effect . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on to quote Hawkins v. The Queen and the view of Sir Anthony Mason, of all people, who quoted Lord Campbell:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in Walters v. Morgan . . . referring to "a nod or a wink or a shake of the head or a smile" as comprising or giving content to a representation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such an offer as is implied from the letter and the surrounding conduct if made with the requisite intention is quite capable of being revealed as illegal or improper on full investigation. The conduct of the two Ministers considered in combination is hardly subtle.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what he had to say. He finished off by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Burmester's advice, confined to the terms of the letter and omitting reference to Mr Sharp and Senator Herron's other actions, an advice given with no reasons but a simple assertion of the author constitutes no substantial basis in my opinion why investigation into such an important matter should not proceed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is signed `G.R. James QC, Chambers, Sydney'. As far as the opposition is concerned, this is not a case of `should not proceed', as Mr James finished his advice. It is a case of must proceed. This inquiry must be held. The motion moved by my colleague contains a very important term of reference:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this House calls on the Prime Minister to hold a full judicial inquiry into these matters and to stand aside the Minister for Transport and Regional Development pending the outcome of that judicial inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If the Prime Minister, someone with a sworn duty and an oath of office to uphold the laws of this country, fails in his duty in this most serious of matters&mdash;and you cannot have a more serious charge&mdash;and does not stand him aside and go down the track of a full investigation so that the truth of this matter is clear, one thing will be absolutely clear to the people of Australia, and that is that the PM's code of conduct has been reduced to black letters in the Crimes Act. That is what the code of conduct will mean. As far as the Crimes Act is concerned, there will be no investigation of the full circumstances of his ministers' action to ensure that they have not behaved in a way that offends the laws that they are sworn to uphold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's performance in this nearly yearlong campaign against these people in the Civil Aviation Safety Authority is one of the most disgraceful episodes I have ever encountered. In the process, he has shown by a

He will do anything to get rid of these people. Why? We know why. Because he gave his commitment to the people who pledged so much money and so much campaign support to him and his party at the time of the 1996 election. That is what this is about. Air safety and the independence of this tribunal are being totally compromised by the disgraceful performance of this totally irresponsible and unlawful minister.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government rejects every nasty innuendo; we reject every element of deceit; we reject every comma, every dot, every hyphen; we reject this censure motion in its entirety lock, stock and barrel. We reject the insulting character of this motion as put by the Labor Party against a minister who, in the last 12 months, has been working to overcome the problems left to him by the last and previous Labor administration. And what is more, with every ounce of indignation I can bring, we reject the Labor Party putting up the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton) as a seconder on this motion when he was the minister responsible, during a significant period under the Labor administration, for the very problems that the now minister has been attempting to resolve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is beyond belief that the Labor Party could so insult the intelligence of the Australian people that they could put up the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith on an issue which they claim goes to questions of propriety and probity. He is the member who started in the kindergarten of politics in New South Wales, in the Labor Youth Council, and who soon 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> became infamous for the fact that on the back of a motorbike in the middle of the night he took off with a parcel of disputed votes so as to ensure the preselection of Paul Keating. He is the incarnation, if you like, of the Chappaquiddick of Australian politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith comes in here talking to us about probity but he was at the centre of one of Australia's most infamous, unsolved political scandals&mdash;the rezoning of land around Botany Bay&mdash;which, for those of you who are interested in a bit of Australian history, at one stage saw charges brought against the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith. The magistrate said that there was a prima facie case against him, but the same case was dismissed by none other than Chief Magistrate Murray Farquhar&mdash;also famous in Australian politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They put him up to attack us on probity and then they put him up to attack the competence of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp). We get this from the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith, who was the minister responsible for the tendering of the tunnel under Sydney Harbour; the minister responsible for the blowouts at Darling Harbour; and the minister responsible for the monorail, which has never made an cent of profit. In his own former federal portfolio&mdash;let us talk about competence&mdash;one of the great fiascos of management was the handling of the Sydney airport noise issue, which for so long he was the irresponsible minister in charge of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only does the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith have that litany of failure and question marks over his political career but in his last effort he was the Minister for Industrial Relations. He was the minister who had the gall to stand up in the parliament suggesting a few technical changes to his unfair dismissal law and saying he was going to make a good system better&mdash;a system which during Labor's administration literally cost, I would say on a fair and conservative estimate, tens of thousands of jobs of our fellow Australians right across the board but particularly young Australians. I do not make that as a party political comment. Bob Carr, the Labor Premier of New South Wales, made that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="952"> point&mdash;that Laurie Brereton's unfair dismissal laws were costing young people opportunities for jobs. So we especially reject a censure motion which is seconded by the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith for all of those very good reasons and also for the hollowness of the claims which they make in regard to the issue before us today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to say, as we reflect upon the political career of the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith, what a stark contrast that makes to the incredible efforts that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development&mdash;today the subject of the opposition attack&mdash;has made in the last 11 months. I suppose I have seen many pretty empty censure motions over the years, but it is particularly galling that we have a censure motion against a minister, the subject matter of which is his attempting to fix up the problems which he has inherited from the previous side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not as though this is a new issue. The fact is that John Sharp has put in a hell of an effort, both in opposition and in government, trying to improve aviation safety in this country. It is incredibly galling for you to in any sense question his motive, when he has on the record his efforts for many years now&mdash;and those of you who know him personally know what a huge effort he has made for one reason, and that is he has tried to improve the air safety conditions which face Australians as they travel by air. That record is there for all to see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As he mentioned&mdash;I thought very well&mdash;during question time today, the minister had ministerial responsibility as a shadow minister in opposition for some of these issues. But the fact is he was personally touched and affected by one of these crashes where a lot of people died. It says a lot for and is a testimony to our colleague that he has made it a personal objective to improve air safety in this country. That is why we particularly so strongly support the minister.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is already progress in the trans&hyphen;Tasman area, as a result of this minister's competence and attention to detail. In the shipping area, he has moved quickly but sensibly to sit down and talk to people about the way we can start to fix the problems about which you did nothing for 13 years&mdash;because when you are in office you are run by the unions. Lastly, on the question of aviation safety, the minister has instituted reviews and a program of reform which are not just directed specifically to this issue but to improving air safety in a strategic way in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue, as put by Labor, revolves around two incidents or series of events. The first relates to Gabi Hollows and her continuation on the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority&mdash;and similarly the continuation of other board members. Our policy position on this has been quite clear. This is not something that has arisen just in recent times. Well prior to the previous election we made the simple point that we believed that those who constitute that authority ought to be people who are expert in the field. As a commonsense proposition, that is very hard to deny, and I was interested to listen to the contributions from the two Labor members because 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="953"> they have never actually mounted a rational argument against that simple proposition. If you are worried about aviation safety in this country and you have a regulatory authority in charge of it, it seems to me to make eminent sense that the people in charge of that&mdash;the people at whom the buck stops&mdash;should be people who have some expertise in that area. We have made that point. It is a policy point that was endorsed in the last election, and this minister has simply been going about doing his job in a competent and sensible way. For that, you bring forward the most spurious, base and hollow claim imaginable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the question of whether or not Ms Hollows should remain on the board. The point the minister has been making is that he respects Gabi Hollows&mdash;as do members on both sides of this House, I am sure&mdash;for being the person she is and for the work she does in a number of areas. It is hardly exceptional for a minister to say that the government would be interested if she were able to serve the national interest by taking an appointment in the area of Aboriginal health. Basically, that is all that has been said. You can go over the fine detail of the documentation, but that is the bottom line. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the second one, the reality is that the minister, on the basis of what he said and of the confirmation we have had from Bill Fisher, said to Claire Pollock, `Regardless of the circumstances of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, our view about the work that you might have in the future with the government, given the fact that you have had work with the government before, would not in any way be impaired by the fact that you might tender your resignation from the CASA board.' How could anyone in their right mind say that that was objectionable in any possible way?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why raise it?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because the minister is doing the right thing, talking to the person concerned, explaining our policy and simply makes the point that, if in pursuance of our policy objective that person resigns from the board, we are not in any way going to prevent them continuing to obtain work from the government in the future as they have in the past. You cannot in one succinct sentence tell 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> me what is actually wrong with that proposition. Anybody with any commonsense could see what a long bow this whole censure motion is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a tried and true tactic of the opposition. They allege offences under the Crimes Act, they allege some legal impropriety, they reach for every document they can to try to substantiate their case. Yesterday, in doorstops and in question time, they attempted to draw a long bow by referring to provisions of the Crimes Act. They asked the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to investigate that matter and he did. He came back with a one&hyphen;page statement which completely knocked it on the head. There goes that leg of their claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They made a claim in respect of the ministerial guidelines. I got out the ministerial guidelines and, when you boil it down, the ministerial guidelines expect ministers to act with probity and to get on with the job. That is exactly what this minister has done. Commonsense would tell you that, if you wanted to see a change in the structure of the board, you ought to be talking to some of the people concerned. The minister has done that. It would be pretty odd if he had not talked to those people about what the consequences of their going off the board might be. It beggars belief that this is the subject of a censure motion in the national parliament. You are basically attacking the minister for doing his job by talking to somebody about getting off the CASA board and about what the implications for their relationship with the government might be in the future. It is absolutely absurd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The more you look at this matter&mdash;you go through all the detail, the ministerial guidelines, the legal opinion, the Crimes Act and look at the two factual circumstances which form the basis of this censure motion&mdash;the more it is evident that there is nothing in it. When you then look at the people who are moving this censure motion&mdash;in particular the seconder of this motion&mdash;you see that this is one of the most convincing cases for this House to support the amendment to this censure motion that I have ever seen in my 13 years since being sworn in back in the mid&hyphen;1980s. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="954">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what this House ought to do. Rather than accepting the Labor Party motion, the course of action is clear: this Labor opposition, responsible for this mess when they were in government, ought to be censured for the mess they left us, and the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) ought to be censured for misleading this parliament and the Australian people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works I present the following reports entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Development of facilities at RAAF Base Darwin</EMPHASIS> , the committee's first report of 1997, and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Development of buildings and services in support of the Department of Defence Joint Project 2043, High Frequency Modernisation Project</EMPHASIS> , the committee's second report of 1997.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that the reports be printed.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The first report which I have tabled concerns the proposed development of operational facilities at RAAF Base Darwin. The Department of Defence proposes to provide the base with the facilities needed to perform its operational role in a safe and effective manner. The proposal examined by the committee encompasses: one, explosive ordnance loading aprons and alert facilities for fighter aircraft; two, operational and technical support facilities; three, additional aviation fuel storage; four, an upgrade of the emergency power station; five, a replacement fire and rescue facility; and, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> six, replacement airfield lighting equipment facilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The estimated outturn cost of the proposed work is $59.5 million. The committee has recommended that the work should proceed. The committee concluded that the military presence in Darwin reflects government policy for an increased defensive presence in the north of Australia. It is clear that RAAF Base Darwin is a vital component of the Defence infrastructure in the north and is likely to remain for many years at its present location.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By way of background, the report notes that the military and civilian infrastructure at RAAF Base Darwin represents a significant investment by the Commonwealth and the cost of relocating the RAAF base to another site on the grounds of aircraft noise or public safety cannot be justified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In answer to a number of individuals and organisations which suggested that the RAAF base should be relocated elsewhere on the grounds of aircraft noise, the report acknowledges the responsible efforts of the RAAF in promulgating noise abatement procedures which have reduced the incidence of noise complaints. Nevertheless, the report recommends that the Department of Defence should establish a dedicated telephone line for receiving and recording any complaints about aircraft noise and a mechanism for their speedy investigation and reporting back to the complainants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The strategic importance of RAAF Base Darwin can easily be overlooked by the presence of RAAF Base Tindall, which is not far to the south. But what the committee had reinforced to it was that, in the sense of real defence for the north of Australia, the role of RAAF Base Darwin as a forward staging post could not be underestimated and that the location of RAAF Base Darwin in strategic terms was irreplaceable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the extensive works that are proposed, the committee has concluded that all of these works will enhance the operational facilities of RAAF Base Darwin as an operational forward redeployment and air defence base not only for Darwin but for the entire nation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="960">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second report I have tabled deals with the proposed development of buildings and services in support of the Department of Defence joint project 2043, high frequency modernisation project. The high frequency modernisation project will provide for the installation of modern, state-of-the&hyphen;art high frequency radio equipment to satisfy the needs of Army, Navy and Air Force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The public works proposal will provide access roads, security, engineering services and buildings to house the transmitter, receiver and management functions of the network. The entire modernisation project will cost $505 million with building works and services estimated to cost $75 million. The committee has recommended that the building works and services should proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The high frequency modernisation project will consist of four communication nodes, each comprising a transmitter station, receiver station and local management facility. There will also be a primary and secondary national management facility. The communication nodes will be located in the Riverina, Townsville, North West Cape and Darwin. I note the interest of the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) in this proposal and his presence in the chamber this afternoon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee concluded that existing facilities are aged and need refurbishment and that new facilities are required at two communication nodes. Facilities to house the high frequency equipment will be located on existing Defence properties and properties acquired for radio communications purposes. All are in areas which Defence believes are free of electromagnetic interference and have sufficient buffer zones to protect them from urban encroachment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed work will entail the construction of new facilities for the Riverina transmitter and receiver on sites which Defence believes are suitable. Elsewhere, the proposal will make good use of existing facilities which will need to be modified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once the high frequency network is operational, some existing Defence communication sites will be redundant. The committee noted that, before excess properties are offered for sale, Defence should ensure that any soil 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> contamination has been remedied in accordance with state or local government requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report recommends that the Department of Defence provides annual reports on the status of the redundant properties, particularly in relation to the cost of the remediation of any soil contamination, when they are to be sold and the amount of revenue received. I commend these reports to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The high frequency modernisation project is very important to my city of Townsville, because Townsville is the home base of the Operational Defence Force and 3rd Brigade that responds in this country first up. In Townsville the transmitter equipment will be located at the Bohle. There is already an existing transmitter site there, but there will be significant extra works and modifications to that site.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The receiver equipment will be located at a new site in the Townsville field training area where there is already significant infrastructure of other types that support the Operational Defence Force. I certainly welcome the continuing investment by the government in Townsville. I am unable to say the exact amount of dollars that this project will entail in Townsville because it is at this stage commercial-in-confidence and will be subject to a tender process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to say that the government is currently spending nearly a million dollars a week on new capital works and new infrastructure in the city, and that is very welcome indeed for the people of Townsville and the electorate of Herbert. I certainly support the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Public Works.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB2></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="960"><TITLE>Publications Committee</TITLE><DEBATE.SUB2 PAGE="960"><TITLE>Report</TITLE>

Before question time, I made reference to a very clear, firm and unqualified commitment which had been made by the present Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to the National Farmers Federation prior to the last election, and I believe that that commitment was very important, firstly, in having the National Farmers Federation endorse the partial sale of Telstra and, secondly, in assuring people in rural and provincial Australia that an incoming coalition government would make absolutely certain that high technology telecommunications facilities would be available to them just as surely as they would be available to people in metropolitan and larger provincial cities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment which was moved by the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), who represents the shadow minister for communications in this chamber, made four points. I am not going to go over them&mdash;they have already been identified. What I want to do is indicate that I intend to concentrate, to the extent that I can, my remarks on item (3) of that amendment where it expresses concern at the government's refusal to honour its election promise on ISDN connections for rural and provincial Australians. People know that ISDN refers to the integrated services digital network. Just to put on the record the promise that was made by the Prime Minister, I indicate that it was made on 21 November 1995 to the National Farmers Federation. It was the big policy announcement of that day. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today I announce that a Coalition Government will require Telstra to offer all of its customers who have lines connected to digital exchanges with access to ISDN as a standard service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will also require Telstra to substantially complete its FMO or digitisation of exchanges by 1 July 1997, instead of its current year 2000 target date.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">`Its current year 2000 target date' was our commitment&mdash;the former Labor government's. That was brought forward, as I say, by that unqualified commitment on the part of the present Prime Minister, then Leader of the Opposition, that an incoming coalition government would bring that target date 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="962"> forward to 1 July 1997, that is, this year. Everyone knows that since that commitment was made, the government has sought to back&hyphen;pedal in a way which will bring very serious disadvantage to those people to whom that promise was quite clearly and unqualifiedly made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For people in rural areas, there are probably two services which, to them, are of overriding importance: transport is one, communications is the other. This present government slashed $600 million out of its road programs, so that is what has been done for transport. As far as communications are concerned, the whole area of telecommunications and things like these high technology provisions, the ISDN, all of those things, if they are provided for people in rural and provincial Australia, will make it possible for them and their families, and in particular for their children, to be given equal opportunities. When we talk about making opportunities available to kids in Australia, we mean the kids in the bush, just the same as we mean the kids at Bennelong, the kids at Hunters Hill, the kids who can be seen from Kirribilli. We mean the kids in the bush. Now for a government to repudiate an undertaking of that kind, as it quite clearly is set to do, I think is nothing short of disgraceful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Chris Schacht is our spokesman on communications and he is represented in this chamber by the shadow minister for health, the member for Dobell, Michael Lee, who, incidentally, was the minister for communications in the previous government when that commitment was made that we would be providing, as standard service, across Australia to all Australians, those services by the year 2000. Michael Lee, the member for Dobell, was in the process of charting the course of communications reform for the next century. That has all now been put asunder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dobell also raised very serious questions when he led for the government in responding to this legislation. I am not going to go into all of those, because, as I have indicated, the one that I am particularly concerned about is item (3) in our amendment, that is, the government's election 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> promise on ISDN connections for rural and provincial Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I emphasise again that we had undertaken to provide it by the year 2000. The present government, in opposition, said that they would bring that forward until 1 July 1997, that is, this year. After the election, the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, commissioned the review group which was chaired by Jock Given from the Communications Law Centre in order to examine this whole area. That was the first step in a quite deliberate strategy to repudiate that earlier undertaking, particularly because of the composition of that review group. I mentioned that Jock Given was to be the chairman. I am not going to go through all the others, except to say that that review group represented, for example, isolated children's parents, the Australian Consumers Association, the National Farmers Federation, the Consumers Telecommunications Network, Australian Telecommunications Users Group, Telstra, Vodaphone, Optus, all of the deliverers, all of the service providers, all of the operators in the area of telecommunications, but of particular and very special significance was the inclusion of&mdash;I say this without denigrating the professor, he knows he had a role to play and he played it&mdash;Professor Henry Ergas, visiting professor from the Centre for Research in Network Economics and Communications, University of Auckland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is particularly significant because, at the end of that very comprehensive examination of all the issues that that review group was charged to examine, the professor delivered an individual report of one. Those other nine&mdash;consumers, providers, participants in telecommunications&mdash;all contributed to and endorsed the joint report which that study brought forward. The only dissenting comments were from Professor Ergas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting because the next stage in this very smart strategy to repudiate that undertaking engineered by and instituted by the minister, Senator Alston, was his media release following that review committee's report. Incredible as you will believe this to be, Mr Deputy Speaker, the first paragraph said: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="963">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two reports assessing whether the standard telephone service should be upgraded were released today . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The release said one was from the chairman of the group, Jock Given. The collective decision of Jock Given and the other eight&mdash;that is, nine of the 10&mdash;was contained within the basic report. The other report, said the minister&mdash;these dissenting comments of one given equal status&mdash;was from Professor Ergas. He said that he was disappointed that the review group was unable to reach a consensus. Nine did; one dissented. He said the two reports would be given careful consideration. It is interesting that the dissenting comments of Professor Ergas quite clearly are going to be the ones that will be given most careful consideration. That has been indicated, of course, by subsequent developments. The minister's media release went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am particularly concerned to ensure that any change to the current arrangements does not impose undue costs on users . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Professor Ergas's dissenting report makes it clear that very substantial sums of money could be involved. That is repudiated and denied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there was an attempt to introduce it according to that target date of 1 July, there would probably be fairly heavy expenses involved. But, if our target of the year 2000 was adopted and those changes were introduced gradually, my understanding of the costs of telecommunications is that the cost of the honouring of that commitment would be minimal.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government knew that their proposal of a 1 July 1997 deadline would be more expensive to achieve than Labor's 2000 deadline but, in the light of that, it made that commitment. Now it retreats from that undertaking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of pretty significant elements about this. It indicates quite clearly that this present government will repudiate that undertaking. My electorate is not in the bush; it is in the outlying areas of Newcastle and Lake Macquarie. Already, there are people in my electorate, close to the largest provincial city in New South Wales, who do not have access, who are concerned that their friends are able to access the Internet in a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fraction of a second while it might take them anything up to 10 minutes to get the image coming up on their screen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This ISDN technology will mean multiple phones and faxes on the one line, much faster faxes, fast EFTPOS links and purchasing services for business, and fast access to the Internet for educational, cultural and information services, including those for kids in rural schools who will be sitting there waiting for the information to come through while their peers in the larger city schools will be way ahead of them. There will be small&hyphen;screen videoconferencing for business and home use, shared screens so users at different locations can work on documents and diagrams together, and visual production groups allowing people in different locations to collaborate and produce high fidelity sound, fast text and graphics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I always believed that modern democratic societies were those in which we attempted to equalise opportunities, not ones where we said that people who live in the bush and provincial areas would not have access to these things. There is an urgent need for members on the government side to make sure that they keep their leaders up to the promises they made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could go on. I have reports and statements here from members of that review committee who have said that the credibility of the minister on this question has been very seriously flawed. His integrity is on the line. The integrity of this government is on the line in this, the most important area of communications technology that Australia has entered into for a long time. They must go back and honour that undertaking for the benefit of people in rural and provincial Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we stand on the edge of a new age where the distinction between computers, telephones, faxes and televisions is becoming a blur. If the average person has trouble staying in touch with technology, what does that tell us about the ability of telecommunications legislation to keep pace with rapid advances? It is time to put the whistle away and let the players play. That requires an entirely new act 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="964"> to replace the outdated and outmoded framework currently in use.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Telecommunications Bill and its associated legislation currently before the House provides a platform for an Australian telecommunications industry that is competitive and on the cutting edge. At the same time, these bills signal a new age of greater choice and protection for consumers and new opportunities for technological innovation. Sadly, the first wave of new possibilities offered to Australians has consisted of more stick than carrot, in the form of the two most used words in my electorate office lexicon, `overhead cables'. Not surprisingly, the community reaction to the uglification of our streets with the erection of towers and hanging of cables has been both loud and widespread. While people are being told about their increased choice of channels, programs and services, they have had no choice about the siting of these cables.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Telecommunications Act 1991, sponsored by the previous Labor government, has allowed Telstra and Optus to do as they please with scant regard for the wishes of residents and the environment. I am sorry that the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) did not mention that the Labor Party was responsible for the introduction of the 1991 Telecommunications Act that led to this very sorry state of affairs which this current government is attempting to change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With extremely charitable immunities due to expire in mid-1997, Telstra and Optus have attempted to roll out their cable as quickly as possible. This has caused a great deal of unrest in the Australian community. Certainly it has become the major concern among the residents of my electorate of Sturt, who decry the fact that 21st century technology will arrive in their houses courtesy of a 19th century delivery service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, my constituents will no doubt be happier with the new arrangements, whereby immunities for the telecommunications companies will have to comply with state and territory planning and environmental laws. Telstra has enjoyed immunity from these laws for 90 years and Optus for the first few years of its existence. That will no longer be the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> case for projects that commence after 1 July this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know it has been an extremely frustrating and lengthy exercise for those who have complained about the current arrangements and attempted to stop the rollout. In some quarters, not my own, their efforts have been written off as NIMBYism. For the most part, I have found their voices to be of genuine concern for other people and the local environment.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="ABBOTT" NAMEID="EZ5">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EZ5">Mr Abbott</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely right.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that the parliamentary secretary would agree with me, as he has a very similar electorate to mine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New technologies have usually achieved quick penetration in the Australian marketplace. I suspect that most Australians have been waiting for pay TV for a long time. But the widespread anger at the overhead rollout has somewhat dulled the enthusiasm. Carriers will have to conform to new obligations, such as collocation of mobile phone towers and ducts, where possible, which is something my constituents have been demanding for a very long time. While Austel discovered that collocation was not universally feasible, it recommended that it was possible in 30 per cent of cases. For competing commercial reasons, Telstra and Optus have failed to explore those possibilities fully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, that would not be the case if the Labor government had listened to the coalition, then in opposition. From the outset, Labor badly mishandled the whole issue of pay TV. After equivocating for years on whether Australia should even have pay TV, they invoked a regime that was clumsy and cost ineffective. It has been extremely difficult to explain to people that the sins of our predecessors have tied our hands with regard to the control over cabling in towns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition, however, is doing something about this mess. Already we have negotiated some new restrictions, and the telecommunications companies have agreed to a tougher interim regime. Now, at the first opportunity, the coalition is legislating for more permanent arrangements. Some will no doubt assert that we are closing the stable door after the horse 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="965"> has bolted. While it is true that the work done prior to the end of the transition period will remain for now, this government, I am happy to note, is intent on playing a major role in seeking new ways to put underground all visible cables.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Burying cables is an expensive proposition that will require the cooperation of all levels of government, utility companies and the community. I know in my own state of South Australia that there have been several estimates over the cost of such an enterprise. While the amounts have varied widely, none of the quotes has been inexpensive. However, there is considerable resolve to get the job done. If in the not&hyphen;too&hyphen;distant future we can rid our cities, suburbs and towns of all overhead wires and, as a consequence, even the classic Aussie stobie pole, as it is called in South Australia, the harshest critic of the current arrangements will admit that it was all worth the effort. Perhaps then they will take down the signs `No overhead cables' that seem to festoon my electorate across all the main streets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The framework that will curb the aerial festooning activities of Optus and Telstra will be of great benefit to consumers. However, these benefits will flow only if there is true competition among the various players. The anti&hyphen;competitive conduct provisions in the package allow industry players flexibility but require adherence to the Trade Practices Act, supplemented by the involvement of the ACCC, which will issue competition guidelines by 1 July and act to stop non-competitive conduct thereafter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consumers will also benefit from the safeguards contained in this telecommunications package. A free market does not of itself necessarily provide the community with the level of surety it requires. Thus, the role of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman will be expanded. In addition, the all&hyphen;important obligations to provide free access to emergency calls and operator and directory assistance services have been retained and will apply to all appropriate providers. The new customer service guarantee, which is not part of the current act, will promote higher service levels and guarantee quick avenues to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> compensation should carriers fail to achieve these levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Services in this guarantee will include the connection, restoration and keeping of appointments. I suspect that the days of the phone company telling customers that they have to wait to get phone services are rapidly drawing to a close. If true competition with other companies does not snap suppliers into shape, these provisions certainly will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra and its predecessors, for so long the monopoly in telecommunications, tasted its first domestic competition only recently. From 1 July, there will be new carriers, which will offer new services to consumers. There will be no restriction on the number of these able to enter the market. Opening up the market will ensure that Australia enjoys state-of-the-art infrastructure that uses the latest technology. A freer market with less regulation will also guarantee a greater choice of services and different rate packages. There will be fierce competition for niche markets and broader services alike. Costs to the consumer can only inevitably come down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As one who has spoken in this place before on the importance of privacy provisions, I am gratified to see that this legislation covers the protection of communications. With the expanded exchange of information and the seemingly insatiable thirst of governments and corporations for more data and more qualified sales leads, the protection of information issue is an increasingly important one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Twelve months ago, Telstra announced it would be spending millions of dollars over two years to protect their customers from misuse of phone information. That assurance followed a six-month study by a privacy audit panel which found that Telstra failed to meet best practice standards in the areas of accountability, use of information and gaining consent from customers. Despite that finding, the audit also admitted that Telstra exceeded international standards for the protection of data.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new telecommunications act will strengthen the privacy provisions. It will now be a requirement that companies keep adequate records of disclosure of information. The Privacy Commissioner will monitor the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="966"> situation to ensure that these records meet the requirements. In addition, there will be greater clarity about the legality or illegality of disclosing information in particular circumstances. I welcome these initiatives and believe they will result in more respect for the privacy of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While Australians embraced the concept of mobile phones early on, new subscribers are signing on at staggering rates. It is estimated that, by the year 2000, there may be eight million mobile phone users in Australia. Calling costs are, however, much higher on a mobile network than on a home telephone, but according to Paul Budde, a prominent telecommunications consultant who has worked for Telstra, there is no reason why they should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many in the community are reluctant to make a call to a mobile phone because of the cost involved. Unlike calls to other home phones, these are timed calls and can become expensive. I suspect there is no need for such a charge. To be sure, the correctness or otherwise of these assertions will be proven as the new era of competition replaces the previously regulated regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that this package sets the table for an open, truly competitive, innovative and inventive communications environment. There is freedom for industry players and there is choice and protection for consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I am confident that this vital industry will provide that which is desired by all Australians&mdash;more job opportunities. As our universities seek to turn out better qualified graduates, the increased activity in the communications area should provide these graduates with many long-term secure jobs. As we all know, the best hope for increased employment is productive and profitable business enterprises. I commend these bills to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to speak on the telecommunications legislation before the House&mdash;an omnibus package if ever I saw one. This legislative package consists of 11 bills, and together they will provide for the establish 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment of a new competitive telecommunications regime beginning on 1 July this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As previous speakers have noted, this new structure will replace the current telecommunications duopoly&mdash;and, in the case of mobile phones, the triopoly. The legislation before us is the result of an ongoing process which started back in 1990 when the Hawke Labor government decided that the future model of the telecommunications industry would involve competition in all aspects of the network.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, this is an omnibus package. Looking through the complexities of it, I thought to myself, `What does it really mean for the average person in the street and for the constituents in my electorate of Franklin?' In the time I have left, I would like to concentrate specifically on the issue of the bill's impact on ordinary Australians&mdash;by that, I mean the people I serve in the rural, urban and remote areas of southern Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important to concentrate on the issue of this bill's impact on ordinary Australians, irrespective of where these people may reside, and their expectation that this bill will provide them with access on an equitable basis to what is called standard telephone services&mdash;that is, payphones and other prescribed carriage services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My big concern is whether these changes that are mooted in this bill are going to mean that once again the subscribers who live in the major cities of Australia&mdash;Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth&mdash;will be able to benefit from all of these wonderful new technological advantages and advances and be able to realise the benefits of increased competition between carriers, while those in the rural and remote areas just read about what is happening to their fellow Australians. In my mind, these new changes will not be seen by them for years, if ever. This is my real big fear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the current regime, people in the rural and remote areas in my electorate only dream of having what is accessible to people on the mainland. With only a small population of 460,000&hyphen;odd people, the big players certainly are not interested in looking after 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="967"> those areas. They are more interested in the mainland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This huge package, a very complex one of many parts, will have an impact on the telecommunications service delivery of the people I represent&mdash;as I said, those in the urban, rural and remote parts of southern Tasmania. In parts of my electorate, under the telecommunications regime, subscribers are penalised by living in the most southerly parts of Tasmania&mdash;such as the small townships of Dover, Cockle Creek and Catamaran.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much is spoken of the universal service obligation expected of carriers in the provision of services to the Australian community. People wax lyrical about what they call the USO. Currently, many of my constituents are financially disadvantaged by bureaucratic line drawing, which is always done from the mainland capitals of Sydney and Melbourne where Telstra and Optus reside. Because of the misunderstanding of what constitutes rural and remote areas in their minds, this line drawing defines areas which are included in the local call area and forces other people to pay STD rates because they are on the other side of this so-called line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The three centres that I mentioned&mdash;Dover, Cockle Creek and Catamaran&mdash;could have quite easily been included in the local area network as these are the last small townships. There would have been no great financial cost to Telstra and the Telstra profits. But were we able to convince the powers that be in Telstra? No way, Jose. Despite having Ted Taylor as state manager&mdash;a fantastic bloke who has encouraged Telstra to develop strong community links in Tasmania&mdash;we were not able to budge the Telstra hierarchy. So much for the universal service obligation. It is all words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that, under this new legislation, the universal service regime has been the subject of only a relatively minor change. It is interesting to note that in clause 152 universal service providers must submit a universal service plan for approval by the minister. The bill states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In deciding whether to approve . . . a plan . . . the Minister must have regard to whether: 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the plan provides for the universal service obligation . . . to be fulfilled&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It has to be fulfilled in two parts, which are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) as efficiently and economically as practicable&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Wonderful vagueness! And:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> at performance standards that reasonably meet the . . . needs of the community.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Wonderful bureaucratic jargon&mdash;trying to tie people down to `as efficiently and as economically as practicable' and `performance standards that reasonably meet the . . . needs of the community'. How vague and wishy washy, yet when it comes to drafting legislation, subclauses, sections and paragraphs jump out and bite you in the neck.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would urge the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) in all sincerity to ensure that the many carriers who enter the market after 1 July this year do much more than just `reasonably meet' community expectations, and that efficiency and economy do not drive service delivery, especially in the many rural and remoter areas not only in my electorate but in electorates throughout Australia that many members in this place who have already spoken on this issue represent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has Minister Alston said about all this? What are his thoughts on the matter? It is interesting to note that the minister called for a group of people to be set up to advise him. He set up a magic group called the Standard Telephone Service Review Group. There were people on it from a wide spectrum: from the Federation Council of the Isolated Children's Parents Association, the Australian Consumers Association, the National Farmers Federation, the coordinator of the Consumer Telecommunications Network, Telstra, Vodafone and Optus to Professor Henry Ergas, the visiting professor from the Centre for Research in Network Economics and Communications at the University of Auckland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This illustrious group of people were given a page and a half of terms of reference and were asked to bring down a report. It is interesting to note the minister's response when the report was brought down. One would assume that we would have had one 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="968"> report. The minister had chosen these people and, knowing ministers and their choice of people to report back to them, one would have thought that there would not have been too much in the way of dissension. But, to my amazement, two reports were brought down: one by Professor Ergas, a sole dissenting report, and one by the rest of the group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note the response that was gained from these two reports. Senator Alston, in his media release of 6 February 1997 entitled `Reports on standard telephone service released', stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . while he was disappointed the Review Group was unable to reach a consensus, this was not surprising given the complexity of the issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I established the review to assess whether the rapid changes in technologies and increased usage of advanced communications like fax, email and the Internet warranted upgrading the standard telephone service.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A little later on he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am particularly concerned to ensure that any change to the current arrangements does not impose undue costs on users of the ordinary telephone service. Professor Ergas' report makes it clear very substantial sums of money could be involved and it is therefore essential that the government obtains  an accurate assessment of likely cost implications for consumers before the matter can be taken further.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, the reports do not provide a quantitative assessment of the additional costs which changes to the standard telephone service would generate, and how these might translate into higher phone prices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will be seeking a more detailed assessment of costs and benefits of the Group's proposals before making a response to the recommendations of the reports.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is interesting to read what Professor Ergas had to say in his dissenting report. He sharply criticised the committee's methodology. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report does not pay serious attention to the likely costs and benefits of the recommendations it advances and fails to note the significant impacts they might have on charges for the standard residential telephone service.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">While not denying there is a need to provide enhanced services to non-metropolitan subscribers, Professor Ergas argues against 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> prescribing these through the universal service obligation. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is difficult to see what information there is in the report which in any way justifies a presumption in favour of prescription.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What was the minister's response to all this? To my amazement, the minister seems to have favoured the minority report compared with the report of the majority of the other members of the committee. It is interesting to see from some press articles how the members of the committee took umbrage at the minister's response. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  of 7 February 24 this year entitled `Rural phone reform less likely' the Executive Director of the Australian Telecommunications Users Group, Mr Allan Horsley, who is a member of the committee, described Senator Alston's release as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . almost an insult to the committee . . . <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is grossly inappropriate that the work be given the offhand treatment that it has, especially as the committee included the carriers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The chairman of the committee, Mr Jock Given, the director of the Communications Law Centre, said he was disappointed that the release did not accurately reflect the committee's findings.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  of 11 February 1997 entitled `Alston weighs up the cost of national ISDN standard' the Managing Director of the Australian Telecommunications Consumers Users Group, Mr Allan Horsley, said that the minister risked `losing the confidence of the industry if he ignored a substantial body of work understood taken over a reasonable period of time'. Mr Horsley labelled Professor Ergas's report as `destructive'. The Policy Manager of the Australian Consumers Association, Ms Mara Bun, said that the six-month process had been subverted by an independent consultant.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise two matters very briefly. The first one is for the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer). I have advice from AusAID that they are aware of an emerging drought situation in parts of Kenya since late last year. The government of Kenya has recently declared a national emergency and launched an appeal for international assistance for drought relief measures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a matter that I believe the Minister for Foreign Affairs ought to give very rapid and prompt attention to, not only on most important humanitarian grounds but also because of the important role that Kenya plays as a partner of Australia in the Indian Ocean Rim initiative. Kenya was one of the five original nations in that process. It is a country which, because of the importance&mdash;that is recognised&mdash;of our relationships in the Indian Ocean, we ought to be paying particular attention to. For those reasons, as well as the more fundamental humanitarian reasons, the Minister for Foreign Affairs ought to be giving prompt attention to this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second matter I wish to raise is a matter for the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston). It arises from a constituent who came to my office&mdash;a Mrs Azab&mdash;who, much to her consternation, recently received a bill from Telstra of over $4,800 and another from Optus of some $900. The overwhelming number of calls registered with Telstra were to a 1902 number and with Optus they were to a 1900 number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mrs Azab has a 15-year-old son who has attention deficit hyperactive disorder. A very quick perusal of the accounts she has received shows that on a whole range of days&mdash;for example, picking 29 November at random, when some 18 calls were made&mdash;calls were made for quite lengthy periods of time to a number that describes itself as a telephone counselling service, a 1902 number. These were matters that were raised with Austel. Austel gave a most disappointing response to Mrs Azab where they said that it was not a matter they would take up.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She has raised the matter with an organisation called the Telephone Information Services Standards Council. She was told by a Telephone Information Services arbitrator on 28 January that she would get a response within two weeks. That has not been forthcoming. Frankly, I believe a situation exists here where vulnerable, isolated people are very much subjected to the possibility of quite considerable exploitation by these sorts of call services, which charge extraordinarily expensive rates for so-called counselling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had a staff member in my office today make a call to the 1902 number. I will just give the House a very brief sample of the so-called counselling that goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">190:  How old are you?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff: I'm 21.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">190: Your're just a baby. What do people as young as you get up to?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff: Oh, we go on a night just to see a band, have a few drinks, then hit a club.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">190: And then do what boys just do, hey!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff: Yeah we get up to all sorts.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the level of sophisticated counselling that people are paying money for on these numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation is that this family simply cannot afford a Telstra bill of the extraordinary order that they have received. It would seem to me that companies, which are seeking to exploit people of this isolated, vulnerable character or boys of this type&mdash;a boy where I have plenty of medical evidence of the genuineness of his complaint and his situation&mdash;by engaging in these services, ought to carry the risk. They ought to be the people who lose out in situations such as the one I have described.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is simply unfair for isolated, vulnerable people to be expected to pay those amazing amounts. It is equally disappointing that Austel has simply failed&mdash;when approached&mdash;to deal with the matter. The arbitrator in the industry has failed us to date. This is a matter that causes the family great consternation. They face the prospect of disconnection of an important telephone service. It is a matter which I believe the minister for communications ought to look at very quickly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to inform the House about the progress, or lack thereof, of roadworks and traffic lights at Chelmsford Drive and the New England Highway at Metford. This is a road which has in excess of 25,000 vehicles per day; a road that children cross to go to school; a road that a large section of the community cross to shop at Green Hills; and a road that is a major highway which is impossible to cross&mdash;after all, it is a national highway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 5 August 1994, three concerned residents of the Metford-Ashtonfield area in my electorate started a saga which is yet to be resolved&mdash;not through any fault of the current federal government but through the mindless political games of the current New South Wales state Labor government and the campaigning untruths of the former government. These three tireless campaigners from the Metford Residents Action Group&mdash;Veronica McLennan, Kaleen Fletcher and Joan White&mdash;started by contacting the RTA and the state member for Maitland, Peter Blackmore, along with Maitland council. To show how concerned the residents were, over 1,100 signatures were gathered on petitions and presented to the New South Wales state government. But Blackmore was told to butt out by the former federal member. After all, it was a federal highway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The progress evolved into the Maitland integrated transport study, which, beginning in late 1994, involved three detailed workshops that specifically asked for, and received, extensive community input. The final RTA report has not been released to date, despite the public input and despite the apparent desire to be seen to treat seriously the views of local residents impacted on by any decision. Maybe the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority is scared of the contents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And then that famous transport minister, Laurie Brereton, who in the dying days of the former government with the monopoly money in one pocket and a new road proposal in the other turned up in the seat of Paterson on 8 August 1995 and again two weeks later&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">bearing gifts like Santa&mdash;promising $2 million for the lights and associated roadworks. At this point in time only 14 months had transpired, and the amazing thing was there was an election in the air. To cement the promise, the former Labor member letterboxed Metford and Ashtonfield with a glossy brochure promising that $2 million&mdash;it was allocated, work starting immediately, don't pass go, collect the $200. Members on this side of the House would be used to hearing these untruths from members and former ministers of the other side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there was the obligatory public meeting by the RTA on 12 February 1996, which evolved into the three meetings of the Metford value management study&mdash;the first in March 1996 and continuing until July. By this time over two years had passed by with no solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The money was not there when we came to government. There was no mention of it in the previous minister's notes or files&mdash;it was just lies, yet again and again. We got used to it, but the community almost believed them. But we, the Howard government, fixed that. We promised we would have the money&mdash;$1.96 million&mdash;and, hey presto, change of administration in Canberra and suddenly the state Labor government is playing games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The works are being held up by&mdash;guess who&mdash;the RTA and the NSW state government. Now, when these residents call the RTA to find out what is happening they are told: `Contact Bob Baldwin&mdash;he's sitting on the plans.' Well, Bob Baldwin is no draftsman and, further, he is tired of being used as the whipping boy for the political games of the RTA and the state Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people have been lied to by the RTA and by none other than Bob Sharpe, Regional Manager of the RTA, and some of his colleagues. They have been playing games&mdash;games with people's lives. I and my office have followed this through diligently all the way and we have been continually reassured by Bob Sharpe of the RTA during private meetings in my office between him, Peter Blackmore and me that it was all happening, that it was waiting for federal approval. This was all garbage. It took forever to get it to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="971"> desk of the federal minister, John Sharp. The state government was sitting on the plans while the people of Paterson waited. The then minister for roads, Michael Knight, and now Carl Scully are sitting on these plans. The money is in place; they know it. They just want to play games and delay the project, hoping that it will reflect badly on that outstanding Liberal state member Peter Blackmore and me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, the Weakleys Drive and Thornton Road lights were promised during the election by Labor. But, again, the previous government did not provide the funding. We have put them in&mdash;no surprise given the time and urgency. But they must have been fast&hyphen;tracked: they just happen to be in the surrounding Labor seat of Hunter. And to show it was political, they imported a Labor state member, John Price, to open the lights&mdash;lights funded with federal money. It is just games, games and more games. Labor does not care, and has not ever cared, for the people in the Hunter. They just use them up as election fodder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put the state roads minister on notice that if there is an accident in the area&mdash;and indeed it has been pouring bucket loads up there today and yesterday&mdash;it will now be Carl Scully who has the blood on his hands. I call on the state minister to fast&hyphen;track the project and get the work under way so the people in Medford can get on with their lives.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="971"><TITLE>Clergy

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are few things more repulsive than a pious cleric and, despite the decline of organised religion, we have them in abundance in Australia. You know the type: unctuous elites, out of touch with everyday cares, who luxuriate in their own high morality. They are great favourites of the fashionable media types&mdash;and don't they know it. In their glib, superficial sanctity they perfectly complement those pious secular clerics of the politically correct establishment. From their lofty heights, and stroking their swollen egos, they pontificate upon the heads of the unworthy with one eye on the cameras.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The uproar over Pauline Hanson has given such clerics a golden opportunity to parade their sanctity while lambasting the unworthy general population. There has been no attempt to understand, only to wallow in their own vanity and to pander to elite opinion. While they may congratulate each other and be congratulated in the press, they have increased the distance between themselves and the wider Australian population&mdash;not that they have any time for such unfashionable commoners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had one recently who vainly preened herself before the assembled media at an Anglican church summit, attended by both the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). For the benefit of the politicians and referring to the gospel, she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . beware of practising your piety before others in order to be seen by them.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She then went on to illustrate the very thing she had warned against. She again used Pauline Hanson as a stick to beat us with and glibly and unctuously cast Australia down among the pariahs of the earth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A man perfectly at home amongst such people, though not a religious cleric, is our Governor&hyphen;General, Sir William Deane. He was appointed by that most un&hyphen;Australian of people, Paul Keating, who was no doubt confident that Sir William would support his internationalist republicanism. Sir William is a Holy Joe preacher of the first water. Secular cleric, hero of the elites, Holy Billy is frequently seen in all the most fashionable media outlets with an expression of studied anguish on his holy face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once, enveloped in smoke, he sat amidst what was supposed to be an enactment of some sort of Aboriginal ceremony, largely organised and conceived by Holy Joe white fellas and set on church ground. Holy Billy made a fool of himself, pretending to be an Aboriginal. It was a perfect illustration of what he is&mdash;all smoke and mirrors. If he wants to feel like an Aboriginal he should come to my electorate and spend some time sleeping rough. He may realise how useless and counterproductive all this holy posturing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="972"> and preaching is, and how little it does to help real Aboriginal people at the grassroots.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If he wants to speak about multiculturalism he should make an effort to study its failings and not insult our intelligence by pretending everything is all right with it. It may make him feel good but his outpourings have increased tensions, not helped understanding and reconciliation. Here is a man who, despite or because of his supposedly superior learning, only sees what he wants to see&mdash;a good samaritan who lives in luxury and sends the wider Australian population bills for his charitable works.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak tonight about the life of an ex&hyphen;POW, Mr Keith Botterill, who was born in Nyngan on 1 August 1924 and who passed away in Sydney, at the age of 72, on 25 January this year.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What was remarkable about this person was that he was one of only six survivors of World War II's infamous Sandakan death marches. Only six out of 1,800 Australians survived those marches; none of the 750 British solders did. Five of those six survivors are now dead. Only Owen Campbell, an 80&hyphen;year&hyphen;old, survives. He lives near Brisbane.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Keith Botterill escaped from the Ranau prisoner of war compound in North Borneo, now the Malaysian state of Sabah,<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> after surviving the 250&hyphen;kilometre death march from Sandakan. In August 1945, at the end of the war, he was found by Sergeant J.A. `Lofty' Hodges of the Australian Special Reconnaissance Division party. I might just quote the words of Keith Botterill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The next day I was lying down, thinking that I could not walk another step, when I looked up and saw an Australian face bending over me. He was a big, six footer. He just sat down beside me and cried, and I cried too.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It was thought that Keith Botterill was unlikely to survive. He weighed only 38 kilograms&mdash;six stone&mdash;and over one stone of that was attributed to swelling from beri-beri. He had been hobbling along with the support of a stick, using the other hand to hold up his testicles, which were swollen from beri-beri. This disease is due to a vitamin B1 or thiamine deficiency from starvation or eating refined rice. It causes muscle weakness, heart failure and oedema in various parts of the body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Botterill was raised largely by his grandmother, who had 13 of her own children to raise. He started work at the age of 14 as a screen printer. He put up his age to enlist, at 16&half; years, in the army. He served with the 2/19th Battalion in Singapore where, as a 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;old, he was wounded in his stomach by a Japanese bullet. He became a prisoner of war in February 1942 in Changi and was shipped to Sandakan to help build an airfield and service roads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of 1944 allied forces were getting within striking distance and the Japanese authorities decided to move the soldiers out in this infamous march, which became the most ruthless, horrific, demeaning act of incomprehensible cruelty of the war. If you fell, you were bayoneted or shot. Had the supreme commander, Douglas MacArthur, released a few DC3s for a few days in March 1944, as he was requested, a rescue operation could have gone ahead with a high chance of success. Perhaps a thousand or so soldiers could have been rescued. In mid&hyphen;1944 to August 1944 that march took place. Men dropped from malnutrition, disease, exhaus 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="973"> tion, bayoneting, and shooting. Only six survived, and only then because they escaped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The treatment of Keith Botterill as a prisoner of war was bad. They used to place him in a cage above the ground. He was bashed every day. He was in this cage once for 12 days, and on another occasion for 40 days with 17 other prisoners. On one occasion, they received no water for the first three days, then they were made to drink until they were sick. They received no food for seven days and then were put on half rations, despite their emaciation and infection with lice and scabies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the war he put this behind him. He knuckled down to hard physical work. He worked on the Snowy Mountains scheme and the construction of Warragamba Dam. He met his wife, Ruth, at Katoomba. She used to deliver milk for the tea for the workers there. He is survived by three daughters&mdash;Susan, Judy and Wendy&mdash;a son, Keith, and 13 grandchildren.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He gave evidence after the war against Japanese guards accused of war crimes, but he spared the life of one man who had shown kindness. That guard's son came to Australia 10 years ago to thank him. I salute a courageous and remarkable Australian. He epitomised everything that is noble and admirable in the digger legend. His story of extraordinary feats of survival should be recognised in this parliament, and I am pleased to acknowledge them here this evening.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="973"><TITLE>Legal Aid Funding</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to take the opportunity to address an issue that I think is of enormous social importance to our community today; that is, the question of legal aid funding. I preface my comments with a couple of notes. First of all, we have seen in the last federal budget additional court charges being made&mdash;at a very heavy level, I might add&mdash;particularly in relation to matters affecting family law. I mention that in passing at the beginning of this adjournment speech, because that sets the scene for another step that occurred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Additional to that were cuts in funding to a range of community services which assist in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> family breakdown and family matters generally within our community. Couple those two things with a third issue, which I think is the most alarming; that is, the playing that is going on in funding for legal aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that most legal aid matters where family law is concerned are the ones that affect families. This government purports very strongly&mdash;throughout the election campaign and since&mdash;that they have a patent on caring for families, that families are the backbone of our nation, that they care for families, and that they believe in the sanctity of the family. Yet it seems to me that everything they are doing in this area of social policy is attacking that very group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is absolutely no doubt that in the ACT there is a great deal of effort going on at the local government level&mdash;I commend all players in that area&mdash;to desperately try to save the situation in relation to funding for legal aid. The situation in the ACT is unique because it appears that the Commonwealth has admitted that the Commonwealth matters accounted for a particular amount of money last financial year, which in fact was $3.006 million, and the subsidy that we received back in the ACT from the Commonwealth was something like $646,000 short. Despite that admitted error, it seems that both the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) have made a concerted decision that they will ignore that and that they will get on and debate and negotiate in terms of funding for future years. That is really starting on the back foot before you get any further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The options that are facing the ACT, as I believe are the options facing all states and territories, are simple. Either you continue to run at a loss, running a legal aid service as best you can on the limited funds that are appearing to be made available or, alternatively, you set up your own state or territory service and allow the Commonwealth to consider setting up theirs separately. That seems the most retrograde step you could ever consider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a start, what could be more un&hyphen;cost effective than running two separate services? Additionally, how can you ensure that the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="974"> clients of those two services will get proper, fair and adequate service when in a majority of family law cases&mdash;I would say in most&mdash;there is a very definite crossing over between both state or territory and Commonwealth jurisdictions. In other words, to try to administer that system of legal aid on a split basis means that, in many cases, clients are going to have to either figuratively or in realistic terms go from one office to another and back again. Whether that occurs on paper or physically, it is going to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that, if this government are fair dinkum, if they are saying to us that they have deficits that they have to attend to, that they regrettably have to make these sorts of cuts, then why on earth are they going to help to create a system that is most cost ineffective and most inconvenient to the people they say they care for more than anybody else? It seems a most ludicrous situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the constituency that I represent, I say that this situation is absolutely and totally unacceptable. The families in my constituency who happen to fall into the unfortunate category of requiring legal aid deserve nothing more nor less than a proper and fair approach to justice. That must be adequately funded and appropriately administered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment, I do not see any signs that we are getting any sensible debate out of the government. For the Prime Minister to say the other day, I think in the media and in this place, that there is no further consideration being given to the issue saddens me unbelievably because this is a very important social and family issue in our community and one that I believe must receive better attention than it is at the moment. I urge all members, particularly those on the other side&mdash;and more particularly the women members on the other side&mdash;to lobby hard and long to have this decision reversed. It is inappropriate, it is unjust and it is inequitable to everybody who participates in the legal aid process.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="974"><TITLE>Small Business: Interest Rate Reductions</TITLE>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which appeared in today's Brisbane <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>  and which sadly reported a small business operator in my electorate who is in such financial difficulty she is considering closing her shop within the Garden City Shopping Centre after 16 years of trading. The problems that face Louise Esdale, whom I have known for some years, centre on the failure of the banks in this country to actually pass on interest rate reductions to small business traders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I empathise greatly with the position Louise is in. I know she has been a very effective small business operator. She has also been very active in chamber of commerce activities and a strong advocate for others in small business in my area. Her store, Something Special, has been a very successful operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Her landlord at Garden City is AMP. They have demanded she make a number of very expensive renovations as part of the terms and conditions of her lease agreement over the 16 years she has been there. She has, amongst other things, had to mortgage her home to meet the cost of these expensive renovations to her shop front. The centre has just undergone a massive restructuring and reworking and major operators who trade in the centre are able to meet the costs of renovations far easier than small&mdash;mother and father or husband and wife type teams&mdash;business operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very concerned for people in my electorate like Louise. I think tremendous pressures have been placed on them as a result of the previous government's legacy. That is bad enough. The fact is the banks, which I think have continued to snub the real opportunities given to them through deregulation for so many years and which have basically continued to do whatever they darn well like, need to get a very large slap across the wrist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) suggesting that if banks do not want to do the right thing and cooperate, then perhaps we should seriously consider some sort of re&hyphen;regulation of the banking sector. There are some results that this country wants and needs that the banks are not fulfilling. I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="975"> think the time has come to get very tough with banking operators in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very concerned because effective operators like Louise are feeling a strong lag effect in the reality of the day to day operations of their business. They understand this government is well intentioned. They know the Prime Minister is very strong in his commitment to the small business sector, but the effect they are feeling on a day to day basis just does not seem to back up the optimism they had. As their local member, I think it is my role to raise this point tonight and to call on the Prime Minister to re&hyphen;double his efforts and to again confirm his strong commitment to the small business sector, offer them some concrete proof of the support I know this government has already given them and show a small business led recovery can only occur if small business survives and grows.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in the House tonight to raise an issue of great urgency in my electorate of Hughes which is causing considerable anxiety and distress amongst my constituents. The issue is that of the Garrawarra Centre for Aged Care which is located in an area of bushland between the townships of Helensburgh and Waterfall and which caters for the frail aged people with challenging behaviours and dementia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This situation has a long history going back to state and Commonwealth discussions and decisions of the previous government in 1992. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> At that stage, Garrawarra had 280 beds and we had always assumed that this would be the basis for further decision making. Subsequently, this base has been eroded to  250. In addition, the initial discussions related to a reduction of one-third of the beds, but this now has achieved the proportions of almost halving or more of the resident population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For Garrawarra, at the moment, this means a proposed downsizing to 120 beds. This is associated with a destruction of an infrastructure of teaching, education and excellence in care. The proposal will eliminate what has long been a tradition at Garrawarra&mdash;that is, the offering of a continuum of care after the resident has come to reside there. It will also mean destruction of community day care programs which facilitate community residence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For Sutherland shire, this will represent a very significant loss of nursing home beds and a drop in the ratio per thousand persons over 70 to well below the accepted Commonwealth guidelines when adjusted to the current resident population. This will precipitate a crisis situation within the next five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would appear that 100 beds are going to go to the Illawarra region. This would seem to be not negotiable, but perhaps 20 of those beds could remain in the Garrawarra Centre as they will service Illawarra in regard to people with challenging behaviour and dementia as their infrastructure at this moment is not geared to cope with these patients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that a rebuilding of the site is desperately needed after decades of neglect. This has been presented as an all in one phenomena. Certainly, the New South Wales state government seems to be indicating that they have capital to rebuild 120 beds. This is going to take at least two years. There is surely an intermediate position which could allow for the retention of some of the current building stock or perhaps there are funds within the Commonwealth sphere which could allow the extra rebuilding and creation of a centre of excellence. I would contend that 180 beds is probably optimal both from the viewpoint of allowing beds to go to the south and to the maintenance of the Sutherland shire infrastructure. It is a vital question to know whether this figure could be negotiated.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="976">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Associated with this decision is the commitment from the Commonwealth to fund these added beds under the Camsam arrangements and to address the question of these patients at Garrawarra who have severe challenging behaviours and who cannot be appropriately cared for under the current Camsam funding arrangements. The private sector is not happy or able to take these patients and it is vital to offer high standards of care to these very debilitated people who have the consequences of brain failure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is urgently needed is for bed numbers to be increased to an optimal figure of 180 from the current 120 proposal as per the original plan, that those people with challenging behaviour&mdash;around 80&mdash;be financed under a category 1 arrangement as is the case in the Adards dementia unit in Hobart, and financial arrangements be made to maintain Garrawarra as a centre which can offer excellence in aged care. In regard to this latter proposition, there are currently three medical officers who have great experience in the management and care of people with dementia and other problems of ageing. The isolated location of Garrawarra will make it very </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Continuing my remarks, members may be aware that my electorate of Cowan covers some of the northern suburbs of Perth. In these regions there is a substantial level of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, which all too often results in bored or poor individuals turning to drugs and drug related crime.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proud to say that this government is attempting to solve many of the nation's challenges left to us by 13 years of avarice from the Labor Party. However, it is a sad fact that the issue of crime remains one of the hardest problems to control. This is due to the fact that criminals do not tend to take much notice of legislation and law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An examination of research papers shows how divided opinions are on what are the best solutions for dealing with the increase in crime rates. This brings me to the issue of the Crimes and Other Legislation Amendment Bill which we are addressing today. The Commonwealth must seek to recover some of the costs incurred in the transportation and storage before disposal of illegal drugs. It is a sad day, though, when money must be spent on these types of operations and when the Commonwealth must put in place legislation to recover some of these costs, but we must. To not act would be to reward those who test the law by dealing in drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is this parliament's responsibility to ensure we maximise the taxpayers' expenditure by not carelessly spending funds when other sources of income may be available. This amendment will ensure that the nation can recover our costs. Not all costs can be recovered, such as salary of staff and other day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day expenses. However, the collection and disposal of narcotics is a very necessary operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It disappoints me that so much time and energy is spent on cleaning up the deeds of the dirty few&mdash;the people who involve themselves in the drug dealing lifestyle. Almost every day in my electorate I see and hear evidence of people who have come unstuck due to the influence of drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will quote some figures which come from the report of a task force on drug abuse. The report states that, in particular, of juvenile detainees held in detention in Western Australia, 89 per cent had been drug users and 47 per cent had been using every day prior to a 1992 survey. Twenty&hyphen;seven per cent had been using cannabis daily in 1992 and 58 per cent in 1995&mdash;indicating an increase in cannabis usage. Eleven per cent had been using amphetamines in 1992 and 17 per cent in 1995&mdash;indicating an increase in amphetamine usage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many reasons for this dilemma. However, there is a strong argument that the issue of drug usage should really be seen as a health issue rather than a criminal issue. There is an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="978"> argument for a total rethink of the way we deal with the issue of drug usage. Seeking reasons for drug abuse seems to be a perennial problem and, whilst some dangerous and destructive addictive drugs are legal in our community, such as alcohol and tobacco, using them is not. Perhaps a debate on the decriminalisation of certain drug usage could be brought on in a very serious manner if it were relevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Drug abuse is an issue which affects many of our young people. Perhaps the emphasis on criminal activity, rather than treating usage as a health issue, is not the preferred way to address the problem. Many teenagers who have become involved in the drug lifestyle seem to be introduced to drug usage through the most recent worrying trend of the rave party culture. The accompanying music and associated body stimulating beats per minute, the fashion trends and the excitement of rave parties appeal to many young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other attraction is the presence at these parties of ecstasy. The drug enhances the music beat, thus further stimulating the drug user. Perhaps not all raves tolerate the use of these drugs, but many do due to the rise of this relatively new culture. There must have been a resultant increase in the trafficking of drugs such as ecstasy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some seven per cent of the population is using the drug ecstasy. Who could ever forget the tragic tale of the Sydney girl, Anna Wood, who became a victim of this drug and the rave scene? Unfortunately, other people have been lured by the so&hyphen;called easy money aspect of drug dealing, whether it be for the extra funds or simply as a way of life. For example, at the beginning of this year, a constituent contacted my office seeking options for the assistance of a young man who had recently come out of gaol after serving a 12&hyphen;month sentence for drug dealing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="979">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He fell into the dealing scene by way of boredom and possibly a lack of direction, dealing to pay for his living. There was no thought of retribution, as it appeared to him that little time was done for this crime and it was hard to get caught. But he was caught. He is now out of gaol and he is preparing to make a go of his life in an honest way. He was lucky, in a sense, that he learnt his lesson. If there had been a proper deterrent, perhaps he would not have even committed the crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what of all those other drug dealers who choose to continue with their illegal vocation? These are the ones who deserve to pay the harshest penalty this country can offer. Drug addicted people are not the only ones who are prey to drug dealers and traffickers. The other victims are in fact everyday people; they are victims of crime who suffer as a result of drug addicts needing money to pay for their habits, and they are family members who may have to witness the breakdown of trust that being a drug addict entails.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Luckily, within Cowan&mdash;and, I am sure, in many other electorates&mdash;we have a variety of agencies which seek to address these problems and other associated issues that lead to crime. Agencies which handle problems such as unemployment, drug abuse, broken homes and homelessness, particularly when it comes to our youth, attempt to pinpoint the cause of all the trouble and set young people back on the path to recovery and law&hyphen;abiding behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, when I look at other countries with relatively low crime rates, I wonder what it is exactly that they do that makes crime control so effective. Is it because they are so strict, and the punishment is so severe that it serves as a suitable deterrent? I have been to Malaysia&mdash;which, as everyone knows, is notorious for the severity of its sentencing laws. As I was riding through the city of Kuala Lumpur in a taxi to the airport, I saw a sign on a wall of the gaol. The gaol was not really an attractive place to look at. The sign said, `You take drugs, you suffer.' The message was pretty simple to me: if you took drugs, you were going to suffer. By the look of the gaol, they were suffering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Drug dealers must in fact pay the penalty, and this brings me to my next point. The time has come to crack down on drug trafficking in Australia, and I am calling for stricter sentencing laws to deal with drug trafficking crimes. The presence of drugs in our society is something which is a sad reality and one that it is doubtful will ever go away. The fact that all drugs, bar alcohol and nicotine, are more or less illegal and yet abuses still occur means that, rather than try and while away the drug issue, we must address it as it is and approach it with the realistic outlook that abuse of illegal drugs will, most likely, always be with us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why I am suggesting a different approach to drug usage management and recommending that the community begin to look at drug use as a public health issue, thus raising the issue into a more acceptable climate of debate rather than keeping to the crime aspect of it. However, we should never accept dealing and trafficking of drugs as desirable. Drug dealing is basically profiteering in the weakness and desperate needs of others, and this surely grinds against any community's entire value system. I would suggest that the time has come for legislation to go much further and crack down on these specimens who survive by preying on the weaknesses and addiction of others. By this I mean tougher sentences. Today, I am calling for mandatory minimum sentencing of 25 years for drug dealing or drug trafficking, no matter how large or small the deal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Customs Act of 1901, nine drugs are listed as narcotic&mdash;this includes cannabis&mdash;and a commercial quantity is measured in kilograms and a trafficable quantity in grams. The maximum penalty for the importation of a commercial quantity of any of the nine narcotics is imprisonment for life. The maximum penalty for a trafficable quantity is a fine not exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 25 years, or both. In the case of importing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="980"> a trafficable amount of cannabis, the maximum is a fine not exceeding $4,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 10 years, or both.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is nowhere near enough. Only recently in Western Australia, we had two gentlemen fined about $120,000 each for trafficking in abalone. On this occasion, it would seem the law protects our wildlife more greatly than it does our young people. In Western Australia, according to schedule 4 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1981, the maximum penalty for the possession of a prohibited drug with intent to sell or supply is a fine not exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment for a term of 25 years without the option of a fine. However, the maximum penalty for conspiring to sell or supply a quantity of prohibited drug is a term of imprisonment not exceeding 20 years, with an option of a fine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time to stop pussy&hyphen;footing about drug dealers. The community wants some toughness in sentencing&mdash;that is the message I am getting from my electorate. The police believe that tough sentencing laws for dealing and trafficking will act as a deterrent, and they cite Singapore's sentencing as an example. Extending gaol terms for drug dealers to a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years seems to be a suitable sentence to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Drugs are the one thing that survives by shamelessly preying on the weak. Sure, there are many outwardly so&hyphen;called normal people who may make an informed choice to use drugs. However, if someone deals in drugs, by making a profit from the sale of drugs they should be made to suffer. This amendment hurts them financially, but they must also have a substantial gaol penalty. I am calling for a minimum of 25 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Illegal drug organisations rely on the little men to do their dirty work&mdash;and those people must take the fall, if necessary. Those people in turn rely on manipulating people with drug habits or manipulating people to take on drug habits, including people who may be vulnerable to such pressures, and for them I would recommend the harshest penalty possible. That they  choose to subvert other people's lives is their choice and they must live with whatever onsequences that choice may bring. If this includes a very long prison term, so be it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Countries such as Malaysia and Thailand have already made it clear that they will not tolerate drug trafficking. Whilst I do not agree with the death penalty for drug trafficking, a mandatory extended prison term would act as a deterrent. This may be considered a hysterical response to the issue of drug dealing. But, let's face it, drug dealers are dealing in death for the sake of a few dollars. How much value does one place on life? Is it just a couple of hundred dollars?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been a lot of deaths recently in Adelaide from ecstasy, and in Perth and Sydney as a result of heroin dealing. Drug dealers are not there for the health and welfare of their customers. They are not there to make sure people have a good time. They are there to make a lot of money as quickly as possible. If an emphasis were placed on the mandatory sentencing of 25 years for drug dealers, can you imagine the impact this would have on the illegal drug industry? All the foot soldiers would be wiped out, severely crippling their impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There appear to be two schools of thought when it comes to dealing with crime. One is the threat of locking them up for as long as possible as some sort of deterrent to others. The other shuns that idea and seeks to rehabilitate them and address the cause of the problem. We should not punish the victims of crime and, surely, a drug user is a victim of crime. We should, however, drop the full force of the community on those who would profit at the expense of the health of others. Mandatory sentencing for dealing and trafficking will work. So, too, will this amendment and I commend it to the Committee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Crimes and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 makes amendments to a number of acts. While I am in no way an expert in this area, I have taken a keen interest in our country's law enforcement agencies as I am a member of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. Crime, and community concern about it, is currently the No. 1 concern of people in the electorate of Bowman. In recent surveys carried out in the electorate, crime, law and order, and the level of crime were cited as the first concern of those surveyed. It is in this context that I am pleased to contribute to the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One does not have to be an expert to appreciate what the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) is proposing with these amendments. I feel the most significant of these changes is that which will affect the superannuation benefits of a convicted felon. Currently, due to a legal loophole in the system, sentences can be manipulated so that someone convicted of multiple offences may not lose their Commonwealth or employer funded superannuation benefits. This occurs when a person convicted on two counts of fraud and sentenced to 12 months imprisonment for each count has three months of the second count made cumulative with the sentence of the first count.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To me, that makes little sense, so let me put it another way. A thief rips off the government twice, gets sentenced to 12 months on both counts, serves 15 months in total and gets to keep his employer funded superannuation. I cannot, for the life of me, see how this is fair to all honest and hard&hyphen;working employees across Australia. The change proposed by this bill will put an end to this nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes propose that a superannuation order may be made if the single sentence in respect of multiple corruption offences, or the aggregate of sentences in respect of multiple corruption offences, exceeds 12 months. In other words, if you are convicted for two counts of fraud and get eight to six months cumulative sentences for the two, totalling 14 months, you have just lost your employer funded superannuation benefits. The only exception to this  is where a person who is convicted of a corruption offence receives a sentence under subsection 20AB of the Crimes Act which could see that person serving only periodic detention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important section of this bill deals with the recovery of costs incurred by the Commonwealth in relation to the storage and maintenance of confiscated goods. These goods usually come in the form of vehicles and marine vessels used by drug traffickers. This amendment will allow the Commonwealth to recover, as the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) put it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Out of pocket expenses it incurs in relation to the transportation and storage of narcotic&hyphen;related goods that are condemned and placed in commercial storage facilities, prior to the goods being transferred to the Official Trustee for disposal.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Currently, the Trustee is able to recover costs for such activities. This amendment will allow the Commonwealth to do likewise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the amendment will not allow the Commonwealth to recover other costs incurred, such as salary of staff, or everyday running costs such as telephones. Nor will the Commonwealth be able to recover expenses that are an ordinary incident of its operation. When you consider the number of boats, planes, cars and trucks used by these drug traffickers, the cost to the Commonwealth of storing them would be immense. I think that it is fair and reasonable for the Commonwealth to receive reimbursement for these costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third section of this bill I wish to speak on is the amendment to the Crimes Act 1914 which will increase the value of a penalty unit. In his second reading speech, the Attorney&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="982">General explained that in 1992 it was decided that all pecuniary penalty provisions in Commonwealth legislation were to be expressed in penalty units to enable penalties to be adjusted from time to time. Penalty units are used to determine the maximum length of sentence, or amount of a fine, and currently the penalty unit is $100. So, if you were fined 100 penalty units, your fine would be $10,000. The reason for using the penalty unit system is to make it easier to vary the value of a fine to reflect the current money value. As is the case with most things, inflation devalues everything, including penalty units.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney&hyphen;General pointed out that, according to figures provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the change to the consumer price index numbers between June 1992 and September 1995 is calculated at approximately 9.6 per cent. This means that the value of the penalty unit has dropped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One can only assume that if all other costs are increasing, so must the profits be from crime related activities. Therefore, it is not unreasonable that the penalty for crimes should also increase accordingly. Under the amendment proposed by this bill, the penalty unit will be increased from $100 to $110. On its own, that is not a huge jump, but the fellow earlier who was fined 100 penalty units has thus had his fine increased by $1,000. I would have to reflect that this is, in reality, a drop in the ocean. What we should have is a greater punitive and prohibitive fine, double or treble the penalty units: make the user pay, and pay dearly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the amendments, as quoted by the Attorney&hyphen;General, will have a minor and unquantifiable financial impact on government revenue. I would have to say: why not make it a viable revenue raiser? Obviously, inflationary pressures also impact on the running of the courts and law enforcement agencies. Without these measures, the cost of catching the criminals will be extremely inhibitive and will affect the overall outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far I have spoken on matters that focus on severer penalties for criminals. However, with any legal system there will always be a minority of innocent citizens who get caught by  mistake. This bill will also amend the Extradition Act 1988 to correct deficiencies and thus lessen the likelihood of innocent citizens being held incorrectly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first of these amendments deals with the application of bail. Under the current system, if a magistrate remands a person in custody following the application of bail that person is not entitled to make further application for release on bail during the remand period. The original intent of this was to stop people from magistrate shopping, where someone who is refused bail by one magistrate simply asks for their case to be heard by a second and, hopefully, more lenient magistrate. The honourable member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) alluded to cases where he has had personal experience of this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the legislation does not allow for someone to make a further bail application, even if the person's circumstances change such that bail would be justified but the original magistrate is no longer available. This could happen if the magistrate resigned or retired. This amendment proposes that, if a person initially fails in his or her bail application on merit, he or she is not able to make a further application unless there is evidence of a change in circumstances that might justify bail being granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second change to the Extradition Act 1988 relates to the procedures following the arrest of a person who has escaped from lawful custody. The intent here is quite obvious: the Attorney&hyphen;General is looking to make sure that the right person is arrested. Under the present legislation, a police officer may arrest a person without a warrant if the said officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person has escaped from custody. That officer may arrest the person and throw them back into gaol.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="983">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to cast aspersions on our police officers, the majority of whom do a tremendous job under very trying conditions. However, it is not inconceivable that a mistake could be made. Imagine you are walking down the street one day and suddenly a police car, sirens blaring, mounts the gutter in front of you. Two huge police officers jump out of the vehicle, guns drawn and, without getting a really good look at you, scream at you to lie face down on the footpath with your hands behind your back. Of course, you would comply with their demands for fear of being shot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The police officers then handcuff you, throw you into the back of the vehicle and drag you down to the watch&hyphen;house where you are held. This may sound a bit far&hyphen;fetched but it could happen. If you bear a resemblance to a convicted felon who has escaped from custody, the police could possibly mistake you for that felon and put you in custody. This amendment requires that such a person be taken before a magistrate for testing of the arresting officer's belief that the person has escaped from custody. Until the magistrate is satisfied that the person has escaped from custody, no warrant can be issued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another section of this bill that protects the innocent is the amendment to the Proceeds of Crime Act. This amendment relates to creating a defence of reasonable corporate precaution. The Proceeds of Crime Act currently states that a body corporate is vicariously liable for the criminal conduct of its directors, servants or agents. This means that if a director or employee of a company, such as MIM, is convicted of a criminal act, the company can be held liable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is other Commonwealth legislation which, while establishing similar liability, provides a defence or reasonable corporate precaution. So if a company, such as MIM, can prove that it has taken reasonable precautions and, as the Attorney&hyphen;General put it, `exercised due diligence to avoid the conduct of its directors, servants and agents,' the body corporate may not be held liable. This amendment proposes to extend this to the Proceeds of Crime Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other change to the Proceeds of Crime Act relates to applications for variation of restraining orders and extensions of time. The act allows for the court to restrain the property  of defendants charged with serious offences. Property that remains restrained for six months after conviction is automatically forfeited to the Commonwealth. An application to have the order released or varied may be lodged but it must be listed, heard and decided within six months of the original conviction. Considerable pressure is placed on the court lists because people generally wait until the end of their trial before applying for a variation in orders. The amendments in this bill are designed to alleviate this pressure by allowing for an extension of time for the making of an application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another procedural change is that which will remove the necessity for ministerial consent before a prosecution can be instituted against a person suspected of a Commonwealth offence. In his second reading speech, the Attorney&hyphen;General explained that the provisions were originally enacted for the purpose of deterring private prosecution brought in inappropriate circumstances, particularly for offences which related to national security or international treaty obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney&hyphen;General further explained that, since the establishment of the Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, the retention of those provisions is difficult to justify. Given that the Director of Public Prosecutions has the power to take over and discontinue a private prosecution, I would have to agree with the Attorney&hyphen;General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now come to the final amendment proposed by this bill. This amendment will make changes to the Witness Protection Act 1994. Before delving into the proposed changes I would like to take a minute to extol the virtues of this program. The witness protection program is vital to the continued success of our law enforcement agencies. Without this program, many 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="984"> of those who testify at great personal sacrifice would not be willing to go through with their testimony.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It takes a great deal of courage to testify in court, particularly in matters relating to Commonwealth criminal law. I can barely imagine what it would be like to have to testify against some of these criminals in the full knowledge that their cronies are still at large and may come looking for retribution. And after testifying, witnesses find that their lives are never the same. They may have to be relocated. Their children are ripped out of a school they may have been in for years. They may have to leave behind family and friends, and start a new career. The sacrifices these people make are immense and as such I feel it is our duty to protect them in any way we can.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments proposed in this bill will make it no longer an offence for a participant in such a program, or someone who was previously a participant, to make disclosures when making a complaint to the Ombudsman, under either the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981 or the Ombudsman Act 1976. Under the current legislation such a disclosure may not be made to the Ombudsman unless prior consent has been given by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I may be corrected if I am wrong, but I believe that if you have a complaint which relates to the Federal Police you are hardly likely to want to go to them to complain. While I agree that the strictest confidentiality must be maintained with regard to the witness protection program, I would have to say that for a person to feel totally at ease they must have the right to go to the Ombudsman directly with complaints. Surely the integrity of the Ombudsman is not in question here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the outset, I am not a lawyer nor do I pretend to have extensive knowledge of the laws of this land. However, I do feel strongly about the way our law enforcement agencies are operated. As a mother of three, a former school teacher of young children and a concerned citizen, I have a vested interest in ensuring the laws of the land are upheld. For this to be done, those who enforce the law have to have every assistance in doing so. I believe that this and other legislation being introduced by this government provides just such assistance. For that reason I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I propose to wind up the debate on the Crimes and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 and I would like to thank all of those members who have taken part in the debate. Those who have participated this morning, the members for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) and Bowman (Mrs West), both reflected concern in the community relating to law and order and security issues. In their own way they reflected also the concern that the legal system protect the innocent as well as punish the guilty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill makes minor and technical amendments to a number of acts dealing with Commonwealth criminal and law enforcement matters. It is not, in that sense, a major policy bill. The support of the opposition for the bill is most welcome. The member for Banks (Mr Melham), who spoke for the opposition, gave conditional support to the amendment to the Crimes Act which increases the value of the penalty unit from $100 to $110 in accordance with the consumer price index. The concern he expressed was also reflected by the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Monetary penalties in terms of penalty units were first introduced in 1992. That approach allows a range of monetary penalties to be monitored and amended simultaneously by a single amendment to the value of the penalty unit in the Crimes Act. Where a particular offence is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="985"> isolated and identified as requiring an increase in penalty, that is achieved by increasing the number of penalty units attached to that offence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The value of the penalty unit has remained unchanged since 1992. Given that the CPI increased by 9.6 per cent between June 1992 and September 1995, it is considered appropriate that the value of the penalty unit be increased. The amendment to the value ensures that the level of monetary penalties for Commonwealth offences is uniform and consistent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Bowman mentioned the possibility of double or treble penalty units. The question of whether to increase the value of a penalty unit by doubling or trebling it raises complex policy and practical issues which really could not appropriately be dealt with in a portfolio bill such as this. This bill is intended only to effect minor policy and technical amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government welcomes the support of the opposition for the amendment which corrects a deficiency in subsection 15(3) of the Extradition Act 1988. It is important that, where a person whose extradition is sought has unsuccessfully applied for bail, the person be able to apply again for bail if there is evidence of a change in circumstances which might justify bail being granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Banks and the member for Dickson also mentioned the retrospective application of the amendments to the International War Crimes Tribunals Act. The paragraphs in question are technical amendments to correct a typographical error in the 1995 amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987. In each case, section 46 of the International War Crimes Tribunals Act 1995 was referred to, whereas the correct reference should have been to section 45.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Legal advice was obtained following discovery of the errors to the effect that it is likely that a court would regard the incorrect reference as a patent mistake and interpret the amendment as referring to section 45 and not section 46.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 45 enables the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply for registration in a specified court of a forfeiture order made in relation to property believed to be in Australia when so requested by the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991, or by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda. So we are talking about two tribunals&mdash;the former Yugoslavia tribunal and the Rwanda tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No applications for registration of tribunal forfeiture orders have been received by my department from either of the tribunals. I am advised that there is none under consideration at this time. In these circumstances, no personal rights and liberties will be adversely affected by the amendments contained in the bill. So the retrospectivity is of no consequence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment to the Customs Act in the bill makes provision for the Australian Federal Police to recover the costs it incurs in relation to the transportation, storage, custody and control of vessels used in drug trafficking. This was referred to by the member for Bowman. In the course of the debate, the member for Dickson asked whether cost recovery would extend to the travel costs of the AFP where those costs relate to the transportation and the taking control of vessels used in drug trafficking. The amendment is framed broadly so that any costs, charges and expenses incurred by the AFP in that context are recoverable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act create a defence of reasonable corporate precaution. The amendment makes provision for the defence of reasonable precaution to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="986"> prevent the conduct of the body corporate's directors, servants or agents from being attributed to it, if it can establish that it took reasonable precautions and exercised due diligence to avoid the conduct. In response to the member for Dickson's questions concerning that amendment, it is for the body corporate to raise and to prove the defence. The requisite standard of proof is `the balance of probabilities'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 2 to the bill removes the requirement to obtain ministerial consent to institute proceedings for the prosecution of offences under the acts denoted in the schedule. The member for Dickson, who seems to have asked quite a lot of questions in the debate, asked whether the amendment enables a private citizen to initiate a prosecution. Private prosecutions may be instituted, which might previously have been blocked by the consent provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, as pointed out by the member for Bowman, the DPP has the power, under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act, to take over a prosecution on indictment for offences against laws of the Commonwealth where the prosecution has been instituted by someone other than the Attorney&hyphen;General. The DPP could therefore take over the prosecution and effectively terminate it. That power provides a safeguard against the continuation of prosecutions which do not comply with the prosecution policy of the Commonwealth. The government is indebted to contributions from members in the debate and I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition supports the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill in that it introduces a number of technical and drafting corrections. Firstly, it incorporates name changes to about 350 tariff classifications, which were recommended by the world customs organisations, but the current levels of tariff assistance are to be maintained. It also makes minor amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to correct drafting, formatting and spelling anomalies in the act when it replaced the Customs Tariff Act 1987.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, it corrects now to allow goods sent overseas for repair not able to be carried out in Australia to be allowed back into Australia with just the cost of the repair dutiable and not the value of the entire item. This apparently was the effect of some inadvertent drafting in the earlier act, and the effect of this change commences from 15 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also reduces the duty on aviation fuels by 0.75 per cent per litre, due to over&hyphen;recovery during the 1995&hyphen;96 year of the aviation industry's contribution to air safety costs. It also introduces a phase back to the general tariff of five per cent for goods which were unintentionally included at the 15 per cent rate, for certain automotive parts and certain textile applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, it reimposes the general five per cent tariff on a range of plastics previously exempted under the Canada&hyphen;Australia trade agreement. The government, it would appear, has been persuaded by Australian industry that Canadian manufacturers had an unfair advantage over their Australian counterparts and has, accordingly, through this, reimposed the tariff. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="987"> opposition sees these as sensible corrections. We support the proposed changes and lend our support to the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise also to support the amendments to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996. This bill amends the 1995 act to enact measures introduced earlier into the House of Representatives as customs tariff proposals. These amendments are drafted twice yearly to maintain some 350 tariff classifications recommended by the World Customs Organisation, to which Australia is a contracting party. There are also a further 200 Australian classifications which make up our own tariff program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1988, Australia adopted a new classification system for administering imports and for collecting and presenting foreign trade statistics. This new system&mdash;the harmonised commodity and coding system&mdash;has been developed over a number of years by an international body, the Customs Cooperation Council, of which Australia is a member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new international harmonised system, sponsored by the WCO in Brussels, replaces the tailored Australian tariff system, with domestic subheadings, with a universal six&hyphen;digit code. The first six figures of each classification are taken from the international system and the seventh and eighth figures are for Australia to insert. These seventh and eighth figures provide a separate category while under the same tariff grouping, making it possible for Australia to impose its own domestically determined tariff system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A universal coding system is essential in the new world of international trade where countless goods are traded between countries and categories are proliferating. The new system incorporates new products that have come into the international trade market in recent years. Value added, technically advanced products and components emerge without a suitable tariff concession to cater for them. This requires the introduction of new classifications. So Australia has adopted the classification changes as agreed and formalised by the principal Customs Tariffs Act in 1995, and it has added 200 national tariff splits to maintain its tariff program.  These biyearly amendments are therefore necessary for the efficient and effective administration of our customs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 1 of the bill is one of four schedules, and is mainly editorial amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. The other schedules, however, have some important provisions. For example, the rates of duty for beer, spirits, tobacco products and certain petroleum products are the subject of half&hyphen;yearly adjustments in line with movements in the consumer price index, so this amendment reflects the increase which came into operation on 1 February 1996. This amendment will also provide for the tariff treatment of topped crude oil. A reference to topped crude oil was inadvertently omitted in the newer 1995 act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A new tariff structure for newsprint preserves existing rates of duty but complies with the WCO changes on the definition of newsprint&mdash;and this is also included in the amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 2 is significant and related to goods repaired overseas, a matter already referred to by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). The schedule amends the concessional entry of goods which have been sent overseas for repair when those repairs could not be carried out in Australia. Previous to this amendment, an importer has been required to pay duty on the value of the exported articles as well as duty on the repair cost. Administrative procedures have been implemented to ensure that customs duty will be collected only on the repair cost of the imported goods. This amendment gives legal effect to the administrative action taken on 15 July 1996.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="988">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal act originally tightened the eligibility definition in respect of goods that were exported from Australia to be altered overseas. Some manufacturers took advantage of a system where they could send materials overseas to be enhanced or further manufactured using relatively cheap foreign labour. They then enjoyed a duty&hyphen;free return of the goods to Australia, so a more rigid definition was introduced to discourage this practice. The principal act now only provides for the duty&hyphen;free importation of goods replaced under a safety recall. It includes goods which are being sent to consumers to compensate them for a product they have already purchased which has a design fault or safety concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment will also allow for the duty&hyphen;free return of goods which are part of a process to replace goods exported from Australia for repair or renovation, and will provide for a duty on the price of the repair or renovation only.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 3 of the bill is to do with the aviation industry and it is to do with the aviation fuel excise. Avgas is the fuel used in piston engine propeller aircraft, and is most commonly used by the general aviation industry. Avtur is used in jet aircraft and turbine powered propeller aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was an amendment to the Customs Tariff Act of 1995, which came into operation on 1 September 1996, reducing the per litre duty on aviation gasoline&mdash;avgas&mdash;and avtur. This reduction in aviation fuel excise will return more than $13 million in savings to the aviation industry in 1996&hyphen;97. The entire excise on aviation fuel is distributed by the Commonwealth to two aviation authorities. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority&mdash;CASA&mdash;is responsible for air safety regulation and Airservices Australia&mdash;AA&mdash;provides air traffic control services, air navigation facilities, rescue and firefighting services. These two authorities were created in 1995 by the division of the Civil Aviation Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reduction in excise follows a 1995&hyphen;96 over recovery of contributions from the aviation industry for operating costs of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. The total funding for CASA for the 1995&hyphen;96 financial year was $86.3 million. Of this, 40 per cent was funded by the  government. Of the remaining funding, 55 per cent was met through a levy on the aviation fuels and $4.9 million is expected to be contributed through fees for services provided by the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This funding is broadly based on a model where the users of aviation and the beneficiaries of aviation safety contribute directly to the costs. The general public contributes to this via the government appropriation, the travelling public by the excise on aviation fuels, and the aviation industry by the excise on aviation fuels and by direct regulatory service fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Revenue from excise on aviation fuels was greater than budgeted, reflecting higher than expected growth in domestic airline activity. So this reduction rightfully returns those moneys to the industry, consistent with the government's commitment to fair and equitable charging arrangements. Last year, when the coalition was in opposition, we opposed the then Labor government's plans for an increase in the excise on avgas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Beneficiaries of this reduction in flying costs will in particular be regional and commuter airlines, flying training schools and operators of agricultural and charter aircraft throughout Australia&mdash;and no&hyphen;one needs to be reminded of how significant that aviation is for rural and regional development. The reduction in excise on aviation fuels will also directly benefit the more than 20,000 private pilots, and help the major and regional airlines keep downward pressure on air fares, benefiting the travelling public.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="989">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both avtur and avgas aircraft operators contribute to an excise which is allocated to CASA. Avtur operators, the jet aircraft, pay for the air traffic services they use through a system of charges to AA&mdash;a user&hyphen;pays approach. The contribution is in the form of on route charges. Jet aircraft tend to adhere to nominated flight plans. However, avgas users, or smaller craft operators, generally do not use scheduled flight plans and a further excise has been imposed on the avgas fuel to recover their air navigation control costs to Airservices Australia. International craft pay an international aircraft charge in lieu of the excise. Our government is also progressing the planned development of long&hyphen;term funding arrangements for CASA later this year, with a view to their implementation in next year's budget, but this amendment has not reduced funding to CASA in 1996&hyphen;97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In general, the international harmonisation of tariff classifications&mdash;that is, the focus of the amendments in this bill&mdash;makes it easier for exporters to participate in international markets. It minimises the costs to exporters by decreasing paperwork and research, makes it easier to research new markets, and makes it quicker for a new industry or small business person to understand, learn and grow a market share. The amendments provide a simpler and a more understandable process for those who administer the Customs Act. The harmonised system also greatly facilitates the collection and interpretation of all foreign trade statistics. It is essential for Australia to monitor trends in world trade so we can take advantage of emerging opportunities as we develop appropriate marketing strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition supported the implementation of a new tariff classification regime in 1995 in order that Australia would become a cooperative and efficient player in world trade. We must not jeopardise Australia's ability to meet its international agreements, especially in respect of trade, and we must maintain our reputation as a facilitator of trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government aims to secure the best possible conditions and opportunities for Australian businesses trading and investing overseas. International trade is no longer the sole domain of large companies. There are now more than 4&half; thousand small and medium sized businesses actively engaged in export markets, and their numbers are growing. There is no longer any relationship between being big and succeeding; small players can also grow and succeed. They generate some $6.5 billion a year in international turnover and, of course, there are many jobs on the home front. Australia's tariff reform has played a major role in promoting the restructure of Australian industry, promoting world best practice and competitiveness and encouraging Australian firms to pursue export markets. I therefore strongly support the Customs Tariffs Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I would like to thank the speakers for their input into the debate. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996, which is now before the committee, contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. In the main, the proposals incorporated in this bill are technical measures and they fall into four parts. Schedule 1 is a series of amendments which were made in the Customs Tariff Proposal No. 1 (1996) to ensure that details contained in the Customs Tariff Act 1995 were correct when it commenced on 1 July 1996. The changes contain editorial amendments, the transfer of legislative amendments, which were enacted late in 1995 but not incorporated in the new legislation, and three tariff structural refinements to accord with the previous government's requirement that duty rates remain stable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 2 of this bill is operative from 15 July 1996. This contains consequential changes as a result of amendments to the tariff concession system. Item 19 in part 2 of schedule 4 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="990"> allows the concessional entry of goods which have been sent overseas for repair that cannot be carried out in Australia. The amendments contained, change the previous bill which would have meant that importers would have to pay duty on the value of exported articles in addition to that on the repair costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Administrative procedures were implemented to ensure that customs duty was only collected on the repair cost of the reimported goods. This amendment gives legal effect to the administrative action on 15 July 1996. Schedule 3 of the bill is operative from 1 September 1996. On 20 August 1996, my colleague the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, John Sharp, announced a reduction of 0.75 cents per litre on the duty on aviation gasoline and aviation kerosene. The duty reductions stem from the over recovery during 1995&hyphen;96 of the aviation industry's contribution to the operating costs of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry contribution is collected by the Commonwealth through a levy included in the customs and excise duty on aviation fuels. This reduction will deliver savings of more than $13 million to the industry in 1996&hyphen;97. This is consistent with the government's commitment to fair and equitable safety regulation cost recovery arrangements. The other changes contained in the bill are of an administrative nature and have no duty implications. I commend the bill to the Committee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition has indicated that we are comfortable with this legislation and, of course, that is why it is being debated in this chamber. We accept that the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill and the operations of the scheme, since it has been in place, have now to a large extent been superseded by funding through the drought relief scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say that I can well remember the angst that surrounded the introduction of this legislation. I remember a very late night sitting of the House of Representatives in the legislation's passage at a time when we were seeing a substantial downturn in commodity prices and a lot of difficulty, particularly in the agriculture sector. There was clearly a need to introduce measures that made it easier for farm households to gain financial support, while various income tests and assets tests were being applied. It was something that the Labor government of the day worked through and put in place in an attempt to make that easier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It still continued to have its administrative difficulties and, to some extent, I think what has now come into place through the drought relief scheme meets those needs and therefore this legislation is really redundant. But we are quite comfortable in going with the flow on this one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might take the opportunity, while speaking on farm household support and with some indulgence from the chair, to raise an issue that is causing me a little bit of concern at the moment in central Victoria and in other parts of regional Victoria. We have all seen the need 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="991"> for farm households and rural communities in particular to become much more innovative in finding new ways to source income and in Victoria one such interesting innovation has been the establishment of the concept of Teletrack which is to expand the racing industry into televised formula presented racing, particularly for the Asian satellite market and elsewhere. In many communities in regional Victoria, there has been a very strong and favourable response to the development of this plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have run into a bit of a problem though in that the Victorian government, which in the end has to give final approval, is now sitting on a report which I understand recommends that we proceed with this industry. There are lots of rural towns which are saying, `Yes, please do so as quickly as possible.' In the central highlands, in the goldfields local government region, it is my understanding that the commissioners want to approve it and go on with it. Lots of farms, which are now involved in this industry, are very keen about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am raising as a matter of concern, while I have the opportunity to say a few words, the fact that the state minister has not made the decision to approve this. This appears to be because of pressure from the VRC, which is not happy with the competition, obviously. I understand that the commissioners have now received a letter from the planning minister directing them to abandon this plan and revealing, I guess, the hint that if the commissioners do not agree, then they may in fact be replaced by an administrator and the move back to local government elections postponed even more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can only say in this forum that this is a classic example of people in rural and regional areas&mdash;where necessity is the mother of invention&mdash;being forced to find innovative ways to bring their communities back to life. With the changes that have taken place in the economic field here in towns such as Bairnsdale, Lakes Entrance, Maryborough, Hamilton and Portland, as well as in central Victoria, this is one such industry that has been won, and it is highly desired. I would certainly call on the Victorian state racing minister, Tom Reynolds&mdash;whom I know personally and have dealt with for many years on a very friendly basis&mdash;to get on with  the approval. If, under the influence of the VRC, the government is trying to sit on it, I call on him to very quickly correct the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note also that the Premier of Victoria is away. They always say down there that when the cat is away the mice will play, and so I guess we will need Jeff back soon to straighten this out. I understand that he is very strongly in favour of Teletrack, and wants to see it up and running. So, for all sorts of reasons, I am saying today, `Get on with it.' As I have said, the opposition is very comfortable with the changes that are involved in the legislation. We are not opposing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are awaiting with interest the outcome of the review that Senator Newman has in place to look at the application of the assets test and the income test to farm based properties, because that is directly relevant to household support and to income flows in difficult times. We wait to see what sorts of solutions come from that report and, in the interim, we are very happy for this legislation to proceed, acknowledging that Labor's farm household support scheme has really now run its race and has been superseded by the drought relief scheme.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that the opposition is not going to oppose the rather minor amendments to the legislation which the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 1996 addresses. It is meant to tidy up a situation which has evolved over the last while with the farm community. You have to go back a little in history to look closely at what has happened. I suppose that it goes back to about 1989 when there was an agreement between 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="992"> the states and the Commonwealth. At one of their ministerial meetings, the Commonwealth put forward that drought no longer be considered a natural disaster. Until that particular time, it was considered to be a natural disaster.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the facts were that there was an agreement that, having withdrawn drought as a natural disaster, certain other things needed to be put in place. The Commonwealth did agree that there would be changes&mdash;particularly in the taxation area, where farmers would be able to set aside money in the good years to tide them over the uncontrollable drought periods that occur in this country&mdash;and also other incentives whereby they would be encouraged to preserve water and fodder on their properties in order to better manage their properties so that they would not have to come back to the taxpayer in such times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, when I was the Minister for Agriculture in New South Wales and we struck the terrible drought around 1992, none of these things were in place, and so we had an extreme problem as to how we were going to accommodate people who were in dire distress. There was no doubt about it: some of them did not have any money to put food on the table, and they were in extreme circumstances. I pay tribute to the then federal minister for primary industry, Senator Collins, who, when I approached him, did put in place a scheme which was very helpful to farming families. I suppose it is the scheme that we are phasing out now because it has been superseded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is that it is important, and I think that the present minister has addressed the problem in setting up the rural task force. Some people in the community would say, `How  is the farming community so different from small business? They work along similar lines and they can probably get into the same types of financial problems.' As I mentioned before, one of the unique things about the farming community is that they have to put up with the vagaries of the seasons, and no matter how much budgeting you do, if you do get into these circumstances where the seasons turn against you, of course, it puts you in a very serious situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes back to getting some support, they do not have the ability to get support because they are considered to have an asset. The asset might be encumbered, it might be very encumbered, but they are considered to have an asset. So it does cause a problem when you are trying to give some relief to people who are in very serious and necessitous circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rural task force has addressed some of those issues as to how that can be considered. Quite frankly, the most important point is to try to make farmers self&hyphen;sufficient. You are not going to support everyone. There is no doubt that in any business some are going to fail and some are not going to be economic producers. That is a fact of life. But the majority of good managers, the majority of good producers, should not be driven out because of the nature of Australia, which is the driest inhabited continent on earth, and it certainly causes some very distressing problems from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is rather minor legislation. It is addressing a few of the issues that have become redundant. However, I do urge the parliament to consider, very closely, the report that is going to come from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, on this rural task force. Anyone who represents a rural seat will understand exactly what we are talking about. I believe the majority of Australians really understand and are very sympathetic to the way that farmers have to put up with the vagaries of the seasons and the hardships they go through in the rural and regional areas of Australia. I honestly believe that when we need to put in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="993"> place legislation that will support them, this parliament and the people of Australia will support it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to go too far into the reports of the rural task force. I think the time will come when we can debate that. As I said, this is minor legislation. I am pleased to see that the opposition is supporting it and I commend it to the parliament.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the previous speaker said in speaking to this bill, the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill, these are minor amendments. I must say that the farm household support scheme was applicable to very few. There were very few who actually took it up. Because it was under close scrutiny, the ability to rort the system was very limited indeed. There was very little rorting, so little that it did not warrant supervision. This is not so with many of the other social security forms of relief that are given to people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that this country any longer realises the full significance of farm support. When you support a farming family, you do not just support that family, you actually support a country town. If you look at Australia you see the enormous drift from country towns to the cities occurring everywhere. It imposes additional strains on the whole community because when someone goes to the city&mdash;our cities are by and large bursting at the seams&mdash;you require new infrastructure. The cost of providing that new infrastructure is quite significant and is borne by the general community. Quite clearly, in the national interest it is worth preserving the country towns. It is also worth preserving them for the lifestyle and the contribution that country people make in giving stability and perhaps an element of commonsense to political discussion that is not generally available in the cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe the drought relief scheme fully replaces the household support scheme. People could get household support for reasons which did not pertain to drought&mdash;things like commodity prices and the actions of a rapacious banking system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have the problem also that there are many farm families where the application of the job search allowance would be highly justifiable. Very many social security outlets do not understand the application of this act with respect to farmers and often you find it very difficult  to get this applied to farm families. This is something that certainly needs looking at. I know it occurs in Western Australia and I would be surprised if it did not occur in every other state, in that a lot of Social Security officers do not understand the particular situation of farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that we do everything we can to keep our farm sector viable. I am not sure that is understood today by any of the major parties. As an example, the government parties are, I suspect, going to vote to abolish the present tariff on sugar. That would make Australia susceptible to imports from the European Common Market, where the tariff subsidy range is close to 200 per cent. It is quite conceivable that Europe will use that for political reasons, and we could see sugar coming to Australia. That will be an absurd situation. It will benefit the consumer not at all. All it will do is put a little extra money in the pockets of the mainly multinationals who are the very big consumers of sugar in the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will, of course, flow on. They will say, `If we have taken the step with sugar and we have made the sugar industry even more efficient, we can then apply this in other areas.' If the government goes ahead and supports a reduction of tariff on sugar it is inconceivable that it will not likewise support a reduction in the tariff on motor vehicles. In my view, that would be an absolute disaster and an irresponsible act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This tariff reduction on sugar is supported, I understand, by the grower groups. They simply, in my view, do not understand their own situation or their own best interests. They feel that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="994"> they are protecting their domestic arrangements from Hilmer, when what we ought to do as a government is tackle the nonsense that is Hilmer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing in this bill that you can substantially oppose. It is a relatively small amendment. I will be watching it very closely to make sure there is in fact no diminution of assistance to country people. As the previous speaker said, there are always people at the margins in farming and you cannot protect them all. The truth is that in the rural communities we have had an ongoing loss averaging over 10 per cent. There has always been that action, I guess, of the market filtering out the incompetent and, in some cases, the unlucky. Unfortunately, in recent times it has also filtered out the young, aggressive farmer who is trying to get things done, often taking bank advice and extending himself&mdash;on bank advice&mdash;beyond his capabilities. He has subsequently been sold up by banks. So we have actually tended to filter some more aggressive farmers by this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of the rural sector is, I think, not generally understood in Australia. Both political parties have to sit down and have a good hard think about whether we do want farming in Australia as it exists now or whether we are going to be content in the future with corporate farming. That is a move that I would oppose very strongly as I see it not in our national interests, as it clearly has not been in the national interests of the United States.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that the intention of the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill has not been misunderstood by the parliament given that, fundamentally, it is removing the entitlement for people to receive farm household support. I am very pleased that it has not been seen in isolation on that element. I am delighted that the emphasis of the government is now on establishing the comprehensive rural policy which the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) referred to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rural adjustment is a massive issue around the world. There is no doubt about that. The drive towards greater efficiency in primary production produces the need for economies of scale, and that is putting intolerable pressure on rural communities because it essentially causes population depletion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year I had the benefit of taking part in an official parliamentary delegation to the European institutions. It was quite enlightening. In every discussion we had&mdash;whether it was with the European Parliament, the OECD or any of the European institutions to which we pay particular attention&mdash;when we raised the issue of the common agricultural policy, it was referred to as their rural policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We made the point about the damage that subsidised commodities can have on the markets in which we are trying to compete and how that hurts us badly. That comment was often received with the comment, `Well, we're not as silly as you Australians.' We were always urging them to shift the emphasis from price support to income support. I discovered that Ireland was the home of support for the CAP. They fiercely defended this as their rural policy, despite the fact that it is a huge cost to taxpayers and that it props up inefficient agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A massive review is now being undertaken by the government of the provision of caring social security in rural environments&mdash;and the member for Page (Mr Causley) mentioned the rural task force, and we have had a rural finance summit, and it is pleasing to see that emphasis&mdash;but it should be noted that it is not always drought which puts pressure on primary industry producing families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was born and raised in the country. In fact, the incubator for John Forrest was the dried fruit industry and horticulture in general. The greatest bogy for somebody trying to produce 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="995"> the best quality, five&hyphen;crown dried sultana, which receives a premium price particularly in European markets, is rain, particularly at this time of the year as we commence the harvest. One of the Comcar drivers was commenting this morning on how delighted he was that it was raining. Rain in January and February can create disasters for horticulture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall an occasion as a young lad where, on a modest 36 acres&mdash;which was a sizeable suite of properties 25 or 30 years ago&mdash;we thought we had our El Dorado sitting there on the vines. My father was so pleased. We put on extra harvest labour to get the crop off quickly in order to get it dried, into the cooperative and ready for packing, because that is when you can consider it is safe. It is like getting your wheat in the silo. It is not safe until it is there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We harvested this record crop and put it onto the drying racks. We filled the final rack and went home to celebrate and relax because we had it on the racks and had finished the primary stage. That night we had 2&half; inches of rain. We had so much rain that the bottom of the drying green was covered with 18 inches of water and, although they were substantial steel structures, one rack collapsed and about three tonnes of fruit fell into the water. That evening, for the first time in my life&mdash;and I have never forgotten the impact it had&mdash;I saw my father cry. Here was our El Dorado, the prospect of a good price for the crop, ruined by rain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The risk from rain still continues. Very often, many of my horticulturists are put under pressure not as a result of drought, but because of the opposite. It happens with many other commodities. With table grapes, and even wine grapes, adverse wet weather has a very dramatic impact on the quality and quantity of fruit produced and, therefore, affects incomes. I will be pleased to see that that aspect is also included in the comprehensive review that is going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should be proud in Australia of the reputation of having a comprehensive social security policy. I have a citizen in my electorate who was widowed two years ago. She is an American, but has become an Australian citizen. Originally, her contact was just to brief me and advise me that, with the support she was receiving, although it was sizeable, it was difficult for her to manage a family of three boys and all of their education expenses. In assisting her to  understand the process, I advised her that social security was not designed to allow Australian families to live a lifestyle of luxury; it was set at targeted levels to make sure that the needs of families were met. She commented to me that the US social security system came nowhere near what Australia provided, and I was encouraged by that approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week, I had the good fortune in Washington to attend some discussions with congressmen in association with the festivities for the new Congress and the State of the Union address by the President of the United States. I entered into some discussions about concerns I have with the new US farm bill and the export enhancement program that is included in that, with a massive budget&mdash;of $500 million&mdash;proposed for it again this year. That approach was referred to as their rural policy and it poses a great challenge for Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not advocating that we move into any level of subsidising inefficient agriculture in any way. But there are rural families hurting out there who have enormous pressures in educating our children&mdash;bearing in mind that securing a post&hyphen;secondary education for many rural families involves sending them away to provincial cities and metropolitan centres to pursue their tertiary education. This often involves enormous expense. So when the social security system looks at their asset base and says, `You have sizeable assets in your farming assets. You have the means to educate your own children,' what needs to be kept in mind is that often that large asset is propped up by a very large debt at dangerous equity levels. It is very difficult for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="996"> families to consider going to the bank and borrowing more money when they are already at marginal equity levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Kalgoorlie talked about those who can be lucky. One of the things about primary production is that, if things go well, often it does amount to luck. An aggressive young farmer who wants to have a go has to take a punt; he has to take a risk. While the situation in my electorate for primary production is nowhere near what it is in Queensland and northern New South Wales after five years of drought there, the good year only comes along once every three or four years. To say to the farming community, `In your good times, you should put away to cope with the bad,' is often unrealistic, given their current equity situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to see that there is a positiveness about what the government is doing. Like all members who represent rural constituencies, we watch with great interest the outcome of the final recommendations of the rural task force. We watch with great interest the activities of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) in addressing this very question to ensure that, as a nation, we have a caring approach to those needy families involved in primary production, and yet that we continue the good work that is being done to encourage efficiency in agriculture so that we can get into those valuable export markets and compete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite what is often a very negative discussion, I remain confident and ever hopeful about the prospects for rural Australia. We have great potential, and one of the greatest assets is the nature of the people that live out there. They are, just by nature of their pioneering character, a very positive and resilient people. We need to recognise this and do what we can to arrest the dramatic decline in population centres out there. More importantly, we must meet the very immediate concerns of working&hyphen;class, very hardworking Australians. I look forward to further progress on these matters. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Farm Household Support Bill, introduced in 1992, was to provide loans for certain farmers who could not obtain a loan through normal means and also provide for the conversion in certain circumstances of such a loan to a grant when a farmer sold his or her farm. No&hyphen;one should have any objection to a continuation of this scheme, given the parlous state of much of our rural industry, but the farm household support scheme is to be terminated to make budget savings of $960,000. This perhaps indicates the scheme was not accessed to the degree it might have been, given the needs of many rural families for financial assistance, but to dismantle it seems premature, for reasons I will detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By way of background, let me read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a letter from a farmer in the central west who wrote to me recently with a not atypical example of life down on the farm 1997 style. This gentleman says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I've been a farmer and my own boss and on the same property for 41 years and I've never seen it as bad as far as cost&hyphen;price squeeze is concerned, the disillusionment of the people and working longer and harder than ever for what?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not talking about farmers who have larger holdings and have never had to purchase more land to improve their position or get their sons established. I'm talking about the average family farm, in most cases a fairly big debt (thanks to Mr Keating and the huge interest rate hike a few years back) and what used to be a comfortable living.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The costs of everything (and I mean everything) just keep increasing and our income dropping alarmingly. Peter this cannot continue, in a matter of a few years there will be no family farms as we know it today. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="997"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I suppose we live in a favourable area, on the river, but I've lived here all my life and know the people and there are farms for sale everywhere, and in some cases have been taken over by banks and the young farmers and families having to leave. To me this is disastrous&mdash;but who the hell cares, we've gradually been reduced to peasants, producing cheap food and to the governing bodies that's about all that matters.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This letter is from the heartland of the safe, once financially lucrative central west of New South Wales, where the topsoil is metres deep, where the rivers flow by, where lucerne flats should return a premium product that supports not only the farm family but a significant portion of the local economy as well. That is how it used to be. My correspondent goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We (my son and myself and our families) produce 200 odd head of cattle&mdash;the income drop this year over last year will be at least $20,000. This year we grew 200 tonnes of barley, last year we got $170 a tonne in the paddock&mdash;this year we get $108 a tonne, a drop of $62 a tonne, or nearly $12,500. We grow roughly 500 tonnes of lucerne. This year we are taking $20 a tonne less&mdash;another $10,000 down. So you see there is over $42,000 drop in income this year&mdash;about a third of our GROSS.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wonder what other sections of our community would tolerate this. Can you imagine cutting school teachers, union wages by one third, wouldn't there be a human outcry? But we have to sit back and take it and I'm telling you Peter the people are sick of it and they won't tolerate it, seeing their livelihood eroded to the point where it is just not viable. Don't think I am a whingeing farmer, I'm not, I'm just stating facts. I know it is alright to say we have to get our commodity prices up, sure, but there has to be a reduction in our costs also. You'll have to hammer and hammer our cause to the appropriate heads of Government&mdash;we don't seem to able to do it.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is not an isolated cry from the wilderness. That is the family farm, Australia 1997: a situation borne not of a lack of commitment, heartache, effort, sweat and pain from the man&mdash;and the lady&mdash;on the land but from a system that has deserted him or her, a financial system that has abandoned the farm sector in tough times after screwing every last dollar from the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Keating and Labor stand condemned for using the blunt tool of interest rate manipulation to force up to Shylock rates the cost of money to farmers, a debt that many are still struggling to meet&mdash;quite apart from those who were wiped off the rural landscape by the combination  of interest rates, the commodity price crash and the distortion of the so&hyphen;called level playing field trading arrangements that we so naively adhere to while our trading partners wear the grid&hyphen;iron gear on this field, have the football, and change the rules as the game progresses, to suit themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note the words of the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) about the US farm bill. We all know how uneven that playing field is. The forecast from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics reinforces the frustration my farming correspondent so eloquently detailed in his letter. He cited cattle prices. Unless we take control of this industry ourselves&mdash;the value adding component as well&mdash;and are not just a bottom&hyphen;end price taker supplying product, with no control over prices, to vertically integrated foreign&hyphen;owned abattoir feedlot export consortia&mdash;then the family farm is doomed, and the skills and dedication of the farm family go with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All this is highly relevant to the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill under discussion. Unless we restructure farm finance in this country to help fill the void left by the banks' abandonment of the bush, we will most likely see not only bandaid schemes such as farm household support reintroduced, but also the need for massive bandaging to stop the haemorrhaging that is likely to occur in rural Australia unless our terms of trade improve.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="998">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this regard, the way in which the banks have abandoned the bush is an absolute disgrace. Not only have they headed off to greener pastures, aided by the total deregulatory climate allowed by the Labor government and its successor, but they have removed much of their advisory services from not only regional centres but also certainly the small local branch, where face&hyphen;to&hyphen;face contact with the bank manager had become part and parcel of the family farm's financial planning process. At the time the banker was needed most&mdash;at the time of high interest rates, dropping commodity prices, the drought, and the slump in wool&mdash;the bank johnnies left town. That is no fault of theirs: they were rationalised out of existence while the bank bosses told deputations from councils in my area to go home and stop wasting their time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are those who want to invest in the viability of the family farm because they believe it is the heart and soul of Australian enterprise. They do not believe the economic rationalist argument that `get big or get out' is the only answer. There are those in regional centres who are exploring alternative schemes of farm finance that will bypass the major banks and their usury attitudes. They will probably require government support for some underwriting of their proposal, but it will be public money well provided, because it is pro&hyphen;active support to help farmers at grassroots level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do, however, despair of the interest that this government will show in such proposals, if they were floated&mdash;so desperate is the government not to underwrite debt. Yet such schemes as household support, rural adjustment and exceptional circumstances assistance are all reactionary programs after the horse has bolted, so to speak. We need some proactive support from government for the family farm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well, there are those in the superannuation industry who are exploring the potential of supporting rural infrastructure programs, particularly rural specific superannuation schemes. They want to support perhaps those viable farm enterprises that have potential, while credit unions are helping fill the void left by the banks, at least for some small businesses in smaller towns, and are helping farm families with their smaller financial commitments. All power to those alternative credit providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The horror days of the Keating bank rates are, hopefully, behind us. Hopefully, we can safely put farm household support schemes in the bottom drawer. But let us not be fooled that the recent reduction in interest rates heralds an end to the problems of the farm family. Such families are now being caught up in the sticky web of the actual means test for Austudy if their children or one of their adult members wants to improve their educational standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is that? It is because no&hyphen;one outside the farm community, certainly not the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) or her bureaucrats, understands that most farm families are trying to earn some supplementary income off farm. Income becomes expenditure to keep the farm family on the farm and meet the repair and maintenance. Family farm partnerships are a fact of life. They are not a rort, they are not a void into which off&hyphen;farm income is dumped to avoid taxation or any other responsibilities; they are very real. Off&hyphen;farm income is an essential part of the family farm these days&mdash;it is not some scheme to manipulate government assistances. Yet families are being penalised at the moment by their very off&hyphen;farm endeavours and they are by the score being disqualified from access to Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The farm household support scheme is to be terminated due to the very low demand and is a contribution to meeting the government's fiscal target, which has somewhat blown out 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="999"> again. I am pleased to see that the government will meet existing commitments for support and continue to accept applications until these legislative changes are effected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government says in its budget papers that it expects there to be a minimal impact from the termination of the FHS. There has been a steady decline in the number of recipients since mid&hyphen;1994, when there were only 284. At budget time last year there were about 47. The government assures us that the welfare needs of farmers will be addressed by the special rural task force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not be fooled by the reduction in applicants for the farm household support. That decline was in direct proportion to a levelling off in bank interest rates. Farm families are particularly proud. They access welfare as an absolutely last resort. They cannot stomach being, on the one hand, part of the hands&hyphen;on productive effort of this nation and, on the other hand, lining up for welfare. Sure, there were times when it was easy to accuse the farmer of capitalising the gains and socialising the losses&mdash;the `agrarian socialist' tag&mdash;with the bounties, the tax write&hyphen;offs. For the average family farm those times, if they ever existed at all, are well gone. Yet few are putting their hands out for help unless there is a desperate need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The termination of the farm household support should be a signal that things are improving in the bush. They are not. We had a reasonable return from the recent harvest but that too was somewhat illusory. The returns were based on a very modest price for a phenomenally large harvest. Had the yields been average or poor, the cash flows of the family farms would still be in dire straits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why we must quickly redress the anomalies of the current Austudy mess. That is why we must revisit the six months extension of the exceptional drought circumstances assistance measures, because one good season will not end the money drought. And that is why we should be pro&hyphen;active in examining ways government can underwrite alternative financial avenues for the family farm, such as I alluded to earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to see here the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) and I would be happy to provide him with that submission, when it comes across my desk, for  an alternative funding proposal for the family farm. The banks have relocated to the cities to play the money screens and look after the speculative big end of town.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not be fooled by the removal of the farm household support. It does not mean things are getting any better on the land, for all the reasons I, and my farming friend, detailed in that letter. The primary industry budget statements blandly credit the dropping of this scheme to the reduction in demand for its support. In 1994, as I pointed out, there were 284 recipients; at last count there were 47. I will bet there has been no other research done on where those other 237 families are now. I suspect they are not ploughing along happily on the farm after the lifeline this scheme offered. I bet they are gone from farming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless we do something to create an alternative to the banks to finance the family farm, there will be no reason to introduce ever again a farm household support scheme like this, because there will be no farm households to support. Corporate farms will have taken over and, irony among ironies, not only will they be funded by the banks&mdash;many of them foreign owned&mdash;but they will be owned by the banks.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;Thank you to all members who have contributed to the debate. I gather it has been wide&hyphen;ranging. The farm household support scheme has generally been acknowledged to be a failure. Farmers will not go on it because of what they see as the onerous requirements for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1000"> repayment and so forth. The government has taken the view that it is more effective to look at welfare arrangements and the impact on farmers of such things as the assets test. We now have, as I think has been alluded to during the debate by various people here this morning, a report available to us on options, and the government will be considering that in due course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested in the comments of the honourable member for Calare (Mr Andren), those that I caught, and I would like to make a couple of brief remarks. Firstly, there is always concern that corporate farming will take over in Australia. However, historically, the ownership of Australia's farms has remained between 90 per cent and 93 per cent family based. Since the early days of colonisation, through all of the ups and down&mdash;the Great Depression, the 1890s, which were as tough, if not tougher, as current times, and the 1930s, which were desperation times&mdash;the figures have fluctuated by only two or three percentage points. Family farm ownership has never really slipped below 90 per cent, and that is essentially because it is such an efficient economic unit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree that, in broad terms, we need to look to alternative sources of financing for the family farm. At the moment, it is largely debt financed and it may be that more innovative approaches are needed for the future. Farmers complain, and understandably, about the interest rates that the banks impose upon them. As a government we are intent upon saying to the banks and the financial sector in this country that we are showing long&hyphen;term support for agriculture. We are developing a business plan, and a set of policies and strategies derived from that, to maximise the chances of the family farm and we expect the banks to do the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us get away from the problem of excessive interest rates. It is worth noting here that evidence submitted to the rural assistance scheme inquiry, which we have set up, suggests very strongly&mdash;the inquiry is only at a preliminary stage at this juncture and I certainly do not want to pre&hyphen;empt any of the work that it may put together&mdash;that there is no evidence of market failure in the provision of capital to the rural sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me comment very briefly on what is happening to those farmers who do leave the land, an issue that was also touched on by the honourable member for Calare. I, too, have an interest  and a concern about that matter. We will do a bit of research on it. One of our rural councillors who has dealt with this problem extensively has followed through on it and undertaken a bit of study of his own. Interestingly enough, he discovered that many of the farmers who left the land found that the time leading up to leaving the farm was the most difficult of all. I suspect that any person in this country who has seen the failure of his or her private enterprise would be able to relate to the dreadfully stressful times leading up to the collapse. It is a situation that can never be fun.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, when farmers did leave, they were able to begin their lives again and, almost universally, they expressed surprise that they were able to get a job quite easily. Farmers are more highly skilled than they often recognise. That is not to say that I resile, in any way, from the need for us to do everything we can to ensure that as many farmers as possible can secure their future.  But having said that, I will very briefly refer to the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 1996. The effect of the bill will be to prevent people who are not entitled to receive farm household support payments on the cut&hyphen;off date, that is 28 days after the bill receives royal assent, from obtaining farm household support at any time in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those people who are entitled to receive farm household support payments on the cut&hyphen;off date, transitional provisions will permit them to continue to receive the support until such time as they are no longer eligible. Permitting continued access to the farm household support 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1001"> payments will require that the access be unbroken and once a person becomes ineligible to receive farm household support payments, that person cannot be paid farm household support payments at a later date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill retains the operation of other provisions of the farm household support scheme for those people who will continue to receive farm household support payments after the cut&hyphen;off date and FHS payments will still be made as a loan which may be converted to a grant under certain circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should emphasise that the operation of the drought relief payment, the DRP, administered under the Farm Household Support Act 1992, is unchanged by the termination of the farm household support scheme in all but one regard. Those former farm household support recipients, who have transferred to the DRP, will not be able to transfer back to the farm household support scheme after the cut&hyphen;off date when their drought relief recovery period finishes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the previous speaker had something to say about that recovery period. We have extended it from six months to 12 months, a very significant movement in terms of the assistance that we offer to the farm sector. In fact, in broad, it has resulted in an increase of something like $170 million over that provided by the previous administration in the forward estimates for drought relief, thus reflecting our very real commitment to this sector. That $170 million, I must say, pales into some insignificance against the value of the interest rate cuts that sound economic management has and will continue to deliver. Presuming that it is properly passed on by the banks, and my evidence is that they are claiming that it is being passed on to the farm sector, that is around $300 million per annum relief already provided by the three reductions in interest rates that we have seen since coming to government just under 12 months ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion may I say that we announced the termination of the farm household support scheme in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget. We are considering the most appropriate way forward in terms of meeting the needs of destitute farm families in the most appalling circumstances. At the  same time we are considering the best way forward in terms of ensuring that as many as possible of those farmers that are finding it difficult are moved into a new era when they are able to join the 20 per cent of Australian farmers who are, at the moment, reaping very real financial rewards for their efforts in terms of return on capital. We want as many as possible who are not in that bracket to be assisted into it and that is what we are aiming to do. Thank you.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we have indicated in respect of this legislation, the opposition is comfortable with what is proposed in this legislation. Most of it is tidying 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1002"> up and slowly progressing forward. We understand there has been wide industry consultation. We certainly have not received any expressions of concern and so in those circumstances we are quite comfortable to support this bill without dissent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a couple of the items though, I would like to just make some passing comment to indicate the way some of our own thinking is evolving for those who conscientiously read or listen to these debates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There may be some confusion in the minds of studious observers of these proceedings when they find that there is more about the Farm Household Support Act involved in this particular legislation, as well&mdash;we did not clean it all up with the last bit. I gather that there are some provisions that continue to operate while the other legislation still does. These provisions are meant, primarily, to prevent double dipping which may occur when people are able to take up benefits under drought relief schemes and under broader opportunities that are available in social security and veterans' affairs legislation when it all conjuncts with the FHSA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This just shows the eternal dilemma we have. As I mentioned in the earlier debate, I remember when we introduced the farm household support scheme and the then Prime Minister's country task force spent a long time with the primary industries minister&mdash;who, at the time, was Simon Crean, I think&mdash;and the social security minister, who was probably Brian Howe. We worked through these things, introducing the legislation at 4 a.m., going home from that session only to face yet another barrage of discontent from rural constituents about the way they were treated by Labor and all this sort of stuff when we had been there until 4 o'clock in the morning introducing this sort of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we find double dipping, so the dog is always chasing its tail around in a circle. It does not mean that we do not continue to try to provide fairly for people who are in difficult financial situations, but where there is a loophole&mdash;Garfield Barwick set the path a long time ago&mdash;the conservative approach is to find it and slip down through it. So, inevitably, we find ourselves here in the parliament trying to close the loopholes as quickly as we open them. I have no doubt that the same thing will continue, but let us hope that it moderates over time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation also makes provision to extend until 30 June the provisions for the Wool Council to maintain its funding for research and promotion. An interesting situation evolving, particularly in the promotion and future use of wool is the changing marketplace for wool, and many of us have been involved in this dilemma for many years. Last night I had the pleasure of dining with a number of representatives from the textile industry, particularly in Victoria, and they were making the suggestion that it is time for the wool industry to seriously consider abandoning its longstanding promotion and logo of 100 per cent pure wool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They said that the market no longer regards a pure wool garment as a pragmatic garment. People are in a hurry; they want easy to clean, easy to hang, easy to press and easy to wear garments. The properties of wool change when they have some synthetic, or other natural fibres added, such as cotton. Even with just small additives, the properties of wool change, according to these people, so that it is suddenly a very attractive product. The marketing of pure wool and the insistence on pure wool products may, in fact, be holding back opportunities for wool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not saying that I know these things, but I am just throwing into the discussion the fact that leaders in the textile industry, who are aware of the longstanding interest in wool and the marketability of wool, are saying that the industry itself, and the wool promotion council, need 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1003"> to start thinking about repositioning this strategy, particularly as it has been around for a long time and a lot of money has been invested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday afternoon in the fashion parade, as it has been called, that was put on in the House by the textile industry, we saw one extremely positive development; that is, the invention, if you can call it that, and the development&mdash;with R&amp;D in the industry here in Australia&mdash;of a new denim yarn which is a cotton&hyphen;wool mix. The industry is quite confident that its properties and attractiveness may take the international denim market by storm. If that is to be the case, then that would be a fabulous injection for both the cotton and wool&hyphen;growing industries in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make those preliminary comments because this is not a new debate. But it is one that I very strongly call on my conservative opponents opposite, those in government now, to seriously think about. In January, in a very public statement, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) made the comment, published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, that he and the government see Australia's future in this area of commodities and products being to ensure that we improve the quality of the raw material, or the raw product, rather than focusing, as we have been talking about and trying to do for some years now, on value adding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a new thought among the conservatives. It was first presented to me by the now Minister for Defence, Ian McLachlan, when he was President of the National Farmers Federation. He put quite strongly to us as members of the country task force&mdash;I think the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) who is here at the table was present at that very meeting&mdash;that it was not in the interests of primary producers in Australia to support the development of value adding because they had very well&hyphen;established markets for their bulk exports&mdash;bales of wool, shiploads of wheat or whatever&mdash;and that exposing those products to the vagaries of value adding in manufacturing in Australia was not the way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of us would be flabbergasted to think that anyone in Australia could even think that way. But I make it very clear to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it was not a new thought expressed by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy in January, that it is actually a  well&hyphen;argued and articulated hypothesis that has been around amongst the conservatives in agriculture and minerals for many years, and it is being argued actively again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So here we have the wool industry struggling with its strategy of exporting bales of wool&mdash;and I can remember my colleague who is in the chamber tonight giving his views many times on the so&hyphen;called export of experts who were in charge of that over the years&mdash;but now we have the textile industry saying to us that there are some new and innovative ways to go about doing this. They are suggesting that in fact value adding in Australia holds some real potential at the very time when the people in government who are now running the industry are saying that this is not the way they are interested in going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call for a rethink on that, and I suggest that people particularly listen to those in the textile industry, although we know that they are not always constructive in these debates. Many of their concerns about tariff reductions, for instance, are totally contrary to the view. In an article in January I saw that the Wool Council was calling for a rapid reduction in tariffs in Australia so that they will get better opportunities to sell their raw product overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our overseas customer is saying to us, `If you reduce your tariff barriers to our products, then we will take more of your raw materials.' That is all very well. What happens when you have the Wool Council coming out and calling for accelerated tariff reductions is that the textile industry suddenly says, `Hey, don't you care about us? Don't you care about the jobs? 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1004"> Don't you care about what we are trying to do with your product to give it a future?' The answer, on that evidence, is no. So this is not an insignificant debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are, in this legislation, just passing a bit of machinery that enables the funding to continue. We understand that the Wool Council is developing its further strategy for post 30 June 1997. What I am saying to the Wool Council is: do not be led by Minister Anderson's hypothesis that we are better off concentrating on the development of the raw material and walking away from attempting to value add in this country. Our farm producers&mdash;and the nation as a whole&mdash;have a far better future by taking the view of the textile manufacturers, the people who want to expand their businesses, based on improving, developing and expanding the use of the products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> A very interesting discussion and debate will unfold on this issue. And I signal here that we are quite incensed that a government could actually begin the process of walking away from value adding in this economy when so much effort has been put in by so many people in the last 10 or 15 years to try and get an export culture, a productivity culture, a research and development culture and a value adding culture established right across the nation. The proof of the pudding is in the eating: the dramatic increase in manufactured exports in the Australian economy, as against the decline in commodity exports in dollar value&mdash;even though volumes have gone up, dollar values have gone down. The contrast is stark and real. It beggars belief that anybody could conclude that it is in the national interest to go any other way. But that is unfolding and it is something that I am quite confident will become part of a significant debate in the nation during the next few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are supporting this legislation and approve of it. But I have taken this opportunity to make a few comments to set the parameters of what we see as a very significant debate emerging in our economy.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) for supporting this series of amendments to clean up various defects in acts and to make sure that we do not revisit ground we have gone over in other areas. I will  refer later to his comments on the textile industry, but I will first speak in support of the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996 and, in particular, the first amendment to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Code Act 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Compensation provisions already apply to agricultural and veterinary chemical products, but do not extend to an individual active constituent where this active constituent is the responsibility of a company separate from the chemical product company. This situation relates to the active constituent review information requested by the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals for the purpose of reviewing existing active constituents to ensure they meet contemporary standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a nutshell, this amendment seeks to ensure that compensation provisions apply to all active constituents in use by chemical product companies, as they do to the agricultural and veterinary chemical products. The amendment will remove the concern about commercial exploitation by providing compensation provisions equivalent to those already applying to agricultural and veterinary chemical products, and will ensure commonality in the entire process of review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the proposed amendment will facilitate the generation of information for the review program by including the active constituents of existing chemical products. This 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1005"> amendment is all about a commonsense approach by a commonsense government and seeks to provide greater protection for those in the chemical production industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another part of this bill amends the Farm Household Support Act 1992, which was very well summed up by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) at the close of the debate on that individual act but is referred to in the tidy&hyphen;up session in this legislation. Quite simply, due to the complexity of the various financial aids available to those in primary industry, this amendment seeks to ensure that recipients of financial assistance cannot double&hyphen;dip when receiving drought relief payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, when drought relief payments are calculated an amount is allowed for a partner. Should this partner subsequently claim social security&mdash;in other words, family allowance or parenting allowance&mdash;this person would receive the same support twice. That would be once as a component under drought relief payments and again under social security benefits. Ultimately, though, such a situation leads to a gross overpayment, resulting in even further financial hardship when restitution is to be made. This amendment will remove the possibility of that occurring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We only need to think about farmers out there doing it a bit tough when the weather has not gone the way that they want or situations are not as good as they could be, to remember that for generations farms were owned outright by families, whereas the farms have now been broken up and sold off. Indeed, over generations these farms have got mortgages on them, some so big the farmers cannot climb over them. But still these people, the very backbone of Australia's rural society, hang in there and keep working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The days of this country riding on the sheep's back, I believe, are gone, and we need to get smarter in our farming applications. We do need to pursue such things as the supermarket to Asia approach. When times get tough and these very proud people put out their hand, they are not used to filling in government forms for assistance. Sometimes by mistake they fill in two sets of forms to seek aid through income support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a shock. I have had one of these people come in to me, and when I spoke to that person I realised from the outset that it had been a very big hurdle to cross, to actually go and seek  assistance. Some have said that for the first time in their life they have actually had to go and put their hand out, and it goes a long way towards breaking the back. We have seen so many farmers walk away from the farm these days. We can remember, through the heavy periods of the drought and the periods of very high interest rates under the former government, the people walking away from the farms, the marriage breakdowns and, sadly, the suicides. To lose the farm is one thing, but to lose life over it is another dimension altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Removing either temptation or an error that may occur by double&hyphen;dipping, and making sure that once support is in place there is no need for people to pay back money to the government because they have only been paid what they are properly due, will reduce a lot of stress on these people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill addresses also the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993. As the member for Burke said, in the chamber we have the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), who has spoken many times and well. Even before my time in this chamber I used to listen to the debates over the radio and heard him speak out on the wool industry, along with Wilson Tuckey, who has been a great defender of the wool industry in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment seeks to extend the sunset date from 30 June 1997 to June 2000 for wool industry contributions to the Australian Animal Health Council. The objective of this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1006"> amendment is to ensure the provision of an interim funding arrangement pending wool industry agreement on longer term funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Animal Health Council was established on 19 January 1996 and is funded by contributions by various animal industries. The predecessor program was the Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Council, which was also funded by the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act was amended back in 1996 to provide for wool industry contributions to the Australian Animal Health Council to be funded by the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation until 30 June 1997. It is obvious that an extension of this funding arrangement is required to enable the wool industry to continue to meet its financial obligations to the Australian Animal Health Corporation and to examine options to provide for a longer term solution. I understand that the Wool Council of Australia supports these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to the comments that the member for Burke made about the textile industry. We have a great textile industry in my electorate&mdash;indeed, we have National Textiles based at Rutherford. Unfortunately, they have just had to downsize and lay off another 20 staff to restructure and remain competitive. I am glad to see them talk about developments in fabrics with the inclusion of wool and cotton together to produce fabrics that will work in Australia, because we can blend those and work those up at Rutherford and produce fabric in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the crying shames is that, over generations, not just in the last government but through many governments, we have seen a deterioration of wool product being spun and made into cloth in Australia. Indeed, now to buy some of the best wool in Australia, the microfines that are produced in Australia, one has to buy fabric woven and spun either in England, Italy, France or Belgium. That is a sad shame because it is a very labour intensive industry even though there are high levels of mechanisation. Perhaps it was the high tariffs that kept the industry uncompetitive for a long period of time and then, when the crunch came, they were no longer able to compete. I know the people at National Textiles are investing millions of dollars to make sure that their plight is not the same, that they do keep up with technology and that they do remain competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the lack of availability of quality cloth has led to a lot of problems. Indeed, the suit I wear today is Australian wool blended with mohair and made by a tailor in Newcastle, a clothing company called Rundles, which faces the possibility of closure&mdash;it is under administration at the moment. It is a shame because their history in Newcastle goes back, I understand, well over 100 years. To hear people like the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) get up last night and put the blame for this on the current government, I find rather ludicrous. Simply, the former government was one of the major instruments in bringing down the tariffs, its archaic industrial relations laws allowing for this company to have to wind back to compete, to overextend and then no longer be able to compete in the Australian market.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, I am glad you reminded me of that because I am discussing the part which covers the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1007"> Act and, Mr Deputy Speaker, with all due respect, it is partly about promotions and organisation and the use of the textile. The demand for the textile has dropped off because of the very high interest rates which we saw climb during the term of the previous government. We then saw a recession, a recession that we had to have, and this recession that we had to have was one of the major factors there. We just heard the member opposite talk about the drop in retail sales: there are direct links and effects. There is no way that the previous government can walk away from the fact that it was there for 13 years, that it administered the policies in those 13 years. We have come in in the last 12 months&mdash;or 12 months in a couple of weeks time&mdash;and we are trying to clean up and fix their mistakes. As we heard our Treasurer (Mr Costello) say in the House, interest rates now are at the lowest ever stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going back to the wool bill, which I am sure you were about to remind me of, Mr Deputy Speaker, it makes the clothing more affordable. When interest rates are down, and the mortgage repayments are down, the affordability of the loan puts more cash back into the pockets. I include the $34 a week family tax benefit that came in this year and I am hoping that people therefore will go out and invest that money in new clothing, particularly with Rundles in Newcastle, so that we can see this company survive. It is a great company and has probably some of the best tailors in Australia when it comes to making fine quality clothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, the act goes through and repeals and introduces many savings provisions. One there is the Tobacco Marketing Act 1965. The repeal of this act allows the Australian tobacco industry to participate fully in the international markets. The Tobacco Marketing Act 1965 provided the legislative basis for the Australian Tobacco Marketing Advisory Committee, which cased to operate on 3 July 1995. It was agreed by the industry that all rights, assets, obligations and liabilities be transferred to the Tobacco Research and Development Corporation, in anticipation of the repeal of this act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act also goes through and frees up minor amendments in the Dried Vine Fruits Equalisation Act 1978 and brings things up to date in the Forestry and Timber Bureau Act 1930 by removing Papua New Guinea as being a territory of Australia, which has been there for many years. I think it goes back to 1975 and the independence of New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a series of minor amendments that are proposed to the above acts to facilitate the correction of formal errors, omit redundancies and fix misdescribed statements. As I said, I am glad that the opposition supports this act and I commend it to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must confess that I came in to the chamber to address a few caustic words about the next bill. I find myself ahead of myself, so as a compromise measure, I would like to go back to the previous bill, with your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker. I want to draw attention to something that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) said which is very germane to the bill we are now discussing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister was talking about family farm ownership. He was pontificating, as he is wont to do, and said that the level of family farm ownership in Australia was very high, and in fact over 90 per cent. What the minister does not realise is that multinationals today do not want the land. The land is an encumbrance. It is something they cannot move quickly. But the multinationals control the product so they have family farmers in total thraldom to them. It is real bondage because any slight movement in the price is felt immediately by the farmer. Of course this affects vegetable growing, the chicken industry and beef.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1920s when `Red Ted' Theodore set up the establishment of publicly owned abattoirs in Queensland, he did not do it for those abattoirs to make a profit; he did it to break the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1008"> monopoly of the foreign ownership at the time. In those days, it was Vesteys. There was no doubt that the cattle industry in Australia was in total thraldom to Vesteys interest and Theodore's strategy was to provide an alternative source of processing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask this House: what difference is there between the position that Vesteys held then and the position held by Japanese and American processors today? Quite clearly we need an alternative form of processing so that markets can be addressed through other than the oligopoly that we have now. I do not subscribe in this day to state ownership, but I do believe that, if we really care about agriculture, we ought to be looking at funding a grower organisation to establish abattoirs to break the vertical integration of that foreign ownership. In my view Minister Anderson does not really understand the rural sector. He speaks from a silver spoon&hyphen;fed background and that is a great pity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am reminded of the early days of the wool crisis when the previous government initiated the Garnaut report. Garnaut is a man for whom I hold the utmost contempt. He is greatly overstated and his report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia and the Northeast Asian ascendancy</EMPHASIS> has done enormous damage to Australia because it was swallowed hook, line and sinker by politicians on both sides. I went to Dubbo to give my views to the industry on the Garnaut report, which I thought was a very suspect document. Young Mr Anderson, the minister, got up and read chapter after chapter from the Garnaut report, which was understandably quite flattering about itself. When we broke for morning tea, one of the local National Party people said to me, `My word. We are so lucky to have a bright young man like John Anderson.' I remember saying to him, `I think you are about to get the government you deserve,' and that is a pity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) mentioned the Wool Council, and I have been very critical of wool marketing arrangements in Australia. The truth is that the Wool Council, the round table and Minister Anderson are as one. There is no doubt that we have to look very hard at wool marketing. I do not think it is so much a matter of value adding as one of making sure that wool growers hold on to their product until further down the production scale. It has been shown in other parts of the world&mdash;in America, for instance&mdash;that, where cooperative organisations have enabled growers to hold on to their product and to sell the value&hyphen;added  product and get the benefit themselves for value adding, they have done very much better. I believe we need to be setting up mechanisms where the Australian wool grower can hold the interest in his wool down to, at least, the single yarn stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) talked about Australia no longer riding on the sheep's back. It is true; it does not. But this should be recognised: if we were to process wool to the top making stage&mdash;and we are the world's best top makers; we have actually eclipsed the French in our productivity&mdash;wool would today be our biggest single export. Wool is important, because wool is the single most important small business in Australia, and it is so widely spread that it has an impact on much of rural Australia. That is something that needs to be looked at. I do not believe that, with the present wool marketing arrangements, the Wool Council or any of the major companies are going to seriously consider this. It is going to be an initiative that must come from wool growers, and it is an initiative that will only succeed if it is looked on sympathetically by government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of processing wool, I believe that a player that has been overlooked in the market is India. India has re&hyphen;equipped itself with the world's best machinery, and I think there would be a good synergy from using Australian produced top making for processing into yarn in India. I favour India over China because India has actually beaten the Chinese in the process 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1009"> of equipping itself with the best equipment, English is generally understood in India, and the legal system sort of works, which is more than really can be said for the situation in China.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no real problem with the bill, as it is basically the machinery for the arrangements, except to say that we have to do something constructive about the wool industry. The innovations happening now are coming from individual wool growers. I see nothing of substance coming from Wool International, which is currently seeking its own survival by trying to join forces with the two other big players in the industry, Elders and Dalgety&hyphen;Wesfarmers. I believe that it is the work of individuals in the industry that is doing most to benefit industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Burke talked about the value of the processors. I believe that it is the wool users who should be the people most involved in the merchandising and advertising of wool. When you look at the history of Australia's wool marketing, it has been abysmal. We have spent $2 billion trying to increase wool consumption in the United States, with negligible effect. I recall that, when I finished wool classing, our instructor said to us, `Everyone of you will now go up and class a clip'&mdash;which every one of us did. He then went on to say, `Unless you can increase consumption per capita in the United States, wool doesn't have a good long&hyphen;term future.' We spent $2 billion trying to increase that consumption, without success. That was $2 billion of wool growers' money that was basically wasted. I believe that there are marketeers in the world who could have had much greater success than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, one of the famous Italian manufacturers of fine wools and material sent Mr Todhunter to America to market their product, on the basis that he had a month and then he had to support himself. He did it very well and that American market is now a substantial part of the company's export business. So it is quite clear that we were capable of doing it, but it certainly was not done by the ways and methods of the Wool Corporation. I do not believe that the organisation we have now, which consists basically of the same people that sit around the minister's round table, has any better grasp of what is needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, the member for Burke is right: the processors need to be listened to. Wool&hyphen;cotton is a very good blend. It has a big future in denim. It is certainly going to improve the material.  I believe there is a market also for wool&hyphen;hemp and wool&hyphen;linen, but why do we not address the crying need for wool&hyphen;polyester? I was at a Kangaroo exercise in the north when our servicemen complained bitterly about the polyester clothes they were supplied with and how they simply did not work in the tropics. You could see by the condition the soldiers were in, in those polyester shirts, that there was a need for a better material. I believe that nothing is too good for our services; we should have the very best cloth. Any shirt for the tropics would be enhanced by the inclusion of wool in the mixture.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank those who have participated in the debate on the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996. In particular, I acknowledge the genuine interest of the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) in these industries and his commitment to the people in them. Even if I think he is a bit skew&hyphen;whiff in some ways in terms of policy prescriptions, I thank him for his contribution and would like to make a few comments about some of the things he said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, he is right when he says that India offers some real future for wool exporting opportunities in this country. The great problem there, particularly vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis China, is that India maintains very high rates of tariffs, particularly against tops. The Indians do so for two reasons. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1010"> In general, they maintain high levels of tariffs as a revenue raising measure on wool because they regard it as a luxury. I think the tariff on tops is about double what it is for greasy wool, and the reason for that is that they have an extensive top making industry themselves, to which the previous speaker alluded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As it happens, I spent a considerable amount of time just yesterday with the Indian minister for textiles. The activities covered by his portfolio, textiles in India, incidentally, support no fewer than 60 million Indians. That is quite mind&hyphen;boggling. We worked through this issue at great length and I left him in no doubt that Australia's position on this is that we are all in favour of joint ventures, all in favour of expanding the trade; that we want to cooperate and strengthen ties with India, particularly in relation to the wool industry and the activities related to that; but that we feel very strongly that the lowering of tariffs is very much in their interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps there are some lessons to be learnt even from the model whereby Australia is now exporting wool tops to Mexico. They are allowed into that country with no tariff barriers being imposed at all, they are then value added by the Mexicans and re&hyphen;exported, under NAFTA, tariff free to the United States. It is a happy arrangement which works very well for Australia, works very well for Mexico and works very well, we hope, for the Americans and their consumers. It is seeing Mexican consumption of Australian wool rise very rapidly&mdash;whilst admittedly off a low base&mdash;by no less than 60 per cent last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that sort of growth continues and if we see the sorts of projections that are now shaping up for India following through, then we will indeed be looking at a much brighter future for wool. I must say that it is not before time. With the knowledge that nine out of 10 woolgrowers this year will lose money and that most of them have now lost money for the sixth year running, there is no doubt at all about the seriousness of the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have at least, through the round table process somewhat disparagingly referred to by the previous speaker, managed to establish that the industry can work together. I regard it as an absolute prerequisite for recovery that the industry works together in a unified way and recognises that the enemies for the wool industry and for woolgrowers are not other sectors of the same industry but the alternative fibres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They really have to capture market share again, and that is not going to be easy. In their heartland markets, in terms of traditional outlets such as Europe, the research shows that an interesting phenomena amongst consumers of almost all goods is now affecting wool; that is, increasingly people expect real value for money from mid&hyphen;range commodities, whether it is motor cars, electronics or clothing. They actually expect qualities of them now that 30 years ago they would have only expected to find in the goods that were priced two, three and four times as much. As a result of that, they are increasingly reluctant to pay big premiums for what are regarded as very narrow increments in quality and prestige. So we do have a problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The name of the game for the wool industry is promotion, promotion, promotion. We have to expand demand for the product and, notwithstanding my general agreement with the comments about the apparent lack of result from the vast amounts of money that have been spent on promotion in recent years, I do think that we are now looking at a much leaner and meaner operation, and certainly on vastly reduced budgets in terms of the generic promotion of wool in the late 1990s. We are going to have to make sure that strategies are effective. This government believes that whilst we have a vital role to play in market research and development and in market access issues and those sorts of things, the industry itself has to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1011"> by and large take a lead. The people with the greatest vested interest in the industry are those who have the greatest capacity to really make it work in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I comment very briefly just on Wool International to reassure the previous speaker and anybody else who is interested that they will not be buying themselves a future? It is quite widely recognised that it is the government's view that, as the stockpile is dealt with and as various other charges imposed upon that body by the 1993 act are discharged, the body will be increasingly wound down and in due course will fade from the scene altogether. We do have a lot of bodies in the wool industry and some rationalisation is, I think, generally agreed to be a very healthy objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming to the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996 which is before us, I will be as brief as I can. Firstly, the proposed amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code of 1994 will extend the part 3 compensation provisions to cover the active constituent of a chemical product, as distinct from only applying to an agricultural or veterinary chemical product as is currently the case. The active constituent compensation provisions will apply between the primary applicant with a protected active constituent and a secondary applicant seeking access to certain information relating to the protected active constituent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, the proposed amendments are in response to concerns expressed by some companies involved with the marketing of active constituents. These concerns especially relate to the provision of active constituent review information requested by the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals, the NRA. The review information is for the purpose of the NRA reviewing existing and especially old active constituents to ensure that they meet contemporary public health, occupational health and safety, environmental impact and trade standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming again to farm household support, the act of 1992 will be amended. Those amendments will strengthen the multiple entitlement exclusion provisions of the Farm Household Support Act in relation to the drought relief payment. The current multiple entitlement exclusion provisions in the Farm Household Support Act need to be strengthened to restrict the level of income support payments to a DRP recipient or their partner through  either the Social Security Act 1991, the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 or the Farm Household Support Act to the equivalent level of entitlements received under other Commonwealth income support measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendments will prevent recipients of the DRP or their partners double dipping by receiving support in the form of a couple&hyphen;rate payment under this act while at the same time obtaining payments or allowances identified separately under the Social Security Act 1991 or the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. When DRP is calculated, an amount for the partner is included in the DRP payment. Hence, if the partner were to claim a payment in their own right such as a partner allowance or parenting allowance, they would in effect receive the same support twice&mdash;once as a component of the drought relief payment and again as a separate payment under the Social Security Act 1991 or the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. Following this amendment such a case will not be possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are in excess of 1,450 recipients of DRP, or their spouses, who are also claiming social security income support payments in addition to receiving the DRP. Based on these figures, the estimated saving from the proposal to strengthen the multiple entitlement exclusion provisions would be a little over $7 million per year. I know that some of those members 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1012"> opposite will understand entirely what I mean when I say that, in this day and age, when one has to be very careful with budgetary outlays and when we all accept the need to ensure that targeting of assistance is effectively undertaken and followed through, the issues can become awesomely complex. This is an outstanding example of just how tricky it can be to get these things right. Nonetheless, we think this will remove a small anomaly under which some people were enjoying a little more than their fair share of the cake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of the December 1994 tobacco restructuring package, the activities of the Australian Tobacco Marketing Advisory Committee&mdash;or ATMAC, as it was known&mdash;were wound up on 3 July 1995 in anticipation of the repeal of the Tobacco Marketing Act 1965, under which ATMAC operated. Schedule 3 of the proposed legislation repeals the act and provides for the transfer of all rights, assets, obligations and liabilities from ATMAC to the Tobacco Research and Development Corporation. This is a troubled Australian industry, but tobacco farmers are doing their best to grapple with their future. They are operating at the moment under a restructuring package, which will see many farmers identify other futures for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make the general comment that I have the utmost sympathy for tobacco farmers. We live in an age when everybody wants to slate people who smoke, everybody is after the manufacturers and there is a great deal of community angst over it. The poor old tobacco farmer is often absolutely the meat in the sandwich in all of this. Many of them are people who, at various times, have been encouraged by governments of all persuasions to go out there and farm tobacco. In fact, I think I am right in saying that they were a protected industry during the Second World War. They were regarded as so important in terms of the product they produced for our service men and women fighting abroad, and so forth, that it was a protected industry to make sure the produce was available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this day and age, a very different view is taken of the desirability of providing cigarettes for anybody. But we must remember the need to work with tobacco farmers, who in many ways are victims of past government policy. In this age when we want to get everybody out of that industry we need to work with those farmers so that they can restructure and find their way forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993, the previous speaker, the member for Kalgoorlie, had quite a bit to say about the wool industry. I will confine myself to a few remarks, having responded more broadly to his comments. The amendment to the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993 will extend the sunset date to 30 June 2000 for wool industry contributions to the Australian Animal Health Council&mdash;the AAHC&mdash;from 30 June 1997, when the current funding arrangements expire. The objective of this provision and the reason for its sunset is to provide an interim funding arrangement pending wool industry agreement on longer&hyphen;term funding. The extension of the sunset date to 30 June 2000 will enable the wool industry to continue to meet their financial obligations to fund the AAHC while they examine options to provide for a longer&hyphen;term solution for funding the AAHC. I commend the amendments to the Main Committee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency Bill 1996 proposes to appropriate funds and to issue the securities to effect Australia's membership of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, MIGA. The purpose of MIGA, which is an institution of the World Bank, is to foster foreign investment in developing countries by providing insurance against various risks and advisory services concerning foreign investment. Membership should assist Australian firms doing business: for example, through obtaining a MIGA guarantee or through obtaining political risk insurance. In addition, Australian membership should be viewed positively by other nations in terms of fulfilling our international development obligations.</PARA></TALK.START>

In 1993, the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade concluded that the benefits of joining MIGA were in excess of the costs and that therefore Australia should join. The Australian Labor Party supported that recommendation at the time and now, in opposition, we are pleased to support the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to briefly comment on the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency Bill 1996. As has been outlined, it is an institution of the World Bank. I am on the public record as always being a bit of a sceptic as far as some of these international financial institutions are concerned. But it is my understanding that the insurance that is afforded to Australian companies investing in other countries, through Australia's membership of this agency, is well worth Australia belonging to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know there are a number of other issues involved as far as MIGA is concerned. As set out in the EM, MIGA's purpose is to foster foreign investment in developing countries. I imagine that the speaker who is to follow me will express some concerns about the encouragement of  Australian institutions and companies investing in developing countries. I have had it brought to my attention that some Australian mining companies are investing and exploring in countries that we might think are a bit politically unstable. However, Australia's membership of MIGA affords these companies insurance against the risks of currency transfer, ex&hyphen;appropriation, war and civil disturbance. Membership should be encouraged because it gives Australian companies the opportunity to invest abroad with security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We live in a world that economically and industrially is getting smaller. We are continually faced with concerns for our own constituencies with regard to foreign investment in Australia. But, by the same token, Australian companies are being very proactive in investing in other parts of the world and, again, I instance mining industries. To a certain extent, I remain a bit sceptical about World Bank type financial institutions but my understanding of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, and the insurance that it provides to Australian companies investing overseas, is that it is well worth Australia's membership. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The previous member said he remained a little sceptical and I think he should. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency Bill 1996 is just another grab at this great straw of internationalism, which has been a hallmark of this and previous governments in Australia. We are told that the analysis says that there will be more 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1014"> benefit than cost. I think that analysis is very dubious and, in any case, it is going to be marginal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it amusing that we spend so much time on these multilateral bodies. Here is another that is going to be dominated by the United States. It is quite clear from the capital structure that that will be the case. There is no provision in these insurance contingencies for devaluation of currency, which is one of the very big risks taken in investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are going to all this trouble to set up an organisation that will, in the main, be used by large business&mdash;and mainly by foreign business. It will not be used much by small Australian businesses. We do not give anything like the same support to industry in our own country. The Development Bank has basically ceased to exist. As a branch of the now privatised Commonwealth Bank, its charter is invalid. Its charter would be ultra vires a companies act. It is necessary to re&hyphen;establish that sort of facility in Australia if we are going to do something serious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker mentioned the growth of the manufacturing industry. This myth has to be countered. We are told that manufacturing now represents a growing percentage of our exports. That is true, but what is not realised is that importation of exactly the same sorts of things has increased at the same rate off a bigger base. So the situation is getting worse, not better. We are going to have no jobs in this country if we do not address the urgent need for an Australian import replacement manufacturing industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not intend to dwell long on this bill. I certainly do not intend to oppose it. It is just another example of the fetish drafts by successive governments in this country. I made the point in the House the other day that in Australia we are fast approaching a one&hyphen;party system where both major parties have identical policies and only quibble at the margins. This bill will do very little for Australia. It is a bill, which, over time, will provide a few lofty jobs for a few people, but it will be of no great benefit to industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was some criticism of the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) in this House. I think it was a little unfair. I have spoken to Ian McLachlan on occasions. I think Ian McLachlan  and the government are aware of the great benefit of bilateral trade arrangements and would pursue those. I believe that Ian McLachlan will do more than any previous minister has done in his capacity as Minister for Defence to make sure there is a real Australian component there. The member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) misrepresented, to some degree, the views of the member. The member is a man whose views should be listened to much more in the cabinet. I believe he is isolated in the government. Having made those few remarks, I am satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr MILES</EMPHASIS> (Braddon&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (12.54 p.m.)&mdash;in reply&mdash;I recognise people's contributions here today. There has been a level of scepticism about being involved in multilateral agreements, but we live in a world community, a global community, and I think everybody recognises that the boundaries are disappearing and distances are shrinking because of the capacity for the world society to work together and because of developments in transport and communication systems. We are closer together as people. We all are aware of a degree of sharing and working with each other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">History is dotted with the difficulties of doing that but, as an Australian government at this stage in history, we believe that we have a role to play in the global community and in working through the structures of the world community. As some of the speakers have indicated, there is a degree of scepticism. That will always be the case, probably right throughout the world. In any country there will be people who are sceptical of centralised 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1015"> bureaucracies and structures which, generally speaking, they have very little control over or say in, even in a democratic sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet governments of every country, as they participate in this global community of ours, have a responsibility to make judgments, assessments and decisions as to where they can best link in as participants in a world community while, at the same time, giving consideration to the interests of their own people, their own society and their own communities. I believe that in this regard the government has found that balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Of course, this proposal for the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency Bill 1996 is one which was supported by the previous government. It has been taken up by us and we support it as a coalition government. It is beneficial to Australian business and industry, and Australian business and industry have wanted us to be involved in this because it does give Australian firms procurement opportunities and, of course, some guarantees against political considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that this can also flow on and benefit people within Australia in regard to employment opportunities. If businesses in Australia believe that they can have better opportunities because we are involved at this level, then I think a direct link can be drawn to benefits here within the Australian community. As a government, this is our bill and we support it, and we take on board the comments of people who have contributed here in the Main Committee today.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In providing funds to the core programs of the IARCs, the Australian aid program adopts a strategic approach which gives priority to those centres which have prime responsibility for conserving the collections of major crop species important to developing countries of our region and Australia&mdash;namely,  rice, wheat, maize, grain legumes, potato, banana. In financial year 1996&hyphen;97, the custodial centres for these key staples will receive $4.6 million in support of their germplasm and agronomy programs from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the IARCs hold only 10% of the world's gene stores, while the remainder are held by national institutions in both industrial and developing countries. The Global Plan of Action for the Conservation and Sustainable Utilisation of the World's Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture stresses the need for adequate resources to be made available to conserve and curate these national collections, as well as the international collections of the IARCs. At this point, national 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1019"> governments and institutions, with the assistance of the international community, have yet to marshall the resources necessary, through national, bilateral and multilateral sources to carry out this essential task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Australia's support through AusAID and ACIAR, as reported in response to Question 1 above, confirms that the aid program continues to take positive steps to address this important issue. Obviously, there is always more that can be done, but without diversion of resources away from other priority programs, or a significant increase in the total resource base, it is not possible to do more than at present.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) and (2) The 1995 Australian Workplace Industrial Relations Survey (AWIRS 95) was a major data source for the 1995 Annual Report on Enterprise Bargaining in Australia.

This survey was representative of all workplaces in the Australian population of this size (excluding workplaces in defence, agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because it was conducted over the phone, the number of questions that could be asked in the small workplace survey was limited. There were no questions directly asking about individual employment contracts.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AWIRS 95 small workplace survey was used in the 1995 Annual Report on Enterprise Bargaining in Australia to provide the data for the section titled `2.5: The incidence of agreements in small business workplaces' at pages 55&hyphen;56 and `Attachment 2.A: The incidence of agreements in small business workplaces' at pages 67&hyphen;73.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Yes, at the time of the accident Comcare was the responsible authority and so manages their compensation claims. Early this year ADI successfully applied for a licence to `self&hyphen;insure' for the purposes of workers' compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) No such allegations have been made to me or, I am advised, to Comcare. Comcare further advise me it did not intervene in the coronial inquiry. In this case, the Coroner requested the report of Comcare's investigation into the incident under the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991. As the Comcare investigation was incomplete at that stage an interim report was duly provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) I have been advised that the State Coroner, Mr D Hand, has determined that the provisions of the Coroners Act 1980, have been complied with and the holding of a formal hearing into the circumstances surrounding the explosion is not necessary. An order dispensing with the holding of an Inquiry was made on 22 October, 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This determination does not affect any decision the injured workers may make with regard to taking their own proceedings. The two proceedings are completely unrelated and, in fact, Supreme Court case law has previously ruled that a Coronial inquiry should not be used to set up civil action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) I am advised Comcare did not intervene in the manner alleged; it assisted the Coroner with his inquiry by providing its interim investigation report.
