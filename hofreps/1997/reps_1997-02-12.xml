<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the AUSTUDY Regulation (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1996, No. 261, and made under the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This motion relates to two measures in the Austudy area that were announced in last year's budget which we find particularly iniquitous. The first is the decision to increase the age of independence under the Austudy means test from 22 to 25. It is a direct reversal of a measure that was taken by the former government when I was minister to reduce it from 25 to 22 in a series of three incremental steps. The second matter that we find particularly objectionable is the abolition of the schooling incidentals allowance. This is not a big ticket item in the overall scheme of the budget. However, we find this a particularly cruel and obnoxious proposition. We have expressed strong opposition to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These matters were given notice of towards the end of the session last year. The Senate has already voted on them. Regrettably, our attempt to disallow these propositions in the Senate failed because the two Independent senators did not support us on that occasion. So you might say that, in a sense, this debate here is a little academic because the numbers are, shall we say, rather more clear&hyphen;cut. But we think these are important issues of princi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ple, and we intend to take this opportunity to raise them in the parliament. On the age of independence, we believe that it is a fundamentally absurd premise to suggest that the structure of the Austudy income test can proceed on the presumption that there is a relationship of financial dependency between people in their mid&hyphen;20s and their parents. It simply does not accord with any concept of social reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that many members of parliament will have received representations on this. I know that I have received quite a few. It is a matter that has generated a great deal of concern and anger. The sort of anomalies that can emerge are well exemplified by this representation received by one of my colleagues. I do not intend to give the name of the individual, but I will read the letter, because I think it exemplifies some of the points:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to inform you of my situation in relation to Austudy regulations. My hope is that you may be able to lodge some sort of appeal and present my case as an example of how the current regulations exclude students with a genuine need from receiving government help.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This year I am entering the second year of a Bachelor of Teaching degree at the University of Western Sydney at Nepean. I enrolled as a mature age student last year at the age of 21. Prior to this, I had completed an associate diploma over two years, which I financed myself by working part-time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had moved out of home to attend this course. The year following, I worked full time in a primary school, supporting myself again. On enrolling in the  degree course, I was refused Austudy payments due to not being an independent age, not having worked full time for three years and not having been on social security and having parents whose income was marginally too high.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For my first year of university, then, I lived off my savings, with the expectation that I would receive Austudy in 1997 at the age of 22. Under this assumption, I also advised my mother that working a second job would not detrimentally affect my chances of receiving the payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On application this year, I found the independent age had been raised to 25. This meant for me that I was still classed as dependent on my parents, whom I do not live with and whose income is set too high as a result of the second job held by my mother. Looking at how the system has been set up, it would have served my purposes better not to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="700"> have worked my way through my associate diploma but rather to have depended on social security.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The point there is that, had he done so, he would have qualified under the work force test to be considered independent. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Maybe then the current regulations would have permitted me to receive the much needed help. So it is my opinion, therefore, that the independent classification as it now stands is not an effective way of assessing students' independence.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">People are confronted with the situation where, having taken bona fide decisions and acted in good faith on the presumption that a set of arrangements would apply, they now find themselves caught by this sort of change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The numbers involved are quite significant. According to budget material, 13,700 stand to have their payments reduced. A further 12,000 will become completely ineligible. I acknowledge that the measure is not quite as obnoxious as was originally suggested in the budget, when it was proposed that if you turned 25 in the course of your studies, you would continue to be deemed dependent on your parents until completion. That meant, hypothetically, that somebody starting medicine at the age of 24 could still be deemed dependent on mum and dad when they were approaching the age of 30. That was a bit too red hot even for this government. I was pleased to see that that aspect of the original proposition was not carried through. There was some loss of savings as a result of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, this is a highly retrograde measure. When in government and when I was minister we made it a high priority to get that age of independence down. And we did. The student organisations identified reducing the age of independence as one of their two top priorities in the Austudy area, the other being to liberalise the personal income test, which we also did to a very considerable extent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We strongly oppose this proposition. Clearly it creates additional barriers to participation in higher education to many people. When you combine it with the impact of the sharply increased HECS charges and the substantially increased HECS debts that people are going to be forced to incur, and the fact that many 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of these students are now going to have to look at loans&mdash;they might be the Austudy supplementary loans or loans from other sources&mdash;you will find that the disincentive for study, especially for those who do not have particularly high levels of means, will be considerable. Bear in mind here that the parental income test under Austudy does cut in at a pretty low income level. We are talking about the basic joint family income threshold of $22,650, which varies a bit depending on circumstances. But still, we are not talking about people with very substantial wealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other measure was the cessation of the schooling incidentals allowance. As I have said, we find this a particularly cruel and objectionable step. The schooling incidentals allowance provided students on the homeless rate of Austudy with $300&mdash;a one&hyphen;off payment&mdash;at the beginning of each year to help them buy necessary items such as books, equipment and course materials. You could not envisage a more disadvantaged group in our society than those receiving the young homeless rate of Austudy. It is an obnoxious measure to deprive people in that circumstance of the capacity to acquire basic textbooks. This is the government that goes on about how important it is to overcome educational disadvantage and address problems like literacy. How can you address educational difficulties if people cannot acquire the basic requisites necessary to undertake study? It is just an absolute outrage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It sits alongside a complementary measure announced at the same time in the budget to get rid of case management for students on the young homeless rate of Austudy. This is not embodied in this regulation, because that was a step that the government was able to do administratively. The idea of case management is to provide customised, individualised assistance to, again, some of the most disadvantaged people in our society&mdash;those getting the young homeless rate of Austudy&mdash;so that they may have some prospect of overcoming their educational disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The saving from the abolition of case management is $14&half; million over four years. Getting rid of the incidentals allowance saves 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="701"> about $11 million over the four years of the forward estimates. These are not big bucks items; they can hardly be said to bear significantly on the government's overall fiscal position. They are just very obnoxious. The government may argue that case management is reinstating the old JPET scheme&mdash;job placement, employment and training. It is setting up a number of pilot programs at a cost of about $11 million. That does not offset the negative impact of these other changes. For one thing, the financial balance clearly represents a cut in assistance to these students. JPET is going to take some time to wind up. It is just not the case that the pilot programs are a comprehensive substitute for the assistance provided through individualised case management and through the incidentals allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think these are thoroughly objectionable measures. We did not object to everything that the government did in the budget. We did not have an in&hyphen;principle objection, for example, to the actual means test changes. It does appear that there have been some major problems in the implementation of that. There have been a heap of complaints about the way that has been administered. But that is not the subject matter of today's debate. These are part of an overall combination of measures which will severely restrict access to higher education for many people. They represent the negation of what we should be trying to achieve in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are already starting to see in enrolment patterns at universities clear evidence of the impact that the combination of these measures will have. The picture does vary from state to state, and the full effect of what the government is doing is in some cases being masked by other factors, such as in Queensland, where there is a significant growth in underlying demand. However, where you have a combination of institutions that service a high proportion of people from disadvantaged backgrounds&mdash;I think of institutions like the University of Western Sydney and some of the newer regional institutions&mdash;and courses that have a sharp increase in the level of fees payable, as in science and technology based courses, you start to see clear evidence of a deterrent effect.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to some research that was done when we were in government on the impact of HECS. It showed that HECS at the level that we in government had pitched it was not having a particularly substantial effect on participation decisions for the great majority of students. However, where you had combined characteristics of disadvantage, such as people from both low socioeconomic backgrounds and rural and isolated areas, you did start to see the emergence of a significant deterrent effect. That arises from the effect of people being encumbered with substantial levels of debt. There is clear evidence that people from disadvantaged backgrounds are more averse to encumbering themselves with high levels of debt than people who are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All those changes are obviously compounded by what is being done in the Austudy area to the extent that people do not have access to the full rate of Austudy they would have otherwise been entitled to, to the extent that they are forced to seek other forms of support, such as trading in part of their Austudy loan as is now permitted under the Austudy supplement arrangements where they can forgo $1 of grant income for $2 of concessional loan. If you accumulate that with the effect of the HECS changes that this government has made, then you are starting to look at a very substantial disincentive effect. We do not yet have a complete picture of that because we do not yet have the full set of information about the take&hyphen;up on offers of application at university. Most of the institutions are still going through the process of offering places. We will see the impact when those final numbers come through, but already it is clear that there is an effect there and that will be compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, reverting to the incidentals allowance, the foundations of educational disadvantage and the viability of equity programs are compromised and undermined to the extent that disadvantage at the school level, problems with literacy and behavioural problems, has emerged as a result of early educational disadvantage. If they are not addressed in a timely fashion, then you have a major problem. It has to be done partly through the early years of schooling, but the programs that we have&mdash;including the incidentals allowance and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="702"> the case management of homeless Austudy recipients&mdash;are designed to provide the kids who are some of the most disadvantaged in our society with a degree of hope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, we find these measures highly obnoxious and we were regrettably unsuccessful in our attempt to have these regulations disallowed in the Senate. I am sure we will be even less successful down here, but we believe very strongly that we need to take a strong stand on principle on this and we will be dividing on this disallowance motion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is worth noting that the regulations in question, which have been supported in the Senate, had already been amended to provide Austudy on an independent basis for everyone who turned 25. As the member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin) indicated earlier, this was a change to the original budget proposal, and I would like to thank the member for Sydney and others for drawing the government's attention to the consequences of the initial proposal. The other point I would like to make at the outset is that the raising of the age of independence has been grandfathered, so anyone who was getting Austudy because of their turning 22 last year will continue to get Austudy this year. They are important points to make at the beginning of this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, this debate is really about exactly what Austudy should be and what it should do. It is important to note that Austudy is an income supplement, not an income substitute. Austudy is an allowance paid to people in need. It is not an allowance paid automatically to students. It is not the educational equivalent of the dole, and that is why it has always been very tightly targeted, as the member for Sydney pointed out in his contribution. The parental means test begins to operate at about $23,000 per year taxable income and for many students their Austudy eligibility cuts out when parental income approaches $35,000.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a benefit that is strictly targeted towards low and I suppose lower middle income families. In addition, we have, as the member for Sydney indicated, the actual means test implemented last year by the former government and continued this year&mdash;I would like to think improved and enhanced&mdash;by the current government. I might have a little more to say about that in a moment. But the simple truth is that we cannot afford to pay all the 500,000 or so people in higher education in Australia $140 a week. We simply cannot afford to do it, and that is why Austudy is a targeted scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other features of Austudy which distinguishes it from DSS benefits is that students on Austudy are able to earn I think up to $6,000 a year before their benefit starts to cut out. DSS beneficiaries are normally limited to about $30 a week. We as a government believe&mdash;the former government believed as well&mdash;that work enhances the student experience, that part-time work is an ordinary part of the life of a full-time student. One of the difficulties with reducing the age of independence to 22 is that we had, anecdotally, numerous students getting Austudy at the age of 22, dropping out of their part-time work but continuing to rely on mum and dad for income incidentals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us remember that there are already a number of grounds of independence apart from age. Marriage is a ground for independence, having a dependent child is a ground for independence, being self-supporting for three of the past four years is a ground for independence and being homeless&mdash;that is, being unable for all sorts of reasons to live in the family home&mdash;is a ground for independence. So there are many other ways in which people can be judged independent of their parents apart simply from the attainment of a certain chronological age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should also be pointed out that in 1974, when the Whitlam government introduced the forerunner of Austudy, the age of independence was 25. In 1987, when the former Hawke government turned the tertiary education assistance scheme into Austudy&mdash;the current scheme&mdash;the age of independence was 25. It is only in 1993 that the age of inde 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="703"> pendence began to be reduced, down to the age of 22 that applied last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If having an age of independence at 25 is an injustice, for nine years it was an injustice connived at by members opposite, including the member for Sydney, and it was an injustice that was perpetrated by the former government. The fact is that it is not an injustice that students should be regarded as dependent until the age of 25.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If they should not be judged on their parental income, there are many criteria on which they can gain independence. They should not be exempted from consideration of parental means simply because they turn 22&mdash;almost any full&hyphen;time student without substantial investment assets and income will qualify under the means test for Austudy if judged independently. The reality of the changes introduced at the beginning of 1993 by the former government is that the children of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) would get Austudy when they turned 22 and Kerry Packer's children, if they were at university, would get Austudy when they turned 22. My position, and the position of the government, is that Jamie Packer should not get Austudy just because he has turned 22. Reducing the Austudy age of independence to 22 was a prime case of middle class welfare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the schooling incidentals allowance. It was an allowance introduced by the former government just before the election. Some could say it was a cynical, pre&hyphen;election bribe and some could say it was something thrown into the youth statement at the last minute as a pre&hyphen;election handout and as a sweetener, and as a desperate last roll of the dice. I am not suggesting for a second that such cynical statements would be true but the fact is that there was a problem with that allowance. It was $300 which may very well have been spent on ice cream at McDonald's as well as on books and other necessities of schooling. So if the intention of the former government had been to ensure that students on the homeless rate of Austudy had better access to books and equipment there were a lot better ways of doing it than simply handing them an extra $300.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SAWFORD" NAMEID="3J4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3J4">Mr Sawford</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But you didn't do it any better ways.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EZ5">Mr ABBOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that. In fact, the new government is assisting homeless youngsters in much more effective and much better targeted ways. Instead of the $3 million or so that was spent on the schooling incidentals allowance of the former government, we are committing $11 million to the jobs, placement, employment and training, or JPET, program and also committing $8 million to the youth homelessness pilot program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Sydney in his contribution alluded to the disincentives that some people face because of the variations between Austudy allowances and DSS allowances. I accept that there are some disincentives. They are not new disincentives: they are disincentives that have existed for many years; they are disincentives which existed under the former government. It is a problem that the current government accepts and is one we are trying to address in the process of formulating our youth allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Sydney raised the question of what he said were declining enrolments at universities. Yes, the figures are yet to be finalised for this year but it is possible that in quite a number of faculties there may be a decline in applications but, on the other hand, in other faculties there will be increases in applications. In the case of science enrolments, there has been a steady fall for some years. That is due fundamentally to falling numbers of students doing science at school. Applications overall fell six per cent last year and they did that in the absence of any increases in HECS charges. When HECS was first brought in in the late 1980s applications to go to university increased substantially. So it is certainly quite simplistic to say that the increases in HECS charges have contributed to a dramatic decrease in university enrolments&mdash;they have not; there is no evidence; it is not logical; it does not stand up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the member for Sydney alluded to the actual means test. Various people on the coalition backbench, various people on the opposition benches and, indeed, various independent members of parliament have drawn the government's attention to some 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="704"> problems. The imputation of values of expenditure was a problem last year and it is a problem again. It is unclear whether anticipated Austudy payments should be included in prospective educational expenses; that was a problem last year and it is a problem again this year. I think members on all sides of the House will find that the departmental motto in this, as in all things, is, `We will listen; we will learn; and where necessary we will act.'</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whatever the fudge or the spin that the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) or the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) may put on it, this is nothing but a betrayal of young Australians by this government. Increasing the age of independence for Austudy from 22 to 25 and abolishing the incidentals allowance from January next year are just more pieces of the jigsaw puzzle that will see the government rejected at the ballot box much sooner than the pundits predict.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, this is an attack on low to middle income earners, whom this government so comprehensively conned at the last election. When I look at the frontbench of the government I see a lot of blase contentment. I do not see anybody with any empathy or understanding of the difficulties that low to middle income earners face in their efforts to raise families and provide educational opportunities for their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course government members can say that on 2 March last year the Australian electorate put its faith in the coalition in a resounding way, but there is a very big `but'&mdash;when it comes to anything to do with education, this is a coalition government that cannot cut the mustard. The Austudy age of independence is a case in point. The coalition suffers from a very convenient memory loss. In 1991 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training released a report on student financial assistance, known as the Price report. The committee's membership included the Labor members for Chifley, Brisbane, Forde, Moreton, Lalor, Cowan and me, as the member for Port Adelaide. The four Labor members on that committee who remain here have not forgotten the report. It was a unani 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mous report, by the way, which recommended changes to Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that committee there were four coalition members who remain as members of this House. They are the Deputy Leader of the National Party and Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson); the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott); the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford); and the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles). What did they support in March 1991? They supported the same recommendation as the Labor members of the committee, recommendation 11A. I remind the House that it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The independence eligibility criteria for independent status for Austudy be reduced progressively to age 21 over the next four budgets.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They endorsed that decision because to suggest that people can be presumed to be financially dependent on their parents until they are in their mid&hyphen;twenties is clearly untenable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1991 decision was the correct one. That judgement was the sensible one. But now the coalition have sold out young people. They have betrayed their actions, their beliefs and their commitments, then and now. I would like to hear why they have changed their commitments to young Australians. This government is very keen on using the term `financial black hole' in attacking the previous Labor government, but where is the government's stance on the social black hole it is creating for so many Australians? The decision to save $210 million dollars over four years takes the money out of the pockets of students. As a result, 13,700 students will have their payments reduced and 12,000 will become completely ineligible&mdash;a total of 25,000 students will be adversely affected by this decision. Where is there any evidence of social ethics and social responsibility in this government? The former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> today, certainly had a change of mind on social ethics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do need economic responsibility, but it needs to be balanced with social and moral responsibility. I refer the many new coalition 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="705"> members to the work of coalition colleagues and Labor members who worked on the Price report. On the issue of independent status for tertiary students, it is worth examining the views of the National Union of Students, of the Institute of Family Studies and of DEET. As the shadow minister at the table, the member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin) said, the National Union of Students stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the overwhelming source of most complaints from their members on Austudy was the question of independent status.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Another student body stated the very obvious, that 18 is the verified age of independence in most areas: voting, licences, alcohol consumption and so on. There is no logic whatsoever in moving the age of independence back to 25 years of age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Institute of Family Studies argued, and I again quote from the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Austudy together with most other allowances is largely built on assumptions that all but a very small number of young people have support from their parents in the early teenage years. The institute stated that young people choose to move on or are forced to move to independent level for various reasons at different ages and stages of development with every different personal and financial resources.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The age for independent Austudy will now be 25 years, while for jobsearch allowance it is 18 years and over. At the time of the report, DEET explained that this reflected the fact that Austudy is generally available over a longer period than the then unemployment benefits and that there was an expectation that parents would contribute to their student children under the age of 25. However, one DEET officer really let the cat out of the bag when he told the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I cannot think of any educational research that is available to us to suggest that 25 is the appropriate age.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Exactly, because none exists. There is absolutely no research, no rationale, no process, no outcome that will support the actions of the government. Those on the government side who know anything about education know this. This is economic responsibility without social responsibility. It is economic good without public good. It is private good without moral good. The action of this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government in changing the age of independent status to 25 years takes public policy on income support for tertiary students backwards to an age that no longer exists. It ought to be comprehensively rejected. I challenge the members of the coalition, particularly the members for Gwydir, Maranoa, McPherson, La Trobe, Warringah and Sturt, to defend these regressive policies in this chamber and to recant on the commitment they made in 1990 and 1991 which led to the publication of the Price report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ceasing of the schooling incidentals allowance is another exceptionally mean measure. It saves $11 million over four years. That is how much the government has taken from the most needy of students. One hundred thousand young people are unemployed&mdash;$2 a week. Measly! It is estimated that 8,500 students will be disadvantaged by this measure. It is a one&hyphen;off payment of $300 payable at the beginning of each year to help homeless Austudy/Abstudy students complete their secondary education, by assisting with study expenses such as books, equipment and course costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a very large outlay, but it is a very important one for recipients. It can make the difference between a young person undertaking or completing a course of study or dropping out altogether. The government has not even attempted to defend this decision in its budget papers, nor can it, because once again this decision reveals nothing but the meanness of spirit which runs through many of its policies, especially those from which Aboriginal people might receive some benefit. It seems that the most vigorous cost cutting measures are made to programs which provide support for Aboriginal people. Perhaps the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) has more friends on the government benches than she realises. This measure reveals a complete lack of understanding and empathy for the hardships that low to middle income families face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same group of students will also be hit by another mean budget measure: the ceasing of case management of secondary students on the student homeless rate of Austudy or Abstudy. This program assisted homeless secondary Austudy/Abstudy students to stay 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="706"> on and complete their studies, achieve family reconciliation and, in the case of year 12 students, make the transition from school to work or further education and training. This measure saves $1.5 million over four years. That is piddling, measly and mean. The total that this government has swindled out of young Australians continues to mount up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's action bares for all to see its lack of prudence and lack of care and responsibility towards the aspirations of ordinary young Australians who, by furthering their education, contribute to the further wealth of this nation. I remind the members for Warringah and Sturt that the people of Australia did not vote for these actions. These are yet more examples of the government's continuing betrayal of people, especially young people. This is a government without conscience, without any vision of national identity or national interest. It thinks standing still is progress. This is a government that is going headlong back into the past. It is supported by a frontbench which believes its own propaganda to manipulate lesser choices for Australians and by a large backbench which has learned to conform, be uniform and exclusive and not to step out of line. This is a government with no openness, no diversity and no inclusiveness. It is a government for a tiny privileged minority of Australians. That is not at all how they promised it would be.</PARA></SPEECH>

As a consequence, there is no possibility that these regulations can be disallowed. So, in effect, all we are doing this morning is spending an hour of the Commonwealth's time debating an issue which is already closed, which I think speaks volumes for the facile nature of the member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin) and the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) in coming in here today to debate an issue which is already closed, simply as a matter of point scoring.</PARA></TALK.START>

<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SAWFORD" NAMEID="3J4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3J4">Mr Sawford</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We'll be sending a copy of your speech to the Adelaide University, my son.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V5">Mr PYNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy for you to send my speech to the members of the university. It would give me more publicity. I turn firstly to the contribution by the member for Port Adelaide, which was, unfortunately&mdash;knowing him as I do&mdash;sadly full of cant and humbug. He used phrases like `the betrayal of young Australians', `meanness of spirit' and `letting down young Australians from low socioeconomic backgrounds', and asked about the rationale for the age of 25. Why wasn't the member for Adelaide asking all these questions in the 13 years of Labor government when they did not introduce the schooling incidentals allowance until just before a federal election, and for the 11 years of Labor government while the Austudy age was 25 and was only brought down to 22 in 1992? Why weren't you asking those questions then?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You say that we have betrayed young Australians. If you are to be believed, then you have betrayed young Australians for 13 years and 11 years on both those counts. That is beside the fact that you betrayed young Australians for your entire term of office in higher education through the introduction of HECS, increasing it three times, and a number of other matters which I will deal with later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One specific matter mentioned by the member for Port Adelaide was how the coalition government is attacking indigenous Australians particularly, and non&hyphen;indigenous Australians. That is an absolute nonsense. If he looked to the facts of the situation, he would know that on two counts the coalition government has specifically excluded indigenous Australians for better treatment. Those are a bill that was introduced in the early part of the coalition's term last year which put aside $140 million extra for indigenous education&mdash;it was an indigenous education bill&mdash;and the budget itself, in which the coalition put special positions aside for indigenous Australians through their 4,000 scholarships for higher education and also put extra money into indigenous education. So the member for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="707"> Port Adelaide should check his facts before he makes such absurd claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Port Adelaide also said that the coalition was letting down young Australians from low socioeconomic backgrounds. It is quite the opposite. In fact, he is letting down his own people in Port Adelaide by making such a claim. Austudy, for the last four years, has been available to people from the age of 22 deemed to be independent because of their age, regardless of the means of their families. As a consequence, Austudy has been paid to many people from comfortable and rich backgrounds instead of people from low socioeconomic backgrounds. If you take money and give it to people who do not require it&mdash;people from wealthy and comfortable backgrounds&mdash;simply because of their age, you inevitably affect people from low socioeconomic backgrounds in the other programs that you can provide to them, because the government's pool of money is limited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the rationale for the age of 25, the member for Port Adelaide might like to know that the Labor Party introduced the age of 25 on two occasions: when they first introduced this measure for Austudy in 1974, and again in 1987 when they changed the measure. That is why we are going back to that age. Austudy should be targeted to the low socioeconomic groups. Raising the age from 22 to 25 will help achieve this by ensuring that students from comfortable and rich backgrounds will face a means test on their family means until the age of 25. It is difficult to understand how the member for Sydney, the member for Port Adelaide and the Labor Party can feel passionate about this measure when for 18 years&mdash;from 1974 until 1992&mdash;it was 25 years of age. For 11 years of Labor government&mdash;if you include the Whitlam period, the Hawke period and the Keating period&mdash;it was 25. Now, all of a sudden, with great humbug, they come into the parliament and into the Senate and decry this change as though it is striking at the heart of students and their capacity. In fact, the member for Sydney described it as `a high priority for Labor when in government'. A high priority, indeed, that took nine years for them to introduce!</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result of reducing the age to 22 will be that those on higher incomes are able to receive Austudy for their children, as the means test is not applied to the newly independent class of student. Those genuinely in need will continue to receive Austudy unabated. There is no change to that. The parliamentary secretary pointed that out. If you are a low income family, then there is no change. If you are married, if you have dependent children, if you have worked for three of the last four years, if you are an orphan, a refugee or homeless, or if you have parents who cannot provide you with home or support, then you will have Austudy. So the member for Sydney's comment that this will create barriers to entry simply does not stand up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has taken a fiscally responsible approach to income support for children. We have maintained a grants scheme, we have maintained the current rate of Austudy in very difficult budgetary times as a consequence of Labor's term in office, and we have tried to target the scheme to the most needy&mdash;not to the children of rich parents who want to cruise through their last years at university at taxpayers' expense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to the abolition of the schooling incidentals allowance, the member for Sydney described it as `an absolute outrage and an obnoxious measure to deprive young homeless'. It is such an obnoxious measure that it took 13 years for the Labor Party to introduce it and a few months before the 1996 election for them to decide that it was an absolute outrage that young homeless children were not able to access $300 for books and other things for their schooling!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that the $300 allowance that was being paid to young homeless children in the last 12 months was not in the least bit targeted, was utterly uncontrolled by the department, and there was no control over how it was spent. As a consequence, we have no idea whether it was spent on books, or shoes, or whatever else, or whether it was spent on rollerblades or other things that might have been used by these people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition, on the other hand, while setting aside this allowance, is spending more money on young homeless people through 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="708"> two measures. We are introducing the youth homelessness pilot program which will provide $8.1 million in additional funding over three years to improve the level of engagement of homeless young people or those at risk of being homeless in family work, education, training and the community. The primary focus of this youth homeless pilot program will be on family reconciliation and early intervention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have put $8.1 million into actually trying to achieve something for young homeless people, rather than simply giving them a benefit which encourages the idea that they can stay away from their families when obviously the best solution to all the problems is for them to be reunited with their families, for them to achieve some reconciliation, for the reasons they left their homes to be changed and for those in the homes who created the problems to change their ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other way we will achieve this is through the reintroduction of JPET&mdash;the job placement, employment and training program&mdash;which will provide targeted assistance to homeless and disadvantaged young people who are looking for work or are wanting to continue or re&hyphen;enter full&hyphen;time education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I will make some general comments on Labor's record on education. The member for Sydney made some general comments in his speech about how the coalition was basically striking at the heart of access to higher education by young people. The hypocrisy of the Labor Party is extraordinary in this term of government. They come into this House time and time again to debate education bills&mdash;the member for Port Adelaide does it regularly; this is the fourth time I have had to follow him in a debate and had to point out the errors of his ways and he unfortunately still has not learnt from any of my contributions&mdash;trying to wear the clothes of the student activist, the student advocate, when for 13 years the Labor Party undermined, betrayed and slapped in the face the National Union of Students, which they were supposed to be aligned with and supposed to represent. Time and time again they came in here and hypocritically changed higher education in a way that affected students.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many examples, such as the introduction of HECS which they promised they would not do before the election but they introduced immediately after the election. They promised again that they would not increase HECS for current students and they increased it three times in one parliament. They introduced full fees for postgraduate students, they reduced per capita funding per student and they widened the gap between the rich and the poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, while I have more things to say and I am sure the Labor members would like to learn as much as they can about higher education from me, time does not permit me to continue. I commend these regulations to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

That assumption or convention that the Leader of the House is undertaking almost continuously is not only offensive but also does not help the better workings of the House.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QT4">Mr FILING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is unusual, because their happiness is not being radiated around the House. Certainly, the happiness is not being expressed in their verbatim comments about how the new changes to Austudy are being effected. I know that the member for Sturt is a close colleague of Senator Vanstone, and the parliamentary secretary at the table, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), is the poor bunny responsible 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="709"> for fronting the brunt of the wrath of the coalition backbenchers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They, along with me and, I am sure, a number of Labor members, would be receiving countless calls from constituents who are upset, confused and, in some cases, bewildered by the changes that are taking place. In particular, bearing in mind that this does not strictly relate to the changes to the assets and income test relating to Austudy, the totality of these changes, which were effected some time ago, is causing a considerable amount of angst amongst the very people who elected the coalition government. In other words, their core constituency is angry about these particular measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just wanted to point out something that my colleague the member Oxley (Ms Hanson) pointed out. When you look at the range of pre&hyphen;tax income of these people we are talking about, and we have to bear in mind that these people are raising, in many cases, two, three or four children, we find that it cuts in at $23,000 per annum and then cuts out completely at $35,000 per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition knows this. When I was part of the coalition, I was part of the discussions that took place in relation to the income levels that are necessary in order to properly raise, educate, feed and clothe a family. When you consider the high rates of tax, the superannuation contributions, the Medicare levy, the private health insurance contributions, the clothing costs, and so on, and the fact that a 22&hyphen;year&hyphen;old is now obliged to be considered to be dependent for the purposes of Austudy, you can understand the tremendous financial constraints that these families would be under. These are the core coalition constituency groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the backbench are upset about this because they recognise that these are the very same people who elected the coalition to power. Those backbenchers who are on knife edge margins are starting to sweat because there is talk of a double dissolution this year in order for the government to achieve a majority in the Senate. Those backbenchers are starting to perhaps consider that their time might be coming because of some of the changes that have been effected.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes have been effected in a way that is not consistent. As the parliamentary secretary did not quite say, they are not consistent with the policy as expressed by the coalition prior to the election or, as the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) pointed out, the strong views held by significant members of the coalition when they signed off on the Price report on Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the consistent complaints from my constituents is that it is easier to go on the dole than to stick around and study. We have this ludicrous situation in this country of people wanting to educate themselves but, because of their financial circumstances, because of the combination of the tests for Austudy, it being easier for them to go on the dole and sit and watch television or to drop their ambition of being able to study and qualify themselves to not only make this country a smarter country but also put ourselves in a position to be able to compete with our neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to realise that, in these particular regulations that the member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin) has sought to have disallowed, one ought to differentiate between the two measures. I want to particularly deal with the question of the qualifying age for Austudy or the age threshold for consideration as independent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the problems in any family relationship is that after 22, or for that matter before 22, what happens in the case where, for instance, the siblings are estranged from their parents? In other words, they cannot get on or there are some particular problems in their relationship that makes it difficult for them to be considered to be dependent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also in my electorate I have had a number of complaints in relation to the application of these tests. For example, a 22-year-old constituent contacted me because he has been refused Austudy to support him during his surveying and mine engineering course. He has been self&hyphen;sufficient from his parents for three years, although he boards with them at a cost of $200 per month&mdash;and $200 per month is a fairly sizeable outgoing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are unable to support him due to significant costs related to their mortgage and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="710"> their other children, but he has been refused Austudy on the basis of their income even though he has no access to it and they are no longer responsible for him legally or otherwise. He works one day a week as this is all his curriculum will allow. Ironically, if he had registered for unemployment for the six months prior to taking his course, he may have been eligible for Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, we have this strange set of circumstances. The member for Sydney, unfortunately, smiles too early because this concoction has arrived at this point thanks also to a number of measures that were undertaken during the period of the Labor government.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, may I make a couple of other comments. What the member for Sturt said in his speech is a little hard to understand. I am still unable to understand where the 25 years comes from. He says it comes from the Labor Party's measures from 1974 and 1987. I was a member of backbench committees in the coalition and, if that were the case, I would be absolutely appalled. If it is, it is purely and simply cynically political. There is no justification other than `you can get away with it because the Labor Party did it before'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at it in reality. People who are 18 years old are able to vote, presumably are able to go and fight for their countries, and are able to go and get a jobsearch allowance. You have a situation where there is now a notional age of independence at 25, and I think that flies in the face of the philosophy of the coalition. Back in the time when I was a member of the coalition, those of us who believe in trying to break the question of dependence considered that people ought to be more independent at an earlier age. In particular, where families are unable, effectively, to support a tertiary student on what are quite low incomes and where there is a cutting off or a withdrawal of Austudy, that has to be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of homeless youth, a matter raised by the member for Port Adelaide, is a vexed question. I was a policeman for nine years. I had a lot of dealings with kids who were homeless on the streets in Perth. It is one of those things that you cannot just keep throwing money at. The coalition, in talking about the money it is expending on homeless youth, is also falling into a similar trap, although I suspect that it is probably trying desperately to appear to be all things to all people on this particular point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make an observation. There have been some interesting studies done by some of the non&hyphen;government service providers on the reasons why some of the kids are homeless and out on the streets. An interesting facet of the studies I have seen is that, in many instances, they are on the streets because they want to be, because in actual fact they are trying to get a more libertarian lifestyle away from their parents at an earlier 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="711"> age. Certainly, many of the kids I dealt with when I was a policeman who were homeless on the streets of Perth you could not take back home because they did not want to go back home&mdash;not because they were being abused, belted up, or whatever, but because they wanted to be out on the street effectively availing themselves of things they wanted to do, including sex, drugs and alcohol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am just saying that on that score it is a mistake to merely quote the amount of money that is being thrown at it. I have had some first-hand experience and, I might say, am very close to some of the non-government service providers. In particular, I have looked at some of the studies they have done amongst the very people we are talking about. I think there is a trap in just merely assuming that throwing money at it is going to solve it. That was 13 years of false thinking on the part of the previous Labor administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will stick to my commitment to the parliamentary secretary and finish, but I will say that, in the totality of the changes to Austudy, I hope the government is going to think again. I know its backbench is smarting. I know the hotlines are running red hot. I can well understand the parliamentary secretary being more than keen to see all the problems of Austudy blown away so the government can get on with other things.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Productivity Commission Bill 1996 is one of the most important pieces of legislation to come before the parliament this session. It is this legislation that gives effect to the amalgamation of several statutory economic advisory bodies to create one powerful, singular source of economic advice to the federal government. The Industry Commission, the Bureau of Industry Economics and the Economic Planning Advisory Council are the advisory bodies which will be amalgamated to form the new Productivity Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is critically important to Australia's overall future economic development that the federal government of the day, of whatever political persuasion, not only has access to the best quality economic advice but can call upon a diversity of advice and opinion from within its own bureaucracy when making the momentous economic decisions it is called upon to make in the interests of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the federal government, through its fiscal policy framework, that can exert great influence over the living standards of all Australians. It is the federal government, through its monetary policy framework, that influences the cost of finance to businesses and households throughout Australia. It is therefore with considerable concern that I note in this bill that the government has centralised the source of independent economic advice from within its own bureaucracy into one body, the Productivity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are very real dangers to government and indeed to the Australian community in this centralisation of economic advice. Quality economic outcomes for the nation can only come from quality economic advice delivered professionally from a variety of sources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Economics is not an exact science, and practitioners often bear the brunt of the cruelest jokes in a professional sense. It is a discipline open to varied interpretations of the variables in that discipline. Indeed, we have witnessed over the past couple of days in the House during the debate on the charter of budget honesty government ministers and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="713"> members distorting economic reality in a most deceitful manner for their own political ends. I refer also to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of Monday, 10 February, when the Treasurer (Mr Costello), in an answer in question time, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the policy of this government to throw away the failure of 13 years of Labor . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As we have said, you cannot turn around 13 years of failure in 11 months but this government has made a start on those problems . . . </PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The chief economic officer in the nation was handed an economy that had grown at four per cent over the last four years. The previous government broke the back of inflation and passed on a low inflation regime to the coalition; it left interest rates in single digits and an economy with industrial disputation at the lowest level it had been for years and an unemployment rate coming down. If you like, a golden egg was left to the coalition. And the chief economic officer in the nation regards that as a failure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer's remarks in question time demonstrate the point I am making&mdash;that is, the importance of obtaining a range of economic advice for the chief economic officer in this country. Given the Treasurer's appalling lack of understanding of economic fundamentals, it is really a double imperative that he get a breadth of economic advice to input into his decision making and that input should come from a variety of sources from within his own bureaucracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This debate on the Productivity Commission Bill is timely because, as I speak in this House today, the Industry Commission cum the Productivity Commission is considering the future of key manufacturing industries that form the backbone of Geelong's regional economy. The Industry Commission recently published its draft report on the automotive industry in Australia, and it is currently taking public submissions for its inquiry into the textile, clothing and footwear manufacturing industries in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of these industries, it is estimated, employ around 7,000 people directly in the Geelong region. Many more people employed in small businesses throughout the region depend on the income flows in the communi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ty that are generated by those employed in these key industries in the city.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, the economic future of the region is inextricably linked to the immediate future of car and component manufacturing and textile, clothing and footwear manufacturing in Geelong. Further dramatic falls in employment in these industries would have a devastating flow&hyphen;on effect on other businesses in the area and the overall employment levels in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, it is with absolute and utter dismay that I continue to read and hear that the member for Corangamite, Mr Stewart McArthur, who is in the House today, is continuing to advocate in this place the zero tariff policy for these industries of the discredited Fightback policy platform. That Fightback policy platform was soundly rejected by the people of Geelong in 1993 and again in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I listened with deep concern to the contribution that was made by the honourable member for Corangamite in the debate last night. The contribution that he made demonstrated once again how remote he is from the hopes, aspirations and concerns of workers in car and component manufacturing and textile, clothing and footwear manufacturing in Geelong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Corangamite mounted his usual theoretical defence of free market economics and laissez&hyphen;faire economic systems, and he left us in no doubt last night&mdash;as well as in other places and forums&mdash;about his commitment and dedication to economic rationalism. Perhaps he might tell the 450 ASTAAS workers recently made redundant in Geelong because of the withdrawal of financial support by the federal government about the great benefits of that economic rationalist approach to government intervention and economic activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the member for Corangamite might like to take himself down to Godfrey Hirst and talk to the management about the level playing field in that free enterprise mecca in the United States of America. I think they could tell him a thing or two about the difficulty they have had in accessing that particular market.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="714">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the doors close on Godfrey Hirst, I suggest the honourable member stand outside the factory gate as the redundant workers file out and give them copies of his speech lauding the great benefits of laissez&hyphen;faire capitalism. It would make good bedtime reading for the children of those redundant workers who will go without because their parents have lost their jobs in these industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not intend to engage in theoretical economic debate on a discredited economic philosophy which is, as we know, the magnificent obsession of the member for Corangamite. I am more interested in expressing on the floor of this House the concerns of the workers in the industries of car and component manufacturing and textile, clothing and footwear manufacturing in Geelong about the Industry Commission reports and where the government might take them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Down in Geelong, the member for Corangamite is affectionately known as Captain Zero&mdash;the man who would sacrifice the economic future of Geelong on the altar of zero tariffs. He is known as a man who, in his blind economic prejudice, is prepared to put the livelihoods of around 7,000 workers and their families at risk in our area and condemn the Geelong region to another decade of economic deprivation and struggle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Corangamite drives into Geelong from his farm in the western district, let him contemplate the devastation that might flow from the policies that he is advocating on the floor of this House. What the Geelong community wants to know is when the member for Corangamite is going to stand up in this place and represent the interests of the community that forms an important part of his electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many car workers and textile workers who live on the other side of the Barwon River and who are very concerned that the member for Corangamite is selling them out in this place and in this debate. They are naturally anxious to know when the member for Corangamite is going to heed the concerns of local manufacturers about their future or when he will listen to the pleadings of local businesses, unions and community leaders on the impact the substantial job 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> losses in these industries will have on the region. The member for Corangamite is hopelessly out of touch and isolated in the Geelong community on this issue. However, he is also isolated in his own caucus, which is badly divided on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note with interest a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> article on Wednesday, 6 November in which the views of the Liberal member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes) in South Australia were expressed.

<PARA STYLE="Para">I congratulate the member for Kingston on her views on this issue because those she has raised mirror my own views which have been expressed on the floor of this House in grievance debates and in my own submission to the Industry Commission on the automotive inquiry currently under way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the people in Geelong are asking why, if the Liberal member for Kingston can stick up for the car industry in her electorate, the member for Corangamite cannot come into this place, stand on the floor of this House and stick up for car workers, component workers and textile, clothing and footwear workers in Geelong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact is that the member for Corangamite is isolated in the Geelong community on this issue. There are deep divisions within his own caucus ranks on the tariff issue, and I urge him today to recant, re&hyphen;think and abandon the commitment he has articulated to economic rationalism, the level playing field and zero tariffs.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="715">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Labor took office in 1983, it inherited an economy in a shambles, an economy with over 10 per cent unemployment, 10 per cent inflation, low growth, double&hyphen;digit interest rates and an economy structurally unfit for the challenges of the 1980s and 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor inherited an automotive industry that was racked by industrial division; it was an inward looking uncompetitive industry with no capacity for exports and a management comfortable behind a protection wall of 57 per cent with little or no incentive to invest in new capital equipment or labour retraining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In government we changed all that, knowing that a radical restructuring was necessary to preserve at least some substantial levels of employment as the industry faced its new global challenges. Labor ushered in a new era of industrial cooperation in the car industry in Geelong and elsewhere. We provided huge incentives to companies to invest in new capital equipment and in the skills of their work force. Labor encouraged the industry to innovate, to unleash its creative talents and to enter export markets with confidence in its competitive position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The results have been staggering, and the gains to the national economy have been substantial. Australia's car industry is now internationally competitive, with high productivity, good export performance with the production of quality cars and a commitment from the industry to invest to maintain its competitive position. I pay tribute to the work force in Geelong and elsewhere which has played its role in ushering in this new era of competitiveness for the car industry.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, it was under Labor's policies that the jobs of car and component industry workers and the jobs of clothing, textile and footwear workers in Geelong have been secured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of the Geelong region know very clearly the differing views of me as the member for Corio and of the member for Corangamite on this and other issues. I am on the public record calling on the federal government to reject the IC report and to hold tariff levels at 15 per cent beyond the year 2000 until Australian manufacturers can gain reasonable access to overseas markets that are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> currently denied them. The member for Corangamite, in contrast, wants to drive the tariff levels down further to zero per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am on the public record supporting the export assistance programs used by local car and textile, clothing and footwear companies to boost their export performance. The member for Corangamite is on the public record supporting the slashing of these programs. I am on the public record supporting a continuation of the labour market programs that have delivered significant productivity gains to Ford and Godfrey Hirst in my electorate. The member for Corangamite, on the other hand, is on the public record supporting the emasculation of the programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am on the public record supporting the maintenance of the 150 per cent R&amp;D incentive for companies such as Ford and Henderson Springs in my electorate, whose research capacity is now in danger because of this government's budgetary actions. The member for Corangamite is on the public record supporting the budget position in slashing these concessions. Let the Geelong community be in no doubt as to the massive differences between the Labor and Liberal parliamentary representatives from the region on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Geelong community is mobilising itself to oppose the recommendations of the Industry Commission which may devastate the region. I urge citizens to sign the community petition being circulated by my colleague the state member for Geelong North, Mr Peter Loney, and I congratulate him for his hard work in circulating this petition throughout the length and breadth of the electorate. I congratulate him also on the support that he is getting from the car workers in the north of Geelong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also urge citizens to attend the public rally at Rippleside Park on 21 February to protest against the Industry Commission recommendations. I pass on my congratulations to the Secretary of the Geelong Trades Hall, John Kranz, and to the Mayor of Geelong, Councillor Gerry Smith, who have thrown their collective weight behind this rally. We are hoping for a massive turnout to that rally.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="716">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own submission to the Industry Commission I put some very simple propositions that I think will demonstrate a clear commitment by government to the preservation of a strong, viable, productive, export orientated industry in Australia. I have recommended a pause in tariff reductions at the year 2000. I have proposed action by government in the forthcoming budget to stimulate the demand for cars by lowering the sales tax on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have suggested action to restore the range of research and development and export incentives abolished in the 1996 budget. I have advocated restoration of the labour market programs that have assisted auto manufacturing and textile and clothing manufacturing in my electorate. I have proposed greater action to improve the overall age of the Australian car park.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let there be no doubt about the future directions of industry policy in 1996 under a new Labor government. That policy has been outlined by the shadow minister for industry, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), on several occasions. In September 1996, he said this at a conference in Queensland about the future directions of Labor policy:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">You cannot get a clearer commitment to the manufacturing sector than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, let me say that the member for Corangamite is prepared to come into this House and sell out the 7,000 Geelong car and component workers and the workers in the textile, clothing and footwear industries. That is something that I will not do on the floor of this House. The member for Corangamite's view is a cynical betrayal of the Geelong region. I will make sure that every car worker, every component worker and every textile, clothing and footwear worker has access to the speech that he made on the floor of this parliament last night.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The bills before this House are bad policy. They will lead to further bad policy. They are bad policy because they reduce the sources of advice that go to government and they narrow the range and focus of that advice. I have said previously in this place that one of the great strengths of the Commonwealth system and Australian national government is the strength which comes from the diversity of views and the scrutiny of those views. As we all play our part in the search for better public policy, the diversity and scrutiny of views and independent, professional and fearless advice help lead the way in our endeavours to make better public policy decisions. Why these bills are so wrong and such bad policy and will lead to further bad policy is that they reduce the sources and diversity of advice to government. The provisions of the bill ensure that the focus and range of advice will be narrowed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What these bills do is essentially roll three separate forms of advice into one. The Industry Commission, responsible to the Treasury portfolio, the Bureau of Industry Economics, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="717"> responsible to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, and EPAC, the Economic Planning and Advisory Council, responsible to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, will be all rolled into one. We might just as well have rolled ABARE into them as well. Why not knock off the research bureau for our primary industries and energy portfolio as well, if that is the approach you wish to take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key component in this range of measures is to effectively roll those three bodies into one and change the name of the Industry Commission to the Productivity Commission. The Industry Commission has a long history in the development of public policy in Australia. When you track back its history, you will find that the Industry Commission was previously known as the Industries Assistance Commission and,  before that, as the Tariff Board. What we have seen in the history of, firstly, the Tariff Board and, ultimately, the Industry Commission and now the proposed Productivity Commission is the provision of independent advice to government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not always so, of course, that the Tariff Board provided, or was allowed to provide, independent advice to government. This is not the first time in history that we have seen a coalition government seek to nobble either the range or sources of advice to it. I will make some comments in respect of the former Minister for Trade, Mr McEwen, and the Tariff Board in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very impressed with the speech by the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor), in which he comprehensively skinned the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur).</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> involved in the Tariff Board and the Industry Commission. He referred in his contribution to the book by Alf Rattigan on the Tariff Board called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Inside Story</EMPHASIS>. As part of my holiday reading, I read the biography on McEwen, which makes some interesting comments along similar lines. I will bring the House to them later.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5V5">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My point in referring to McEwen is not to take up the invitation of the minister at the table to come across but to ask the question, `Where is the National Party in this debate?' McEwen would be rolling in this grave at the craven way in which the National Party has allowed a Liberal Treasurer to skin them in this area. I will come to that shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dangers of these bills and the way in which the diversity of advice and the focus of advice to government will be reduced could be no more clearly set out than in the provisions of the bill itself and in the terms of the amendment to the second reading, which has been moved by the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans). When one turns to clause 6, part 2, of the Productivity Commission Bill, one's attention is drawn to the sorts of issues which the proposed Productivity Commission is asked to take note of. Reference is made to `the productivity performance of industry or of the economy as a whole' and `any factor that affects or might affect productivity performance, including labour market practices'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In subclause 8(a) there is an express requirement that `the commission must have regard to the desire of the Commonwealth government to improve the overall economic performance of the economy through higher productivity'. Subclause 8(b) says `to facilitate adjustment to structural changes in the economy and to ease social and economic hardships arising from those changes'. Subclause 8(c) says `to reduce regulation of industry'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All these provisions are consistent with the approach to industry policy we have seen this government take since it came to office. That those provisions are so narrow is highlighted 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="718"> by the provisions of the amendment moved by the member for Holt. The amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) expresses its concern at the monopolisation of economic advice under the Treasury portfolio . . . the disappearance of independent sources of economic and industry policy advice to the Prime Minister and to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On the basis of what we have seen to date, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) certainly needs some independent advice because at the moment, so far as industry policy is concerned, more means less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every time the minister for industry has a loss around the cabinet table, he issues a press release or makes a public comment to the effect, `I could have lost more, therefore it is a victory.' It is certainly the case that the minister requires more advice in the industry policy area, not less&mdash;certainly not the domination of advice on the industry and economic area by Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of the amendment refers to concern about the centralising of economic industry policy advice under one minister, the Treasurer. The third part of the amendment refers to the need for the commission to take into account not only Australia's international obligations but also the progress made by Australia's trading partners in reducing both tariff and non-tariff barriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, the amendment refers to the need for the commission to have regard to regional development and employment consequences. All those provisions would have the effect of widening the view of the proposed Productivity Commission, of increasing the diversity of view that would go to government and of putting government in a better position to make economic and industry policy decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why these bills, which represent such bad policy, would lead to even further bad policy is reflected by the decisions the government has already made since it came to office. We have seen a massively reduced focus on industry policy, a massively reduced level of importance given to the industry policy area.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has been no better expressed than by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). On 19 December on ABC's Radio National, in response to the statement by Pru Goward that business is complaining there is no industry policy, the Prime  Minister responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, there is. I mean industry policy is low inflation, low interest rates, industrial relations reform, other microeconomic reform. There is a debate, the debate is about the extent to which Government should specifically intervene to support particular industries . . . So it really is about the extent to which you specifically intervene and give a nudge in a particular direction. That's what the debate about industry policy is about. So it's a pretty limited debate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We hear the Prime Minister express his view that the area of industry policy is a very narrow and very limited area. That is not the view we take on this side of the House. Before me the member for Corio outlined to the House the statements that the shadow minister for industry, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), has been making consistently in the course of the last nine months or so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this side of the House, we take the view that it is very important for the Commonwealth to have an active industry policy. It is very important for the Commonwealth to take the view that one of the arms of public policy is an active and an interventionist industry policy. Of course, the effect of these bills will be to reduce one important source of forming views about industry policy, and that, of course, is the Bureau of Industry Economics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decisions the government has made to date reflect the views of the Prime Minister but also reflect the policy domination on the part of people who take the view that there is no role for industry policy, who take the view that the market absolutely should prevail. We have seen these sorts of decisions from the government consistently since it came to office. We have seen, for example, the massive gutting or abolition&mdash;most of it in breach of election commitments&mdash;of a whole range of industry and trade enhancement measures, all of which are aimed at increasing our export performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen in the recent release of the midyear review that the government's own figures make the point that the net contribu 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="719"> tion of exports to growth in GDP is estimated, on the government's own forecast, to be a negative contribution for 1996-97 and a negative contribution for 1997-98. So, at a point in the cycle where the government's own analysis and the government's own forecasts show that exports will make a net negative contribution to growth in GDP, and therefore a net negative contribution to jobs, the government is gutting or abolishing the trade and industry enhancement programs that have been put in place previously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">EMDG, gutted by $426 million over four years; research and development, reduced by $2 billion; Austrade, gutted by $90 million on a recurrent basis. In industry bounty areas we have seen the effective abolition of a range of bounty measures&mdash;whether it is in shipbuilding, which is now almost exclusively an export industry in Australia, computers, robotics or book bounties. All of these measures have been implemented by the government, consistent with the philosophy expressed by the Prime Minister that there is effectively no role for industry policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The narrowing of the focus of advice, the abolition of the Bureau of Industry Economics, the rolling in of the Economic Planning and Advisory Council into the Industry Commission and renaming it the Productivity Commission, with those narrow terms of reference that I have outlined to the House, will only have the effect of increasing that trend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To enhance that point, the Industry Commission recently released a paper entitled `The changing of Australian manufacturing'. That paper stated the view of the Industry Commission:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there was no basis for providing selective government assistance to the manufacturing sector.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is not the view that some people take when they look at some of the work done by the Bureau of Industry Economics. The rolling in of these three sources of advice, the narrowing of the focus of these sources of advice and further consolidating the dominance of Treasury in this area will have the effect of continuing bad public policy decisions in this area.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note in the brief put out by the library on this bill an interesting quote about the Industry Commission. The library material says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Industry Commission has a long history, as the Industry Assistance Commission before 1990, and before 1973 the Tariff Board. Since the early 1960s it has had a reputation for giving consistent anti&hyphen;protection, anti&hyphen;government and free market advice. Its critics allege that the IC's work often reflect its bias rather than being the outcome of well&hyphen;reasoned analysis.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On some occasions I have seen the Industry Commission referred to as the `Industry Abolition Commission'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I take up here is in respect of fearless and independent advice. With the Tariff Board it was not always so, and the member for Corangamite referred to Alf Rattigan's book on the insider's view of the Tariff Board. In Peter Golding's book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Black Jack McEwen</EMPHASIS>, you find reference to the sort of attitude which McEwen took to the Tariff Board in its early days. At pages 215 and 216 of that book, we find comments from Bill Carmichael, who became a member of the Tariff Board in 1960. Carmichael made some points which confirm the comments Rattigan made in his book which the member for Corangamite referred to. Carmichael is quoted by Golding as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The board was operating in a fairly ad hoc way. It lacked any consistent framework. It was reacting to references by the minister or principally originating from his department and they were all requests for increases in assistance. The whole environment and the practice of the board up until then&mdash;and the expectation of it&mdash;was that its work would result in increases in protection. It was concerned with providing protection to Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then Carmichael says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But it also had in its charter responsibility for doing this in the context of advancing national economic welfare. It was this second larger, broader focus that had been ignored. The practice was that the board was a fairly submissive institution . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A `fairly submissive institution'. Carmichael goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principle of independent advice was what was behind the establishment of the Tariff Board and if the public expectation of the institution was that it should provide advice at arm's length but in fact was receiving a wink and a nod about what advice would be acceptable then it was simply being used 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="720"> to keep the public in the dark and was a tame institution.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We see in the course of the book an entire chapter devoted to the dispute between Rattigan and McEwen, under the title `Rattigan, the "manageable", just isn't so', where the Tariff Board established its reputation ultimately for giving independent advice. The point to be made here is that that was one occasion where a coalition minister effectively sought to nobble advice in a public policy area. The coalition government here is doing it in a much more grandiose way: by rolling three institutions into one and by substantially narrowing the terms of the advice that would be available to government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed that the member for Corio in the course of his contribution referred to views held by the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes) which were entirely inconsistent with the views expressed by the member for Corangamite in respect of tariffs in the car industry. The member for Corio referred to an article that the member for Kingston had written in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> at the end of last year or early this year. I must say I was much more interested in a report in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> which contained an article by Mrs Gallus, the member for Hindmarsh. I will leave it to the member for Corio to home in on the inconsistencies on the question of tariffs in the car industry that the member for Hindmarsh has with the member for Corangamite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was particularly interested in the general comments that the member for Hindmarsh had to make about the Productivity Commission. In the course of her article, which is on the opinion page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, page 15, the member for Hindmarsh said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is within the Commission an almost religious conviction . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Being religious about public policy views is not the sort of approach that a fearless, independent and professional statutory authority ought to bring. Religious convictions are for members of parliament and ministers to hold when they have considered a vast array of information and advice to them. The member for Hindmarsh goes on to say:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What standard of reports should we expect from the Productivity Commission?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She talks about objectivity and says that `it has not shown this objectivity' to date. Here we have the member for Hindmarsh referring to the Productivity Commission, saying it operates on the basis of religious convictions and saying that it has not shown objectivity in its report. Yet this legislation would have two other independent sources of advice rolled into the Commission so that a religious view expressed by the Commission, a non&hyphen;objective view of the Commission, would become the monopoly source of advice to government in industry and economic areas. The member for Hindmarsh goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we need from the Productivity Commission is an honest analysis . . . The Productivity Commission has misunderstood its role. It is not there to make government policy, but to provide the information on which the government can base policy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On the day in which we see bills debated in this House to abolish the Bureau of Industry Economics, to abolish the Economic Planning Advisory Council, to narrow the sources and range and diversity of economic industry advice to the government we see one of the government's own members writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  that the commission suffers from religious convictions, it is not honest in its advice, it is not objective in its advice and it is taking upon itself the role of making public policy decisions rather than providing the government with honest, independent and fearless advice. I hope that, on the basis of the article she has written today, the member for Hindmarsh will come into this chamber and support the amendment circulated by the member for Holt. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Productivity Commission Bill, on the face of it, gives effect to an election promise that the government made&mdash;one of the few it has kept, I might add. But it is in the application of what we consider this legislation will lead to that we see an insidious agenda on the part of the government. It is for that reason that we are moving amendments both to the second reading and in the consideration of detail stage. The first reason is to give a wider perspective to what the Productivity Commis 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="721"> sion should take into account in arriving at its decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two areas that I am specifically interested in. The first is that if we are expected to compete with the rest of the world, we cannot ignore what the rest of the world is doing to support their industries. There is not a level playing field and even though the Industry Commission, as it still is, recognises that fact it seems to place almost total regard on Australia's obligations and Australia meeting them, and scant regard&mdash;one would argue, none at all&mdash;on the pace of reform on the part of our trading partners. One of the amendments seeks to address that point, that there ought to be a requirement on the part of this body to have regard to what our trading partners do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area it has to have to regard to, quite frankly, is the impact of its decisions on regional Australia. We have this government with all its mock concern about regional Australia, yet it has abolished the regional development office and the regional development program, and we have a minister who still calls himself the minister for regional development whose only act has been to abolish his own department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government talks concern about regions but it does not require this body to have regard to the impact on regions of its decisions and the recommendations it makes. We believe it is essential that it does so, so one of the amendments goes to that point. For all those members who sit on the other side representing regions which returned this government so massively in the last election, to oppose this amendment is again betraying the regions because it requires no more than the fact that the commission have regard to the impact on regions, both in terms of industry development and in terms of jobs. Who could argue against that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point that we are seeking to get from the government as a result of our amendments is the need for there to be an alternative source of advice, rather than just Treasury. I think there is a monopoly now on advice to the government. It is a monopoly contained within the framework of Treasury&mdash;and we know that Treasury is dominated by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the free market ideology. I do not mind there being that rigour in a decision&hyphen;making process but there needs to be an alternative and government has an obligation to provide that alternative. It needs to acquaint itself with views other than those of Treasury and then, in a cabinet room, make wise decisions based on the weighting of the evidence before it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If all you have is the monopoly, how can you make a sensible decision? You are a government that talks about competition but you will not allow the competition of ideas in the cabinet room. If you support competition of ideas, you should be supporting the amendment we are moving that seeks to open up an alternative source of advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst this bill is not yet through the House, the fact is that the Productivity Commission exists in fact and has come out with its first determination. The reality is that the Productivity Commission, which is still called the Industry Commission, is the body that has reported on the Australian automotive industry. It is our concern about what has come forward in this report that underscores the reasons we are seeking amendments in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is not just us who have concerns about the direction the new body will take; those concerns exist in the government's own ranks. We have headline after headline in the last few weeks of ministers in the Howard government expressing concern about the cuts in car tariffs. Senator Hill has talked about decisions in relation to the automotive industry and the textile industry&mdash;the next agenda for the Productivity Commission. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They should not be made on ideological grounds or some ivory tower view which is out of touch with the real world. They will be practical, commonsense decisions based on Australia's national, economic and social interests.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Clearly, he does not think that the Productivity Commission's majority report has had such a regard. We have also got, as the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) has just identified, not just one of the backbench expressing concern&mdash;most notably the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) in an article today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> &mdash;we have a number of other South Australian members as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="722"> well: Susan Jeanes, Chris Pyne, Andrew Southcott, Jeannie Ferris and Trish Worth, to name a few. I am sure that as the debate runs on we will be flushing more out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I am saying to them is that if they have concerns for the future of the car industry in South Australia they should support our amendments, cross the floor and send a message to the government because it is clearly not getting that message in terms of the way the campaign is being run at the moment. We have the concerns of Senator Hill shared by Senator Vanstone. We have those concerns also shared by the Victorian and South Australian premiers, but also it would seem by the minister for industry and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the people that go around in public in interviews and say, `There shouldn't be any further cuts in tariffs without knowing what our trading partners are doing or without regard to what our trading partners are doing.' If they believe it, support the amendments; require the Productivity Commission to take those factors into account. The reality is that there is division on the government side. There is concern about the direction that the Productivity Commission has taken in relation to the automotive industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here now is the opportunity to address that concern and to correct the issues the Productivity Commission takes into account in arriving at its decisions. This is more than delivery on an election promise which said: `We want to get savings, we want to get efficiencies, we want to cut the budget bottom line through rationalisation.' It is more than that because what it provides for is the destruction of an important industry: the automotive industry. It reflects the dominance of Treasury in giving advice to government that essentially argues for cuts in government expenditure, regardless of the consequences. It is a free market ideology that has no regard for the effect on communities. Communities are more than just a marketplace. Communities are people. They are history. They are commitments. They are families. They are social structures. They are not just marketplaces. They have been the lifeblood of the development of this country; regional Austral 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ia has been the lifeblood of this country. They are also our best bet for future potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that the terms of reference that were sent to the Industry Commission in the context of the automotive industry required it to have regard to&mdash;these are weasel words&mdash;`the regional development objectives of the government'. How can the government have regional development objectives when it has abolished its regional development department and when it says there is no constitutional role for the Commonwealth in regional development? It is pretty easy to be dismissive of the government's regional development objectives because it hasn't got any.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the face of it, you would think there would be a requirement to have regard to the impact of changes in the automotive plan on regional Australia. But scant regard is paid to that by the majority report. The only person who addresses it is Mr Ian Webber in his minority report. He expresses grave concern about the impact that the implementation of the majority recommendations, the cuts to tariffs, the end to the export facilitation scheme and the like will have on regional Australia. All I am saying is that, if the government is concerned about the impact on regional Australia, they should write it properly into the charter. That is what we are urging be done by way of the amendment we are putting forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that development of our regions will occur only if we have an effective industry policy. The majority report does not provide a sound basis for future investment into the automotive industry. Indeed, if you listened to Mr Scales defending that report on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Sunday</EMPHASIS> on the Nine Network as recently as last Sunday, he sees this as a launching pad for the introduction of a GST. We give the commission the obligation to look into the future of the automotive industry and he sees it as a launching pad for a GST. Where are these instructions coming from? That is why you need alternative advice. That is why you need to give specific terms of reference and require in the legislative charter for this body to stick to its obligations, to have regard to the impact of tariff changes in the rest of the world and to have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="723"> regard to the impact of its decisions on regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact will be huge on the car industry, especially in Victoria and South Australia. I see the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) in the chamber now. She has expressed concern about the direction of this report. She is in that group rejecting the report. I say to the member: if your concern is that they do not have regard to what our trading partners are doing, and if your concern is that they have not had proper regard to the impact on regional South Australia, then support our amendments. Join us on this side of the House when we put them before the chamber and vote with us. Don't just go around expressing your concerns in the media: support it in the place that matters&mdash;the people's chamber. Make sure it gets locked into legislation. Have the courage of your convictions and side with us in implementing the amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Productivity Commission report actually gives a tick to Labor's car plan. It actually says the export facilitation scheme was a great initiative in getting our car industry, both vehicles and automotive components, into the international marketplace. But then it recommends we end it. It says that the car plan is successful but we should finish it; the export facilitation scheme is a great initiative but we should not continue it. What sort of logic is that? We have them looking at the circumstances that have seen the growth of this industry&mdash;the entrenching of important initiatives and expansion in areas such as South Australia&mdash;and yet they argue for an end to the export facilitation scheme and to the unilateral disarmament on tariffs. Keep cutting tariffs here, regardless of what our trading partners will do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the other countries should be obliged to honour their obligations under the tariff reduction regime. Australia has led the way. Having argued for so long and having positioned ourselves for so long, it would be crazy to move away from that discipline. And we should not be moving alone. If there is a requirement for us to meet our obligations, so too must there be such a requirement for our trading partners.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is, we do not have a strategy for the future of the automotive industry in this report; we have ideology. That is why it has to be rejected. That is why there are so many members on the government side of this chamber rejecting the recommendations of the report. If, in fact, there is rejection of it because it has not had proper regard to what this country needs, then let us correct it. Let us correct the basis upon which it gets its charter. Let us amend the legislation that gives it the power to simply keep reporting ideology rather than reality. That is what the thrust of our amendments involves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor is committed to a more interventionist, a more active industry policy. It is one that we have argued for and it is one that is supported by many sections of the Australian community, most recently by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which has actually been a very strong supporter of the government in most of the decisions it has taken but which has come out recently and said, `Reverse the decisions that cut research and development in this country.' It has come out and said it supports a sectoral approach to industry policy and it has called for the government to implement and develop a more competitive industry policy. We are arguing for just that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These supports for industry are not welfare measures, as the Treasurer (Mr Costello) would cast them&mdash;he believes that any assistance to industry is business welfare&mdash;but they are not. They are investments in our future. They recognise that there are market failures. They recognise that there is not a level playing field and they recognise that, if we are to get industry developed in this country, then there needs to be a partnership with government to achieve it. The reality is we will not get unemployment down in this country unless we get economic growth at better than four per cent. This government has set its targets as low as three to 3&half; per cent. No wonder it will not make any progress in unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did make progress in getting unemployment down in our last three years. Why? Because we had economic growth averaging 4.2 per cent. This government has come to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="724"> power and, through decisions taken in the budget, has ground that growth back to 3&half; per cent at best and I would suggest, when the figures come out, probably a damn sight less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will not get unemployment down in this country unless you get economic growth going, you will not get economic growth going without an industry policy and you will not get an industry policy if your sole source of advice is the new Productivity Commission because it does not believe in it. It does not believe in government in partnership intervening to help industries grow. But Labor does and we will continue to argue for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that government needs to develop a strategy that goes beyond the term of one government. It needs to put in place an industry policy that is transparent and understood by those who would seek to invest in this country. It needs to be an approach similar to&mdash;but developed for the Australian context&mdash;that so successfully embraced in Japan in the MITI model, a bipartisan approach on industry policy to provide business with a secure policy framework transcending the electoral process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is needed is this alternative source of advice to counter the ideological claptrap that surrounds the Treasurer and his department. We need a long&hyphen;term industry policy. I am on the record in this chamber spelling out what that policy involves. It is something that needs to go beyond the next election but it cannot be done unless you establish an alternative source of advice, unless you go beyond the monopoly power of Treasury and the Treasurer in taking submissions to cabinet as to what the future of the industry will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it will be an interesting tussle to see how the government resolves its dilemma on tariffs and the future of the car industry. Tariff is not the only component. Tariff is about stopping or limiting imports. That is an important part, but it is not the vital part of what has been more successful with the car plan, that is, expanding exports. The objective has to be to get net export growth. It has to be to provide expansion in the industry recognising that the marketplace is out there in the region, not just here in Australia. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Unless you have a strategy that fosters it, unless you have the industry support that recognises that there is not a level playing field, it is not going to happen. If we are serious about ensuring that we have a body of advice coming forward, the amendments should be supported. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am overwhelmed that so many government members entered the chamber on the occasion of my speech in the debate on this most important matter&mdash;the Productivity Commission Bill. As many members have said, this bill formulates at law the amalgamation of the Industry Commission, the Economic Planning and Advisory Council and the Bureau of Industry Economics. I say at law because clearly this amalgamation has already been achieved in reality. It is somewhat farcical that the Productivity Commission has been issuing reports, most notably its 240&hyphen;page report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stocktake of progress in microeconomic reform</EMPHASIS>  which was released as late as June last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the accompanying press release, on the occasion of the release of that document, the commission had many fine things to say. It said, among other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Microeconomic reform is crucial to future living standards in Australia. Some major reforms have already been introduced but a substantial reform task lies ahead.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The commission's press release goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The stocktake report finds that the most pressing needs for reform are in:</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reforms in these areas are needed to create an adaptable and innovative economy; that can flourish amid rapid global change.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They are fine words but, to my way of thinking, the Productivity Commission is full of little else but fine words. That is typical of the sorts of statements that it has gained a reputation for releasing. It is my understanding that the Productivity Commission costs 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="725"> something like twice as much to run as something like the Industrial Relations Commission, which is far more productive in its own right in benefits to the economy than perhaps the inaptly titled Productivity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have with the Productivity Commission is a monolithic advisory body which reports to government on both industry and productivity matters. Those opposite are hell bent on notions of competition, yet simultaneously seek to thwart any notion of competition in the kind of advice being given to government which those of us on this side of the House say ought to be from a range of sources, not from one monolithic advisory body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new commission, which is an amalgamation of three former instrumentalities, will also receive additional responsibility in the areas of labour market reform and competition policy. My personal view is that this bill should not proceed. This monolithic body should not be formed at law, even though it has already been formed in an administrative sense. I understand that in reality this is not about to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those of us on this side of the House contend that sound economic management requires a variety of credible sources of advice to government, not just advice from one source. We are equally concerned that the advice that will be forthcoming, as was quite lucidly submitted by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) in his speech, will be all too concentrated for the good of both the government and the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To that end, Labor pursued a competitive advice model to ensure that all sides of the debate would be considered. Indeed, one of the underlying thrusts of the amendments that we are proposing seeks to restore some competitive basis for the kind of advice that is proffered to the government. Any such notions of competitive advice are being dismantled by the government. We remain concerned that this will lead the government to pursue even more inappropriate economic and energy policies than those that it is currently pursuing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the issues mentioned in the stocktake report, which I have previously alluded to, such as a further cut in general tariffs from 1 July this year from five per cent to three per cent, the complete abolition of the sugar tariff, the review of all limits on foreign investment where the government has a view of relaxing strictions and the termination of export assistance like the DIFF scheme and the export market development grants scheme, are energy policy matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The further concentration of advice will increase the weight of Treasury views in the agenda of this government. Whilst these views should be considered, they should be debated in the environment of the range of options and alternatives that exist. Clearly, this will not happen given the concentration of advice in a monolithic body that this bill will formalise the creation of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government loves competition, but it is thwarting competition in the advice that it reasonably ought to be receiving from a range of sources if it is to run the economy in a far more effective way than it has been to date. The work program of the new commission will be largely determined by Treasury. Given the congruence of ideology of both Treasury and the Productivity Commission, the economic perspective presented will be extremely narrow. Those two bodies have views on the economy which are markedly similar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hotham also mentioned that the opposition is not opposed to the Treasury, nor is it opposed to the agencies within the Treasury portfolio. Rather, we would submit that what is required is a plurality of advice emanating from a diverse range of sources&mdash;quite literally, a competitive model for the provision of all kinds of economic based advice to this government. The fact that there is not a monopoly of wisdom within the Treasury portfolio and, therefore, all the advice should not be concentrated within that portfolio is apparent to those on this side of the House but, unfortunately, not so apparent to those on the other side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have some concerns with this legislation. The first of these concerns is, as I have put, the dismantling of the system of compet 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="726"> ing sources of advice established by Labor while in government. To that end, this legislation further isolates and ostracises the contributions of other departments&mdash;most notably Industry, Science and Tourism&mdash;in the overall context of the Australian economic debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new commission will, to a considerable degree, reflect both the personnel and the practices of the former Industry Commission. Previous experience with the IC has demonstrated that it has an extreme reluctance to take note of those views which do not coincide with, nor adhere somewhat rigidly to, its own predetermined views. Those submissions and public hearings are essentially a sham, a farce. For instance, where draft reports have been issued, there has rarely been any substantial change in the recommendations in the final report regardless of the weight, the cogency and the factual content of the responses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industry Commission is, therefore, quite legitimately regarded as an ideological advocate rather than a source of true independent advice of the kind that we believe this government needs and in fact should demand. It has an extreme fundamentalist view of the way reform should take place, and the views of other groups which are supportive of reforms, such as various employer groups and, indeed, the ACTU, are rejected. It, therefore, fails&mdash;and some might even say refuses&mdash;to build a consensus even amongst those that are largely supportive, that largely embrace the general economic directives and underlying thrusts of the Industry Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, these draft reports to which I have just alluded failed to gain credibility with any of the major stakeholders in the areas concerned. I refer to stakeholders as being those government departments and other major players in the economic debate who look somewhat candidly upon draft reports knowing that there has been no true consultation embraced as part of their development and that any final recommendations will not incorporate any subsequent amendments that might be made or suggested by interested parties.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Increasingly important is the fact that interested parties are boycotting the Industry Commission because of its failure to listen in a balanced, non-partisan and non-prejudiced way. There has been far too much emphasis placed on the now failed and the now discredited ORANI model, which is consistently used to claim exorbitant `savings' for the particular ideological course that has been proffered or recommended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, this ORANI model has indeed lost the confidence of some state governments, some federal parliamentarians, including me, significant national business organisations and community and religious organisations, and various commentators on all sides of politics also cast doubt on the worth of the ORANI model, given its consistent claims of exorbitant savings for a particular ideological course that has been recommended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing to indicate that the commission has or will have any capacity to adequately address the interested industries, consumers in the community and the social and environmental consequences as it is required to do under the general policy guidelines outlined in clause 8 of the bill. The commission, through its report that I have mentioned previously, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stocktake of progress in microeconomic reform</EMPHASIS>, has already largely determined the results of any inquiries it might undertake and is, therefore, incapable of balanced and independent advice. This is bad policy, which leads to further bad policy. I ask the government to examine this matter in the bill critically before it proceeds to encouraging a vote on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have cited some of the industry policy matters which are encapsulated within the stocktake report and other matters contained in the same report which I believe already have their futures predetermined. Page 9 of the stocktake report under the heading `Competition policy' states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prices oversight should be limited to statutory and natural monopolies and other markets where competition is very weak.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is another example of the commission predetermining the future of a particular issue. In this case, the oversighting of prices in both the oil and banking industries would not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="727"> occur. There would be no statutory obligation for the oversight of pricing in the event that that particular predetermined recommendation of the commission were to be pursued. One can only imagine that, given it was a key part of the stocktake report, issued only some 10 months ago, it is on the commission's predetermined agenda and that, if there are further submissions and proposed amendments requested from the public at large and other interested parties, they will not be incorporated into any final recommendations of the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consequently, the creation of the Productivity Commission must be seen as an undermining of the democratic process. The funding level will exacerbate the situation by giving the commission a level of resources which will ensure its capacity to initiate and dominate the agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just refer to the potential to undermine the democratic process. There is no doubt that in putting this forward in the parliament the government has pre&hyphen;empted the parliament because it has arrogantly disregarded the supremacy of this place by acting as if the Productivity Commission was already in operation&mdash;although this legislation is necessary to effect its creation at law. Before the election the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) claimed he was going to respect the role of parliament and the supremacy of the parliament, yet this is another example of where proper parliamentary processes have been blatantly ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What then are the better alternatives? I offer a few words of advice in that regard. The first is that the government should seek and obtain a variety of sources of advice and not just one which emanates from a monolithic body such as the newly formed Productivity Commission. There should be more of a `horses for courses' approach. Appropriate people with expertise and credibility in a range of areas under examination by the commission should be utilised as being effective and efficient sources of advice. The one Productivity Commission/Treasury line should not be extended to the government as the only source of advice on issue after issue after issue. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More open and genuinely consultative processes should also be undertaken. By that I mean that if the commission calls for submissions from interested parties it should look at those submissions with a view to incorporating at least some of them into the final recommendations of any report on any particular aspect of micro&hyphen;economic reform that it may be investigating. This would create a capacity to build support and build a basis for global reform that would enjoy the support of a range of interested parties who, whether or not they had had their suggested amendments incorporated in the final report, would at least feel that they had been legitimately consulted and would be more inclined to support the eventual outcome, given that they felt that they were reasonably heard during the consultative process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is required in this country is not a source of advice emanating from a single monolithic body but a partnership between government and business where government can seek a range of advice from a range of sources offering different expertise to it so that we can get economic growth above levels of four per cent&mdash;economic growth of the kind that will be needed to lower unemployment and of the kind that the former Labor government was reaching in its final term of office. But the Productivity Commission does not believe in this integrated partnership arrangement. It would consider any suggestions of the nature that we are proposing to go to the issue of business welfare. Seeking to attain the sorts of schemes I have been talking about, be it DIFF or EMDG, has nothing to do with business welfare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even though I have called for this bill not to proceed, I acknowledge that it will proceed. Due to the significant influence that the Productivity Commission will have, the  opposition considers that the bills should be referred to a Senate committee so that the proposed commission can be adequately scrutinised.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Ministers also have their own ideas, so you have another 15 or so opinions on which decisions can be made. To run the line that there is going to be only one source of  information going into the government, and that that is coming from the Productivity Commission, does not stand up at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting to look at the Industry Commission's general policy guidelines, under which it operated, and to look at the guidelines for the new Productivity Commission. In actual fact, the guidelines are very similar. So the work which was being undertaken by the Industry Commission is largely the work which is going to be done by the Productivity Commission. Let me just go 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="729"> through some of those guidelines to point that out to people. The general policy guidelines for the Industry Commission state:</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) to encourage the development and growth of Australian industries that are efficient in their use of resources, self&hyphen;reliant, enterprising, innovative and internationally competitive.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">the same words&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to improve the overall economic performance of the economy through higher productivity in the public and private sectors in order to achieve higher living standards for all members of the Australian community;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is pretty close to the same sort of thing. The wording is slightly different. The second guideline for the Industry Commission says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to facilitate adjustment to structural changes in the economy and to ease social and economic hardships arising from those changes;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to recognise the interests of industries, consumers and the community that are likely to be affected by the measures proposed by the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Many speakers have come in here and have not really gone back and done their homework in that area. Go back and have a look at what the Industry Commission's guidelines were. The Productivity Commission is, by and large, going to take on all of that work, and its general policy guidelines are almost identical in wording to that of the previous Industry Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our whole goal with this is to try to make sure that policy comes into the government which is wide ranging, which is informative, which brings in empirical evidence, which is well based, which is analysed and which brings to us options and so gives the government a very good, well-rounded view of whatever investigation has been undertaken. The point can be made that there are part-time commissioners who can be appointed to the commission and specifically brought in, depending on what industry or what area is being investigated. So there can be specialist 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="730"> points of view brought in to help the Productivity Commission with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reject quite strongly the view that a range of options will not be brought to the government and that there will not be wide-ranging consultation and gathering of information because of the way in which the general guidelines of the commission have been structured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that this commission will fulfil its function quite adequately and that the work of the commission will be able to proceed in a very comprehensive way. The advice coming through to government just from this commission alone will be very intensive, will be well analysed and will take into account a whole range of factors as is required by a commission of this nature. I have no doubt about that whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to point out that one of the amendments that has been proposed relates to competitive neutrality policies and principles. The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) is proposing to change some wording in that regard. He proposes the word `experience' instead of `enjoy' and `competitive disadvantage' as well as `competitive advantage'. It is interesting to go back to a little bit of history which shows that the preferred words of the then government, the Labor Party, were exactly what is now put into this legislation. Under `Competitive neutrality policies', it reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The objective of competitive neutrality policy is the elimination of resource allocation distortions arising out of the public ownership of entities engaged in significant business activities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then it makes this particular point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government businesses should not enjoy any net competitive advantage simply as a result of their public sector ownership.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is exactly what we have put into this legislation, and that is exactly what the then Labor government, in 1994, used as their preferred words. Now one of the members of the opposition, the member for Werriwa, is coming in here and saying that he would like to move an amendment along these lines with the aim of ensuring that significant government business activities do not experience&mdash;`experience' instead of `enjoy'&mdash;`net competi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tive advantages', and then he wants to put in the words `or disadvantages'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where is the opposition on competitive neutrality policy? Has the opposition changed its policy or is it that one of its members is acting as a rogue in regard to the policy position? In 1994, the preferred words were the words which we are actually putting into this legislation now. So, when the opposition come in here and want to move amendments, maybe they&mdash;in particular the member for Werriwa&mdash;should go back and check the history of the wording of the previous government. Some opposition members obviously have not gone back over the history and looked into it in a thorough, comprehensive manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government believes that the Productivity Commission is a very important commission, that it has a job to do and that it will be one source of information for the government to use to analyse particular areas. It is very important within the Treasury portfolio. There was overlap and duplication in some of these areas. Besides, EPAC was just being ignored by the previous government. So I think this is a sensible, commonsense approach to good public administration in this country. I have no doubt at all that the information and the range of options which will come to the government from the Productivity Commission will be wide ranging, that its inquiries will be done thoroughly and that the scientific, empirical evidence which will be brought to us will be, without exception, of a very high standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that what is being proposed in this bill will certainly serve all Australians' interests, will serve the government well and will provide the information. By having the three areas rolled together, I believe there will not be the overlap and the duplication which was occurring before. As I said previously, there are research capacities within other departments to develop empirical information for the appropriate ministers. The industry minister, if he so desires, could have a subunit within his portfolio, as could any other minister. So the idea that this can be only one source of information is blatantly wrong.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="731">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has also been comment by some people that the commission will not be able to do anything on its own initiative, that it will always be under instruction. Over the years, the Industry Commission has spent about 50 per cent of its time&mdash;probably a bit more&mdash;on public inquiry and the rest of its time has been spent in research, in gathering information and in initiating inquiries in its own right. I have no doubt that that will continue, that a lot of the time of the Productivity Commission will be directed towards public inquiry. I know it is fundamentally important to have wide-ranging information flowing into the Productivity Commission, but to say that it cannot act on its own initiative, that it is going to be tied down with very detailed instructions and have no time to go about initiating the gathering of empirical information in its own right I do not think is a correct interpretation of this bill which we are proposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the commission will be able to initiate the gathering of information to a certain extent. As I said, the Industry Commission tended to use a significant amount of its time initiating the gathering of information off its own bat, and I believe that will continue. It is important for a body such as this to be able to gather information on its own initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will no doubt be more opportunity for debate on some of these matters because amendments will be moved that will provide that opportunity. In closing the debate, I would like to thank all members from both sides. I think there were 18 people involved in the debate. It is on a topic which is wide ranging. That is to be expected in regard to such a commission, which is about Australia being competitive, productive, taking into account circumstances in which Australians find themselves&mdash;whether they live in regional or urban Australia. I believe that these debates are very healthy and worth while, and I believe without doubt that the Productivity Commission will fulfil its role, this legislation having been passed to achieve those sorts of outcomes. The information flowing to the government will be well based and comprehensive. </PARA>

The simple fact is that that is its rhetoric; it is not the reality.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have the circumstance where the first major act of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) was to abolish his department. The minister is on the record as saying that there is no constitutional role for the Commonwealth in regional development. Little wonder, therefore, that when they ask the Industry Commission, in its

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to those members on the other side of the House who have lent their name to concerns about the Productivity Commission's recommendations on the car plan&mdash;the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes), the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne), the member for Boothby (Dr Southcott) and the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth)&mdash;all of whom have written letters around this parliament.

What a sham! I again refer the amendment to the member and to the other members from the South Australian seats who are in this chamber and who express concern about the impact of the majority report of the Productivity Commission on the car plan.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The car plan under Labor worked and saw the expansion of the car industry. That car plan will be decimated if the majority report of the Productivity Commission is adopted. There is also another report under way, into the textile, clothing and footwear industries. There is a whole group of them in town today. That is the reason I was out of the chamber before, because I was speaking with them. They are going to be inquired into. Don't you think there are impacts on regional jobs in the textile industry in this country? Yet you will come into this place and vote down an amendment that requires the Productivity Commission to have regard to the impact on regions and jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple reality is that under the car plan, through the export facilitation scheme, we saw a huge growth in the component supply market of the car industry as well as a base underpinning the car market. Without those plans, and with the unilateral disarmament on tariff cuts and with the abolition of the export facilitation scheme, those jobs will go. Those regions will suffer.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an extraordinary move by the Manager of Opposition Business, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), to introduce a pious amendment&mdash;which is all it is&mdash;to the Productivity Commission Bill and then to expect the South Australian members of parliament to flutter about and fall apart. Quite clearly, this is a political stunt on behalf of the opposition&mdash;a political stunt just like the letter circulated by Margaret Reynolds about human rights last year and just like the pious amendments that are always moved to government bills by both the current opposition and us when we were 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in opposition. We do not intend as South Australian members of parliament to fall for some pious amendment, to fall for some political stunt, designed to give the member for Hotham another run in the press.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to some of the more substantial reasons why we vote  against these amendments, it is very clear that the matters mentioned in the member for Hotham's amendments proposing subclauses (f) and (g) are already included in the bill. I refer to the bill. These are the general policy guidelines for the commission as stated in the bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) to facilitate adjustment to structural changes in the economy and to ease social and economic hardships arising from those changes; and</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) to recognise the interests of industries, consumers and the community that are likely to be affected by measures proposed by the Commission; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) to recognise the social and environmental consequences of measures proposed by the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">All of those matters quite clearly specifically give the Productivity Commission the opportunity in their terms of reference to take into account all the matters raised in (f) and (g) of the amendments of the member for Hotham. They are not excluded. In fact, in the auto industry inquiry, the terms of reference included the commission taking into account our international obligations. For many years the government has had the right in its terms of reference, in its policy and principles guidelines that it gives to the Productivity Commission&mdash;formerly the Industry Commission&mdash;to indicate what they want taken into account. It does not require us to leave out any issue. It does not have to be included in the policy guidelines in the bill because anything else can also be included, and it usually is included.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each new inquiry is given new terms of reference. They include some things that are in the guidelines and they  include extra things that the government thinks are important in its policies and principles to include in each inquiry. I would also add that the ALP spent 13 years in government with this capacity for the Industry Commission inquiry&mdash;now the Productivity Commission&mdash;and for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="734"> 13 years they did not see any necessity at all to include amendments (f) and (g) in the policy guidelines for the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is only today, at the last minute, without any notice being given to the government that the member for Hotham has come in here and demanded, having had an about&hyphen;face, that this is crucial, that it would be obnoxious if we did not include it. Why then for 13 years did the Labor Party see no reason, no cause celebre, for including in the Industry Commission Act the requirement to take into account these matters? It is so transparent it is pathetic. I am sorry that the members of the opposition have been so badly let down by the Manager of Opposition Business. I am sorry for Simon, of course, because it will set back his opportunities for the leadership to some extent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point I would like to make is that these changes&mdash;(f) and (g) being included by the member for Hotham&mdash;will make absolutely no difference whatsoever to the auto industry inquiry that has already being conducted by the Productivity Commission. That inquiry has been completed, the draft has been put out to the public and in May the final report will be made. This bill will have no effect whatsoever on that inquiry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That will make no difference whatsoever to the  deliberations of the current Productivity Commission inquiry because this is a new bill. The idea that this will in some way affect the automotive industry in South Australia is a nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I would simply restate my absolute commitment to the South Australian automotive industry, which has been stated publicly on many occasions since the draft report of the Industry Commission came out before Christmas in newspapers and on radio. I know that most of my South Australian colleagues share that commitment very strongly. This is a very important issue to South Australia, and we will do everything in our power to protect the jobs and the livelihoods of the families affected.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like any good opposition we are here to help. We are here to help all those government members who are so worried about the way in which the Productivity Commission is not considering regional issues. It is not considering regional employment issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested to hear the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne). He is the true heir to Peacock, with all that style&mdash;he is well presented and is very stylish in his presentation&mdash;but there are a few gaps in the substance. He mentioned, correctly enough, that for 13 years the Labor Party did not have a reference to regional employment and development in the work of the Industry Commission, but that is the whole point of this legislation. The Labor Party in government had the BIE and EPAC to provide the recommendations about regional development and regional employment. But this legislation is wiping those two bodies away, clearing the decks in terms of regional employment and development and establishing a narrow stream of neoclassical advice in the hands of the Productivity Commission. The member for Sturt is damned by his own analysis, because the very purpose of this bill is to wipe away all the advice that the federal cabinet has ever received on regional employment and development courtesy of EPAC and the BIE.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are wiping away that stream of advice, then obviously regional development and regional employment should be entrenched in the policy guidelines for the new Productivity Commission. So the Labor Party is here to help. We are here to help all those government backbenchers from South Australia and Victoria who are concerned about the narrow advice on tariffs that takes no account of regional development and employment and all those National Party members, not even in the chamber, who have copped so many cuts to employment in their regional electorates. Here is the answer. Here is the positive, constructive solution to the way in which the Productivity Commission fails to consider regional employment and regional development. If you have a look at the policy guidelines, it is fairly clear why regions should be mentioned: because everything bar the kitchen 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="735"> sink has been mentioned, from productivity to structural change, to regulation of industry, to industries and consumers, and to social and environmental consequences. Whatever happened to mentioning regions? Whatever happened to taking a spatial dimension in the formation of economic policy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem the government has is that the Productivity Commission relies on the ORANI model. The ORANI model of forecasting and projections takes no account of space. It takes no account of the way in which many factors of production are immobile, particularly labour. In the ORANI model it is supposed that a job lost in the electorate of Kingston, Hindmarsh, Sturt or Adelaide is a job that will be replaced somewhere else in the national economy and the person losing that job can move seamlessly to another location to pick up that employment. So there is no spatial dimension to the work of the productivity commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everything is mentioned here in the bill bar regions. It is a shameful thing for the Liberal members participating in this debate to adopt the doctrine of Sharpism. John Sharp, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development in name only&mdash;in practice, Transport only&mdash;has said that the Commonwealth has no funding or constitutional responsibility for regions. It is bad enough for the National Party to be saying those things, but Liberal Party members should not fall for that very narrow, neoclassical, flawed analysis of economic projections. Regions should be written into guidelines. It is so simple to do. If you believe in regional development, put it into the policy guidelines of the Productivity Commission. If you have seen the way in which EPAC and BIE are being abolished by virtue of this legislation, continue their charter on regional development by writing it into the new bill. It is so simple to do. This is a commonsense proposition. It merely needs to be stated to be supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is wrong with all those government backbenchers who talk the language of regional development and employment but when push comes to shove, when the heat is on in the parliament, when they have to face a vote on the guidelines for the Productivity

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we are talking about the Productivity Commission Bill, it is worth reflecting on the history of the Productivity Commission, which is a merging of the Industry Commission, EPAC and BIE. Before it was the Industry Commission it was the Industries Assistance Commission; before that the Tariff Board. The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) has circulated an amendment saying that it should be the brief of the Productivity Commission to consider regional development and regional employment consequences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regional development and the consequences for it are something most of us on this side are very concerned about because we are the people who do come from the regions of Australia. The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) and the member for Hotham were tugging their forelocks to the man who believed that if you were not living in Sydney, you were camping out. Where does the member for Werriwa come from? He comes from the suburbs of Sydney. Where does the member for Hotham come from? He comes from Melbourne. Where did he work when he was President of the ACTU? He worked in Melbourne, and he probably thinks that Australia stops at Tullamarine. Of the 89 members of this House from places outside Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra, there are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="736"> only something like 11 who represent the ALP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the amendment, by introducing into the brief of the Productivity Commission that it should consider regional development and regional employment consequences&mdash;and that is something I addressed in my speech on the second reading&mdash;you virtually make the Productivity Commission an impotent body. You say that the Productivity Commission has to consider national goals and regional goals, so it would almost act in different ways. I think it is more important that a government consider the regional consequences. The Productivity Commission is one source of advice to the government. Regional consequences will be raised by members on this side of the House because we are the ones who represent the regions and we are the ones who know that Australia does not stop at Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hotham has been searching around trying to find something to differentiate himself from those in the Liberal Party and he thought that the way to go on industry policy was to model ourselves on Japan's MITI. Everyone knows their interventionist industry policy has had a lot of failures. They have been quite unsuccessful in terms of some of the things they have missed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rise to state once again my very firm commitment to the automotive industry in South Australia. We do need to consider the regional impact that the automotive industry does have in South Australia but I do not believe it is necessary to introduce this clause into the Productivity Commission Bill. I think it is better that this be considered by governments rather than by the Productivity Commission.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in support of this amendment on the Productivity Commission Bill and do so on the basis that those on this side of the chamber are committed to the Australian automotive industry. I know there are some on the other side who are somewhat committed to the industry, and perhaps an exception to that lot is the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), who is noted for his absence this morning; he is no doubt off doing his direct 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mail to his constituents in the industry and his local electorate, having been absolutely skinned alive this morning by the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has said, we are from the opposition and we are, indeed, here to help. I know the government has not to this date, on any aspect of this bill or in any submission it has made in terms of debate on this bill, made more than a passing reference to the needs of regional Australia, the needs of regional development and the employment consequences of this bill as it applies to those regions it claims to represent&mdash;or, perhaps, misrepresent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In government we had the BIE and EPAC and, contrary to the view of those on the other side, we took notice on an ongoing basis of all those constituencies and authorities during our term in government. In fact they offered more than just the limited, neo&hyphen;classic advice that no doubt will be proffered by this new amalgamated, monolithically geared Productivity Commission. No doubt the government, in implementing this legislation, is simply sweeping away a major stream of advice from a diverse range of sources that was formerly forthcoming under the reign of the Keating and Hawke governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite who have been forced to endure regional cuts to their constituencies have the answer, it is right in front of them: support an amendment which makes more than just a passing reference to regional development; show some intestinal fortitude and apply your minds to supporting a reference to regional development which will ensure that the automotive industry is looked after in a way that those opposite pay no more than lip service to.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We did not rely on the ORANI model to anywhere near the extent that you clearly are relying on it. We relied on it until we acknowledged early in our third term of government that the ORANI model was flawed and discredited. That model was consistently used to claim exorbitant savings for any ideological course that was recom 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="737"> mended but it lost the confidence of state governments and those on this side of the House; and it lost the confidence of significant national business organisations and other community organisations because it claimed exorbitant savings to justify some ideological bent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on this side of the House do more than just mouth platitudes in regard to regional development and regional employment; we want to put it in the legislation and say, `It is there for the taking.' The government should show some guts and take the opportunity to put it in the legislation where it belongs and demonstrate that they are not, as their National Party cohort has said, ministers for just transport, but that they are concerned about more than just issues related to transport; that they are concerned about regional development as well as other portfolio areas. Today, while their presence in the chamber is noted, apart from the member for Corangamite their silence in large part has been deafening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I urge those opposite to put a reference in the legislation to regional development. In the event that this will occur, I am sure that we would approach growth rates of near four per cent&mdash;of the kind that we had when we were last in government&mdash;in order to render the sorts of falls in unemployment that are required to reverse the trends that are already demonstrated in the first 10 months of this government's office. Unemployment, especially in regional areas, is trending upwards to levels which are clearly unsustainable and to levels which will clearly cost the government seats at the forthcoming federal election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge those opposite to show the guts and intestinal fortitude to put the reference to regional development in the bill, to support this amendment and not kowtow to certain sectional interests as the member for Corangamite does, who has slinked away having been skinned by the member for Hotham in what was a most assertive and formidable presentation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

Why don't you go to the guidelines that are already in the Productivity Commission's legislation before us today? Have a look and see what it says. The member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) read them out to you. Paragraph (c) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to recognise the interests of industries&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">including the car industry, because it is an industry&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">consumers and the community&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the South Australian community, the Adelaide community, the Kingston community, the community of workers; the community&mdash;does not `community' include region&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that are likely to be affected.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">How more specific can you get! The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) smiles. I would like him to tell us when he gets up how else he would interpret that other than that members of the community are affected by it. Is that not regional interests?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is, as the member for Sturt said, a stunt&mdash;and not a very hard stunt. As I said at the beginning, it is one of the reasons why I like politics: to think that the shadow minister spent the morning or late last night, sitting 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="738"> there, thinking up some way he could try to divide the government, and this was the best he could do. But it was a nice attempt. Let us say it was one of those warm, friendly attempts that we see so often that really cannot rise that much ire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> If I can point out to the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton), who decided to attack the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), that I do not actually agree with the member for Corangamite on the Productivity Commission's report on the car industry. I think, as I said in a speech in this House yesterday, it is a poor document. It is an intellectually  impoverished document. But, for all that, the member for Corangamite has stood a very strong line on what he believes, and he believes it honestly. I would ask the member for Isaacs to clear up what he said earlier, because at one stage he had the member for Corangamite being skinned by the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) and then I think he changed it and had him being skinned by the member for Werriwa or Hotham. Perhaps he would like to make up his mind who is actually skinning the member for Corangamite&mdash;who, in fact, was not skinned at all but who has stood his ground on principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate the member for Corangamite for the stand he has taken, although I have to say it is not a stand in this instance that I agree with. He at least is a man of principle and has not introduced to this House a trivial, nonsensical amendment simply on the political grounds that they might be able to divide the South Australians. It was a weak and pathetic attempt. The member for Hotham is going to have to try a lot harder in future if he thinks he is going to score on that side.</PARA></SPEECH>

I have listened to her with great attention on other presentations but I am alarmed to hear her treat an amendment&mdash;that we from the region see of vital importance to us, to our careers, to job opportunities and to industry for the future&mdash;with such scorn, regarding it as trivial and nonsensical.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment says `to have regard to the regional development and employment consequences'. Aren't there any regional employment consequences for the car industry in South Australia? The amendment is of no accord, it is trivial, and it is nonsensical, is it? Go back home and tell that to the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>&mdash;make your attitude towards employment in non-capital cities a front&hyphen;page story. Where I come from, the Hunter and the Central Coast, regional economic development and regional economic development policies are of the utmost importance. Regions like the Hunter, the Central Coast, the Latrobe Valley and Geelong&mdash;regions right around Australia&mdash;have suffered decade after decade from neglect by conservative federal governments. Here we have a government led by a Prime Minister (Mr Howard) who, in his role as Treasurer, scorned regions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said last night in this place that, when we came as a delegation to talk to him about an autonomous taxation office for Newcastle to service the Hunter region and the north, his response was, `No, there's no role for that.' When he becomes Prime Minister, back into the position of power, what are the first actions that are taken? Abolish the regional development program and close down the regional offices of public service departments. So CES offices are getting closed down, Medicare offices are being closed down, the Newcastle immigration office, which was performing a fantastic service for northern New South Wales and for central New South Wales, is being been closed down. You can go right through all the federal services and you will see reduction in the staff numbers and abolition of regionalisation of federal public services by this Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It ill becomes those from country Australia who now sit opposite to be clamouring in support of what has been put forward by the government and not realising the double&hyphen;speak that they are getting. The growth centres of the future and the growth of this economy has to be in regional Australia. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="739"> What those opposite on the back bench are really saying, is that you have no regard for that. You say: `simply trust the Prime Minister and trust this government.' How can anybody trust this government&mdash;such a forgetful man, such a forgetful government; a government that puts forward propositions but when they are revealed now in the parliament says, `Yes, but we didn't state those things at the election. Somebody else, the apparatchiks, the party, put out those responses to my statement.' If you go through all of those processes and you on that side think that is going to wear in regional Australia, you have another think coming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to argue as strongly as I can that the future of this country is in regions, and regions must have a voice. I tell you now: before this year is over, you on that side will be reintroducing regional development programs because of the scathing response there has been to the abolition of the regional development program in country Australia. You may not want to look across here but, you will see. Before the end of the year, you will reintroduce a regional development program because of the battering you are taking in country Australia. Talk to people associated with the regional development programs in western New South Wales and listen to what their views are about this government; talk to people in eastern country Victoria and ask them what their views are about this government and its attitudes to regional development.</PARA>

They were still going to the election saying that all was well at AN.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been absolute hypocrisy about employment, about caring how many people are unemployed and about what is and is not regional Australia. The opposition is just getting itself into one more little stunt which is really not appreciated by the electorate. They should have learned that. They had 13 years to do things and to do them well. They messed it up; they have been chucked out; and they now are not handling opposition all that well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could be getting on and debating other important legislation. This bill is not about the car industry; this bill is not about the latest draft report of the Productivity Commission. There will be inquiries into that report and public discussion going on this month and next month. This legislation has absolutely nothing to do with that at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The general policy guidelines for the commission, which were read out by the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) and referred to by the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), are very important. For the opposition, who perhaps have not read them, I will remind them again: it is to recognise, for instance, the social and environmental consequences of measures proposed by the commission. I would not have thought you would actually even need to add the word `regional' to that. Go back to school. What would your English teachers have had to say about that? Look at the correct drafting of things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has already been said, there will be plenty of opportunities for the government to put in the appropriate terms of reference when it is wanting inquiries made by the Productivity Commission. The car industry in South Australia, as in other parts of Australia, is very important. The car industry in South Australia is important to me, but it is even more important to the 17,000 people who work in it. Because I recognised that this bill 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="740"> was not about the debate on the car industry, I actually spoke about that industry in the grievance debate on Monday. I said on that occasion that we cannot live in a textbook and how important the industry was in South Australia. But I also reiterate that that draft report is not even the full report yet. It is not the final report to the government. When it is, the government will consider that report. I support Ian Webber. It was good that the government brought in somebody with industry experience. All that is good. But this bill is not about the car industry and it is not about that report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hotham, in conjunction with others in opposition, has been up to one more political stunt. I say to him and I say to the opposition that the people of Australia are sick of stunts. They want some real action. We should be getting through this bill and getting on to debating other legislation which will be of real relevance and real importance to the people of Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The series of amendments that have been proposed&mdash;particularly amendment No. 4 relating to the need for the Productivity Commission to have regard, when it is giving advice to government, to the effect that its recommendations will have on regions&mdash;are very reasonable amendments. I cannot see anything in this particular amendment that would send a shiver up the spine of any member of the opposition. How members opposite can come in here and say that this is just a political stunt is quite beyond me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We really do need to entrench in the charter of this new body that is going to give very specialised, very specific economic advice to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government a reference to regional concerns. In the Productivity Commission's deliberations, when it constructs and implements its models of economic activity and when it makes its own judgments about the evidence, one of the factors that it needs to take into account is the impact that those recommendations might have on particular regions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The reason I am speaking to this amendment is fairly obvious because before the Industry Commission as I speak here today are two references: one on the automotive industry and the other on the textile, clothing and manufacturing industry. Both of those industries employ around 7,000 people in direct employment in my electorate. You could imagine what would happen to downstream employment if we had significant job losses in those particular industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should say at this point that over the past 15 years we have seen a rationalisation of those industries in the Geelong community. So we are aware of the processes of structural adjustment; we are aware of the possible job losses that can occur. What we are simply saying to the bodies that give advice to government is that they must now take into account from the provisions of their charter the concerns of people in regional areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested in what the member for Boothby (Dr Southcott) had to say. He said that this particular amendment would make the Productivity Commission impotent and that all you had to do was leave the consideration of regional issues to the government of the day. That is all very fine, but we have a problem because the government of the day says that it does not have any constitutional responsibility for the regions. Indeed, in the budget that the government brought down, it put its hand in the chest of the regions and ripped out the heart with its bare hands. That is what it did in the budget. There was not a whimper from the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne), the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) and other members who are here today in this particular debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are simply saying is we should enshrine this provision in the legislation so 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="741"> that the government of the day cannot avoid the issue of regional development because, as we know, we have a minister for transport and not transport and regional development. The federal government has openly said they have no constitutional responsibility for regional development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I was very intrigued with the way the member for Hindmarsh suggested that all the government had to do was write in the reference that the Productivity Commission could examine regional issues. The problem with that is that under this legislation the Productivity Commission can initiate references and it can leave out any reference to regional development. So where are we going to get it if you have a Productivity Commission that can draft its own references and leave out any reference to regional development and a government that sees no constitutional responsibility for regional development?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The most culpable member in this is the member who got skinned by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean)&mdash;and he is here in the House today&mdash;the member for Corangamite. They are going to hang his political carcass at the front end of his electorate coming into Geelong and at the back end of it, because there is no other member on the floor of this House who has indulged himself in such a great economic rationalist fantasy, that is going to destroy Geelong industry, as the member for Corangamite.

I did like his point that he was going to become the propagandist for the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), and we very much appreciate his efforts in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This proposed amendment is obviously nothing more than an attempt by the honour 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> able member for Hotham (Mr Crean) to write himself a job description because he is the shadow minister&mdash;for those who are not aware, and there are probably those that are not&mdash;for industry and regional development. I think his job as Manager of Opposition Business should be taken more seriously because this sort of amendment does tend to waste the time of the House. But we really must respond and reveal that it is nothing more than a stunt. I believe that the honourable member for Hotham&mdash;with my apologies to the English language&mdash;is exhibiting the gasbaggery for which he is becoming known in this place. He can make a name for himself in that field and perhaps he should stick to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP have just produced someone from regional Australia&mdash;the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris). But they are fairly thin on the ground when it comes to producing members from regional Australia to speak to this amendment because the Australian people spoke most vehemently from the regions when they elected us overwhelmingly at the last federal election. What distinguishes us from the ALP is that the concerns of regional Australia are intrinsic to everything we do, in everything we say, and in all our concerns. We really do have great concern for the country as a whole. It is something the sectional Labor Party is desperately now trying to grasp back, but they just do not relate very well to the country areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to this proposed amendment to clause 8, surely it is res ipsa loquitur: the thing speaks for itself. Perhaps they should get advice from the honourable member for Barton (Mr McClelland) when they attempt to draft such nonsensical amendments. Clause 8 refers to `General policy guidelines for Commission.' You only then have to refer to subclause (d) to find the reference to regional Australia and employment. That subclause calls upon the commission:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to recognise the interests of industries, consumers and the community that are likely to be affected by measures proposed by the Commission;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If we do not think communities live in regional Australia, I do not know what we are supposed to be thinking on the opposition side. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="742"> The proposed amendment really is nonsensical and irrelevant. We probably should not be wasting so much of the time of the House on this. Clause 8, subclause (2), is also quite specific:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the performance of its functions, the Commission must also have regard to any other matters notified to it in writing by the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is obvious. The only criticism you possibly could make of the general policy guidelines to the commission is that probably they are too detailed. You want to make sure that the guidelines are such that the commission can address itself to all the relevant concerns. If you want to be specific about regions or areas of interest that need to be addressed by a particular report, it is all there for the minister to make sure that those things are stipulated in the matter notified to the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, we have a scenario where the honourable member for Hotham comes up with another amendment that is really designed to do nothing but showcase the fact that they have invented a position for him, he wants to write himself a job description and he is desperately sticking to that task. But it is not working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that we are amalgamating a number of commissions into the Productivity Commission is very important. We are streamlining the efficiency of economic advice that is sought on behalf of the government. It is very important that we do look at the efficiency of those operations. For too long we had a government that has been kicked out by the Australian people on the basis of profligacy, waste and too much government unfortunately&mdash;too much duplication, too much government. What we are trying to do is streamline. The fact is that, by this one efficiency, budgetary cost savings of $5 million are expected already in 1997&hyphen;98 and $6.15 million in 1998&hyphen;99 and so on.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly take the point, Mr Deputy Speaker. The general policy guidelines for the new Productivity Commission take into account the impacts on communities. Surely this gives the Productivity Commission much greater scope to look, not only at regions, but within regions, and to look at the people in the communities that will be affected by its reports. Of course, for my electorate of Kingston, it is very appropriate that the Productivity Commission in the future will be able to focus on those workers

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is good to see that the opposition has not been asleep over the Christmas break. South Australian members have been debating the report that was released by the Industry Commission and discrediting it, and no doubt the ongoing criticism will continue. I believe that this amendment simply seeks to capitalise on the legitimate debate that has been going on between members of the government and between members of the opposition. We have all had our say on the recommendations made within the report and I believe that they stand discredited. The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) has been watching this debate and that is the very reason why we have the amendments placed before us, in order to entice some South Australian members to be attracted to support those amendments, but it is not going to work.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The members from South Australia really have a touch of arrogance. They have actually got a bit carried away with themselves. They think the regions of Australia simply mean South Australia. Fortunately for the country it does not, they actually are much more widespread.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps they have not realised that in South Australia there is also a steel industry at Whyalla, which is very much under threat. Perhaps they have not realised that regions include places like the Pilbara in Western Australia. In fact, Australia is made up of a series of regions, but you would not know it from our economic statistics. The fact is that for quite a long time there has been a debate raging about the need to understand our country as a series of economic regions. One region is the conurbation of southern Queensland and northern New South Wales, which takes in two states. That is one region. It is one economic zone, not two. However, look at our statistics and you will not see it as one, you will see it as two. You will see southern Queensland and northern New South Wales as two separate regions which, of course, they are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similar things occur in Albury&hyphen;Wodonga. Our economic statistics do not reflect the country at all. Historically, organisations like the Industry Commission and this new Productivity Commission do not reflect the actuality. They give an artificial view of the economy of the country and change is long overdue. There is legislation now refocusing and restructuring and it is very difficult to understand why the government has not accepted these amendments. Why wouldn't you have an amendment included which says `and to have regard to the regional development and regional employment consequences'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why wouldn't that be seen as an improvement of legislation? It is a sensible logical extension. The idea from the South Australian members that somehow this is an attack on them or some attempt to inveigle them is a little bit fanciful.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="745">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment there is a company in Newcastle in receivership with 300 employees. It is Australia's biggest suit maker incorporating modern high technology and good investment. They have done everything right but as far as our economics are concerned as a country, it does not show up. Taking it across the whole country or the whole of the state, it does not spike into the statistics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly we have got steel in three regions of Australia but it should be five or six or seven. We have currently got Newcastle. We have got Kembla. We have Whyalla. We also now have Port Hedland. We could have north and south Australia&mdash;it is a very real possibility. We could have the Meekatharra deposits in southern South Australia and we could have possibly two other areas in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the minister is announcing a committee of parliamentarians. He refused a parliamentary committee but has a committee of parliamentarians. Are they going to Western Australia where the new emerging regions are for steel? No, not at all. The government does not see any role for that. In other words what we are trying to suggest is that the government is stuck in the old rut of the states. This government is about states and states' rights and in the process it undermines and damages the regions. While ever the view in Canberra is via the state channels, via the state governments and the state premiers, the regions will never be understood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There may well be one region in a state; there may well be three regions in a state, but the fact is that until we, as a parliament, and our institutions start to understand the actuality of our economy which is that it is regional, we will never make it work very well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The future of this country is not in the Melbourne and Sydney areas which are largely suffocated because of transport complications and land costs. The future lies in the regions and their potential growth. Unless you take that into account in employment, in skills, in provision of training and investment and analyse it accordingly and look at it accordingly, we will never make it work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments are very sensible, logical things. It is amazing and people out in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> community will be astounded that the government does not just accept them and get on with it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a good, long, hard look at what they are trying to hang their hat on. They talk about their former regional development policy&mdash;this was going to save regional Australia. When was it implemented? Just prior to the last election&mdash;a cheap political stunt trying to shore up their vote in regional Australia. The very reason those speaking opposite are from metropolitan areas is the simple fact they do not have any regional representation. They were decimated in regional Australia. That little stunt they tried to pull before the last election did not fool anyone and it most certainly did not fool the people of regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it very interesting that the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) was running around Australia last year saying, `We're going to

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, as you pointed out, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), actually had nothing to say of relevance to the Productivity Commission Bill or the clause. It is a miserable existence he has because he is parliamentary secretary in an area of government responsibility that his minister, Mr Sharp, has abolished. Mr Sharp has said there is no Commonwealth constitutional or funding responsibility for regional development. I suppose that makes the parliamentary secretary a parliamentary secretary for nothing, which in the food chain of parliamentary life is probably the bottom of the ocean. It is barely surprising by that analysis that he was right off the bill and right off the clause and had nothing to say of any substance about the need for this particular amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the other matters that he raised, if we accept his proposition that all those problems in Australia's regions took place over the last 13 years, what problem is there in inserting the need for regional development and regional employment to be considered by the Productivity Commission? If the member for Ballarat is correct in saying that all those 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="747"> things happened and all those problems occurred over the last 13 years in Australia's region, it is all the more reason to support the Labor amendment. It is all the more reason to support the Productivity Commission's having regard for regional development and regional employment. It is a basic proposition that, by his own argument, he has de facto supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to other government members who have been attacking this amendment. The member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) was saying that, because the word `community' is in the reference to the Productivity Commission, it covers regions. That is not the case. The Productivity Commission in their national model regard the community interest as the national interest and, in between community and nation, they have no place for assessing regional impacts. Do not take me for the source of those things, take the member for Hindmarsh herself. In debate last night she said `models have to have assumptions in them', and that one of the things that the Industry Commission will admit is wrong with its model is that `it does not have the capacity to take in regional effects. So regional effects are out of this model. Quite interestingly, Chris Murphy has a model&mdash;MM2&mdash;in which he did manage to look at regional effects. According to Mr Murphy's model, we get a 1.2 per cent drop in South Australian state product as a result of the change in tariff'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a strange thing indeed for the member for Hindmarsh to be saying last night that the Productivity Commission model takes no account of regional effects, it has no regional dimension to its analysis, but today, because she has been corralled into it by the government whips, she is forced to say that the word `community' in the Productivity Commission Bill denotes a regional consideration. She cannot have it both ways and she, too, is damned by her own analysis, the words that she put to this House just last night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Beyond that, other government contributors have not had a very good time of it. We had the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes) saying that this was an amendment that the Labor Party advanced at the very last minute. Where was she last night when the Deputy Leader of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Opposition, Mr Evans, stood up and moved a second reading amendment which stated, in part, `believing that the Commission should be required to have regard when providing its advice to the regional development and employment consequences of that advice.' So this was foreshadowed by the Australian Labor Party in debate 24 hours ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the reason we are moving this amendment in detail is that we are expecting all those government members who spoke in favour of regional analysis and regional effects in the debate last night to support us today. We were moving this amendment on their behalf. The shadow treasurer stood up and moved the second reading amendment last night. The member for Hindmarsh and her colleagues came out and said, `That is right, the Productivity Commission is deficient because it does not take account of regional effects.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Labor Party comes in today and says, `Okay, we will take that proposition. It has been supported by the shadow treasurer and by the member for Hindmarsh; we will move an amendment in detail to write regional development and employment into the charter of the Productivity Commission.' As I started out some time ago, we are from the opposition and we are here to help on these matters. We are here to help all those government members who have a concern that the Productivity Commission takes no account of regional effects. We could not be any more sincere, any more helpful, any more constructive in our amendments this morning than we have in raising the matter that has been moved by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This need not be a partisan matter. This need not be a matter where people like the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) feel the need to stand up and denounce this proposition only because it has been moved by the Labor Party. If he was advancing this, he would find many reasons why the Productivity Commission should take account of regional effects.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a great need to develop and make the best use of Australia's human resources, particularly in regional Australia, as well as to improve our social and economic infrastructure in those regions. It is for this reason that the opposition is so committed to incorporating as an integral part of this legislation a reference&mdash;and more than just passing reference to the words `community' or `nation' or whatever&mdash;to the word `region'. We want some definite, deliberate reference to the word `region'. We need to entrench and express that in this bill as an expression of our commitment to those crucial areas in which many Australians choose to live.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the Productivity Commission must also take into account the needs and aspirations of residents and constituents of this parliament in regional areas. As I again affirm, we need to make more than passing reference to regions. We all know that in last year's budget, regions of this great nation were gutted by this government. Indeed, this is one attempt by the opposition to ameliorate the plight of regional Australia in terms of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="750"> devastation that has been wrought upon them by those opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) suggested that given that the word `community' was already contained in regulations associated with the bill that that was sufficient in terms of incorporating a definition of the word `nation', indeed of the word `region'. However, the Productivity Commission has more than a loose definition of the word `community'. It defines it more than just loosely, it defines it as a nation. That is, community interests are, as the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) said, our national interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Far too broad a definition for our purposes is that one that I have just put to you. If we are representing the interests of regional Australia then I ask government members why it is that they are not prepared to incorporate a more definitive definition of regional Australia in this bill. Is it simply because we are committed to it and they are not? We are committed to it and they haven't got the guts to incorporate in this bill anything more than a passing reference to regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hindmarsh's claim that the definition of `community' is an all-embracing one is absolute, arrant nonsense. In fact, the Productivity Commission's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stocktake</EMPHASIS> report does not refer to the word `community' in any way, shape or form. It only reports in the context of the nation; there is nothing to do with community as such. I think that the member for Hindmarsh is completely wrong in her fatuous assertion that the word `community' referred to the word `region'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On page 31 of the report it only discusses outcomes in terms of national growth figures. It discusses outcomes in terms of GDP. It discusses outcomes in terms of findings by the IC, the BIE, EPAC and the BCA in regard to the impact of micro-economic reform on a range of nationally based economic indicators, notably GDP.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Mitchell for his question. I am aware of recent developments. This morning, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia dropped its standard variable mortgage rate from 8.25 per cent to 7.55 per cent. As I have previously said, that rate of 7.55 per cent by the Commonwealth Bank in relation to its standard variable mortgage is the lowest since June 1974. Interest rates are now at their lowest since June 1974. Of course, in 1974 loans were rationed and quite often people on those rates had to take cocktails. The last time the ceiling on home loans was below 7.55 per cent was in 1969.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When man walked on the moon, that is right. One small step for the Commonwealth Bank, one giant leap for home buyers this morning. Since March 1996, when the standard variable rate was 10.5 per cent, interest rates have fallen by 2.95 per cent. On the average Australian $100,000 home loan mortgage, that is an interest saving of $246 a month. All Australians will welcome the fact that home loan rates are falling, and I pay special tribute to the new mortgage originators&mdash;the Aussie Home Loans, the RAMS&mdash;that introduce competition and put the competitive urge on banks to drop those rates. They have led the way, and I call on other banks to see if they can match the Commonwealth Bank in relation to that announcement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated earlier in the week, for the first time we are now seeing the mortgage originators, such as Aussie Home Loans, go into small business lending. This represents a wonderful opportunity for small business to put competitive forces at play to get the benefits in relation to their businesses. I urge those small businesses to go down to their banks and ask their banks whether they can match the rates which are now being offered by the mortgage originators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government turned away from the Labor path of high debt, high deficit and high interest rates. We took the decisions to rescue the fiscal situation of Australia. We decided to embark on a low inflation, low interest rate strategy. The benefits will be for small business. The benefits will be for home buyers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course I confirm what I said on the Laws program, and I am pleased that you have the time to listen in. I was very pleased that when we released the mid&hyphen;year review the shadow Treasurer was in the country. He had just got back from the Clinton inaugural, and he came out and gave a doorstop saying, `It's jobs, stupid,' presumably speaking to himself. Then he went away the next day again and left it to the shadow assistant Treasurer. They are putting to work Martin Ferguson's policy of job sharing&mdash;the two of them&mdash;but they are trying to do it on two salaries instead of one, Martin. You should tell them that the idea of job sharing is to share the income as well as the workload.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course I said that on the Laws program because the design features of the family tax initiative were: part (a), which was for all qualifying parents with dependent children up to that income ceiling of $70,000 adjusted per defendant gained under part (a); under part (b) there was an additional gain for the single income family with a child under five. That was to redress what we thought was some of the current imbalance against the single income family which does not have access to two tax free thresholds, nor does it have access to two marginal rates of 20 per cent. That was a deliberate design feature. That was the way in which the family tax initiative was designed and introduced. We make no apology for that. This was a family tax initiative for the families of Australia&mdash;$1 billion of tax relief for Australian families&mdash;and this government is proud of it.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

So to date ATSIC has had to fund the Saunders inquiry and the Mathews inquiry, the latter of which cost $1.03 million. I say again that the government is adamant that no further taxpayers' money should be spent on this tawdry saga which has cost in excess of $4 million to date. This is the reason why we will return the Hindmarsh Island Bridge legislation to the Senate.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for the Northern Territory for his question. I want to say again that the government will make a fair and considered response to the Wik decision after it has finished a round of consultations with relevant organisations, with representatives of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and also with the state and territorial governments. I have said that the goal of the government in this area is to have an outcome, a solution, a response which delivers both justice and certainty to all of the people who are affected by this decision. The Wik decision did surprise many people. It did overturn the understanding that many Australians had which was largely based on the preamble to the Native Title Act. It is a matter of some interest to me, and I think to the House, that the preamble to the Native Title Act stated that native title had been:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . extinguished by valid government acts that are inconsistent with the continued existence of native title rights and interests, such as the grant of freehold or leasehold estates</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That particular clause gave rise to the quite understandable expectation with the whole of Australia that the grant of a pastoral lease had extinguished native title. It is also interesting that the status given to that proposition in the preamble to the Native Title Act was exactly the same status as was given to the statement in the Native Title Act that the High Court had rejected the doctrine that Australia was terra nullius at the time of European settlement. Those who argue that there was no particular strength in the proposition that a pastoral lease had extinguished native title are also in a sense arguing that there was no greater strength in the proposition that the High Court of Australia had overturned the doctrine of terra nullius.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not pretend that this is an easy matter to resolve. The discussions I had on 22 January with the Premiers and the Chief Ministers were extremely useful. On 6 February, the Commonwealth received further material on proposals by the states and the territories. That is now under consideration. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="754"> There will be a round table meeting here in Canberra on Friday between me, Senator Minchin&mdash;the parliamentary secretary who has given very valuable assistance to the government on this issue&mdash;representatives of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, representatives of the National Farmers Federation, the Minerals Council and other organisations whose members are affected by this particular situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have not ruled out any options except the option of doing absolutely nothing or the option of, in some way, trying to overturn the basic principles of the Mabo decision. They are the two options which are absolutely sacrosanct as far as we are concerned. I think it is important that if we are to have a negotiated settlement of this issue that those people who have a vital stake in a just outcome and an outcome that delivers certainty must be prepared to make some compromises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is approaching this issue in a spirit of trying to find common ground in respect of a very difficult challenge between people who hold strongly opposed views. It may not be possible to find that common ground, but I want to assure the House that I personally and my government will leave absolutely no effort untouched in order to try to reach that common ground. But if there is to be common ground it must be achieved within a reasonable time frame because it is not in the national interest for there to be ongoing and lingering uncertainty and doubt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be no argument, in my view, that the whole basis of the discussion on native title was fundamentally altered by the decision of the High Court of Australia in the Wik case. I accept that decision as a proper interpretation of the current law, but, of course, I naturally reiterate the right of the national parliament to change the current law of Australia if it believes it to be in the national interest.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

It is no wonder that the Labor Party is so directionless at the moment and does not have any idea where to turn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He confirms more and more every day just how useless the Labor Party is as a contributor to national policy debate. In the House yesterday&mdash;and it is worth noting this because it just shows how divorced of ideas they are&mdash;he said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Cowan for his question. The legal costs of the member for Fremantle fall into three categories: the costs of her representation before the Marks royal commission, the costs of her court challenges to the appointment of the royal commission, and the costs of the Western Australian government which courts ordered she pay in respect of failed challenges. As I stated in this House on 19 November last year, the government intends to comply with the parliament's previous explicit decision to approve payment of only so much of the member for Fremantle's legal costs as were reasonably incurred in appearing before the Marks royal commission, less such costs as are payable by the state government of Western Australia. Under the appropriation approved by parliament for the 1995&hyphen;96 financial year, $319,927 has already been paid by the Commonwealth in respect of these costs. This appropriation lapsed on 30 June 1996.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said on 19 November that the government intended to seek parliament's approval of a further appropriation of approximately $50,000. That remains the government's 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="757"> position. That amount represents the balance of the royal commission costs, after making allowance for the amount of the royal commission costs which we understand are payable by the state government. The government intends not to pay any of the court costs, in accordance with the parliament's previous explicit decisions. In other words, the foreshadowed litigation has not affected the government's intentions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the proposed payment of Dr Lawrence's legal costs was put before this House in 1995, the then government agreed, in this House, to a coalition amendment reducing the amount of money appropriated by parliament to pay for Dr Lawrence's legal costs by the amount of the court costs. In the Senate, the wording of the appropriation was amended explicitly to exclude the payment by the Commonwealth of any costs other than the royal commission costs. We understand that these costs other than the royal commission costs were to have been paid by the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund, which was set up specifically to pay those costs that the parliament had refused to authorise the government to pay. The Australian public and the donors to that fund are entitled to ask why the fund has not been applied in payment of those costs, as this was the stated reason for the fund being set up. It might also be asked whether any interest has accrued on the funds, or whether administration fees have been charged. The fund was set up to pay those costs and should be applied accordingly.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

As part of the transaction, which will come into effect on 17 February, Telstra will sell its 60 per cent stake in Telstar Systems to Lockheed and Transfield, and on a redistribution of equity this will give Lockheed and Transfield a 50 per cent share each in Telstar. It is the intention of all the parties that the contract be novated to Telstar, probably in the first quarter of next year.

And, if he is going to quote figures, I suggest that he not be selective but honest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts with bulk&hyphen;billing are these. When we came to power in March 1996 the bulk&hyphen;billing rate for general practitioners was 80.3 per cent. As of December 1996 the rate was 80.5 per cent. The rate had in fact gone up.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For all Medicare services the rate was 71.1 per cent. Across all Medicare services in the December quarter the rate was 71.7 per cent. So in the whole range of Medicare services the rate of bulk&hyphen;billing has gone up more than for general practitioner services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister seems to have some problems with mathematics, so I will tell him one very simple point. The rate of bulk&hyphen;billing services is already very high and, as the maximum conceivable rate is 100 per cent, it is inevitable that at some point the rates will start to plateau. In fact, that plateau has been evident since two financial years ago in general practitioner services as the rate of increase in bulk&hyphen;billing services started to decline two years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To check the veracity of the shadow minister's claim, overnight I got the department to take out the bulk&hyphen;billing figures for January. In fact the rate of bulk&hyphen;billing for January was 81.0 per cent, an all&hyphen;time high. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> It shows that the claim he is making is absolutely without substance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point that I should make is that any changes in the budget did not actually come into place until November last year. So any talk about the last two quarters of the calendar year in fact relates to what you did in the 1995 budget. If anything happened in those two quarters it is as a result of the decisions of the Labor Party, not the decisions of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, if you look across all bulk&hyphen;billing figures, you have to see the great hypocrisy of what is going on. The Labor Party froze rebates for non&hyphen;vocationally registered GPs in November 1991. There has been no increase for over five years under the decision of the previous government. Bulk&hyphen;billing increased from 72.7 per cent in December 1991 to 86.6 per cent in December 1996. So if there is a slowdown in the rate of increase it is inevitably because you held the rebates at their level for over five years&mdash;and, for good measure, you took them out of the forward estimates in the budget without telling anybody, so there is nothing for them in the forward estimates for the next four years either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With services for vocationally registered GPs, you made the decision to halve the rate of increase from November 1994, so it is not surprising that GP rebates&mdash;bulk&hyphen;billing&mdash;should slow down&mdash;totally as a consequence of decisions made over six consecutive years by the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will make this final point. The shadow minister says in his press release `This disturbing evidence in the fall of bulk&hyphen;billing rates'&mdash;which is, of course, complete humbug&mdash;`is the first indication of the coalition's attempt to undermine Medicare by stealth.' There is only one thing that would undermine Medicare, and that is an annual rate of growth of 6.6 per cent, which is what you left us. On a budget bigger than the budget of the state of Western Australia you left us with an uncontrollable increase in the rate of growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have brought that back to controllable levels. We have done, on doctor numbers, what Graham Richardson and Brian Howe said needed to be done&mdash;but you never had 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="761"> the guts to do it, or to support us. We have managed to get a cap on pathology fee rebates over the forward estimates.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for her question. I am very concerned by evidence that some cots in use in Australia, especially old and homemade cots, may present significant safety risks to children. In October last year I directed the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs as a matter of urgency to investigate the safety of cots. I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> also acted to have work on an improved Australian standard for portable cots fast&hyphen;tracked. As part of the bureau's investigation, surveys were conducted to identify potentially dangerous cots. Comments from the public, manufacturers and consumer groups were also sought.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have now received the bureau's report, which has identified some significant safety risks. There is evidence that children have died or have been seriously injured as a result of hazards associated with entrapment, snagging of clothing and falls. This is simply unacceptable. The community expects, quite rightly, high safety and design standards for nursery furniture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To address these problems, I propose to introduce a mandatory standard for the safe design of children's cots. The standard will cover the major safety hazards. I have been pleased by the very responsible reaction of Australian manufacturers on this issue. The support of the states and territories will be essential to ensure effective enforcement, especially over the sale of older and second&hyphen;hand cots.</PARA>

But as a result of representations that were put to me by Senator Kernot later in the year&mdash;and she was supported in those representations, I think, by other members of her party&mdash;I in fact restored the Democrats' staff to the level that had obtained. So if we are to follow the logic of what Senator Kernot has said, Senator Kernot herself was presumably bribed by that action. If Senator Kernot thinks that by restoring her staff establishment we are in some way behaving in a corrupt fashion then she is certainly indicting herself.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Frail and sick older Australians in need of nursing home care are going to need to sell their homes to get that care. This will lead to a system of nursing home care never seen in this country before. If you have a large amount of assets to sell and then, after selling them, pay the proceeds over as an up-front fee, you will be able to get into a nursing home and get decent care. Those who have little to contribute either will not get in or, if they do, will receive a much poorer level of care. The principle of equal access for all Australians to quality care will be lost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is a piece of legislation which truly reveals the humbug in the assertion of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that `one group of the community that is not going to be hurt are the most vulnerable'. He went on to say, `We will protect the vulnerable and the needy.' They certainly are not protected by this legislation, which will see people going into nursing homes only if they are able to sell their homes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In stark contrast to the sentiment of these statements by the Prime Minister, this government with this legislation&mdash;which forces people to sell their homes to gain nursing home care&mdash;will cause, as it has already started to cause, widespread uncertainty and apprehension amongst older Australians. This legislation will not only directly and adversely affect the lives of those needing nursing home care but also affect the lives of their immediate families.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The atmosphere of apprehension and uncertainty is only worsened by the refusal of the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) to come clean on this point. She will not admit that the assets test to determine whether or not a person must pay an entry fee for nursing home care will necessitate most people having to sell their houses. Selling a home is always a dramatic and often traumatic time in anybody's life. Being forced to sell it when one is so seriously and physically incapacitated that nursing home admission has been recommended is far worse.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA STYLE="Para">The minister has squirmed and prevaricated on this point. Despite a growing groundswell of opinion to the contrary, she has stubbornly stuck to her guns. But the mounting tide of evidence is irresistible. People will have to sell their homes. That is very clear when we have a look at the draft legislation. It provides exemptions in the assets test for spouses, relatives or a carer living in the house. This clause is very clear in the draft legislation. But there is no exemption from the assets test for a single person. Yet we know from the statistics that around 90 per cent of nursing home entrants have been living alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also know from the data supplied by aged care assessment teams that around 70 per cent of people recommended for nursing home care are home owners at the time of assessment, so they have an asset to sell. Of these, about 10 per cent have a spouse who would remain in the home. Therefore, 63 per cent of residents have a sellable home. The critical point is that all the department's estimates about how much nursing homes can expect from entry fees are based on people selling their homes. Otherwise, there will be no money for the upgrade of nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most damning evidence is now coming from the nursing home proprietors themselves. Today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> we read about a Gold Coast aged care facility operator confirming that proposed new federal rules mean that some people will have to sell their homes if they want nursing home care. It says that the new laws finalised this week would mean single pensioners with no assets except their homes might have to sell their property if they need nursing home care.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Edith Morgan also makes the crucial point&mdash;a point that is obviously not understood by this government&mdash;that a bond develops between older people and their homes. The security of their own home is vitally linked to their health and wellbeing. She also makes this point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the knowledge that the family home awaits their return can be a final hope for continued life.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This hope for a continued life in your own home is of course lost as a result of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Edith Morgan is also worried that concern within a family over the potential loss of the family asset, the family home, if it is to be sold to secure entry to a nursing home, is the spectre of a trend all too prevalent in the United States, where privatised health care and user pays hold sway. This is the spectre of elder abuse and, in the most extreme manifestation, as Edith Morgan has brought to attention of the Australian people, granny dumping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The treasurer of the same organisation, Norah McGuire, also rejects the minister's assurance that the elderly would not have to sell their homes, describing the minister's assurances as `balderdash'. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are `very few' nursing home proprietors who would not demand a bond from vulnerable patients and the government would be unable to stop patients being pressured into selling.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is nothing in the draft legislation that would stop them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Maybe we are going to see, from a comment on the Terry Laidler program yesterday, the minister finally stop stonewalling on this point. The interviewer asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But if they are single pensioners living in a home that they own, that home will be taken into account in assessing the assets they might have to admit themselves to nursing homes?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The minister said: `That may well be.' Minister, maybe we are finally getting there; maybe you will admit that people's homes will be taken into account when they need to go into a nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the minister needs to consider some of the other implications of this failure to exempt the family home from the assets test. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="767"> The Pensioners and Superannuants Federation also raised the point that including the family home in the assets test is likely to see a dramatic escalation in the size of the entry fee for nursing homes. In fact, Minister, because your legislation fails to place any cap on the amount of entry fee&mdash;so there is no cap on the amount of entry fee that can be charged&mdash;it is likely that the entry fee will become the total of a person's assets. In most cases, this will be the total value of the family home less $22,500.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the situation in Victoria. The average price of a home in Victoria, according to the Real Estate Institute, is $155,400. The entry contribution then could be $132,900. Is that the level of entry contribution that people will be expected to make? The Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation are very concerned that this will be so. Their media release from earlier this week states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pensioners will be devastated when they find they are expected to hand over all but $22 000 simply in order to get the care they need in a nursing home. Most will be extremely reluctant to move&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">this is the critical point&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">if it means selling their home. Usually, it is their only asset.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What this will inevitably lead to is two tiers of care. Nursing homes will of course be attractive to those who can pay the most in entry fees. They will get in first. Those who can pay only a small fee will be passed over, let alone those who have no money to pay any fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister is setting up a system whereby she will be gutting the assets of average Australians as they struggle to ensure themselves a reasonable standard of care. The minister is trying to hoodwink the Australian people by representing the need to go into a nursing home as merely a change in accommodation. She has persistently refused to acknowledge the point that nursing homes are for people who can no longer look after themselves. They are designed to care for people. They are not an accommodation option. I draw the minister's attention to the crowning irony in the draft bill which she has released for 10 days public comment.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are only two things that are clear from this draft legislation. One is that people will have to sell their homes to gain nursing home care, particularly the 90 per cent who are single when they go in. As a result of this user&hyphen;pays approach we will have access and decent care for those who can pay and much poorer care for those who cannot pay or have only a small amount to pay.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I greatly welcome this opportunity to address the House today on this matter and to highlight this government's aged care initiatives and again correct the inaccuracies, mischief, pain and heartache that this shadow minister causes out there in the community by not coming clean. We need to assess Labor's record in government with respect to aged care. Where was their record? I brought into this House before their policy when they went to the last election. There were eight solitary paragraphs. That was the sum total of that party's aged care policy as we went to the last election. Eight paragraphs is the best they could offer as their solution to a system that is breaking down, that is in disrepair in the nursing home sector where people are crowded into rooms of four beds or more and where the facilities in some cases are fire traps and hazards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the system that that party presided over for over a decade when they were in government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was introduced by you in this parliament in 1988 by way of an instrument in this House&mdash;and I have all the background on its introduction. It was supported by us because it was sound, sensible policy to address an improvement in accommodation for the frail in our community. Those who presided over this two&hyphen;tiered system allowed that to continue.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> People in hostels were asked to make a significant contribution towards the cost of their accommodation while those in nursing homes who were not had to suffer the consequences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite also presided over a system where if you went into a hostel you were also subject to a variable fee charging practice by the provider. That was totally uncapped. You could earn any amount of money over the free 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> area and the provider had the licence, under that regime, to take dollar for dollar outside the free area without any restriction or caps. That was the two&hyphen;tiered system that these people presided over. Nursing home residents did not have to pay any such fee so if you were sent to one facility you paid it and in another facility you did not. We all know that the profile in those facilities has changed dramatically so that the edges are now blurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, in terms of the condition of the accommodation facilities, these two facilities also differed in that if you were lucky enough to be assessed to go into a hostel you often went into one that was modern, that would provide the dignity, comfort and security of your own room with an en&hyphen;suite bathroom, but if you went into one of these run&hyphen;down, dilapidated old nursing homes, you were probably going to be thrust into a ward of four or more people, with no private bathroom facilities, no dignity and no privacy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The system that those opposite presided over was a disgrace but what was more disgraceful was the fact that they sat on their hands, they procrastinated, they knew that there was pressure building in the community, that we were not meeting the needs of the community and that there was no flexibility in the system as it stands today&mdash;and they did nothing about it. Not only did they put in place no plans to address the pressures in the system today, they did not plan for the future. We have an ageing population. That is a fact and these pressures will continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a government we have a duty and a responsibility to care for those in the community who are frail and vulnerable. These people had no concern. They professed to have a concern but they had no concern, otherwise they would not allow people to be sitting and lying in fire traps, and in disgraceful conditions that we see in some nursing homes in this country today. You are a disgrace. Again, there was the hypocrisy about the assets testing. Let me make just one point: guess who presided over and applied the assets test when they were in government?

He went on to say that Professor Gregory estimated that it would cost half a billion dollars to bring aged care facilities in Australia up to scratch. Dr Suter went on further to say that the Labor government thought it was too horrific to contemplate. They did not have the gumption to address such a serious and important measure in this community. He went on to say that, because it was too horrific for the Labor government to tackle, very little was done in terms of funding: what was required to redevelop these buildings and bring them up to proper standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I quote also from comments made by my colleague Senator Woodley yesterday on 5AN news. Senator Woodley said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are being condemned by the member for Jagajaga for failing to exempt homes of single, older Australians from the assets test. This government has not introduced the assets test, as I said. I think the most important thing that has happened since we took government just over 11 months ago is that we have consulted with this sector. That consultation process has gone on since I became the minister. When we laid out our blueprint and our vision for the future of aged care I set up four working groups which comprised people from the leading consumer groups, including the superannuants and pensioners association that the shadow minister has been frequently quoting from. They had a representative on the working groups; they had an opportunity to have their input and they did. They received consideration and they were given concessions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a very good and constructive consultative process in laying down the implementation details for this particular bill. We have been criticised today for not having some of those details, but the fact is that the people on the other side, when they were in government, did not bother to bring out a draft exposure bill. They just brought the bill into the House and said to people: `That is what you are going to get.' They did not consult. I am told on good authority that very 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> little consulting was done with the industry in any shape or form. It is not unusual to bring a bill to the House that sets down the main principles of policy and then to fill in some of the details, as appropriate, with subordinate legislation that will come behind it. That will also be available and will be laid on the table.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have listened and we have consulted. In my deliberation of and response to the working group's first paper to me I have tried to balance the interests of both the consumers and the providers in our community: the consumers because, clearly, the whole policy should be developed on the basis that they should be our first concern&mdash;and they are&mdash;and the providers because, in order for the providers to give the care that is so vital in these nursing homes and hostels, they also need to be able to run viable facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been disappointed to hear the criticisms being levelled at those in the facility who are the care givers because these are a group of highly professional, dedicated people in our community&mdash;both the trained nurses and those who are the care givers are a very special group. As I have moved around this country visiting the many facilities, I have been touched and deeply moved by that dedication to the job, sometimes under the most difficult of circumstances. These are the people who are expected to give the same level of care and do give the same level of care because of their professional dedication to all members of the public who enter nursing home and hostel facilities. All residents get the same dedicated care because the carers are professionals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government's total commitment is to continue to support the nursing staff and the care giving staff in these facilities to care for people based on their need to be cared for, not on whether or not they have the means to pay for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are doing is responsible. We are saying to the Australian public that we are dealing with a difficult situation in terms of the financial provision for the future.

I am concerned that ever since the government announced that the elderly of Australia would be forced to pay at least $26,000 to gain a nursing home bed, we have heard nothing from the minister about this, and today her explanation was no exception to that previous comment I made, which I will not repeat. Each time the minister has walked to the dispatch box, she has told the people of Australia, `No, nobody will have to sell their homes to gain a bed in a nursing home.' What do we do when those statements are made? We immediately race out, switch on the TVs, listen to the radio, read the newspapers and listen to the people who run this country's nursing homes, the pensioner groups, the peak bodies for the aged, who are saying exactly the opposite to what the minister is trying to have us believe. They are saying in very clear voices, `The elderly of this country will have to sell up if they want to get a bed in a nursing home.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the one hand, we have the minister and a couple of her barely convincing cronies 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> saying one thing and, on the other, we have the majority of the spokespeople for nursing homes and for the aged saying another. Who do we believe? I have news for the people in the gallery and for the people on the government benches. We in opposition believe the people and not the falsities spread in the debate today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the government's legislation, the only people exempt from having to sell their home in order to raise the money to move into a nursing home are those who share a house with a spouse or a long&hyphen;term carer. Okay. So what happens when you go looking for that part of the bill which says people living alone are also exempt from selling their homes in order to move into a nursing home? You start to become just a little bit concerned for the elderly of this country and more than just a little angry and disbelieving of the minister because it is not there. It does not exist. Nowhere in the government's draft legislation is the family home exempt from the assets test for a pensioner living alone in their own home. The minister is well aware of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ninety per cent of the people who are now admitted to our nursing homes do not have a spouse living with them, nor do they have a carer. This means that all of those people within that 90 per cent bracket who own their own home, upon moving into a nursing home, will have to sell. There can be no other interpretation. It is what the minister has left out of the legislation that condemns her and her government, not what has been put in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Seventy per cent of pensioners have as their one asset the family home. So when these people are presented with this legislation which says, `Those who have assets over $22,500 will now have to pay to get into a nursing home,' there are not many choices left open to them, are there? Not one question did the minister answer in this regard during this debate today, nor at any time when questions have been raised  directly to her in this House about this legislation. So for those living alone, it is either going to be the family home or it is going to be no nursing home bed. It is that clear cut.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="772">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has really been playing with semantics. She knows these figures. I guarantee that they would be tattooed on the back of her eyelids. She may well say that this government will not force anyone to sell their home, but she knows and the government knows that the majority of people requiring nursing home care will have no choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister said about the government's aged care package on Monday, in answer to a question from the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is about delivering comfort. It is about delivering safety and security. It is about access to care based on people's need, not based on people's means.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I put it to the minister&mdash;that is, I would if she were in the House to listen to her own matter of public importance&mdash;that for these people their homes are the very definition of security for them. Go and speak to the aged in the community. Their homes are the very definition to them of safety and comfort, especially when they are sick or weak enough to require a bed in a nursing home. Yet this policy manoeuvres them into selling up lock, stock and barrel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet, despite the only interpretation one can draw from this legislation, the minister will not fess up&mdash;not even to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, when you asked the question&mdash;and admit what to everybody is the bleeding obvious. So what are the other people in the community saying? The member for the Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), our shadow minister, has touched on what Mrs Norah McGuire, the Treasurer of the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, has said. I would advise the minister to go and talk to this woman because she has been concerned for a long term about this piece of legislation. She was upset enough to label what the minister has said as `balderdash'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister also made a comment about what Reverend Harry Herbert, the general secretary of the Uniting Church's New South Wales board for social responsibility, said about this matter. I would like to remind the minister, in case she does not know this either, that they happen to be one of the biggest providers of nursing homes in this country. What did he have to say? The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minister quoted part of it. The member for Jagajaga at least bought the truth to the matter. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most elderly people don't have a lot of cash reserves, and their main asset is their home.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Ipso facto, the elderly will just have to sell their one and only asset to get into a nursing home. So the nursing home industry admits it, the aged peak bodies admit it, why will the minister not admit what is the obvious truth about the legislation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can only think that she has not come forward because she is too ashamed. She does not want to be the minister who presides over an aged care policy which will see our frail and sick elderly in our community go through the trauma and the emotional upheaval of selling their one and only asset in order to receive what we have come to expect in this country as a basic health right&mdash;a bed in a nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what it comes down to. I do not blame her. I would not want to carry the bag for this piece of political immorality either. Every time she gets up to the dispatch box in this House to deny what has become so obvious to the rest of Australia her frontbench offers a bit of support saying, `Get into it, Judi.' I will let the minister in on a secret. We watch your frontbench and see it in their eyes and on their faces when your back is turned that they are relieved that you are wearing it and not them. They are relieved that they are not carrying the can for this piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can tell you, minister, that you will carry the stigma of being the minister responsible for this policy through the rest of your political career. There are still some things in this world, in our society, which should be considered above being placed at the mercy of market forces, above user pays, above profit and loss, and a bed in a nursing home should be one of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely there has to be a balance between economic realities and what we consider to be the decent and the equitable hallmarks of a civil society. Surely there are some aspects of our society which should be protected from the government's obsession with bottom lines in order for them to be able to look in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="773"> mirror in the morning and feel that they are not ashamed of their actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After a full life contributing to our society, the elderly amongst us should not have these demands placed upon them. They go to nursing homes sick, frail and often mentally deficient. Some 60 per cent arrive direct from a hospital. How can we call our society civil if we say to these people, `Oh, sorry, before we let you in here for what might be the final days of your life, you're going to have to hand us your front door keys, otherwise thanks very much&mdash;no bed'? How can the minister submit these already weak and fragile people to this kind of unconscionable harassment day in and day out just so she can have her way?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By its policy on nursing homes, the Howard government is attacking the elderly in the most sinister and reprehensible of ways. They are plunging them into insecurity and fear at a time when they should be confident of receiving adequate care irrespective of their means.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I came into public life because I have an agenda of things which I wish to see achieved. Amongst them is better care for older Australians. The previous government would not consult, it certainly would not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> listen and it was not able to see a vision of aged care 20 years from now, which is what this government and, in particular, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) are all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, honourable members and Australians, I would like to paint a picture for you. We are living in a country with an economy growing at about 3&half; per cent, with underlying growth closer to three per cent. There are 7.8 million people who are working in this country and 6.2 million people relying on some form of social security benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, about 13 per cent of the population is over the age of 65. By the year 2030, it will be 19 per cent and by 2051 a third of us will be over the age of 65. At the moment, about five per cent of us end up needing aged residential care, eight per cent of us over the age of 75 years will suffer from dementia and our age dependency ratio will double over the next 35 years from 5.3:1 in 1993 to 2.6:1 in the year 2040. The National Commission of Audit, for example, estimates that over the next 40 years we will have to spend another 10 per cent of gross domestic product, above and beyond real growth from present levels of expenditure, on the health and welfare costs of ageing alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, taxation receipts on PAYE taxpayers is less than all the money we spend on health, education and welfare. Professor Bob Gregory's 1994 stage 2 aged care review, initiated but ignored by the ideologically paralysed Labor government, preoccupied as it was at the time with a republic and other such priorities, found that for this vulnerable, non&hyphen;vocal group of people, amongst other things, a billion dollars is required to be spent now to bring nursing homes up to health, design and outcome standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1987, irrespective of the accommodation received, a nursing home resident, irrespective of their income, pays a set amount representing 87&half; per cent of the age pension, meaning that the wealthiest person in the country can be accommodated in a nursing home for that rate of payment. Yet as Gregory told us, three years ago nursing home 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="774"> residents had income above the pension totalling in excess $238 million a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The system over which the previous government presided locked in numerous perverse incentives and, in many cases, forced standards of care down. Some 75 per cent of homes, according to Gregory, need to be fixed or completely rebuilt to meet Australian design standards; 70 per cent similarly to meet outcome standards; 13 per cent, according to Gregory's report at the time, did not meet fire standards; and, as is the case at the moment, 39 per cent of residents in nursing homes in Australia live in a bay which has at least four residents contained within it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask Australians, and some on the other side in particular, to ask themselves whether have they ever been into a nursing home. Have they been into a nursing home, as I have on numerous occasions, at 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock in the morning? If they have, they should ask themselves the question: are these the circumstances under which I would wish to live? Are these the circumstances under which I would be happy to have my mother or a member of my family live? I can assure you that many things I have seen in the early hours of the morning in nursing homes are not consistent with the dignity, comfort and security which the government is now trying to offer with a long-term vision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot have it both ways. You cannot snuggle into bed with two per cent to three per cent underlying growth, denying taxation, industrial relations, transport and social services reform, and then on the other hand say, `We want free aged care. We want free health care. We want free education.' You cannot do it. You are spending the future. You are seeking to indulge too many people in Australia at the moment at the expense of our children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party introduced the hostel system in 1988. It is the hostel system upon which this program is based, yet entry fees and variable daily fees were uncapped. Standards have skyrocketed as a result. About half of these residents in hostels at the moment would actually qualify for nursing home care. The level of dependency in hostels has rapidly increased over the last decade, yet the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hostel subsidy at the moment is $6,892 whereas a person with the same level of dependency has been receiving a government subsidy of around $26,793.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nursing homes, which still generally look after those with the greatest needs, have no capacity whatsoever, except in the three per cent of the market currently covered by exempt bed licences, to charge an entry contribution or fee. Typical ALP logic: make everybody the same going in as you suck on your chardonnay and turn a blind eye to the outcomes at the other end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From 1 July this year, income testing will replace the current ad hoc arrangements. Currently, nursing home residents pay a maximum of 85 per cent of the age pension, whether they are millionaires or age pensioners, whilst hostel residents, 50 per cent of whom need just as much care, currently pay open-ended fees with no upper limit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The income tested fee is for 25c in the dollar above the pension area of $49 a week to a maximum of $60 a day. Those who will not be asked to pay an accommodation bond include full or part-pensioners who have not owned their own home in the past year and who have assets under $22,500, for singles, and $45,000, for couples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government also protects those who have a spouse, a partner, a carer or a dependent child living in the house. Some $2,600 can be drawn down each year for up to five years to a maximum of $13,000. That money and the interest that is earned on it has to be spent on the care of the person who derives the benefit from it. It cannot be taken as profit by the proprietor. It has to be spent only on a home that has met sufficient standards. It can only be spent on improving the accommodation in which that person&mdash;and some of them may be our own mothers&mdash;is actually living.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can have up to six months to pay the accommodation bond or you can take the option of paying it as a daily or a monthly fee, or you can even, as the Labor Party introduced in 1988 for hostels, take it as a debt against your estate. As well as that, the government will be introducing mandatory 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="775"> prudential arrangements to see that people's investments are protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To give you an example of what this is all about, the very people for whom this will provide the greatest benefit are the people whose sacrifices made this country what it is. They lived through wars and depression. They made enormous sacrifices and they are people who count their responsibilities ahead of their rights, unlike some on the other side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I spoke to a group of some 200 people affected by this in my electorate, and I explained to them what it was all about and what the government's long-term vision was, one woman got up and said, `I wasn't too sure about all this when I first heard about it, but then I heard my son having a conversation with my husband. My husband asked my son, "What do you intend to do with the house when we die?" and he said, "I'm going to sell it and then have an overseas trip, buy a car and invest the rest."' Then she said to me, `Once I heard that, I thought that, if I have to spend a little bit of what we have on giving my husband and me better care now while we are alive, that is something we ought to be supporting.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also draw the attention of the House to comments made by some of those in the industry, those who understand the issues. Maureen Lister, for example, the Executive Director of Aged Care Australia said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We'll be able to see quite significant improvements in the buildings of nursing homes and everyone knows that that is gravely needed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further to that, on 6WF Maureen Lister again said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We've had entry contributions in the hostel system for some 10 years, and I don't believe residents of hostels would ever say they've been discriminated against on the basis of the amount of assets that they've had.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have found in my own electorate, for example, that I have had more concern expressed to me about this decision by people my age than I have by the very people who are actually going to benefit from the decision the government has made. We are actually setting in place for the future, which will not be repealed by the opposition if they ever win 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government, a long-term vision in Australia where those who can afford to are actually required to make a contribution toward their care so that those who are working in Australia know that when they get to that end of their lives when they need care, when they have no choice, there is a place available for them and it is a place of quality in which they would like to live.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government spent more looking after criminals in Australia than it did looking after people in nursing homes. We are going to make sure that people in nursing homes and residential care get better care than they have had for at least a decade. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to continue my contribution in the consideration in detail stage on the Productivity Commission Bill. I was at the stage of drawing to the attention of the House section 8(1)(a), which quite clearly covers what the opposition are putting forward, and that says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to improve the overall economic performance of the economy . . . to achieve higher living standards for all members of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The operative words are `for all members of the Australian community' and the `overall economic performance'. I want to use as one example of that the five interest rate drops in the 11 months since the Howard government has been in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) has put forward indicates an absence of understanding of what that clause 8(1)(a) does. It does cover everything. Interest rates have dropped substantially. Interest rates are available universally and they flow on to regional areas as well as to the metropolitan areas and the city centres of Australia. These drops have had a substantial impact on the improvement of many regional areas throughout Australia. We now have the lowest interest rates since 1974, far lower than we had under the previous government, at 7.55 per cent, which was announced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) today&mdash;a substantial drop of 2.95 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under clause 8(1)(a), those interest rates are available in regional areas of Australia, without the opposition's amendment. I want to particularly draw the House's attention to the fact that, if you compare that with the previous government's record and the impact that interest rates had then on the regional economy&mdash;when your rates varied between eight per cent and rose up to levels of 21 and 22 per cent at their worst&mdash;the flow&hyphen;on to regional areas occurred then and was quite significant. In fact, it was extremely damaging to regional areas and sent many hundreds of small businesses bankrupt. As a result, your policies created massive unemployment losses. I am saying to you that you have overlooked the fact that clause 8(1)(a) covers every section of the community.</PARA>

If you say the general policy guidelines are so encompassing and simply reflect that which was picked up off the Industry Commission, why does your own reference have to make specific reference to regional development? That is our point.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you really believe you have the interests of regional Australia at heart, why not require, through the legislation, the new body to have to have regard in its decisions to the impact on regional industry and regional jobs?

You introduce mickey mouse schemes. You have schemes that pilot. You have 100,000 youth unemployed and the best you are coming up with is a pilot for 1,000. This is your problem.

You have flattened that economic activity. Now you have a report out from the Industry Commission&mdash;to be the Productivity Commission&mdash;that recommends further flattening of the automotive industry in this country if the majority of recommendations are adopted.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make a couple of points on the comments that have been made during this debate. The first is in response to a comment which I think was made by the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor). The Treasurer does not bring the cabinet submission in from the Productivity Commission. It is actually the relevant minister who does that. For example, in regard to the automotive report, it will be the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) who will bring that in. I am just correcting the factual information which was wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another argument raised was that the Productivity Commission could draft its own terms of reference. The Productivity Commission does not draft the terms of reference for public inquiries.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, another opposition speaker said that and I am just correcting it. Drafting the terms of reference is the respon

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come specifically to the amendment, because quite a bit of reference has been made to it in regard to the automotive industry. In the draft report on the automotive industry, the Productivity Commission is seeking more analysis of regional effects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are quite appreciative in some inquiries of the importance of what the regional parts of Australia need to have put before them. So regional Australia is taken into account in these matters. What we are putting down here are the general overall guidelines for the running of the Productivity Commission, and I think they are quite appropriate.

It essentially requires, through legislation, the Productivity Commission to have regard to not only Australia's international obligations but also the progress made by Australia's trading partners in reducing both tariff and non-tariff barriers. This proposition argues that our industries should not be subjected to unilateral disarmament. It is the proposition that says our industries are prepared to participate and contribute to the discipline and rigour of breaking down the world trade barriers but that they should not be the only ones doing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the rhetoric that those on the other side go to when they seek to criticise the Productivity Commission's report into the automotive industry. They share the sentiments that we are trying to reflect in this amendment to the legislation, yet they are not prepared to back it by way of legislative change. In other words, it is lip-service, not commitment. They want to be able to get themselves off the hook out there and say, `We think we should have regard to what our trading partners are doing.' If they believe it, let them vote for it. Let them support the amendment that requires the Productivity Commission to have regard to that consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that, if you look at the automotive industry report, you can see yet again the fact that the Productivity Commission says, `Yes, the car plan of Labor has been effective. Yes, it involved a reduction in the tariff levels. It also involved an export facilitation scheme that was very successful. But, having been successful, we believe that it should be ended.' That is the conclusion of the Productivity Commission. It is not with any regard to what the rest of the world does or the impact on regional Australia. The purpose of our amendments is to require them to have that regard.</PARA>

It is very clear that the coalition parties see competitive neutrality as a one&hyphen;way street that is designed for private sector organisations to make complaints against unfair advantages of the public sector, but not designed for the reverse&mdash;that is, the opportunity for public sector organisations to make complaints about instances where they are prohibited from fair competition in the marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provisions as they stand reflect the coalition's ideological obsession with private ownership. They work on the basis that only private ownership can achieve desirable social and economic goals. They see no legitimate role for an active public sector. I would have thought that by any common understanding of the two words `competitive neutrality' one could expect the competition to be neutral; that is, the public sector should not have unfair advantages in competition against the private sector and, just as much, it should not have unfair disadvantages. So the purposes of my amendments&mdash;three in total&mdash;are to entrench that particular purpose, to make sure that competition between public utilities and organisations is absolutely neutral and fair and to ensure that competitive neutrality is, in effect, a two&hyphen;way street and not a one&hyphen;way process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the second reading debate I listened to the member for Braddon (Mr Miles), who was again in the chamber representing the government on this matter even though he has no economic responsibilities within his executive duties. He was making the point that the words as they stand in the Productivity Commission Bill reflect the intergovernmental agreement that was arrived at by the former government. He did not put it exactly in those terms. He just said, `These are the words that were taken from the former government.' Because the Treasurer (Mr Costello) was not here and the member for Braddon has so little expertise or background in any of these matters, he was not telling the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> House the full truth; he was not telling the House each of the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He should have mentioned that it was an intergovernmental agreement arrived at in April 1995 that carried the words he quoted to the House. He would also appreciate that an intergovernmental agreement in April 1995 carried the signatures of six conservative heads of government and three ALP heads of government. As I understand the proposition for competitive neutrality and policy principles, (3)(i) was a clause inserted at the insistence of the Victorian government. It was the Kennett government that wrote those words into the intergovernmental agreement. Then the member for Braddon further refused to explain to the House or read out the next clause, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each party is free to determine its own agenda for the implementation of competitive neutrality principles.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As I understand it, the former government was locked into the words in clause (3)(i) that were written and commissioned by the Kennett government. It was the Labor Party, then in federal government, that insisted on each party being free to determine its own agenda for the implementation of competitive neutrality principles. I can assure the House that, if we had been in government throughout the course of 1996, we would have come up with a very different Commonwealth competitive neutrality policy statement from the one released by Mr Costello in June 1996. I invite members of the House to check the words given to the House by the member for Braddon against the terms and conditions of this policy statement. The statement says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Competitors of government businesses, and others, will be able to have Commonwealth business activities investigated by the Productivity Commission where they consider that competitive neutrality arrangements are not being applied.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">No mention of the reverse. The Labor Party in government, in a Commonwealth competitive neutrality statement, would have also applied the reverse principle&mdash;that is, government instrumentalities could have made a complaint to the Productivity Commission if they were being unfairly restricted in competing against the private sector. The statement then talks about the role of the complaints 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="783"> mechanism, and it lists three roles for that mechanism:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;respond to concerns that government businesses are not complying with competitive neutrality principles;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;advise on whether resource allocation distortions are being caused by significant government businesses; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;consider whether Government businesses have net competitive advantages resulting from public ownership.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, no mention of net competitive disadvantages. It is those disadvantages that the Howard government is so determined to inflict upon the public sector. We have had government backbenchers saying that they do not believe the Government Publishing Service should be able to compete against the private sector. They say that the private sector should compete against government but not the reverse. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had government backbenchers saying those things. They think competitive neutrality is a one&hyphen;way street. The private sector can compete against government, but not the reverse. We have had the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) placing a restriction on the Australian Protective Service. They are no longer allowed to tender for private security work. So he is allowing the private sector to tender against all the work of the Australian Protective Service, but they are not allowed to do the same thing by the same standard as the private sector. They have been barred from tendering for any private security work. So this government sees competitive neutrality as a one&hyphen;way street. That is just the backdoor way, the unfair way, of shrinking the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government do not believe in a level playing field of competition; they do not believe in competition which is neutral. They believe in one ideologically driven and inadequate view of the world that only the private sector knows and does best. That is totally unfair to any decent principle. The best way to work out the role of the public sector is to adopt a philosophical and pragmatic assessment of where it can play a useful role. Once that role is established, if there is to be competition against the private sector, we should make sure that the competition is on 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the fabled level playing field and is completely neutral and fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is not applying that principle. I believe it is very important that the House adopt these amendments to make sure that in clause 21 competitive neutrality is a two-way street. For instance, look at clause 21(1). It says a person may complain to the commission, but it does not allow a government authority to complain to the Productivity Commission about the sorts of restrictions that it might be facing. Have a look at clause 21(3). It talks about net competitive advantages over their competitors, but it does not talk about net competitive disadvantages that the public sector might face. Further, I am proposing to add, among the list of complaints that might be made to the commission, the following words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a particular Commonwealth business or business activity faces net competitive disadvantage and restraints in its capacity to compete against the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So these Labor Party amendments are sensible. They live up to the literal meaning of the words `competitive neutrality'. They apply a neutral set of competition rules in instances where public and private sector organisations are engaged in an active market. What could be more fair and reasonable than that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just cannot understand why a government that produces a competitive neutrality statement and talks about competitive neutrality in the Productivity Commission Bill does not put in place guidelines that are neutral in terms of competition. Surely it is not reasonable for the private sector to make complaints when the public sector can make no such complaints about instances where it is restricted. The Australian Protective Service should be allowed to tender for work of a private security nature. If the Attorney&hyphen;General does not allow them, they should be able to make a complaint to the Productivity Commission. Under the guidelines before the House at the moment they would not be able to do that.</PARA>

His proof is to read from a Liberal Party document of June 1996. He has got no proof, he has got no documentation. I had a conversation during the last division with the former Treasurer, Mr Willis. I asked him about Labor's progressing of competitive neutrality statements, and he said there was basically no consideration of these matters during our time in government, that we

We have a commonsense amendment to move&mdash;the idea that competitive neutrality should mean neutral competition.

Why should the public sector not be competing on a truly level playing field, without unfair advantages and disadvantages in its operation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Braddon has made a claim to try to disparage my amendments, to make 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> suggestions about what the Labor Party was doing in 1994. He cannot substantiate that in any shape or form, and the ministerial code of conduct clearly requires the Treasurer to be here. For a party&mdash;the Liberal Party&mdash;that made so much noise about respect for the parliament, I could not imagine anything more disrespectful than the way in which this Productivity Commission Bill is being handled. It makes it very hard for the Labor Party and indeed for all parliamentarians to get fair consideration of constructive amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we bat on, wanting to do the right thing by the public sector. When it comes to the ideology expressed in the Commission of Audit, the way in which so many ministers are trying to wind back the public sector by not allowing it fair competition and fair access to markets, when it comes to the loss of jobs and the loss of investment that comes out of that attitude, particularly in regional Australia, we stand on strong ground. We cannot have proper and fair process in the House of Representatives, but morally and intellectually our argument is superior. I hope in the fullness of time the Australian public understands that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The narrow Liberal ideology that only the private sector knows and does best is replicated all over the country. The Kennett government has adopted this philosophy. For instance, it will not allow public hospital pathology units to compete against the private sector, but private pathology can compete against public hospitals. As the member for Denison indicated, the Kennett government will not allow local government to compete against the private sector under any circumstances, yet it invites a ridiculous and arbitrary rule of how much private sector work local councils must contract out.

They talk about real jobs, private sector activity&mdash;all the vacuous rhetoric of their side of politics&mdash;but the truth is, if you want to do something about insecurity, if you want to do something about the impact of globalisation, the answer does not lie in the private sector alone. The answer does not lie in rampant individualism. The answer does not lie in winding back social capital. It does not lie in further fragmenting society. It lies in the active role of government. It lies in collectivist institutions looking after the collective interest. That is why fair competition and competitive neutrality for the public sector is so critical. It should be one of the pillars on which good governance is built in the 1990s. For all the debates we have in this place, unless the public sector gets a fair crack at market opportunities and a fair chance to compete, then it is very hard for government to use its countervailing role, its instruments of public policy to get the best public outcomes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will. I wanted to make the point about the difficult position the government has now placed the Productivity Commission in. They advised the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration on 2 December that they are expecting to receive competitive neutrality complaints from public sector organisations. I asked Mr Pitkethly of the Productivity Commission the following question at that public hearing:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If, for instance, the Government Printing Service complained to you that they have been barred from competing for private sector work but the private sector is encouraged to compete for their work, would that be regarded as a legitimate complaint?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr Pitkethly</EMPHASIS> &mdash;I think so.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that the AGPS could come to us and say, `Yes, we are competing with one hand tied behind 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="789"> our back compared to the position of our domestic competitors.'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It seems to me that the government now has a most awkward situation on its hands. The Productivity Commission has been gearing up all its work, all its administration and all its printed material on the basis of the supposition that public sector organisations could in fact lodge complaints with it regarding competitive disadvantages and restraints they might face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raise that matter to try to ease the burden of the parliamentary secretary. He has shots coming at him from all sides. He does not have the Treasurer (Mr Costello) here to try to help him out. He has now placed the Productivity Commission in a terrible position where all their preparations for the administration of competitive neutrality have been thrown in the air by the government's faulty bill and its inability to accept the Labor Party's sensible amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The best thing the parliamentary secretary could do in response to that&mdash;his only get out, his only debating point in this consideration&mdash;was to say that Labor agreed to something in the middle of 1994, and his proof of that was a Liberal Party document dated June 1996, which he quoted from. This is a sort of sleight of hand. This is a new form of logic, an argument the House has not yet seen. It is the osmosis of how one party's document two years after the event proves what another party did in 1994. It does not make sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Productivity Commission now stands with a problem on its hands, given the second reading and the consideration in detail. I would urge the parliamentary secretary to correct this anomaly before this bill passes the third reading stage. It is now the only sensible way out. He has a glazed look. He does not know what to do, but I would urge him to correct the problem as soon as possible.</PARA></SPEECH>

It does seem that there has

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliamentary secretary displays no signs of moving to discuss this with the Treasurer, but it would be of assistance to us were he to seek some instructions in relation to this. If the Treasurer were here, he could give a response to us directly. It does no honour to this House to find that the parliamentary secretary stands up and says that in 1994 there was a document in existence which suggested that the Labor Party adhered to this particular vision of how the principles of competitive neutrality ought to work. He has not been able to produce any source of it. He says he was so advised and is directing us to a document which his own government produced to source this. This is a fairly cynical act to say the least. As the member for Werriwa says, worthy of the Demidenko label.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should say that it is a little puzzling that we do not have the opportunity of the Treasurer's coming to the dispatch box to actually say on what basis he has sent his parliamentary secretary down here to make the allegations he has made. Secondly, we are not able to address this question which could well be resolved to the satisfaction of members on both sides of this House were we to actually get a commitment to the principles that I am sure the Productivity Commission and the community at large thought they were getting when this government spoke about these lofty principles of competitive neutrality.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Dobell moving forthwith that the consideration of the Telecommunications Bill 1996 and the associated telecommunications measures should not be proceeded with until after the government has responded to the report on telecommunications reform by the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I acknowledge that there is an agreement with the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles). I thank the Chief Government Whip also for agreeing to allow two opposition members to speak for five minutes on this particular motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason the opposition is moving this motion is to make the clear point that we believe that this legislation should not be before the House of Representatives when the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee is still dealing with the issues that go to the heart of this legislation. We think that after the committee has finished its work, after it has tabled and made its report public, and after the government has responded to the recommendations of that committee is the time when this parliament, and in particular the House of Representatives, should be considering the detail of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that leaves some difficulties for the industry because the legislation is meant to take effect from 1 July 1997. I think no&hyphen;one is to blame except the Minister for Communi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cations and the Arts, Senator Alston, for the government being in this pickle. They are in a pickle because Senator Alston just could not help himself when he was appointed Minister for Communications and the Arts last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We set out on this path of reform in telecommunications way back in the early 1980s. At that time it was agreed that we would move to full and open competition on 1 July 1997. During the last government I had the honour of serving as Minister for Communications and the Arts. Towards the end of 1994 we outlined the Labor government's plans to go through a process of consultation and drawing up of legislation that would provide the transition to full and open competition on 1 July 1997. The plan was for legislation to be passed by the end of 1995 or the middle of 1996 to give the industry at least a year's notice of what the law would be, so that people could make their plans for investment and start to hire their staff&mdash;so that they could hit the ground running, probably before 1 July 1997. As the new law took effect on that date we would have hoped that we could have had the most rapid development of a more competitive communications market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, what happened was that after Senator Alston was appointed minister, on the election of the Howard government, he took every possible measure to pour scorn on the former government's efforts, and to pour scorn, in some cases, on the hard work which had been done by many members of the industry, representatives of consumers, the carriers, the ACCC and others, who had sat down with me over a period of more than 18 months, working on the detail of this legislation, coming up with a whole series of compromises that meant no&hyphen;one got everything they asked for. But everyone, I think, came to the conclusion by March 1996 that we had a legislative package that tried to strike the right balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Alston just could not help himself. He made foolish comments about the industry being totally opposed to the former government's legislation and he claimed that he was wiping the slate clean. It is a bit hard to understand the logic of those remarks when you now look at the legislative package that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="791"> is about to go before that chamber. Nevertheless, Senator Alston had his chance to grandstand. The result of his grandstanding was another period of delay of up to 12 months. We are now in a pickle where a Senate committee is investigating what the legislative package would be at the very time that the legislative package is sought to be introduced and debated into the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that this is not good enough for a minister of the Crown. We think that the only people who will suffer as a result of Senator Aston's grandstanding is the industry. There will be a greater period of uncertainty before we finally know what the legislative package would be. For all those reasons, we believe that it would be best for this House if we delay consideration of this bill until the Senate committee has had an opportunity to finish its deliberations. For all those reasons, I put this motion before the House. We are very optimistic of having the government's support, but if we are not able to persuade them with the eloquence of our arguments, then we will move on to the debate on the legislative package.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very substantial package of legislation which entirely replaces the legislation which currently regulates the telecommunications industry and overhauls the current industry structure. It will have an enormous impact on the business plans of Telstra, Optus, potential carriers, service providers and, most importantly, consumers. Seemingly minor changes to key provisions, such as the competition rule in the Trade Practices Amendment Bill, the tariff provisions, the universal service obligations&mdash;all those things&mdash;will have a massive impact on the sale price of Telstra and will also affect all carriers and service providers investment decisions. They will dictate the speed of the rollout of what has been referred to as the information superhighway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people who should be most concerned to ensure that their interests are protected by the legislation are residents of rural and regional Australia. These consumers will be the ones who could be bypassed by the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> information superhighway unless there are airtight guarantees of universal access to its standard telephone service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For these reasons we believe it is appropriate that consideration of this bill should not proceed until after the government has responded to the report on telecommunications reform that it has received from the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Provided we can persuade the minor parties and Independents to vote in favour of amendments which the opposition will move in the Senate, the competitive model which the legislation puts in place could in fact result in lower prices, enhanced services and a greatly increased variety of services for many consumers, particularly large businesses and metropolitan consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the legislation which we currently have before us does not ensure that rural or regional Australia will receive these benefits. On the contrary, it is our view that rural and regional Australians will be substantially worse off than they are under the current telecommunications legislation. For those reasons, I support the motion moved by the member for Dobell (Mr Lee). I urge all honourable members to support the motion moved by the member for Dobell.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">If I provide copies of the proposed amendment to the clerks then the minister at the table, the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith) representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), who has to leave shortly, can take a copy with him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I would like to turn in detail to the legislation. The opposition remains strongly committed to the introduction of full and open competition on 1 July 1997 for the reasons I outlined in my speech in moving the suspension of standing orders. I outlined our concern that Senator Alston's grandstanding placed at risk the 1 July transition date for the introduction of full and open competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Over the last decade, the Labor Party has worked very hard to introduce full and open competition in telecommunications. It was the Hawke Labor government that made the decision to allow Optus to be the second carrier, to allow that licence to be issued. We now have Vodafone as the third competitor with mobile telephony. The Labor government also changed the law so that there could be service providers out there snapping at the heels of the major carriers.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several years ago, in no small measure due to the efforts of the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, we had the government commit to the introduction of full and open competition on 1 July 1997. During our period of working through the best way to achieve more competition in telecommunications, it was the Labor Party's firm view that one of the premises of our approach to telecommunications should be that Telstra remained in public ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that in keeping Telstra as an entity owned by the government we could ensure that there was a large carrier out there making sure that people who live in the bush, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people with disabilities, were not left out; that people who, if left to market forces would have to pay very large sums of money for basic telecommunications services, were not left behind. We wanted to make sure that people who perhaps need to have special equipment can have it at an affordable price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was our view that by keeping Telstra 100 per cent government owned we could ensure that the government ultimately could be held responsible if people in the bush were not looked after or if people with disabilities could not purchase equipment at a reasonable price. For all those reasons, the former government worked very hard at developing a legislative package that sought to move Australia in a rational way towards a more open and competitive market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to turn to some of the areas where the Labor opposition remains concerned about changes the government has made to the legislation. Perhaps I could begin with an area of great controversy, and that is the powers and immunities that carriers have had in the past&mdash;the exemption from the state and local government planning laws. I remind the House that during the last government there were some changes to what is known as the telecommunications national code. It was the former Labor government that gave local councils the ability to refer proposals to build mobile telephone communications towers, for example, to the secretary of the department of the environment. If a local council was against it, you could call in an umpire. In January 1996 the former Labor government outlined a proposal which would give local councils the power to force carriers to install pay TV cable underground in areas where the existing telecommunications cable was underground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand the detail of this legislative package and the government's announced intentions in this area, there will be a number of changes that we have reservations about. In particular, the government has decided to allow a three&hyphen;month extension beyond that 1 July cut&hyphen;off date for the powers and immunities that are granted to the carriers. That extension is apparently to allow broadband 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="794"> cable roll&hyphen;out to continue in areas where the roll&hyphen;out has allegedly begun.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before he left, the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games, who represents the Minister for Communications and the Arts in the House, said that he would be willing to answer any questions that the opposition raised during this debate. Knowing the efficiency and diligence of the officials in the box, I am sure they will make sure every one of these questions gets to the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we would like to know, for example, is how the government intends to define an area where broadband cable roll&hyphen;out is already taking place. Do they mean that because Optus Vision is about to begin&mdash;or has recently begun&mdash;roll&hyphen;out in Adelaide they can continue to install overhead aerial cable in Adelaide up until 1 October 1997? Or do they mean that if the roll&hyphen;out has begun in a particular local government area in Adelaide, then Optus is exempted from the normal rules until 1 October in that local government area? Or does the minister mean that to apply to a particular town or street? What does the government mean? I think the House would benefit from some clarification of that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also be keen to know what the government's position is on proposals to build mobile telephone communications towers in areas. At the moment the telecommunications code gives local councils the ability to refer off to the arbitrator&mdash;in effect, to the department of the environment&mdash;to look at proposals that local councils resolve that they are opposed to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that there are provisions outlined for the Australian Communications Authority to have the ability to hold public inquiries into particular proposals that might affect the environment. I would be keen to know what the threshold test will be for the ACA in determining whether proposals should be allowed to be approved or rejected. For example, is it to be a test of national interest?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several years ago, there was a lengthy dispute between Telstra and the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service about whether a mobile telephone tower could 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be erected on top of a mountain in one of the national parks on the New South Wales south coast. I believe it was strongly in the national interest that that tower be installed to fill a gap in the mobile telephone network used by fishermen on the New South Wales south coast. I was very pleased that Telstra, CEPA and the New South Wales environmental authorities were able to reach agreement about the very strict environmental conditions that were placed on Telstra to allow that tower to be built. That is an example of the construction of a tower being in the national interest. We made sure that we covered a gap that was placing the lives of fishermen, sailors and recreational sailors at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think you could argue that a communications tower in a suburban neighbourhood would be in the national interest. Often carriers have the ability to select from many different sites for a mobile telephone tower. It is becoming increasingly common that proposals near schools and densely populated residential areas are triggering strong opposition from local communities and councils. I would be keen for the minister to outline what will happen under the new government's regime if a local council resolves to oppose to a telecommunications tower.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also noticed in the legislation that there is a proposal for Austel to convene a public inquiry to determine what `low impact' will mean. There are certain exemptions given for low impact activities. I seek an assurance that no mobile telephone tower will ever be considered to be low impact, given the great lengths we have gone to in the past to ensure that there is a proper and thorough investigation of proposals for mobile telephone towers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the first point: we are quite concerned about this government's attempts to water down that 1 July 1997 cut&hyphen;off that I have outlined. The carriers have known for some time that the 1 July cut&hyphen;off will mean an increase in the number of carriers competing in the Australian telecommunications market. I, for one, think it would be wrong for an unlimited number of carriers, some Australian owned and some possibly 100 per cent foreign owned, to be exempt from planning and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="795"> local government ordinances. Once we move from a limited number of carriers, such as one, two or three, to dozens of carriers or an unlimited number, we cannot grant dozens of domestic and foreign company exemptions from the normal planning and environmental laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also draw the minister's attention to a remark in the explanatory memorandum at page 7 of volume 1. In passing, it makes the obvious point that, in the face of increasing demand for mobile communications services and restrictions on the use of aerial cabling, there will be a continuing and increasing demand for transmitter sites and underground ducts. Perhaps the minister could outline to the House whether the government has conducted any estimates of how many towers are expected to be constructed between now and the year 2000 and, in particular, what impact there may be in the sale of blocks of spectrum. I would be quite interested to know whether the current round of erections of large numbers of mobile telephone towers will fill the gaps or whether we can expect there to continue to be a substantial increase in the number of mobile telephone towers constructed between now and the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next point I want to raise concerns part (b) of the opposition's second reading amendment, which expresses concern at the government's refusal to ensure that rural and provincial customers benefit from local call price reductions. We are concerned about this because the government has taken a quite fundamental step in getting legislation through the Senate and this parliament to sell off one&hyphen;third of Telstra. I do not want to revisit the past debate, but from the opposition's point of view this is a fundamental change. While the government will retain two-thirds of the shares in Telstra, it will not be able to oppress the minority shareholders. That means that the ability of the government to determine what Telstra does has changed fundamentally. For that reason, we believe there need to be additional protections for people who live in rural and provincial areas, and certainly more protections than we envisaged when our package had that first premise of Telstra remaining completely in government ownership.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to bring to the House's attention a remark made by the member for Bass, representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, when the government was accepting the opposition's amendment to give the minister power of direction. I will quote from the House of Representatives <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 12 December 1996. This is what Mr Smith said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the government's expectation that any public interest controls would be exercised through regulatory mechanisms which apply to all carriers and that, if the Commonwealth sought to exercise any control over Telstra in its capacity as a shareholder, it would do so by exercising the rights attaching to the two-thirds of the shares which it owned, not by exercising the power of direction.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the debate that took place at that time, I made the point that it may be the government's view but it is certainly not the view of those of us on this side of the House. We believe that, with the government accepting that amendment, it is retaining the right for a future government to issue directions to Telstra. I am sure people who are purchasing shares in Telstra will understand that that is the clear, express wish of the parliament. No weasel words from the minister can seek to restrict the future decisions of an elected government. Certainly it cannot restrict the decisions of the parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite fortuitous that, during that debate, we sought to obtain an assurance from the minister that if at any time in the future Telstra sought to introduce price discounts for local calls for city customers it would use that power of direction to make sure that Telstra passed on those reductions in local call prices to people who live in rural and provincial Australia. We know that the Prime Minister spoke to his party room earlier this year about the matter. I will quote from a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian </EMPHASIS>of the time:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Howard's pledge to the Government party-room that those in remote areas will have all the "whiz-bangery" that the new technology has to offer&mdash;at the same price as those in the cities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know, there is no more basic and more important service to someone who lives in the bush than the local telephone call. If you cannot be guaranteed 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="796"> your local telephone calls at the same price as those in the city, the Prime Minister's promise to the party room does not mean much at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet, within a day or two of the Prime Minister giving that assurance, his office was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> as saying that local call charges would not be allowed to rise in regional Australia or anywhere else but the extent of price reductions could vary between areas. Also, we had the minister for communications, Senator Alston, confirming in the same article that Telstra will be free to charge different prices for consumers in different cities or towns where the industry is opened up to all comers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is clear&mdash;certainly with the package that is before the House at the moment&mdash;that the government is expecting that there are going to be significant reductions in local call prices in city areas. If Telstra is not prepared to pass on those price reductions to people who live in the bush, then we want a direction from the government that makes sure that that is the case. It is not that hard to do. We saw the Prime Minister almost do it at question time today when he made it clear that the government had been embarrassed into agreeing to maintain its promise on directory assistance charges. I will say more about that later. I think that if we were to see a difference in the price of local calls emerging, then that would also be an issue worthy of a direction from the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now would like to move on to another promise which was made by the Prime Minister in a very important speech, a speech that I am sure is clear in your mind, Mr Deputy Speaker, because it helped persuade the National Farmers Federation, and perhaps other people who live in the bush, to  support the coalition's proposal to privatise one&hyphen;third of Telstra. In the speech the Prime Minister made on 21 November 1995 to the National Farmers Federation&mdash;this was his big policy announcement of the day in that address&mdash;he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today I announce that a Coalition Government will require Telstra to offer all of its customers who have lines connected to digital exchanges with access to ISDN as a standard service. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will also require Telstra to substantially complete its FMO or digitisation of exchanges by 1 July 1997, instead of its current year 2000 target date.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So in that speech to the National Farmers Federation in November 1995, the Prime Minister promised access to ISDN as a standard service right across the country&mdash;a promise which the then Labor government said would cost many billions of dollars, a promise which we said the coalition could never deliver on and a promise which has not been met to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite interesting that we have had some new developments on this in the last few days. Senator Alston commissioned a review group headed by Jock Given from the Communications Law Centre&mdash;a very able organisation and a very able man, I might say. Nine out of the 10 members of the review group submitted their majority report, which recommended that ISDN be guaranteed to all residents and businesses by the year 2000. It did not quite meet the Prime Minister's timetable in the promise he made to the National Farmers Federation. But you can understand why the review group might have been encouraged to make ISDN the standard service when the Prime Minister outlined that promise in his  speech to the National Farmers Federation. Let me repeat it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today I announce that a Coalition Government will require Telstra to offer all of its customers who have lines connected to digital exchanges with access to ISDN as a standard service.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what John Winston Howard promised the National Farmers Federation. It is what got them to agree to support privatisation of one-third of Telstra. It is what got the National Party to agree to the one-third privatisation of Telstra. And the promise is getting broken as we speak.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the review group divided nine to one, Senator Alston put out this very misleading statement on 6 February:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two reports assessing whether the standard telephone service should be upgraded were released today . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It was not indicated that it was one report of a nine to one vote, a nine to one recommendation and a minority report from one member, Professor Ergas. But Senator Alston 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="797"> claims we have two reports. He went on to almost equate the two opinions&mdash;the opinion of the nine majority members of the group and Professor Ergas&mdash;as if they were two reports of equal weight and equal merit. In fact, if anything, Senator Alston in the press report is very heavily leaning in favour of Professor Ergas, who, as I understand it, is a long-term friend of Senator Alston and someone who he had worked closely with during his studies. In this report, Senator Alston, the minister, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am particularly concerned to ensure that any change to the current arrangements does not impose undue costs on users of the ordinary telephone service. Professor Ergas' report makes it clear very substantial sums of money could be involved . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">My eyesight might be failing me, but I cannot see any such conditions on the Prime Minister's promise to the National Farmers Federation. I am not sure that when the Prime Minister spoke to his party room and to the National Party over the last 18 months he would have put this condition on this clear promise to provide all the people who live in the bush, everyone who is connected to a digital exchange, with access to ISDN as a standard service. Senator Alston is trying to walk away from the promise he gave the National Party and the promise that John Winston Howard gave the National Farmers Federation. There was a quick response from the industry. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  of Friday, 7 February said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Communications, Senator Richard Alston, came under fire from key sections of the telecommunications industry yesterday after expressing concern at the potential costs of providing digital services to all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry outcry came after Senator Alston appeared to undermine a report presented to him by a committee he appointed to consider upgrading the telephone service.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The managing director of the Australian Telecommunications Users Group, Mr Allan Horsley, said the Minister risked losing the "confidence of the industry if he ignored a substantial body of work undertaken over a reasonable period of time". 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There you have it&mdash;an industry reacting with complete shock to the government's intention to walk away from the promises which the Prime Minister gave the National Farmers Federation before the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last point, the fourth point, I want to touch on before finishing concerns the government's refusal to honour the Prime Minister's guarantee that no charge would be introduced for directory assistance. Before the last election, the coalition promised to make sure that there would be no charges for directory assistance for local calls, long distance calls or international calls. It was a clear promise in the policy released by the Prime Minister and Senator Alston, and it is a promise that the government has obviously been discussing with Telstra. The government has obviously been trying to work out a way that it can break that assurance given to the Australian people before the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difficulty for the Prime Minister is that it has been a bad week. He forgot about the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) briefing him about Senator Woods, he forgot about coming out against work for the dole when he was on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> in 1991&hyphen;92 and today he was faced with the difficulty of admitting that he forgot that he had also told the House in June last year that he would not allow the introduction of charging for directory assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Alston, I understand, was asked a question about the same issue earlier today. It is on the front page of every newspaper in the country today and all Senator Alston could say was, `There is no formal proposal before the government.' I would like to know how many times Senator Alston has discussed the introduction of charges for directory assistance with Telstra staff. I will bet it is more than a dozen times. I would like to know why Senator Alston did not say to Mr Blount, `There is no way we can do that, Frank. We promised the people before the last election there would be no charges for directory assistance', the first time Frank Blount raised the issue with him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder how many times Senator Alston discussed the proposed introduction of directory assistance charges with Mr Blount and Telstra staff after June, when the Prime 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="798"> Minister had given his solemn word in this chamber that the government would not introduce charging for directory assistance. I will bet it was at least more than half a dozen times.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the point of order: the member for Ballarat obviously has not seen part (d) of the opposition's second reading amendment. Having been embarrassed to back down on the Speaker's chair, today we also get a backdown from the Prime Minister on the introduction of charging for directory assistance. What we want to know is why did it take a story appearing on the front page of every newspaper in the country to force the government to tell Telstra that this was not on. Why didn't Senator Alston tell Frank Blount the first time he raised this issue that it was not on? Why didn't Senator Alston tell Frank Blount it was not on after the Prime Minister had given his word in this House that the government would not allow charging for directory assistance?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that there have been negotiations between this government and Telstra about how to introduce these charges. Having had the Prime Minister on two occasions tell this House that charging for directory assistance will not be introduced, I would like to see a similar statement from Senator Alston. It would really make our day if we could get slippery Senator Alston to also agree to put on record his commitment that he will resign as minister if there is ever a charge introduced 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for directory assistance. We will make sure that the pressure is kept on this government to make sure that ordinary Australians do not have to pay for directory assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This attempted plan by Telstra to offer people a $5 discount on their rental charges to make up for the introduction of a 50c charge for every call made to directory assistance for a number in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">White Pages</EMPHASIS> is just ridiculous. It is ridiculous because it would not take long for Telstra to claw that money back through increases in quarterly rentals, but that directory assistance charge would be there forever. We are pleased that the government has been forced to back down. They have been embarrassed into backing down on the Speaker's chair, they have been embarrassed into backing down on directory assistance charges, and we can give them the promise that at any future time they raise this matter we will keep the pressure up because we believe it is a measure that should not be imposed on residential customers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all of those reasons, the opposition does remain committed to the introduction of full and open competition in telecommunications. We remain concerned about the major changes that the government has made, particularly to the intentions on powers and immunities for carriers. We think it is outrageous that the government has walked away from the promises that were given to people, such as the promise to the National Farmers Federation and farmers to provide the latest high speed digital connections through ISDN. We want to ensure that wherever Australians may live, whether it is Ballarat, Launceston or suburban Melbourne and Sydney, people will receive those reductions in local call charges that will flow from competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Optus Vision's local call service on its pay TV network results in price cuts in Hunters Hill and the Prime Minister's electorate, we think that it would be a good thing if Telstra tried to match those price cuts. If Telstra cuts its local call charges in Hunters Hill, I want to see price cuts for local call charges in my own electorate of the Central Coast. I would like to see them in the electorate of Ballarat, where the shadow cabinet is heading on Monday. We would like to make 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="799"> sure that the electors of Ballarat also benefit from any price reductions that the residents of Hunters Hill might enjoy. We will be very disturbed if the member for Ballarat, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Ronaldson), who is at the table, is not also concerned and is not working hard in the background trying to ensure that his constituents also benefit from any price reductions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those opposite can rightly lament the contribution from the shadow minister, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), for had he shown any interest in the material that was available to him he would have found that most of his questions were answered, perhaps with the exception of those he raised out of sheer curiosity. The 11 telecommunications bills before the House today fulfil the coalition's pre&hyphen;1996 election promise of putting the needs of my Dunkley community and other Australians first.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Half the people in the world have never made a telephone call. Australia has about 52 fixed telephones and 16 mobile phones for every 100 residents. In 1996, 96.7 per cent of Victorian residents had a telephone connection. The rating agency Standard and Poor's has claimed that the Australian telecommunications industry would have a $30 billion annual turnover by the year 2004. This sector is demonstrably a big deal to our economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overall market in telecommunications traffic is still growing strongly. Communications charges account for a growing propor 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion of most small businesses' costs. Emerging telecommunications technology is revolutionising the way small businesses operate and people recreate. Proprietors and households want to see the promises of competition delivered to them in terms of reduced costs and widening product choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The phased introduction of competition in telecommunications, commencing with an industry regulator in 1989, has brought benefits but has some way to go. I acknowledge the 1991 comment of the then Minister for Transport and Communications, the now Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the creation of one strong competitor is the best way of achieving genuine and strong competition quickly in a market the size of Australia's.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is true that we do now have a viable and strong multi&hyphen;service competitor to Telstra in Optus Communications and a third established player in the mobile market in Vodafone. This has produced some gains. It is time that we opened up the telecommunications market further. Call rates to both Australian and overseas long distance destinations have come down although the coalition's election document Better Communications stated that local call charges under Labor remained among the highest in the world. In 1995 Australia still ranked 11th out of 24 OECD countries when comparing a basket of all calls and service charges, a ranking unchanged since 1989. Our competitive position will improve only if we secure gains at a faster rate than the nations we compete with for investment and trade. Clearly, under Labor the 8,000 small businesses in Dunkley were not getting even close to a competitive trading boost from telecommunications competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This package heralds a host of benefits targeted at the consumers beyond the imperative produced by the Telecommunications Act 1991, sunsetting on 30 June this year. We observed telecommunications competition finding its feet and getting used to the light and, to the previous government's credit, without them making too much of a mess of it. Now we must move forward. That is what this package of legislation is about, heralding in long awaited opportunities and the promise that a new era of telecommunications compe 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="800"> tition presents&mdash;an era of regulatory framework more concerned with delivering benefits of a competitive sector to consumers than chaperoning in the forms of technology is what this government is offering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills also address some of the deficiencies of Labor's technology first policy approach to competition in the telecommunications sector. Let me provide some evidence. Small businesses in Dunkley regard the telephone as a lifeline. About the only thing worse than having a telephone out of order for more than half a day is having an incorrect entry in the phone directory. Under the 1991 regime, Telstra manages to connect only 76 per cent of new requested business services on or before the agreed commencement date. Only 57 per cent of metropolitan or residential telephone service faults are cleared within one working day of notification. Although the figure is clearly up for business faults, at 79 per cent, after two days eight per cent of business faults in metropolitan areas still have not been rectified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also concerns me that over the past five years Telstra's fault clearance record has generally been on a downward trend. Costs have to keep falling. Residents of Dunkley by the bay demand it. Small and large businesses alike are calling for it and the government is facilitating price reductions. If call costs and other charges for telecommunications decrease our businesses have a better chance of staying in business and we can attract an increasing share of the region's corporate headquarters and service sector activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More open competition will help to ensure our telecommunications costs do not become grossly unattractive compared with what is charged in Singapore and Hong Kong. The entry of new Australian and international carriers and service providers, either in their own right through equity interests or via interconnect and strategic alliances with offshore providers, will provide an added boost to our already vibrant telecommunications equipment and content industry. Helen Meredith, in a special <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> article of 9 September 1996, drew attention to the telecommunications equipment sector as the star performer of manufacturing, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with $4.5 billion in sales in 1995 and a 33 per cent increase in exports since 1990, to $1 billion annually.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At six per cent of revenue, telecommunications technology supplies outpace the national average for business R&amp;D expenditure and leave the one per cent average for manufacturing far behind. Carrier licences will be available to providers of carriage free of network roll&hyphen;out obligations. Carrier industry development plans will encourage further strategic planning and investment in a manner driven by the businesses' market and commercial imperatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subject to meeting the requirements of a light&hyphen;handed service provider regulatory regime, content and service providers can be assured of access to carriage within a framework of commercially reasonable terms and conditions. Seamless interconnect capabilities will be mandated by industry driven access codes backed up by clear rights of arbitration available to all parties on matters of price, conduct and access standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The words of part 4 of the coalition's 1996 communications election promise define and differentiate the government's approach from what has preceded it. It is worth recalling:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the objective of telecommunications policy should be to give Australians a world class telecommunications industry, not only in terms of technology, but also pricing and quality of service.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The coalition's changes to the laws governing telecommunications are unashamedly customer focused. The government has decided that the industry not only will be subject to general trade practices laws contained in part 4 of the Trade Practices Act but also will have additional industry specific regulations overseen by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where competition is substantially lessened, the ACCC will be able to issue what is called a competition notice. If a carrier or service provider continues to engage in anti&hyphen;competitive conduct, it will face onerous civil penalties or the threat of private action for damages. This is great news for consumers. Dominant service providers and carriers may also be required to file their tariffs with the ACCC and to keep records and report on their con 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="801"> duct against the access code and towards competing and related industry parties. These rules will all expire on 1 July 2000, to allow an assessment by the government before that date as to how effective they have proven to be and whether further changes are required to produce open and competitive market conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This package includes a world class comprehensive consumer protection regime that leaves the previous government's so&hyphen;called 99&hyphen;principles proposal back in the analog era. The coalition's universal service regime provides greater scope to upgrade obligations and to increase the flexibility and contestability of USO provision by providers. Remote and rural communities will not be left behind in the era of open competition in telecommunications. Beyond the USO regime the government has the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund initiative, price control and consumer guarantees to ensure that non&hyphen;metropolitan Australia benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Communications Authority, which combines the former umpire Austel with the Spectrum Management Agency, is able to set enforceable standards for customer connection time, the rectification of faults and the keeping of appointments to meet with customers. I draw the attention of the House to the continuation of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. The incumbent, Mr John Pinnock, does a very good job with constituent problems generally addressed with little fuss and in a professional and responsible manner. The bill also ensures that the customers will continue to enjoy access to directory assistance services, operator services, itemised billing, preferred carrier selection and override capability, and privacy protection for their personal information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Communications Authority will be required to monitor the performance of carriers and service providers each year and to report findings to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. The regulatory framework provides many opportunities for public involvement. The untimed local call obligation not only has been retained but also has been extended. Business consumers now have the legislative right to untimed local 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> voice calls. Residential customers will have their current entitlement to untimed voice calls preserved, reinforced and extended to include untimed non&hyphen;voice data and facsimile traffic where this can be accommodated using the standard telephone service. Price controls will continue to apply to Telstra at least until 1999, including a cap on local call prices and a basket of services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But for many people in Dunkley by the bay the sharp edge of telecommunications regulation relates to the powers and immunities granted to carriers. When Labor introduced the original legislation in 1991, the sixth general principle of the bill was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it gives the carriers, on an equal footing, certain exclusive rights and powers. These include rights to install certain types of telecommunications facilities; and certain powers in relation to land and immunity from laws.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The national code that attempted to guide carrier behaviour under the previous government, in the absence of state local land use planning and development controls, was clearly deficient. It lacked teeth and was excessively skewed to the advantage of carriers. It was thick on procedural steps but wafer thin in terms of encouraging better network deployment outcomes. Residents were upset that the carriers did not comply with the spirit of the law or, better still, the intentions of the code. Instead, mobile phone towers were erected and pay TV cables deployed in many areas at the expense of an unnecessary loss of visual and neighbourhood amenity. The member for Flinders, who was just giving me some encouragement, reminds me of a situation in Somerville where we had two towers side by side providing the largest goalposts that I have seen on the Mornington Peninsula. That outcome was delivered under the former Labor government's regime.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1K6">Mr BILLSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Outrageous! Despite a few rehashes and the 30 June 1993 assurance from the then Minister for Communications and the Arts, the member for Dobell, that its `new and stringent code seeks to balance the rights of carriers and the consumers with the importance of protecting the environment', Labor fumbled the issue of powers and immunities. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="802"> It took a coalition government to respond to the legitimate community concerns. We have once again been left to clean up the mess. Twenty&hyphen;one improvements have been made to Labor's lax arrangements to produce a new code with some real teeth. Far greater attention has been given to amenity considerations and increased local control.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The available time does not permit me to detail the significant enhancements that aim to genuinely balance the rights of residents to have their visual amenity protected and the demand of local students, residences and businesses to have access to exciting new technologies. Time also does not permit me to recall how the former minister fumbled and mucked around with this particular situation, delaying and procrastinating until it would be dealt with after the federal election. Clearly that gives an indication of what Labor would have delivered to the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While regularly being an advocate of the cause of local government, I have to disagree with the Australian Local Government Association's criticisms of the new code. The code is, by any measure, a substantial improvement on what has existed to date. Well before this House rose in 1996, the Minister for Communications and the Arts recognised the need to inform state governments that their land use planning laws could enable standard approvals processes to be applied to telecommunications infrastructure as is provided under the new code. I informed my local councils of the need to provide for the significant increase in local control within their own planning schemes and to develop local planning guidelines which carriers need to take into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ball is clearly now not in the Commonwealth's court, given that the greater local control that has been sought is facilitated by this legislation and the new code. Streamlining approvals for low impact facilities is a carrot to carriers to do the right thing and work to amenity friendly facility designs and configurations. I encourage those with a particular view on what should constitute low impact facilities to contribute fully to Austel's public inquiry into this matter. I particularly encourage the member for Dobell, given that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> he appears to have some views on that subject.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Allowing standard normal land use planning regimes to apply to telecommunications with limited reserve powers to the Commonwealth is not a new concept. The bill requires carriers to first argue for the approval of their facility on amenity grounds. If unsuccessful on amenity grounds, scope is provided for the carrier to argue the case for their facility against national interest tests. While some argue these national interest tests grounds are lax, others claim these arrangements are too stringent and will freeze out new carriers. It sounds like the government has got the balance pretty right from that critique from both sides of the argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nomination of a minimum cable diameter before a council has the power to veto a rollout seeks to ensure that people are not needlessly denied access to the standard telephone service which this package mandates as the right of all Australians. This provision is not some Machiavellian plot to enable broadband carriers to slip under this minimum and roll over local communities to roll out new pay TV cable or the like. I say to my local government friends and to the Dunkley community: let us give this new regime a go. I say to the member for Dobell&mdash;he has had some experience in this field&mdash;how about contributing to the debate and the shape the telecommunications regulatory regime will be beyond 30 June?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the package fails to fulfil its stated intentions and legitimate community concerns, or the worthwhile public policy objectives articulated by the government, I will be willing to go into bat to argue for the necessary changes. But let's give it a go. Labor, through its shadow spokesman, have offered nothing towards what the industry structure should look like beyond 30 June.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, I think <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> might reflect only a handful of paragraphs in which the member for Dobell actually referred to what is in the package. I would certainly encourage him to acquaint himself with the material. He might find it quite enlightening, particularly in responding to many of the questions he asked 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="803"> which are very clearly dealt with in the material that is available to him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This package of bills takes Australia into a new era where competition is not an end in itself but one where delivering the benefits of competition to Australia and its businesses and citizens is the focus of the regulatory framework. These bills give the industry the confidence to expand and invest and contain comprehensive legislative safeguards for consumers. This package facilitates open&hyphen;ended competition, which is the No. 1 driving force that will improve the quality and range of services that are available, and continue to bring the real cost of telecommunications down. This package is good news for consumers, investors, businesses and households. It is good for the economy and continuing jobs growth within the sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge honourable members to reject the opposition's amendment as a pathetic and pointless contribution to the debate about what shape telecommunications regulations should be beyond 30 June, and commend these bills to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek the indulgence of the House, Mr Deputy Speaker. At question time today the member for Melbourne addressed a question to me concerning a letter written by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to a member of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority board. I said in response that I would investigate the matter and take whatever action is appropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The clear thrust of the question was that in some way the letter represented a breach of section 73 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. I have obtained an opinion from Mr H. Burmester, the Chief General Counsel of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department, and I will read that advice and then table it, together with an attachment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have asked for advice as to whether or not a letter signed by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs on 6 May 1996 and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> addressed to Ms G Hollows gives any cause for concern that an offence may thereby have been committed against Section 73 of the Crimes Act 1914, or any other provision of that Act, or any provision of any other Act of the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 73 has, in my opinion, no application to the facts and circumstances set out in that letter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additionally, in my opinion, there is no other provision of that or any other Act which would apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, I consider that there is nothing contained in the letter which would make it necessary or appropriate for the matter to be referred either to the Australian Federal Police for consideration of investigation, or to the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration of prosecution.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In addition, I was asked whether the behaviour of the minister, or indeed of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, represented any breach of the ministerial guidelines. I have perused those guidelines again and I am satisfied, on the information given to me by the two ministers, that their conduct in this matter has not breached those guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Could I additionally state that, prior to coming into the House, attempts were made by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, as a matter of courtesy, to contact Ms Hollows because it was my intention, as it is necessary given the nature of the advice, to table the letter from Senator Herron to her to inform her that that was going to occur. Unfortunately, in the time available he was not able to reach her, although I understand a fax is being sent to her to advise her of it. I would also add that, in all of the circumstances, the contribution that has been made to the Australian community by her is appreciated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply emphasise again that any suggestion of any breach of the Commonwealth Crimes Act, any suggestion of any breach of any other Commonwealth act, is absolutely repudiated and destroyed by the independent opinion of the Chief General Counsel. I am also absolutely satisfied, on the advice given to me by the two ministers, that there has been no breach of ministerial guidelines. I table the opinion and the letter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to deal with a number of issues raised by the Telecommunications Bill 1996. The first one I want to cover is one that, I dare say, will not be referred to by other members of the House for the simple reason that they probably will not have encountered this particular problem. We are discussing here, as well as the telecommunications legislation, the Radiocommunications Amendment Bill 1996, the Radiocommunications (Transmitter Licence Tax) Amendment Bill 1996 and the Radiocommunications (Receiver Licence Tax) Amendment Bill 1996. These bills provide that the existing agency, the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Spectrum Management Agency, will, as part of the proposed post&hyphen;1997 changes in regulation of telecommunications in Australia, merge with the telecommunications regulator, Austel, to form the Australian Communications Authority, or ACA.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Presently, the Spectrum Management Agency is a Commonwealth statutory agency within the portfolio of Communications and the Arts. It was established by the Radiocommunications Act 1992 and its primary function is to manage and allow access to the radio frequency spectrum. Technically, that spectrum is the range of frequencies used in radiocommunications. In such a vast continent as Australia, radio based communications are essential for industry, safety and telecommunications, as well as providing important cultural and recreational services. Australia depends on effective and efficient access to and management of that spectrum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Spectrum Management Agency and the Australian Broadcasting Authority are responsible for the FM radio channels 86.7 and 88.0. They relate to a set of frequencies the ABA has made available for low power, open narrowcast services around Australia on a first come, first served basis. These licences are issued under a streamline procedure which assumes certain technical criteria will, in most cases, allow the operation of a maximum of two transmitters in an area without interference to existing services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The broadcasting power level is set at one watt maximum in residential areas&mdash;10 watts in rural and remote areas&mdash;and the antenna height is limited to a maximum of 10 metres above average terrain level. At least 10 kilometres must separate transmitters operating on the same frequency&mdash;for example, 88FM. In general, these arrangements allow a good signal to be received out to a two&hyphen;kilometre radius from a one&hyphen;watt transmitter site under normal conditions. Any person may apply for a transmitter licence to operate an open narrowcast service. By far the most common purpose for which these licences are employed is to provide tourist information radio, especially in regional areas.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="805">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I found these things out after I wrote to the Australian Broadcasting Authority inquiring about the broadcasting activities of a Mr Neil Thomas, who set up his own church in 1978 after being sacked by the Overseas Mission Service International and the Wesleyan Methodist Church when money he was responsible for went missing. I will tell the House more about Mr Thomas shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Broadcasting Authority advised me, in response to my inquiries, that their records showed a number of licences originally issued to applicants denoting their proposed narrowcast services as religious or Christian. They attached a schedule of those licences and advised me that a total of 1,124 such licences had been issued, 249 for transmitters in the state of Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those licences are current for one year and are renewable and transferable. Licence holders may also authorise third parties to operate their transmitters. Authorised users have to comply with the licence conditions, including that the service be open narrowcast. There is, however, importantly, no obligation on licence holders to advise the relevant Commonwealth authorities&mdash;the ABA and the Spectrum Management Agency&mdash;if a licence is transferred or if a third party authorisation is given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given these factors, neither the Australian Broadcasting Authority nor the Spectrum Management Agency will necessarily be aware of the current licence holder of every licence issued nor the specific type or content of the service that is being provided. The Australian Broadcasting Authority provided me with a list of licences of this character which they had issued. Most of the licences said to be of a religious or Christian character had been issued to a company by the name of Gospel Across Australia&mdash;one of the companies associated with Mr Neil Thomas. The contact name is Mr Jason Lee and there is a post office box number in Brunswick West. I can assure the House that if any of these stations get into any difficulty that post office box number will disappear very smartly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gospel Across Australia has licences for: Emerald, Queensland; Murgon, Queensland; Taylors Lakes, Victoria; Beaudesert, Queens 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> land; Blackwater, Queensland; Broughton, Victoria; Cloncurry, Queensland; Dalby, Queensland; Katherine, Northern Territory; Morphett Vale, South Australia; Moura, Queensland; Mount Morgan, Queensland; and Yeppoon, Queensland.The ABA notes that services provided under class licences, because of their specialised, closely targeted and limited nature, have significantly less power to influence when compared with commercial broadcasting services. They nevertheless indicate that their approach is designed to protect the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been told that Mr Neil Thomas has been seeking out these licences on a grand scale. It has been said to me that Neil Thomas Ministries representatives claim to have access to 400 such licences and to have lodged an order for 400 transmitters, which could be right, given the capacity of these licences to be subleased. Even given the narrow range of each transmitter, it is not unreasonable to believe that Mr Thomas could reach a potential audience of up to, or even in excess of, one million people. If Mr Thomas has the potential to be something of a media baron, what kind of man is he? What kind of character checks would he pass?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that Mr Thomas and companies associated with his church&mdash;a church which belongs to him and is accountable to no-one else&mdash;have since 1980 raked up debts to individuals, companies and the taxpayer in excess of $2 million. In 1980, Mr Thomas set up a building project referred to as Ormiso Valley just south of Canberra near Hall. It collapsed with the South Pacific Evangelical Fellowship owing creditors $250,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1987, Mr Thomas personally filed a part 10 bankruptcy statement with debts of $212,000. Since then, other companies of which he has personally been a director or other members of his church have been directors have constantly gone broke. A company called NSC left behind debts of $600,000, including massive liabilities to the tax office and Telecom. Cowman College left behind debts of $515,000 and Laindon left behind debts of $100,000. A Croydon confectionary manufacturer, Sloane Enterprises, went to the Supreme Court to try to recover a debt 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="806"> of $330,000 from Lexvale, another enterprise of Mr Thomas and his members. As a result of his business ventures, many individuals, companies and taxpayers are owed massive sums of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not simply stop at financial affairs. I have to say that Mr Thomas is active in America, where I understand he is presently residing, and in Vanuatu. For a time he was banned in Vanuatu because of his activities. I understand that more recently he has been allowed to re&hyphen;enter. He is said to go around Vanuatu with a man he claims to have raised from the dead. This is the kind of person we are dealing with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In June 1991, a fire destroyed a hall owned by the Grace Church, which is the name Neil Thomas gave to his church at that stage. This hall was next to the Grace Church in Balmoral Avenue, Pascoe Vale. The arson squad investigated. Several years later a long&hyphen;term member of the church confessed to having lit the fire in association with Mr Robert Gelsi, another Grace Church member, on the orders of Neil Thomas. This was reported to the arson squad, which conducted investigations and interviewed Mr Gelsi and Mr Thomas. He was a hard man to interview because he was spending a lot of his time in America. The arson squad did not proceed to lay charges because Mr Gelsi and Mr Thomas backed up each other's stories and there was a problem with motive. The hall was uninsured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My sources within the church say the hall was uninsured due to a keystone cops type bungle with Mr Thomas's son, Peter, believing that their accountant, Tom Griffiths, had insured the building while Mr Griffiths believed Peter Thomas had done so. The significant point is that Neil Thomas believed the building to be insured and, in any event, why would a church member confess if he was not guilty? I know who I believe was responsible for the fire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More recently, I have been contacted by a young man concerned that Neil Thomas and his pastors are encouraging social security fraud. This young man went guarantor for rent on a property in Pascoe Vale. He ended up being left with debts of $3,000 because he was a guarantor in relation to the rent at that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> property. Not only is he irate about that; he is most concerned that many members of the church, young people in particular, receive social security benefits&mdash;I have asked Coburg Social Security to investigate this matter&mdash;while still working for Neil Thomas based enterprises such as Neil Thomas Ministries Engineering, his confectionary company and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, this is not a church; it is a money making machine and a front organisation for a parasite who fastens himself and his pastors to families, some of whom have very deep and very genuine religious convictions. Sometimes these families have personal problems or have suffered serious tragedies and this man tears families apart and bleeds them until they are destitute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The church in fact receives hundreds of thousands of dollars a year from its adherents, but it is perpetually broke and all its ventures have failed. It preaches the sanctity of marriage, but it causes marriages to breakdown. It says you should not live with ungodly people so, if your husband or wife cannot be converted to the church, you should leave them. It preaches the gospel, but its senior pastor has bodyguards who threaten anyone who stands in the church's way. It is an ugly fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would seek from the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) rules regarding the granting of open narrowcast licences and checks to ensure that people cannot get monopolies or large collections of these licences so we do not find these airwaves being taken over by Jimmy Swaggart type phoneys. Indeed, Mr Thomas has links with Mr Swaggart, and I have no doubt he has fantasies about becoming an Australian tele&hyphen;evangelist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue I want to raise concerning this legislation is the propriety of this bill's being here in the first place. It follows on from the government's legislation to sell off one-third of Telstra. We have learnt in the House in the last couple of days that this bill was in turn able to get through the Senate following a set of events as follows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 21 October, Independent Senator Mal Colston's original request for an upgrade 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="807"> worth some $23,000 for a staffer went to Senator Margaret Reid. On 31 October, Senator Reid wrote back to Senator Colston saying she was very reluctant to seek the approval of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), which was not surprising in all the circumstances, as she had left a similar position in her own office unfilled in order to save money. On 15 November, at Senator Colston's insistence, she wrote to the Prime Minister conveying the Colston request, but pointing out that she had left a similar position in her office unfilled to save money and she asked for extra money, if the Prime Minister agreed to the Colston request.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 29 November, however, the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff wrote to Senator Reid's office saying the upgrade had been approved. On 4 December, Senator Reid wrote to the Prime Minister saying the total cost to the Senate budget could be up to $65,000 and requested extra money. On 10 December, Prime Minister Howard wrote to Senator Reid saying he would consider extra money in future years and a day later the Telstra sale passed in the Senate. Together with other matters that have been brought out in question time today, these are matters of great concern as to the propriety of this bill being here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third issue I want to raise relates to that issue of directory assistance. It is a matter of great concern that Telstra has announced that it intends to introduce a 50c charge for calls to the 013 directory assistance number. I point out to the House that the coalition promised in its January 1996 policy document, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Better Communications</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Coalition Government will not permit carriers to charge for operator assisted calls and will set an overall requirement that 90 per cent of all operator assisted calls be answered within ten seconds. This requirement will cover directory assistance, emergency calls, long distance and international calls and fault reporting.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In stark contrast to this very clear, unequivocal policy commitment, the package of bills before the House contains no reference to the provision of free directory assistance. The only reference to directory assistance is in schedule 2 of the Telecommunications Bill, which sets out the standard service provider 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rules. So this legislative requirement is clearly not enough to prevent Telstra charging a 50c fee or, indeed, any other fee for directory assistance. I point out that the introduction of fees for directory assistance will specifically disadvantage the elderly, including those with poor eyesight, and other customers who are unable to use a telephone book.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a matter of great concern to the opposition. We believe that Telstra's directory services are highly profitable without their charging for calls and we believe that benefit should carry with it a responsibility to provide free directory assistance services. We will, therefore, endeavour to amend the bills accordingly in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth issue that I want to raise concerns the telecommunications national code. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Billson), made reference to the issue of overhead cables and mobile phone towers. This has been an issue of great concern in my electorate and in other electorates also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter of great concern to us that the code which the government has recently introduced is quite inadequate. It replaces the former code, which had been in operation since mid-1995. When the former code was introduced, there was no reference to broadband cables as it was not envisaged that cables would be used to establish pay TV in Australia. As a result, that code was inadequate in terms of requiring the carriers to follow accountable processes and in assisting councils to make an environmental assessment of the establishment of telecommunications infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This revised code, which came into operation from 1 January this year, is fundamentally flawed. It does not address the major concerns of local government or of local communities, and most of the changes included in the new code under the guise of applying a stricter regime are essentially cosmetic. It fails to provide any real mechanism for councils to exert influence over aerial broadband cables and towers and there are many loopholes for carriers to exploit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, the code defines low impact facilities to include towers with collocated 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="808"> antennae and most aerial cabling in industrial and rural areas. The code restricts requirements for undergrounding of cables to very limited circumstances&mdash;essentially when there is no other overhead cabling in an area at all. Conversely, carriers appear to be able to go overhead if they can find any existing aerial cabling of another carrier or public utility. Its provisions on notification and consultation in the final analysis mean that carriers can ignore community views in virtually all circumstances provided they go through the motions. The time frames for notification and consultation are very short indeed. In addition, it should be noted that the carriers' exemptions from state and territory laws have been extended from 1 July to 30 September this year for cables and to 31 December this year for towers. These are matters of great consternation and concern in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The code falls far short of providing an acceptable framework for the installation of telecommunications facilities. It would appear that it is the government's intention to ensure a rollout for the carriers at the expense of environmental considerations and community consultation. The extension to the state and territory laws exemptions will mean that the carriers have been given a reprieve so that most of the telecommunications infrastructure such as aerial broadband cables and telecommunications towers will be established. What is needed, firstly, is greater powers for local government in relation to the planning issues and, secondly, the banging together of the heads of carriers like Optus and Telstra to make use of the capacity which we have to underground facilities. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to look at one of the other matters he raised in his contribution. I think it is quite outrageous that tonight he has tried to continue with this nonsense about Telstra 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> allegedly wanting a 50c charge on directory assistance calls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) clearly knocked that on the head in question time today.

Their comments are aimed towards older Australians each and every time they bring these sorts of matters up, and I find it absolutely indefensible of the member for Wills to get up here tonight and attempt to perpetrate this sort of nonsense and this sort of scare campaign particularly directed at older Australians. It is quite simple&mdash;the Prime Minister knocked it on the head in question time today, and government members will ensure this sort of nonsense will get buried, which is where it should be, and where the cables running around this country should be&mdash;buried.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the contribution of the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) is concerned, as an ex&hyphen;minister in the area we are discussing today, in  <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS> parlance his was a `very courageous' contribution: to spend his time defending the regime which he administered in part I found a very courageous decision indeed. Essentially we have a `not quite as good as it should be' telecommunications regime, particularly as far as infrastructure is concerned in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill before us tonight is part of a package of 11 bills which together will provide for the establishment of the new competitive telecommunications era which begins on 1 July this year. This legislation will go a long way towards fixing the blighted legacy which the previous Labor government left us. It will do this by repealing the 1991 Telecommunications Act introduced by the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) when he had responsibility for this area. It will enable real and open competition in telecommunications and establish a world&hyphen;class consumer protection framework which the previous government promised but&mdash;guess what&mdash;did not deliver. They never quite got around to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the Australian Communications Authority Bill 1996 will establish the Austral 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="809"> ian Communications Authority. It will merge Austel with the Spectrum Management Agency and this new body will manage the radio frequency spectrum, administer licensing of carriers and administer consumer and technical issues relating to telecommunications. This particular bill will also enable the administration of all competitive regulation in Australia's telecommunications industry to transfer to the ACCC, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are three other bills, the Telecommunications (Universal Service Levy) Bill 1996, the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Charges) Bill 1996 and the Telecommunications (Numbering Charges) Bill 1996. Each will provide for relevant taxing arrangements under the new regime. The transitional arrangements which started on 1 January and go right through to 1 July will be facilitated by the Telecommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996. It will also provide for the continuation of some existing regulatory arrangements after that date pending the introduction of these various new ones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last three bills in the package of 11 before us are the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Fees) Termination Bill 1996, the Radiocommunications (Transmitter Licence Tax) Amendment Bill 1996 and the Radiocommunications (Receiver Licence Tax) Amendment Bill 1996. Altogether these bills deal with the transitional arrangements for carrier licence fees and amendments to radiocommunications tax legislation which will apply once this ACA mechanism is actually up and running.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These various reforms were foreshadowed in the government's pre&hyphen;election statement `Better Communications' and since then we have further refined them through a process of public consultation which has involved various members across the government parties talking with people in their constituencies. In particular, as secretary of the government's communications policy committee of the backbench, I also participated in this process and worked with the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), along with colleagues, in shaping the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> final outcomes which have resulted in the legislation which is before us today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I should take a moment to congratulate the minister on his consultative approach with the backbench committee on these various bills. The chairman of the committee, the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), should be congratulated for his role in ensuring the voices of private members representing the real concerns of their constituents were heard, which was certainly not the case in the previous government. The member for Dunkley (Mr Billson)&mdash;a good contribution tonight&mdash;the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) and, in particular, the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) should also be congratulated for their very effective advocacy on the concerns of local residents. Each of these members and so many others vocalised the concerns of their constituents and offered solutions to the minister, and they were listened to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is hard, though, to have all the results which we wanted to have. In a sense, because of the ineffective regime put in place by the previous government, a lot of what we need to do in this country today is all a little bit too late. The horses have well and truly bolted. The previous government left us with a situation where, effectively, two tonnes of cure were needed to address the problems which a simple ounce of prevention would have addressed back in 1991 if the Labor Party had bothered to do their job properly. I believe these bills before us tonight prove this new government has made some progress in the massive task of fixing up the mess which Labor created in telecommunications infrastructure under Mr Beazley's stewardship as minister back in 1991.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be no doubt this legislation is a vast improvement on what the previous Labor government introduced in 1991. As I said before, it will bring in real and open competition in the telecommunications industry and

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a lot of ways, as I said, it has not gone far enough. I know the member for Moore (Mr Filing) believes this. We all have our concerns this has not gone as far as a lot of people in this country would have liked. A lot of people in this country would have liked us to go into a very expensive exercise of undoing the visual pollution caused by the previous government's lacklustre approach.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. They are not really sure exactly what they have created. Back in 1991 the previous government laid down the ground rules for the industry. It had a unique opportunity to insist that Telstra&mdash;or Telecom OTC as it was called then&mdash;actually shared its existing and future underground cabling infrastructure with industry newcomers, such as Optus. But did they take it up? No, they let the tail wag the dog and allowed Telstra to dictate what the ground rules were going to be, which left competitors like Optus&mdash;its only really big competitor&mdash;both figuratively and literally up in the air.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the only place Optus could really put its cables and still compete with the established Telecom&hyphen;Telstra infrastructure. Telstra said to the government at the time, `We're not going to share our underground infrastructure. We're not going to assist in making sure, from the national good point of view, infrastructure is available to competitors. We don't care about the social good.' Yet the previous government specifically legislated to protect carriers from the abuse of market powers by other carriers by giving Austel, the telecommunications industry watchdog, a charter to promote competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This watchdog had absolutely no teeth, even though the previous government insisted it had supplied it with a very effective set of choppers. It was a lap&hyphen;dog and not a watchdog. It has let down so many average Australians because the regime it operated under in Labor's legislation was insufficient.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In developing its framework for reform, the Government has remained mindful of the social importance of telecommunications to Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This government is certainly doing something about ensuring the social needs of Australia are well meet by the telecommunications industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a `never mind the quality, feel the width' kind of regime set up in 1991. It leaves you wondering just how come so many Australians have had to settle for less than the best when it comes to our national telecommunications infrastructure which should have been established a far better way six years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overhead cable rollout has effectively been a $4 billion duplication of existing infrastructure in this country. The Optus organisation was put in a position of a $4 billion spend to get cables up in the sky. I submit there are some virtues which can come from this duplication, but it is in effect a cost this country can nary afford. It would be like duplicating a four&hyphen;lane Pacific Highway running through your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl. It would be like having two sets of four&hyphen;lane Pacific Highways. What an absolute farce; an absolute waste of money in the overall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has resulted in so many people in my electorate of Moreton wondering why they have to welcome the introduction of this new 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="811"> competition and this new infrastructure by looking at cables stringing across their views. People in Wellers Hill, Moorooka and Tarragindi are wondering why their views of the city are being blotted by this large cable which has been put in by Optus. It is a blot on the landscape. It is, essentially, Beazley's blot on the landscape.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have seen some of the very worst examples of this aerial infrastructure cabling which has gone wrong. The member for Dunkley has shown me some in, around and near his electorate. The member for North Sydney has done the same, as has the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes). As secretary of the backbench committee, I have made it my task to have a look at what some of my colleagues have been complaining about. Most of those complaints centre on the fact a lot of the contractors did not do their job properly and the cables were drooping all over the place. Where was Austel? Very quiet in the whole procedure. So many people in this country have been let down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation before us tonight does so much to address some of the worst examples of this poor infrastructure installation. So many of these cables will be reviewed and fixed as a result. In my own electorate, I noticed one example just the other day at Cornwall Street and Ipswich Road at Annerley. It is obvious. The cable hangs so low. It is one of those that Optus will need to have a closer look at. There are some very bad cases that will be addressed as a result of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must stress that Optus has copped the PR blame for all of this, and this has actually suited the Telstra/Labor Party plan rather well. It really has, I think, been part of an overall master plan. The socialist left&mdash;which ran the Telstra unions and had so much influence on the previous government's decision making on this front&mdash;really have had a lot to do with ensuring that Telstra did very well, despite their apparent claim six years ago that they were setting up fair competition mechanisms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through the course of this cable roll out and the introduction of competition, Telstra have acted like your typical corporate thug. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> They have acted like the bully on the beach. They have acted like the type of person who would stand on the top of a sandhill and kick sand in the face of anyone who came too close.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own street, I do not have any choice. I do not have any competition. It is Foxtel or it is nothing. It is all underground cable. That is fine, but so much for competition. What did the previous government deliver on this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to emphasise that this is not just about pay television, although that has been the glamour item which has been talked about. After all, if this cable infrastructure was all about pay TV, we probably would have gone down the road of some encoded transmission infrastructure rather than cables.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is all about telephony. It is all about putting a second set of copper wires, a competitive set of copper wires, into every house in Australia. It is all about going to the core, to the heart, of the business of Telstra. This is why Telstra have fought so hard&mdash;and, in so many ways, so dirty&mdash;through the regime that the previous government set up. The previous government promised so much and, of course, they did not do enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking back, and perhaps it is great to be wise in hindsight, it seems to me that the previous government could have used their relationship with the exclusive Telecom OTC organisation, as it was then, to look at the commencement of some sort of national cable authority. They could have said, `You have a social benefit to perform as a long held stakeholder in telecommunications in this country. You have a role to play in ensuring a competitive regime will work in this country, and our stated policies of telecommunications will actually occur by providing the infrastructure.' That is perhaps the way the previous government should have gone. They should have looked at establishing a standard cable system right throughout this country&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This country has been built on government inspired infrastructure. It is a fact that, in a country so large, so sparse and with such a small population, government does have a role to play in this, and the previous government did not do enough about it. They have left a big mess for us to fix&mdash;in fact, a $4 billion waste in expenditure in infrastructure in this country. That is $4 billion which could have been invested in some other areas or some better cases in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overhead cables have now become a way of life for people in the three eastern states, and they are being installed currently in South Australia, in Adelaide. It would be wrong for the current government to now commit the sorts of funds needed to unpick the previous government's mistakes in this matter. So this legislation does not do anything about that, although it does look at the worst cases and it stipulates a rethink by the people who have installed the cable infrastructure. That is the good news about this legislation. It will force companies to fix the very worst cable mistakes that have been created as a result of the previous government's slack approach to this whole regime. The previous government promised a futuristic, world-class facility. They promised it but they did not deliver it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The future outlook appears very good as a result of this bill. It will provide real competition. It will do something about removing some of the cabling and fixing others. It will provide a tougher regime in putting the powers back into the hands of local authorities and, as a consequence, to state government. Planning is a local government issue. Planning should be in the hands of local authorities, and that is what the previous government did not address. That is what this government is doing.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me point out the main thing. There is a very good reason why the minister, the previous minister and his predecessor gave such extraordinarily wide&hyphen;ranging powers to the telecommunications carriers to construct telecommunications towers and lay cables without interference from local authorities. In effect, it was a very substantial net subsidy to the carriers and, in the case of the sale of Telstra, is a very valuable part of the asset of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can compare our telecommunications policy with those policies elsewhere in the world&mdash;particularly in the United States, although they are probably not the best role model for Australia because they have a much greater population. If you look at some of the problems affecting their telecommunications carriers in trying to get cable laying permission from local communities, there is a substantial difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I was suggesting that what has happened is that the two major telecommunications 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="813"> carriers have had a very substantial net subsidy and, in the case of Telstra, a subsidy that is a very substantial asset. It is an asset the government hopes to realise from in order not only to fund its environmental package but also to write off some of the debts that have been incurred in the 13 years of Labor mismanagement of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am happy to see here the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), who represents the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), because he has an extraordinary amount of expertise, in his former capacity as the Telecommunications Ombudsman, in dealing with all of the complaints, some of which I am going to talk about now in relation to telecommunications. In relation to his role as the Telecommunications Ombudsman, he would no doubt not only be fully aware of the shortcomings of the previous government's policies but also have a valuable insight into the shortcomings of the government's own legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of this legislation is to implement a new regulatory framework for the telecommunications industry. Obviously, a telecommunications industry framework is important because it sets a future for future telecommunications development not only in the telecommunications field but also in the other industries that rely so heavily on telecommunications. As we approach the age of the so-called information superhighway, there are going to be substantial flow-on effects not only in the core telecommunications industry but also in a whole range of industries which will probably touch every single aspect of our lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is of the utmost importance that we get this formula right. We have to ensure that the long-term view is taken in the best interests of all the people in Australia; that is, taken in consideration of not only the likely proceeds of the sale of Telstra but also the best interests of the customer, the people who are going to be using telecommunications. I want to touch on a couple of areas, even though my time is going to be cut tonight and I will have to speak again.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that interests me is the area of Internet access. One of the great concerns&mdash;a matter that I raised with the minister representing the minister for communications in a question without notice and that is still unsatisfactorily resolved, as he knows&mdash;is the question of the extraordinary conflict of interest that Telstra has as an Internet access provider, an Internet service provider and the carrier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have the basic prospect that we are going to see Telstra time charging Internet access providers. What this effectively means is that those Internet access providers are no longer going to be able to have a local call to their particular service centre&mdash;say, OzEmail&mdash;that may be in one of the capital cities or regional centres. Those service centres are going to have to bill their customers or the customers will be billed themselves for a timed call for the provision of the Internet access service. I would presume that that call charge will, in fact, occur at the Internet access service centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a matter of grave concern to Internet users, to Internet access providers and to Internet service providers. It is a matter of grave concern, because this conflict of interest is an extraordinary one. I would say to the House that, if it were the United States, it would not occur. There would already be trade practices or monopoly arrangements made in order to prevent that sort of arrangement occurring where the carrier is providing the access service. It is an extraordinary situation, because the very companies with which Telstra are competing have to go to Telstra to get their cables.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> You do not have to be Albert Einstein to have worked out that, at the end of the day, Telstra is in a very high pressure competitive environment with Internet access providers. I am not making an allegation that they are going to sit on the requests that they are getting for extra cables, but it puts them in an extraordinarily difficult position because they have this substantial conflict of interest. Some of the Internet access providers are requiring hundreds and hundreds of extra lines a week in order to take into account the extraordinary growth in the use of the Internet.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="814">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular conflict of interest may well end up with the Internet access providers being forced to time charge their clients' access to their own particular services, which, of course, is another opportunity for Telstra to increase its market share of Internet access services. When we consider that this situation will continue irrespective of these new pieces of legislation, it is a matter of great concern to Internet users. I know that some members here use the Internet and would be fully aware of the consequences of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can give the House one instance: a constituent approached me about a problem he had experienced when he was trying to get an extra line into his house to allow Internet access for him and his brother, both students, without disrupting their normal telephone line. They live in the suburb of Carabooda where calls are charged at the standard residential rate. The neighbouring suburb of Yanchep is one where time charges apply&mdash;something I am going to talk about a bit later on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra informed him that, though his extant line remains connected to the Carabooda switch, his new line will have to be connected to the Yanchep switch and therefore attract time charges. This is a ludicrous situation. This is the result of Telstra's decision to upgrade the Yanchep switch rather than the Carabooda one, knowing that the Carabooda's capacity was almost full. Faced with the government decision&mdash;supported overwhelmingly by public opinion&mdash;that timed calls will not become universal, Telstra has very cleverly been able to circumvent the intent of government in this way. No matter what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) may say about time charges, I am sure they will find ways around the rules that this new legislation is introducing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the backbench of the coalition that you will, in the future, get complaints about towers going up&mdash;like I did. I asked the minister a question before Christmas and was told that we were going to get some action on it but, in the meantime, Optus shot out and threw up towers in my area.</PARA>

Unfortunately, the former minister at the table, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), failed in his time to implement changes. I can remember long periods of debate over this. The minister was one of those fiercely advocating these changes, although he is very quiet now. But at the time we were being assured that something was going to be done.

That is what cuts to university and TAFE places do not provide. A $1.8 billion cut over four years to labour market programs also does not provide that. The cutting out of the minimum youth training allowance for those whose parents might earn more than a paltry sum does not help those who are seeking work much either.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the demand side of the economy. Let us look at this government's management of the macro economy. You create jobs in this country by promoting economic growth. What have we seen? We have seen the economy all but ground to a halt. What do those opposite tell us when we ask them what they are going to do about unemployment and, in particular, youth unemployment? They go back to what I will call the traditional excuses of the Liberal Party. They say, `We're going to fix IR and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> introduce some changes to capital gains rollover. We'll fiddle with the provisional tax uplift factor and cut red tape.' When all else fails, they bring out the old red tape phrase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask those members on the other side, particularly the member for Paterson, how many employers have been to them cheering and told them that, because of some fiddling with the IR legislation, capital gains tax and the provisional tax uplift factor, they will take on a few extra employees? I suggest that no-one has been to them. I suggest that it simply is not happening. When we ask the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) during question time how he is progressing with his attempts to cut red tape, we get a blank look, if we are lucky, or usually a smile. That is the best we can get from the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister is very conscious that he is losing credibility on this issue, so he rings Andrew Robb and asks, `What am I going to do about this?' Andrew Robb says, `Well, polling shows that this phrase `work for the dole' is very popular.' So the Prime Minister says, `Well, that's got to be my line. We'd better work something out for a while. We'd better get some detail.' But then we had the Woods affair.

They are saying, quite rightly, that the people in the Cherbourg area have done this for years and produced great results from it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context, I wish to refer to an article sent to me by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). I am indebted to the right honourable member not only for the pleasure and privilege to be serving in a parliament with someone of his experience and background but also for his assistance in matters of this kind. He sent me this article which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Readers Digest</EMPHASIS> in December 1996. It is entitled `What Welfare Did for Thomas Dutton' and is by William Ecenbarger. I will quote selectively from it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the rim of consciousness, Thomas Dutton felt his life draining away. He was vomiting blood. His breath was reduced to a wheeze as his lungs filled with fluid. Double pneumonia. Tears streamed down his face from a chest pain that words could only hint at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On that night of November 24, last year, the Aboriginal man was wheeled into the emergency ward of Broken Hill Base Hospital, put on a respirator and moved to the intensive care unit. This time he was lucky. Gradually, he recovered his strength. But a week later the doctor delivered an ultimatum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"If you don't stop drinking, you'll be dead of liver failure within a year."</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dutton was left to ponder the rubble of his life. It had begun with such promise. He was once the brightest child in his preschool class, once a rugby league player who many thought would become a highly paid professional. Instead he had dropped out of school, was functionally illiterate and unemployed&mdash;indeed he had never had a job. He was an alcoholic. And in less than a month he would turn 24.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dutton could only ponder as well the fate of his family and of his people. Over the past 40,000 years, some 1600 generations of Aborigines have lived in Australia. Since the arrival of European settlers a mere 200 years ago, they have endured diseases to which they had no immunity, the loss of their land, racism and even murder. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Somehow they have survived. But now Aborigines like Thomas Dutton are being subjected to something they may not outlast: a welfare system that creates dependency and destroys self-respect.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The article goes on to refer to the tremendous background of his forebears. It refers to his grandfather, who was a shearer, was used to hard work and had achieved a lot. It referred to the fact that hard work had never hurt him and the fact that he had done very well at that hard work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But over a period of time the welfare state impinged on Aboriginal life. Unfortunately, and sadly, what has happened to him and his family is that he became dependent on it, so much so that it became inculcated into his consciousness. He would say to a friend, `Why don't you go on the dole?' The answer was, `I like to work for my money, mate.' Thomas Dutton did not understand. His attitudes had been seeded in childhood and watered every day since. He was constantly told by adults that Aborigines were entitled to welfare because of past treatment by whites.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He had turned down innumerable offers of farm work. `It is my right not to do it,' he said. `Pick grapes? Too bloody hard, too bloody hot.' So it went on. Along with all of that background, the article goes on to describe the situation at Wilcannia and the despair there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's announced work for the dole program feeds right across the board&mdash;not just to the Aboriginal community, which has CDEP, but right through to the white community. We need this scheme. We need something that will help young people. Young people have welcomed it. That is the beauty of it. I have had it in my electorate. I have had a lot of calls of support, and it is probably reflected in many electorates across Australia. This is a hope for young people, a chance to get them into a job and give them hope and a chance for the future. This is something that the Labor Party should seriously look at and support in a bipartisan way.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="816"><TITLE>Association of Professional Engineers, Scientists and Managers of Australia</TITLE>

Even a fierce electrical storm after the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Southern Cross</EMPHASIS> left Fiji could not halt Smithy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very proud to say that Smithy was born and bred in Brisbane and his home in Riverview Terrace, Hamilton, is part of the federal electorate of Lilley, which I represent. To mark the centennial celebrations of Smithy's birth, the Brisbane FAC led by Tim Rothwell and Cam Spence organised a day of festivities. I was honoured to be able to officially accept a commemorative $1 coin from the Royal Australian Mint. The coin features a profile of Kingsford Smith and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Southern Cross</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>

Over 1,000 people attended the celebrations to pay tribute to Smithy's historic accomplishments. One of the highlights of the festivities was a flyover by three Tiger Moths and a daring aerobatic display by the Royal Queensland Aero Club.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With all his fame, Smithy always considered himself a Brisbanite and a Queenslander. In fact, the whole Kingsford Smith clan were born in Queensland. This fact did not escape the notice of his co-commander on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Southern Cross</EMPHASIS>, Charles Ulm. After their successful crossing of the Pacific, Ulm was quoted as saying that he too was a Queenslander. He said he was born in an outer Brisbane suburb&mdash;Melbourne.</PARA>

It languished in a civil aviation bulk store in New South Wales until it was moved to Queensland where it was lovingly restored and is proudly displayed in the vicinity of Brisbane's international airport just a short distance from where he landed on that historic day in 1928. Smithy will always be remembered as one of Australia's greatest aviation pioneers, and I am sure he would have felt honoured by the centennial celebrations that were held in his home town of Brisbane on Sunday. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the flaw in all of this abuse, exploitation, mistreatment and murder of Third World seafarers by operators of ships trading to this country on a regular basis is that the flag state, the state where the ship is registered, is responsible for the discipline of the officers of the ship and those who operate that ship.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1K6">Mr BILLSON</NAME><ELECTORATE> (Dunkley)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(7.54 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to briefly talk about a product that is manufactured in my electorate. Some of you might not be aware that the Dunkley electorate has been quietly establishing a reputation as a centre of high technology and innovation. This particular product is manufactured by one of our local businesses, Uni&hyphen;Ject Australia Pty Ltd, under the directorship of Nap Curie. This product is a world&hyphen;leading product that is not quite getting the local recognition it deserves. What you are looking at is a disposable, retractable safety syringe. They call the product ENSI, an acronym for `eliminating needle stick injuries'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The product enables a normal needle to be stuck on the end, the dose entered and then when it is ejected a click occurs. When you retract the arm of the syringe the syringe is sucked back into the casing, therefore eliminating needlestick injury. To avoid it being projected at somebody or protruding from the end of the capsule you simply break the end of the handle off and you have a very safe and simple product that brings to an end one of the great fears of the health profession, the needlestick injury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you are seeing is a very simple product that is battling to establish itself in the domestic market, despite a very serious concern among health professionals about the effect of needlestick injuries. In a 1992 survey of hospital emergency departments accredited by the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine it was found that an average rate of reported needlestick injury was two per hundred hospital beds per month, or at least 4,200 injuries across Australia per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A United States source estimates that the cost of each needlestick injury varies between $A525 and $A1,700. With an average cost of around $1,000, let me assure you that the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="820"> slight additional expense that comes with purchasing this product over and above the more conventional version is quickly absorbed within one or two needlestick injuries. It does not take a genius to work out that $1,000 goes a long way towards buying these sorts of products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of this product is reflected in the fact that this country imports the vast majority of its syringes&mdash;about 450 million of them each year. With that amount of product coming into the country you can understand why this local manufacturer is keen to establish itself within the domestic market, but there is some reluctance by hospitals to take up the product notwithstanding the fact that my local public hospital, the Mornington Peninsula Hospital, does use this product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A Sydney University 1994 study suggested that 27 per cent of nurses in medical wards at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and 42 per cent of surgical ward nurses have sustained a needlestick injury over the past two years. Every doctor in a surgical unit as well as 57 per cent of those in surgical wards have received a needlestick injury. What I am basically alluding to is the fact that with that high rate of risk and the extreme cost of needlestick injury, it is a false economy for some of our purchasing officers to overlook this product in favour of the conventional product which is a couple of cents cheaper per unit. Interestingly, the only competitor for this product is also imported and its cost is twice that of the local product, for a less effective mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am urging all health professionals, as I have urged the Victorian state Minister for Health, the Hon. Rob Knowles, to get the message out to our health community that needlestick injuries are an unnecessary risk facing our health professionals. There is an excellent local product that has been developed to bring an end to the needlestick injuries which are quite common in routine surgery and procedures in hospitals&mdash;and that is something that is manufactured in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It surprises me that the product has not taken off but it has been suggested to me that it is perhaps because a trip to the US plant 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> where the imported product is manufactured is far more attractive than running down to sunny Dunkley by the bay to look at the sanitised workplace and factory of the manufacturer in Seaford. I commend the transnational company Becton Dickinson for the role they are playing in trying to manage needlestick injury but suggest that with this sort of product available that approach of managing needlestick injury and circulating information is perhaps a bit out of date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Health professionals all around the country, I would encourage you to familiarise yourselves with this product as I certainly encourage the Commonwealth Department of Health and Family Services. As I was discussing with the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan), those medical staff in the defence services ought to have a look at this product. It does prevent needlestick injury. It is an important innovation. It is available now and I think the local manufacturer deserves some encouragement for producing world's best innovative technology in dealing with very serious incidents and episodes in the health industry.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="820"><TITLE>Vehicle Repairs</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly in the short time remaining I wish to express my concern about plans that I believe will affect many New South Wales motorists&mdash;plans by NRMA insurance to have all damaged vehicles taken to a centralised holding yard and repair work being put out to tender. This means that policyholders will lose their right of choice of a vehicle repairer in the event of an accident. I believe this erodes the rights of the NRMA members who choose to insure their vehicles with the NRMA. Not only that, it will have a vast effect on the many hundreds of small smash repair businesses throughout New South Wales that will not be able to tender for work from the NRMA.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The NRMA is the largest motoring organisation in New South Wales and has close to 60 per cent of all vehicles insured with it. The effects of this, I believe, have not been fully examined. I have been contacted by Mr Tony Selmes of the Motor Traders Association of New South Wales. He certainly has expressed 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="821"> his concerns on behalf of his members. He has said that smash repairers are telling him that their customers are horrified at the loss of their ability to choose their own repairer. They reject the NRMA's claim that policyholders do not want to be involved in getting their cars back on the road. I believe that the NRMA should have a look at this decision and consult more widely with its members before it goes ahead and implements this decision.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak in this debate on the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Amendment Bill 1996 and the Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Bill 1996 but before I do I wish to make this comment. I was reminded this morning, because of a doorstop, of the role of this particular chamber. That role is to deal with legislation primarily, with the odd, recent aberration that is not contested by the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worthy of comment as to what the national interest demands in some of these areas because prior to reflecting upon these bills I would like to reflect on the benefits of cooperation between government and opposition in important areas. Clearly, this is an important area, one that is addressing issues of a national approach to our transport system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was reminded this morning that we have a long way to go in our banking system as far as our state entities are concerned. I went to transfer a reasonably substantial sum this morning from my bank here in Canberra to my bank in Western Australia and the bank wanted an $80 tax for the privilege. I might add that I did not transfer the money. Apparently, that is not a bank charge; that is a charge imposed by the ACT authorities to allow me to send money through a computer, which is probably based in Melbourne, to Western Australia. It is damn silly. However, here we are trying to resolve some of those problems. We also have an example here of how the major parties can get together to address serious national issues, and that is what this chamber is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, you are not going to see issues of native title in this chamber. You are not going to see issues of uniform reform of the tax system here either because our opponents have a feral approach to that which says that the political advantage outweighs the national interest. They are not issues that need to be confrontational. They are issues where the major parties, because of the extreme national importance of the issues, should be running around saying, `What is reasonable? What is fair to the people? What are the offsets that certain sections of the community might need, say, in the tax system if you made major changes?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should be able to stand up in this building, be it in the main chamber or in this chamber, and address the national interest rather than party political interests. Okay, I think there are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="824"> plenty of opportunities to present yourself as better administrators, as better able to run the country, but we should not be using matters of extreme national importance for the purpose of trying to improve our own political chances. Unfortunately, that is happening. For example, look at the issue of work for the dole. There has to be a national benefit. The two parties should not be sparring over the issue. They should be getting together to say, `What is the best way to implement such a process? What is fair? What is reasonable?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a message to the media in all of that but, of course, the media do not listen to what goes on in this chamber for the simple reason that there is no confrontation. In fact, 90 per cent of them, if they were asked to attend in this place, could not find it. That is a great pity because the national interest is being addressed in this chamber. I just make that point because it is the chamber in which people do get together to progress the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, it is also a place where members such as me, with no influence at cabinet level, can make comments on this sort of legislation in the hope that people&mdash;and I welcome those who are here today&mdash;who have a huge influence on the administration of these things can take them into account. I want to make points that are not necessarily against the proposals in the legislation but I want to raise issues that should be considered as time goes by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My background in business included both directorship and ownership of quite large road vehicles in Western Australia. I lived in Carnarvon where road transport was eventually its only source of transport. We did have shipping at one stage but that became so inefficient through bad work practices that over a 600&hyphen;mile journey it could not compete with trucks that, initially, were travelling over 300 miles of unsealed road. You would not believe that that could be the case but, in fact, it was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can well remember on one occasion deciding that I wanted to support the local shipping service. I was a substantial importer of goods to the town as a hotel proprietor, so I thought I would give the shipping company a bit of work. The only problem was that the goods arrived three days late and left me in an embarrassing situation in supplying my customers, and some of the goods arrived in damaged condition. It was just plain stupid that I should try and share my freight bill amongst the wharfies, the seamen and the trucking operators. That gives you some idea of why that was so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We discovered that, even under a road transport regime with government involvement, it was a franchise. We were told that if we had a monopoly it would be cheaper. We eventually discovered and believed that the monopoly was not serving us properly and I, amongst other citizens, formed a cooperative transport company to compete for our own work, and we did so by tendering to the government, notwithstanding that the government officials told us there was no way that we could reduce the price of freight into Carnarvon. They used the words, `We've gone through their figures, Mr Tuckey, with a fine toothcomb.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We underbid the franchised operator by 30 per cent. I might add that it took something like 12 years before the prices we charged the community&mdash;and I want to underline that word `community'&mdash;reached the bid price of our then competitor. In all that time, the cooperative made good profits&mdash;which, by the way, it returned to its customers. It was an interesting situation to support the argument for competition. I might add that, having won the monopoly, we invited our competitor back into the business to keep us honest. We then had a duopoly, but we retained 90 per cent of the business and they had 10 per cent. They were a very substantial organisation, well known throughout Australia today. The realities are that that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="825"> provides another aspect of all the matters of road transport; but I put that up on the basis of my credentials.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During that period, it was my personal advocacy with the then state minister for transport, Mr Ray O'Connor, that got the extension of road trains&mdash;which were limited originally from Carnarvon to Geraldton&mdash;through to the outskirts of Perth. I want to comment on the developments in that area. That represented huge financial savings. Of course, because we were transporting perishables and it was simply impossible to break up a road train 300 miles from destination with perishable goods, Mr O'Connor agreed to a trial for six months of two or three of our vehicles to prove the point. In six weeks he opened the road up to anyone, because we proved beyond doubt that these vehicles did not represent a threat to the safety of the community&mdash;and, of course, that has been established even further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is about setting national parameters for vehicle registration and vehicle configuration. It is on the issue of vehicle configuration that I want to address this particular committee, because that has been one of the greatest areas of stupidity on a state by state basis. Clearly, as you add to the load carrying capacity of a single prime mover by adding additional trailers, there is a substantial opportunity to reduce freight costs. The big cost is in the prime mover and, of course, in the operator. Even fuel consumption is not relative to doubling the load of a road train or to the creation of a B&hyphen;double or any of those other configurations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting point was that, quite clearly, certain states&mdash;Victoria, in particular&mdash;for decades used the road registration system as a non&hyphen;tariff barrier to protect the railways, which were encouraged into gross inefficiencies as a consequence. Who paid for that? Consumers. It is a reality, for a number of reasons, that trucks are more efficient than rail. Rail dominates when it gets to very large bulk loads over substantial distances. I have pointed out in my own electorate over the years that, whilst people like rail and they say it gets trucks off the road and does all sorts of things, the load that is shifted throughout my electorate each year, where there is about 4,000 kilometres of track, is 1,175 tonnes of freight per kilometre of infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The iron ore province in Western Australia shifts 80,000 tonnes of product per annum per kilometre of rail infrastructure. They also have too many kilometres of rail. As the late Lang Hancock pointed out, initially they should have had a central line with spurs. There is one available that is downhill all the way. An electric train running on it would generate electricity for the entire trip. However, the realities are that, even there, there are inefficiencies because of the system. Those inefficiencies should have been addressed in the initial planning stages of that wonderful asset of Australian resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My point is that I still have fears about having a national system. Western Australia and, very closely, Queensland set the pattern in the use of efficient truck configurations. They proved that they were not a danger. The Court government&mdash;and the Minister for Transport, Eric Charlton&mdash;decided to overcome the last stupid barrier to larger configurations. That stupid barrier was that you could not move a road train&mdash;that is, two semitrailers, with one towed by the other&mdash;in the metropolitan areas. We are still forcing the break&hyphen;up on the perimeter of the metropolitan area&mdash;it has progressed a long way from my original 300 miles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The realities were that, when we had that break&hyphen;up situation, a third of the revenue of that second trailer was lost in the last 20 or 30 kilometres, because that was the cost involved in having someone else pick it up and bring it in. Quite properly, the Court government said, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="826"> `This can cease. We will have a trial to prove that these things can run into the saleyards with stock or to the markets with perishables, and so on.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shires associated with those last 20 kilometres formed committees, went berserk and carried on, but eventually the trial was considered a success after 500 movements. When I was driving along in my car, a woman who was one of the leaders of the opposition to this rang up and protested vigorously that the minister had decided to open up that section of the road because he believed the trial was a success. Her complaint was that none of the members of her committee had seen one of these trucks on the road. That is how much of a danger they represented&mdash;they had never even seen one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She said, `We really need to have a look at them.' Why had she not seen them? She had not seen them because she had not noticed them. They were there all right. That is when the community gets silly. They are paying the price. I do not mind paying the price for genuine safety and genuine protection of the community, but I do when there is no good reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People talk about these larger configurations damaging the roads. If they get off the shoulder because road authorities have made the roads too narrow, naturally the longer vehicles will break a little bit more off the edge. However, when it comes to axle loading, because the weight is in the prime mover, the overall freight per axle loading is less. The best way to put it is that there can be more freight with less weight on the road. It is the aggregate of the axle loading. How can that be doing more damage to the road? However, there are problems with bridges and things like that which are more significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am addressing these issues to make the point that, now we have a uniform system, we should not let it become the lowest common denominator. With the town of Carnarvon, practically for as long as I can remember, three trailers went north. They still only allow two into the town. I am not sure that, with proper and decent roads, that is even a necessity. But every time a trailer is added to an appropriate prime mover a huge decision is being made. This legislation actually puts legislation together for the ACT, but as a model for the states. Section 3 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The purpose of this Act is to make provision for the registration of heavy vehicles and for related matters in the Australian Capital Territory and the Jervis Bay Territory.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I will take the few minutes I have left to talk about those regulations. Regulations, of course, are the laws that are written after we parliamentarians have passed the law. I believe that in greenfields legislation the regulations should be made available with the law and that we should have some time to give them scrutiny. That does not happen, but it will be the sharp end of an act of this nature. I hope we do not see public pressure and other stupid activities generating this lower common denominator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New South Wales decided to prevent trucking by charging ridiculously high registration fees and, of course, all their truck owners went off to South Australia. Others said that was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="827"> dreadful; I said that it serves them right. The realities are that if we overtax road transport, in excess of what is reasonable, then the consumer pays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment, in terms of the tax debate, this typical semitrailer on full&hyphen;time line haul is paying $2,000 a week in taxes. That is if you annualise the original sales tax on the prime mover and the other equipment and take into account fuel taxes and all of these things. That, to me, is patently silly in a country like Australia where we have huge distances involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In elections I used to make the point that if previous Prime Minister Keating had been dragged off to Russia by the KGB in his youth to be brainwashed into wrecking the Australian economy&mdash;as you and I now know, such a trip was not necessary&mdash;the first thing they would have taught him to do is tax transport. They would have said, `Tax transport. The higher you tax transport, the quicker you can wreck the economy.' I have heard statements that Australians' expenditure on transport is as high as $1 in $7 when you measure it through all the times that goods move from A to B.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a significant factor we will never overcome because Australia is Australia. Our resources just do not all happen to be within a couple of kilometres of a convenient port. We should look very closely at whether that is an appropriate source of taxation. I say that it is not. I think it is one of the issues that a proper review of the tax system should address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of these things are highlighted. Now that we have some centralised legislation, that is fine. I agree that we should not have the silly sorts of situations that existed at one stage where you could head across to South Australia from Western Australia and when you got there they would not let you drive your truck unless you had had their vehicle inspection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are all the reasons we are moving towards uniformity. I think that is fine but, as I say, there have been some most unimaginative and economically irresponsible road transport rules that had nothing to do with protecting people on the road, protecting the roads or anything else. In other states it did not happen. All the evidence was that the problems did not arise. We are now driving road trains through the metropolitan area in Perth and people cannot find them, those that bitterly wanted to find them and point out that they had just run over someone. It is ridiculous. They do not represent a danger. In fact, they are very hard to identify amongst all the other traffic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think many truck drivers would tell you that the real dangers on the road are not them; they are people towing caravans and people who drive in a highly irresponsible way, particularly in relation to trucks. They see the length of a motor car in front of a truck, that the truck driver has left there for the purpose of not running into the car in front of him, and they pull into the gap and wonder why there is smoke rising off the bitumen. I think there are more dangers there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These particular dangers should not be taken into account when they do not exist. That was one of the great areas of concern in Western Australia. The first was that we have in some cases had to actually raise our registration fees because the state of Western Australia did not believe it was appropriate to tax people through registration fees. They were there for the purpose of registering the vehicle. Of course, we have had to raise them somewhat but, more importantly, we eventually won the argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we have some special rights to license larger configurations which are significant to the economy of Western Australia, with the distances involved. I make a plea on the record that at no stage should we use uniformity to get the lowest common denominator. We should 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="828"> always be trying to progress the boundaries, provided we take genuine note of safety for the community and the normal protection of roads.</PARA></SPEECH>

The two bills currently before us are an important step towards nationally uniform road transport laws. The Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Amendment Bill establishes a legislative framework for a national regulatory scheme for the transport of dangerous goods by road. These minor amendments will pave the way for the completion of the new national dangerous goods regulations and a revised version of the Australian code for the transport of dangerous goods by road.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reforms to the dangerous goods laws are designed chiefly to improve the safe transport of dangerous goods by road, enhance national uniformity, and improve enforcement and compliance. The proposed regulations will clarify the responsibilities of each of the parties involved in the transport of dangerous goods, introduce a nationally coordinated administrative system for exemptions, approvals and other decisions, establish a national licensing scheme for vehicles carrying dangerous goods in bulk, and their drivers, and an obligation to use only people who are trained to work with dangerous goods for tasks such as packing, consigning and maintaining equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Bill establishes a framework for a national registration scheme for heavy vehicles throughout Australia. The scheme will provide uniform arrangements for initial registration, renewal, transfer, suspension and cancellation of registration, and the issue and clearance of vehicle defect notices. Uniform and consistent heavy vehicle registration procedures will end the various different registration requirements across Australia which are confusing, complex and costly to the transport industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's road transport industry is among the best in the world. Trucking accounts for about 75 per cent of the Australian freight market in terms of both value and tonnage. Approximately $60 billion of freight is shifted by road transport each year throughout Australia. In 1992&hyphen;93, the transport industry contributed 2.9 per cent to Australia's gross domestic product, a figure which continues to rise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The value of the road transport industry, as an employer, is also significant. Between 1985 and 1993, the industry grew by 21 per cent, which equals 22,800 jobs. Currently, the trucking industry accounts for 1.7 per cent of all employment in Australia. I hasten to add that a large of percentage of that is located in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trucking industry plays a pivotal role, particularly in my electorate of McEwen. Two of Victoria's main highways dissect McEwen&mdash;the Goulburn Valley Highway, which provides a link between Melbourne and Brisbane, and the Hume Highway which is the chief route for transport travelling between Melbourne and Sydney. Without an efficient and cost&hyphen;effective road transport system, numerous other industries would collapse. Wineries, farms, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="829"> manufacturing, retail, timber and mining are just a few of the important industries in my electorate of McEwen which rely on heavy vehicles to conduct their business.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension, I was at a very crucial part of my address in this chamber regarding these two national transport bills. I was on the point of referring to the importance of the trucking industry and how, in our everyday lives, we sometimes do not realise how important it is. I was also about to give some examples.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not realise when we go into the supermarket that the shelves there would not be stocked unless we had an efficient transport industry. We take so many other things for granted as well. For example, service stations would run out of fuel, there would be no means to transport the timber to the sawmills, dairy farmers could not get their milk delivered to the dairies, and wineries&mdash;a very big growth industry in the important electorate of McEwen&mdash;could not transport their products to their outlets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without the transport industry, the very fabric of our society would disintegrate and we simply would not survive. The bus and coach industry is equally important. Not only does it play a vital role in Australia's burgeoning tourism industry, but it also contributes substantially to the national economy and to the social and recreational life of all Australians. Almost a third of the entire Australian passenger market is serviced by the coach and bus industry, which employs 20,000 people. That is why it is essential that our road transport laws are reformed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the December 1996 edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Reformer</EMPHASIS>, the National Road Transport Commission referred to an independent report which estimated that implementation of the entire package of national reforms to road transport could benefit the economy by up to $1 billion a year. The direct economic benefits to the road transport industry and its users are estimated at nearly $500 million a year, or a 13 per cent improvement in overall productivity. And that means jobs and increased economic activity throughout regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report was based on surveys of transport operators from across Australia. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Reformer</EMPHASIS>, in its article, goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most operators said that the reforms would allow them to reduce the size of their fleets, cutting operating costs significantly. Operators said that the reforms would enable them to hold their rates at current levels or reduce them, with most of the benefits being passed to customers and ultimately to consumers via the supply chain.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Howard government has already clearly shown its commitment to road transport reform, and the development of a uniform national regulatory framework, through the National Road Transport Commission process. While the states and territories and the transport industry have agreed that uniform laws are necessary, there is still some way to go before consensus is reached on all aspects of the national road transport law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The removal of individual state and territory restrictions and registration charges for heavy vehicles, and the adoption and implementation of nationally uniform rules and standards, will help to reduce costs to both the transport industry and the businesses they supply&mdash;and, ultimately, consumers&mdash;and will bring about greater efficiencies and competition for truck and bus drivers and operators and lead to a safer transport industry.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="830">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note that these reforms will benefit not only the road transport industry itself but also ultimately each and every Australian through lower costs and charges and safer roads for all road users. As drivers, most of us know that, when travelling along our national roads and even our local roads, trucks and buses can be fairly imposing at times. Living in Victoria's scenic Yarra Valley, with its narrow, winding and hilly roads, I must admit to the occasional bout of nerves when confronted by a heavy vehicle coming around a narrow bend. These fears can be somewhat lessened through road transport law reforms. If we know that heavy vehicles are designed and constructed to be safe and are not defective, and if we know that bus and truck drivers are qualified, experienced, properly licensed and driving responsibly, we can be reassured that we can share the road with them safely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The safety performance of trucks has improved greatly in the 1990s. Figures from the Federal Office of Road Safety show that last year there were 140 fatal crashes involving articulated trucks in Australia, a 15.2 per cent drop from 1995. This is also a substantial improvement on 1988 when there were 260 fatal crashes recorded. Unfortunately, the number of fatal crashes involving buses increased by 40.9 per cent last year, with 31 fatal crashes in 1996 compared with 22 in 1995. But overall, the heavy vehicle industry itself has a good road safety record. A 1996 Federal Office of Road Safety report on heavy vehicle accidents in urban areas showed that, in two&hyphen;thirds of cases, the party at fault was the other road user, not the bus or truck driver. This shows how important it is that motorists drive carefully and sensibly around trucks and buses and remember their manoeuvrability, stopping, turning and acceleration restrictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Road accidents, whether or not trucks and buses are involved, come at an enormous cost to all Australians in terms of the number of lives lost and the serious injuries and trauma they cause. Last year a total of 1,973 people lost their lives on our roads&mdash;a drop, I must add, of 2.2 per cent on the previous year. Victims of motor vehicle accidents, and their families, experience great physical, psychological and emotional pain, shock and suffering after being involved in crashes, while the community must bear the cost of the $6.1 billion annual road fatality and accident bill. The Federal Office of Road Safety calculates that, for every road death, 15 other people suffer life&hyphen;altering injuries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to a VicRoads forward strategy entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Roads in Victoria</EMPHASIS>, national highways account for 13 per cent of all serious injury accidents on Victorian rural roads, even though national highways represent only one per cent of the rural road length. Between 1990 and 1994, there were 722 serious casualty accidents on national highways in Victoria and, since 1991, the number of serious injury accidents on national highways has increased by 40 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government has already announced numerous programs specifically aimed at reducing the road toll and increasing road safety. One of the most important initiatives is undoubtedly the reintroduction of the federal road safety black spot funding program which was scrapped by the previous Labour government in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the last election the coalition vowed to restore the black spot program in an effort to reduce road trauma. The government will provide almost $149 million over the next four years towards the program, which will target road locations with a high accident record and where the highest benefits can be achieved. An evaluation of the former federal accident black spot program indicated a return of $4 for every $1 invested. The Federal Office of Road Safety 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="831"> has estimated that one life is saved every year for every $500,000 spent on the black spot program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The best aspect of this important road safety program is that it involves local communities helping the government to identify and fix Australia's most dangerous roads. Community groups, service clubs and organisations representing motorists and the transport industry are able to nominate dangerous sites for treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many such black spots in my electorate of McEwen which require immediate attention, particularly sections along the Goulburn Valley Highway, Maroondah Highway, Main Whittlesea Road and Whittlesea&hyphen;Yea Road. These roads have recorded a high level of casualty accidents in recent years mainly due to roadside obstacles and lack of shoulder sealing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One local council in my electorate, the city of Whittlesea, has already taken advantage of the consultative phase of the black spot program and has nominated three sites in the McEwen electorate for black spot funding. These nominations have been forwarded to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) for his consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As mentioned previously, there are two major highways in my electorate of McEwen which form part of the national highway network&mdash;the Hume Highway and the Goulburn Valley Highway north of Seymour. Although these two highways represent only a very small part of the total national highway network, they are of national importance to the road transport system. According to Vicroads, Victoria accounts for 35 per cent of the interstate road freight task and has a 20 per cent share of national road travel. The Goulburn Valley Highway and Hume Freeway also provide a vital link for businesses and primary producers to the port of Melbourne, which handles more than one&hyphen;third of the nation's exports and imports and 44 per cent of containers which move through capital city ports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Goulburn Valley Highway has become notorious in the past two years for road fatalities and is now referred to by locals as `Hell Highway'. In the 12 months to September 1995, the short stretch of the Goulburn Valley Highway which runs from Seymour to north of Murchison East claimed nine lives in six separate crashes. Heavy vehicles were involved in half of those crashes. The Goulburn Valley Highway is used extensively by the road transport industry carrying freight to the port of Melbourne and interstate. The VicRoads1993 Goulburn Valley Highway strategy estimates that in 1990 about 1.3 million tonnes of freight was transported north of the state border with a similar amount brought south.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an urgent need to improve road safety and capacity along the Goulburn Valley Highway by way of progressive duplication and the provision of overtaking lanes. VicRoads believes that upgrading the road would reduce costs of interstate freight movement between Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland and improve the competitiveness of the local region's fruit export industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another section of national highway which is used predominantly for freight transport and which needs attention is the link between the Hume Freeway at Craigieburn and the Western Ring Road. According to Vicroads, there have been 293 casualty accidents, including 11 fatal accidents, along this section of highway over the past five years. It is suggested that a new freeway standard connection is needed between these two points to overcome the high costs of delays and accidents which are currently being experienced. The primary causes are the lack of access control between the existing highway and abutting industrial and commercial development, and the heavy traffic volumes at major signalled intersections.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="832">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These two national highways are vital to the road transport industry and we must ensure that they are continually upgraded and improved to meet growing transport requirements and reduce road trauma and its high cost to the Australian community. The road transport industry plays an integral role in the economies of almost every single community in my electorate of McEwen, as it does in the nation as a whole. The government has shown through its road safety and improvement programs, its role in the development of a national road transport law, and the introduction of these two bills before the House today, that it is committed to improving the efficiencies of the road transport industry. This will boost growth, create jobs, cut costs and increase competitiveness, which means massive benefits for the heavy vehicle industry and, in turn, for each and every Australian including, most importantly, those people within the electorate of McEwen. I commend these bills to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is perhaps little known that our economy is completely dependent upon roads for freight transport. Some 75 per cent of the goods moved around Australia each day go by road. Nearly 20 per cent of the cost of goods that we buy in our daily life is attributable to the cost of transport. So it could be said that it is a major part of our economy. Road transport is a $60,000 million per year industry. It is unquestionably a critical player in our domestic economic make&hyphen;up, and perhaps it goes a little unnoticed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Road transport is of critical importance in the movement of goods, and of critical importance in the cost imposts to both local primary producers, the beef and coal industries, in my electorate&mdash;industries whose plight these days is not looking much better. The industry is of critical importance as an employer in regional communities such as Gloucester, Bulahdelah, Stroud and Raymond Terrace. It has been of focal critical importance in matters of national road safety over the past decade or so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I want to focus on some of the big reforms for the industry which map out the direction in which road transport is heading. The objective of these reforms, as far as I am concerned, is to ensure that road transport is in even better shape to improve and grow and, freed from unnecessary government red tape, to secure for those who work in the industry&mdash;employer and employee alike&mdash;a rewarding future based on professionalism and service to clients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The best way to achieve this future is for the government and the industry to work hand in hand in partnership, and that is what the Howard government is firmly committed to. The government is committed to securing a better future for all Australians. We have come a long way since the federal government first became involved in road funding back in the 1920s; and, over the next 10 years, we will go a lot further. By the year 2005 or 2006, under a coalition government, I anticipate that we will achieve some major national milestones. Indeed, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, John Sharp, is to be heartily congratulated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some examples of reforms are that all the narrow seals on the national highways in rural Australia will have been eliminated, and most of the rural network will have been opened up to unimpeded access to B&hyphen;doubles and B&hyphen;triples&mdash;one of the major forms of transportation in my electorate, as I said before, for beef and for coal. We will see the Summerland Way reconstructed to take freight vehicles off the Pacific Highway and avoid the densely populated areas. I do not think there are too many people who like to see large numbers of trucks, particularly when they are heavily laden B&hyphen;doubles, coming past their own front door.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="833">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most importantly for my electorate, we will see the upgrading of the Pacific Highway. In particular, one stretch, the Bulahdelah to Coolongolook deviation, will eliminate the greatest black spots on the eastern seaboard on Highway 1. This is all part of the four&hyphen;lane road going all the way from Ballarat to Brisbane through Melbourne and Sydney, and the Pacific Highway is obviously the vital link.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is in my electorate a further commitment to the section from Coolongolook to Possums Brush of $93 million, which will eliminate another poor stretch of road. All up, the government has given a genuine commitment of some $2&half; billion for the Pacific Highway over the next decade&mdash;a commitment that we have had before from the previous government and that then has been withdrawn&mdash;obviously without concern, without understanding of the transport industry, and without respect for those who travel on it and for those who unfortunately die on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With that, I would like to make reference to a recent report issued by the Federal Office of Road Safety comparing OECD nations. Importantly, the international comparisons of road deaths as a measure of public health risks associated with road trauma imply the point of sensibility and necessity of having national uniform regulatory regimes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fatalities per 100,000 in 1994, Australia is ranked ninth in OECD nations with 10.8 road fatalities per 100,000 population. This figure, whilst it undoubtedly could be better, is in fact below the OECD median and, critically, is below the fatalities per 100,000 people of years past. In 1970 we had 30.4 fatalities per 100,000 people in Australia. In 1980, the figure had dropped to 22.3 fatalities per 100,000 people and in 1990 to 13.7 fatalities. But what price do we put on a life? We seem to rejoice when the road toll drops by five or 10, but still that represents hundreds of people too many wasted in carnage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To give you some examples, from talking to Arthur Baker of Baker's Towing at Bulahdelah, in 1995&mdash;just for heavy vehicles&mdash;there were 28 heavy vehicle accidents; nine complete road closures&mdash;one which lasted two days; two fatal accidents, and the list goes on. Last year on 23 July there was a glass spill which shut the Pacific Highway for a full day. On 25 July, some two days later, an oil spill shut the Pacific Highway yet again. Days later, on 1 August, a chemical spill shut the Pacific Highway yet again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the causes? Everyone could quite easily tag it as being driver fatigue, but there are many causes. It could be equipment failure and, indeed, in some of those accidents equipment failure has been put down as one of the causes. But it is also attributable to it being the worst section of highway in Australia. It is, as I said, a section of highway that has been ignored over the last 13 years, despite the promises and the commitment of $1 billion, we might remember, in 1990 when the member for Charlton (Mr Bob Brown) was the minister for transport and Mr Keating, the then Prime Minister, in his wisdom followed up and pulled out the $1 billion. It is not very good for the people of Bulahdelah who have to go out and clean up some of these messes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the establishment of the National Road Transport Commission, a lot of progress has been made on achieving uniformity of charges and regulations in the road transport industry. To give you some examples, currently a rough average for registration in New South Wales is around $2,800 for a prime mover and $1,400 for a trailer; in Queensland it is $900 for the trailer and $2,500 for the prime mover, and in South Australia $420 for the trailer and $2,500 for the prime mover. So just on trailer registrations there is a variation of over $1,000. What puts it into even further jeopardy&mdash;and there are a lot of trucks and trailers in my electorate 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="834"> registered in South Australia&mdash;is that you only have to have one inspection at the time of purchase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that these regulations do seek to change is that under part 2, division 1, section 11, the registration authority is not to register heavy vehicles based outside its jurisdiction. Quite clearly, it is saying that people must prove that the state they register their vehicles in must be their base of operation. The excuse put forward by South Australia is that there are enough registration inspections at roadsides throughout Australia to pick up problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, it is clearly known throughout the trucking industry that these black spots of inspection&mdash;not the black spots of roads&mdash;are transmitted on radio frequencies and drivers who are overloaded and drivers with poor quality equipment will take detours, stop trucks, do anything they can, to avoid going through them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This set of regulations goes a long way towards establishing a safer road network and a safer system of transport in Australia for all Australians. I think it is the right of every employer and driver in the transport industry to be able to pick up a load in Perth and drive through South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland to Darwin with that same load on without having to be challenged on the registration of the vehicle, on the quality of inspection of the vehicle, on the load that is on the vehicle, and on the regulations that it has complied with. I think these regulations go a long way towards establishing clear links that show that this government is serious about the transport industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I speak quite regularly with people in the transport industry, such as John Farragher from the John Farragher Transport Group, which has a couple of hundred trucks based in my electorate; Joe Sepos from Sepos Transport, which has some 175 trucks in my electorate; Horns Transport, which is a major coal contractor, and Mountain Bulk Haulage, which is one of the biggest contractors in New South Wales under varying names. One of the biggest things that those people have put to me is that, quite simply, the cowboys in the industry are destroying it for all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the days of the `Mad Dog Morgan' truck drivers will soon be long gone. The time is coming when there needs to be a sense of responsibility and professionalism in the industry. Through these regulations I am sure that we will be starting the process of achieving uniform regulations across the broad spectrum of the transport industry. It is a process that will see the eradication of a few more cowboys and we will see less accidents per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But such a process does not come easy. There will be objections from within sectors of the transport industry. As I said, the people in my electorate who are involved in the industry applaud the government. The move towards self&hyphen;regulation and self&hyphen;inspection for those who can comply with the self&hyphen;inspection process takes another unnecessary burden off small business. For large trucking companies such as Sepos and Farragher to have to take their vehicles to inspection stations, when they have their own full&hyphen;blown facilities for stripping and rebuilding trucks, inspecting and checking&mdash;and they run an extremely clean outfit&mdash;is rather ludicrous. It is a cost impost and, more importantly, a time impost which leads to a loss of business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summing up, the minister is to be congratulated. I look forward to working with him to make sure that these regulations are implemented. Now that Thiess Contractors has been nominated as the preferred tenderer for the Bulahdelah to Coolongolook section of road, we can look forward to the contracts being finalised, to the road being started and to it being completed just after the end of this term of government. The continuation of that road will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="835"> make it safe for those who travel upon it. It will reduce the fatalities and it will allow people to get on with their lives.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend these important cognate bills on road transport reforms to the parliament. They form an integral part of the national road transport reform program being brought to fruition, on a cooperative basis, by the Commonwealth, state and territory governments. For far too long, the economic viability and efficiency of the nation's road transport system has been compromised and undermined by each of the states and territories pursuing fragmented, inconsistent and contradictory road regulations, and the previous speaker mentioned the matter of some of the vehicles not being inspected on a regular basis in some of the states.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Amendment Bill 1996 and the Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Bill 1996 achieve the government's objective to introduce national road transport reforms designed to produce improvements in road safety and transport efficiency and reduce the costs of administering road transport across Australia. The bills are a significant component of transport micro&hyphen;economic reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A national uniform regime for road transport regulations will deliver substantial benefits to the industry, its users and the wider community, as well as to the national economy. It will remove the frustration, delays, inefficiencies and costs linked with differences in the regulatory frameworks of the various states and territories. Australia has a huge transport industry which, in economic terms, exceeds $60 billion a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate of Riverina, the city of Wagga Wagga is the headquarters of many trucking companies, large and small. It is also a centre for maintenance for those trucking organisations. In Wagga Wagga we have the headquarters of Finemores, one of the largest transport operators in Australia. This company and the others bring many jobs to the Riverina and particularly to Wagga Wagga. Finemores is a progressive company which generates enormous job opportunities and injects millions of dollars into the Riverina and national economies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing I like about Finemores, and no doubt it is reflected in other companies, is the training program they provide for drivers, both in safety and in the management of their vehicles. One of the touches I like about many trucks today is that on the back of them they have a phone number and a request for you to phone the company and let them know if, in your opinion, a driver is doing a good job or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An efficient and cost&hyphen;effective transport industry is vital to the ongoing development of Australia and has a critical role to play in the movement of diverse freight, such as food and manufactured goods, to consumers across the country. Twenty per cent of the cost of goods is attributed to transport costs, and the bulk of that occurs on our road network. Any strategy to introduce uniform national transport regulations in order to reduce costs is welcome, as those cost reductions translate into more jobs and lower prices to consumers. This is especially important in rural and regional Australia as transport costs are an additional input to prices charged to consumers there compared with those for people living in the cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is a vast country with one of the most extensive road networks in the world, comprising 810,000 kilometres of public roads, and this makes it essential to have an efficient and uniform national road transport regulatory regime. Our road network is used by a national fleet of 11 million vehicles of which about half a million are heavy transport vehicles. For non&hyphen;bulk commodities, road is Australia's dominant domestic transport mode. In terms of tonnage moved, 69 per cent of freight is consigned by road. When measured by tonnes per 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="836"> kilometre, road freight comprises 34 per cent of the transport task. Ninety per cent of the transport task is performed on the major routes that comprise 20 per cent of the total network by length. The remaining 80 per cent of roads perform only 10 per cent of the transport task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A key component of the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Amendment Bill 1996 is the safe movement of dangerous goods on our road network. The movement of dangerous goods by road does pose a threat and a danger to other road users, as well as to city and urban areas through which the heavy vehicles travel. Authorities must always be vigilant in these situations and the transport industry involved in the movement of dangerous goods has a huge responsibility to ensure every safety precaution is taken and every regulation is observed in order to protect the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, you may have read in the papers this week, as I did, of the unfortunate death of a motorist when the load shifted on a truck and the timber crushed his vehicle&mdash;I think that accident was in Sydney. You may also have read as recently as this morning of another accident when a steel beam passed through another vehicle, narrowly missing taking a person's head off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember that, as a member representing a large electorate&mdash;and I represented a very large electorate and travelled about a million kilometres in a motor vehicle in 11 or 12 years&mdash;there were many instances where pieces came off the backs of trucks. I remember once a steel rim came off a truck and if it had bounced the wrong way I would not be here today&mdash;I would not have had a head. So it is important that we also look at that particular section of the road transport industry. While I do not think we should be over&hyphen;regulatory, we must do something about that. As I have said, in my own experience the number of pieces of equipment that fell off the backs of trucks narrowly missing the car were many indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although Australia's road safety record is equal to the best in the world, accidents do happen. Fortunately, our professional transport industry, our national uniform regulations and our network of highly skilled and trained full&hyphen;time emergency service personnel, along with volunteers, have always combined to prevent major disasters when accidents invariably occur. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, all trucks travelling today have to carry a manifest to let us know what is on them in case there is an accident. It is not only important to know what is on the truck but to know exactly where it is on the truck, because if you have to go and handle a situation you may have a problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a lighter note, I remember coming across an accident once where a truck had been carrying a load of bees, and the bees were off the back of the truck and in the middle of the road. This was in the middle of a large town. I must say the emergency service had a problem on their hands there&mdash;not as dangerous as in some accidents, but certainly a lively situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the parliament for providing me with information on dangerous goods being carried on vehicles. I would like to read this shipping document manifest into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dangerous Goods cannot be transported unless the appropriate Shipping Documentation is available in the Driver's Cab.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That Documentation must include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A detailed description of the Dangerous Goods, including Class of Dangerous Goods and the United Nations (UN) Dangerous Good Number. This UN Number is specific to the particular Dangerous Goods being transported and provides Emergency response personnel with clear information about the type of Dangerous Goods being transported.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The second element of the Shipping document is the Emergency Procedure Guide for the Dangerous Goods being transported. This Guide provides essential emergency response information, including what to do in an Emergency situation.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the vehicle must be clearly placarded with  Dangerous Good Class Diamonds indication, the primary physical hazard indication associated with the dangerous goods.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">However, an accident on the Hume Highway last year, which involved a heavy vehicle carrying hazardous materials, highlighted several serious anomalies. I am pleased that most of these have been addressed in the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Amendment Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the manifest still needs to be kept in a set place within the prime mover to enable easy access by firefighters or other rescue operatives, particularly in a case where the driver is unconscious or may have been killed. A report was prepared on the particular accident that I mentioned. It is interesting to read this report because, while the manifest has to be in these trucks today, there is some argument about exactly where in the truck it should be. The report on that accident says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The manifest was OK but its positioning in the truck inside the drivers side door, as required by legislation, was not considered appropriate. In this particular accident it was not possible to gain access to the manifest due to the nature of the accident. A (trucking company) representative suggested that a better location for the manifest would be under the passengers side seat. Already a lot of computer equipment is stored in this location on . . . trucks and experience has shown that to be, generally, the best accessible location following an accident.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have written to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) about that. I asked him to take that on board. Only research will show whether that is the right place for it or whether it should be, as it is now, inside the driver's side door. I have raised this matter with the minister and have urged him to look at the problem of easy access to the truck manifest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important element of the safe transport of dangerous goods is the coalition government's black spot roads program which will, over time, upgrade Australia's most dangerous roads. As part of this crucial road safety strategy, the government will spend $36 million a year in real terms over a four&hyphen;year period. As a representative of the vast and important rural electorate of Riverina&mdash;the food bowl of Australia&mdash;I am pleased that 50 per cent of these funds will be allocated to rural and regional roads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As other members have done, I have put out a press statement asking people in my electorate to let me know of black spots. I received a letter the other day about a black spot on the Hume Highway and, while the Hume Highway is not in my electorate, this example will give the House an indication of the problem. This person was writing about an area that has a dual carriageway, with a concrete road, so you would think everything would be all right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is with a sidetrack into a service station. The concrete leading into that sidetrack ends at a very sharp angle, so when a truck goes onto the side to go down the bypass, it moves off the concrete onto the gravel. This has created an enormous hole. The person who wrote to me said that he had wiped out the front end of his car in the hole. All that is needed is another metre of concrete on that angle, extended on either side, thus phasing it in. That may save lives. That example is an indication of one of the black spots which could be fixed up without great expense.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Changes in regulations invariably cause problems for some individuals, and no doubt this will happen within the transport industry. While these bills will generate enormous benefits for the transport industry and the broader community, I am confident that those operators who feel that they may be adversely affected by the reforms will be given a fair hearing by the different state jurisdictions. I commend these bills to the House and I congratulate the government for introducing them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Amendment Bill. I appreciate the excellent work done on transport reform to date by Minister Sharp, his staff and the department. I also appreciate that the aim of the act is to provide for the safe and efficient transport of dangerous goods across Australia, albeit by using present links available including through urban areas and historic villages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that improving the administration and the enforcement of the procedures set in plan for the transportation of dangerous goods are certainly noble intentions. However, the act does not take into account three critical factors and I raise these in the knowledge of how they would affect and relate to my electorate of Gilmore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the act fails to take into consideration the standard of roads we inherited and on which the dangerous goods are to be transported. The potential for disaster because of poor maintenance cannot be neutralised by regulations. To introduce such regulations for the safety of goods being transported would, of course, be welcome. However, we all understand that transport is only as safe as the roads upon which it travels and I concede that for the most part this service is excellent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We as a government can regulate all we like but as long as the roads are not up to scratch then the potential for an accident is always going to be extreme. My electorate of Gilmore is a perfect example. It is a dead end when it comes to the moving of goods by road transport. As well, there is no other transportation choice, as the railway system from the southern end of Sydney comes to a halt in my electorate. Therefore, the only option is transport by road.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a number of small manufacturers and two major manufacturers in the Shoalhaven that have national markets&mdash;the Shoalhaven paper mill and the Manildra group producing starch and ethanol. Both of these companies, which are the largest employers in the area, process and require large amounts of chemicals to be transported in bulk in and out of the area on roads that not only go through historic villages and urban areas but that are also, in many cases, substandard. The major arteries into Nowra from the Hume Highway and all points south and west are either via Batemans Bay or through the historic township of Kangaroo Valley, adding some hundreds of dollars to a trip in fuel and running costs because of the added distance, not to mention the added stress that is incurred by the drivers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To illustrate the inadequacy and the potential for danger of this road, Minister Sharp and I were recently invited by Hitchcock's Haulage of Bomaderry to join them on two loaded semitrailers on a run from Moss Vale to Bomaderry through Kangaroo Valley to experience what to them is everyday life. The journey was a real eye&hyphen;opener for both of us. Had it not been for the skill and expertise of the drivers, the near misses we experienced could undoubtedly have been a lot more serious. It was very easy to see the potential for disaster with the drivers relying on each other's expertise to avoid such incidents&mdash;not to mention the anger and frustration of those having the misfortune to be behind them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This potential would almost be eliminated if main road 92 were to be built from the coast to Canberra, using a link out of the city centre and travelling through sparsely populated areas 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="839"> yet linking the region to the city. No longer would semitrailers laden with dangerous goods need to travel through the historic Kangaroo Valley and, in particular, the very dangerous road could then revert to being a tourist route&mdash;for which it was designed&mdash;linking Sydney with the southern highlands, Canberra, the Shoalhaven and Illawarra. Apart from the question of safety, the socioeconomic implications are enormous. Once again the lifestyle of a village could be restored without the fear of a disaster about to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another valuable asset to the Shoalhaven is HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Albatross</EMPHASIS> which is being upgraded in its role as a major defence maintenance facility. Its services are being exported to South&hyphen;East Asia and there is need for close links to Canberra to allow for embassy liaisons and to provide a strategic defence link between HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Albatross</EMPHASIS>, HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cresswell</EMPHASIS> and Canberra. The Department of Defence will, of course, also be bound by the dangerous goods act, so main road 92 would provide the safe, speedy link that is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pleasing to note that the defence forces are already making a start on parts of main road 92 for their own benefit and the future potential of the base and in turn my electorate as a whole. I thank the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) for recogning of this potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second item I raise with regard to this legislation is the environmental concerns of transporting dangerous goods through areas of strategic environmental importance. The impact of road transport on Australia's environment is significant and I do not believe safety concerns with regard to environmental issues have been of sufficient focus in the dangerous goods act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will quote from the recent report of the review board, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Transport law and the future of the National Road Transport Commission (NRTC)</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Road transport is the single largest source of air pollution in major urban areas in Australia. It accounts for about 12% of greenhouse gas emissions. As such, the impact of road transport on Australia's environment is significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review of the NRTC notes the environmental issues so far have not been a focus of the reform process. It acknowledges the need for greater consideration of the environmental impact of changes to road transport regulation. In essence, it recommends that . . . the National Road Transport Commission be required to consult, to the mutual satisfactory of both parties, with the National Environmental Protection Council Committee on all road transport issues having significant environmental impacts.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I support these recommendations and again use my electorate of Gilmore as an example. Gilmore is an area that boasts some of the most spectacular scenery in Australia, and I believe the socioeconomic future of Gilmore rests with this beautiful scenery in the form of its attraction to tourists, mainly for ecotourism, for both domestic and international markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In considering the transport of dangerous goods I ask: what plans has the government for protecting fragile environmental areas from accidents and spills that we hope will never eventuate? Regulations at a federal and state level are necessary, but not always adhered to. Furthermore, accidents are generally caused by inexperienced drivers who are not subject to the regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must again emphasise that the safety of pristine areas, of which my electorate is a proud keeper, cannot be guaranteed by regulations alone and you cannot regulate against accidents. The impact of a spill of dangerous goods on flora and fauna in the Gilmore electorate would be disastrous. Fragile areas such as Jervis Bay and national parks would take many years to recover, if ever, from such an accident. Another scenario that brings shivers to the spine is a petrol tanker spill on the Batemans Bay bridge. The environment would be ruined and that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="840"> would mean economic disaster for the fishing industry, the oyster industry and the tourism industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although I talk on the subject of my electorate of Gilmore in regard to the environment, I must refer to the 1993 report of the Resource Assessment Commission. This report is the most substantial of almost 60 reports which have been undertaken on Australia's coastal zone since the 1960s. The report identified a need for an integrated national approach involving local, state and Commonwealth governments to address the problems of the coastal zone. The inquiry found that no single sphere of government can manage the zone, and issues of national significance and great public concern are involved; the socioeconomic development of the coastal zone is of profound importance to this nation; and, most importantly, Australia has international obligations in the zone that necessitate coordination between the spheres of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our coastal zone, with its estuaries, contains ecologically important habitats, and on the whole our marine and estuarine environments are in good condition. However, the problems of coastal pollution have been recognised and it is our responsibility not only to put a stop to the progress of pollution but to reverse the trend, and certainly to do all we can to prevent the potential disaster of a spill of dangerous goods. There are options such as a link road that eliminate these serious concerns for my electorate. I will quote briefly from Australia's state of the environment report of 1996:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Air toxin emissions by vehicles are an emerging issue through urban and coastal areas requiring further investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final factor not addressed by this dangerous goods act is the lack of a contingency plan should the worst scenario happen. I have said previously that it is impossible to regulate against accidents. I cannot stress enough the importance of looking at better roads when complimenting this bill&mdash;in particular, for my electorate, main road 92. This is certainly an issue that would involve all levels of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The social and economic future of Gilmore is tied to the potential of its environmental assets. A dangerous goods spill would have a devastating effect on our economy and community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again I congratulate all those involved in the preparation of the dangerous goods act, and I ask that they give serious consideration to the points referred to. Also I commend the minister for transport and his department on work being done so far on main road 92, as I commend the Shoalhaven Council for allocating considerable funds for research to this most important road link, not just for the Gilmore electorate but for New South Wales and Australia as a whole.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to keep the chamber here for too long but in summing up I would just like to thank all participants in this debate. I have been listening intently to what has been said from both sides of the House and I would congratulate all members on the nature and extent of their contribution to this debate. I think that it has been extremely worth while.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Melbourne and the shadow minister (Mr Tanner), raised questions about the need for the government to heed the issues of heavy vehicle safety, driving hours and vehicle maintenance. I can assure him that the government is acutely aware of that and is already paying close attention to these areas.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="841">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The road transport reforms being developed by the National Road Transport Commission&mdash;the NRTC&mdash;are intended to cover a wide range of transport activities. Registration and dangerous goods are only two of six regulatory models which fall within that reform program. Other modules include: truck driving hours; heavy vehicle standards; compliance and enforcement; and driver licensing. I commend to Mr Tanner those transport reforms that are being developed and I respectfully suggest he has a close look at that program. I think it will answer a number of his queries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), raised the concern about the types of dangerous goods being transported and the public's right to know, and that is a very legitimate point. The new dangerous goods regime that I was talking about before which has been developed by the NRTC contains strict requirements for dangerous goods, with the vehicle to be clearly placarded in accordance with international requirements. These placards include colour symbols and written warnings which indicate to all road users the nature of the hazard posed by those dangerous goods. I can assure the honourable member that the government is acutely aware of that and I think that he would be well satisfied with the regime that has been put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Calare (Mr Andren), raised the question of who is going to foot the bill for road and bridge damage from the increase in heavy vehicle limits and the associated transport costs. The mass limits of individual vehicles are part of the NRTC's legislative reforms. There has been extensive consultation with local governments and others in relation to that. In effect, operators who wish to avail themselves of any increased mass will be required to pay additional charges to recover the cost of any additional road damage. This arrangement will affect only large operators and will result in an amendment to the Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Act 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Calare also raised the question of the representation of community groups in relation to deliberations that led to these amendments. Under the NRTC Act 1991, there is a strict requirement for the NRTC to consult with representatives of people who live in rural or remote areas where appropriate and practicable to do so. Furthermore, section 10(d) of the act requires that all interested people, bodies and organisations be involved in the consultative process, and I believe that has been attended to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Corio (Mr O'Connor), raised a question about Point Lillias. That is ostensibly a state government matter and, to the extent that the transport of dangerous goods is a state and territory responsibility, we have no strict regulatory responsibility in that area, although, as I indicated earlier, the new dangerous goods regulatory regime is designed to facilitate the safe transport of dangerous goods and compliance with those new regulations will provide for the highest possible level of safety regardless of locational factors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that is of assistance to those honourable members in particular. Again, I would like to thank all members of the House for their contribution to this debate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition supports the Public Service Amendment Bill 1996. It is, in its intention and execution, a very simple bill to correct a procedural flaw, the correction of which would have the unanimous support of the House. Therefore, I will speak about that only very briefly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, there is one concern that the opposition has had with the bill. We have considered it very carefully. We have received generous cooperation from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) and from the department in consideration of that concern and, on balance, we are prepared to accept the proposition the government puts with regard to that. Let me deal with those two things in detail, but not at length.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill proposes an amendment to the Public Service Act to deal with, as I said in my opening remarks, a procedural flaw. This procedural flaw arises in the discipline provisions of the act; it was never intended and, clearly, it is anomalous. We have a situation at the moment whereby the act does not enable the bringing of valid discipline charges against an officer of the Australian Public Service who has resumed duties in a department after a period as an unattached officer where the misconduct alleged took place when the officer was so unattached, as defined in the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nobody ever intended that there should be a circumstance in which an offence for which one was liable to be charged when it was committed should be open to a defence that the officer concerned had changed status between the offence and the laying of the charge and therefore in some way the officer should be protected from dealing with that charge in a manner that every other officer in the Public Service would have to confront. That was never the intention. It is simply an unintended consequence and we support the intention to correct it. I will waste no more time on that. In my view, everybody in the House and everybody I know in the Public Service supports that proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, why does the bill need any consideration at all? We could just pass it on the nod. It is because there is within the propositions an element of retrospectivity, and every time that arises everybody in the parliament on both sides, and the independent members, want to give that a lot of consideration. I know from discussion with the minister that that was a concern that he had. He took significant efforts to reassure himself that it was not an element of retrospectivity that was either unwarranted or adversely affected the rights of those affected in a way that should give concern to the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I took a lot of time and consulted with colleagues who have been associated with this both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. The Senate has a lot of history of dealing with this by virtue of the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee which examines all legislation for any matters that might affect the rights of a citizen, including retrospectivity.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="843">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most important factor in minimising any concern about retrospectivity is that a simple description of the anomaly we are correcting makes it clear that this bill, through proposed sections 63(L), 10 and 11, while it does give retrospective application to proposed subsection 9, in respect of persons who cease to be unattached officers or engaged in misconduct before the commencement of a subsection, does not create an offence that was not an offence at the time the incident occurred. The incident was an offence. What has changed is the removal of a technical defence, or a procedural defence, which the unattached officer might have had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not an irrelevant factor nevertheless, even though what we are saying is that the conduct, if it is an offence now, was an offence at the time it was committed. It is almost certain&mdash;I think it is beyond question&mdash;that the individual officer would have believed they were liable for action under the Public Service Act. I do not believe there was anybody out there saying, `Well, I can act in a way that would otherwise lead me to face disciplinary proceedings, because I have this procedural defence available to me that will protect me.' I do not think there is anybody who felt they were not in jeopardy and that their rights were not at risk who will confront an unexpected vulnerability to being charged under the Public Service Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principles that are involved, while they are important, need to be assessed against the circumstances of the individual piece of legislation. If we have a circumstance where any disciplinary procedure is, on its face, and in this instance in fact, retrospective, it is not a matter to be dealt with lightly. But, conversely, it is not a matter which should freeze us into inactivity. We are not endangering any right that anybody had or believed they had at the time of the offence. In so far as the incident occurred or the alleged offence might have taken place in any particular case, the ground rules are being subsequently changed, but not in any way that I believe offends the principle of retrospectivity that would give concern to the House or the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition, like the government, gave substantial consideration to whether this issue of retrospectivity was such that it should cause us not to support what would otherwise be an innocuous bill which we would support in a straightforward manner. On balance, we are convinced that the bill should proceed as proposed and that there is no need for the House to be so concerned with the retrospective application. I do not believe the Senate will consider it should take any particular action with regard to this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we support the bill, I do not think it will affect very many people. It is a rare circumstance, first, that anybody is charged under the Public Service Act at all or, secondly, that unattached officers are charged under the Public Service Act. It is even less common that they should then come back to their department as an attached officer in the period between the incident in question and the proceedings being initiated. By the time you had all those processes, it is a very rare circumstance that anybody is going to confront such a matter, but certainly it is conceivable and some of the possibilities might arise quite quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether or not that is the case, the public expects that the parliament will have the legislation in proper order so that, if an offence has taken place, proper proceedings can be initiated with regard to it without procedural defects providing procedural defences that do not go to the merits of the matter. For those reasons and, briefly, because that is what the circumstance warrants, the opposition will be supporting the bill and cooperating in its speedy passage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The standing and integrity of the Public Service must be at all times beyond reproach. That that is the case in relation particularly to people in the diplomatic corps goes without saying. The diplomatic corps is probably the most visible presence of our country overseas. Consequently, it is absolutely essential to ensure that legislation is in place which will work evenly both across members of that corps who may have been appointed by the Governor&hyphen;General and across the whole Public Service structure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no secret that, for a number of years, questions have been raised about the behaviour of some diplomats overseas, particularly in South&hyphen;East Asia. Cooperative international relations and the passing of Crimes Act legislation some years ago has now seen tourists being charged for interfering with children. Recently, a committal proceeding occurred here in Canberra where a former diplomat was charged with certain offences involving the exploitation and sexual abuse of children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a truism&mdash;as those involved in the criminal law are well aware&mdash;to say that charges of this nature are the easiest to make and often the most difficult to refute. However, I am not so sure that that principle necessarily applies in situations that we have experienced under the operation of this act. It is particularly acute when cultural and ethnic differences enter the equation and where there is a requirement for interpreters. Obviously, the best defence is frequently the assertion that the complainant was induced to make the complaint for monetary, accommodation or other considerations. I would think&mdash;and this is a wider issue, admittedly&mdash;that evidentiary provisions need to be introduced to permit the taking of evidence from children by way of video presentation, as is currently done in Queensland, for complaints of this nature. That does not prohibit cross&hyphen;examination of the complainant for the provisions to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Public Service Amendment Bill 1996 clarifies the presumption which underpins the parent legislation&mdash;that is, that unattached officers are liable to Public Service disciplinary procedures. It is a fairly reasonable assumption that this bill has flowed from some of the allegations that have arisen in recent times along the lines that I have mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill has particular application to the diplomatic corps. The act defines `unattached officer' for discipline purposes as an officer who is in employment outside the department and is not performing duty in the department, or an officer who is on certain types of leave of absence from the service and does not hold an office in the department. An officer ceases to be unattached upon resumption of duty in the department. Heads of Australian diplomatic missions who were officers of the service prior to becoming heads of diplomatic missions are unattached officers while performing the role of head of mission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been argued&mdash;and the argument appears to have been largely unresolved&mdash;that diplomats, although public servants per se, are not susceptible to Public Service disciplinary procedures. However, it equally can be argued that the intention always was that diplomats are public servants first and foremost and, therefore, should be liable to Public Service rules and guidelines. The existing legislation had exhibited a weakness in this respect, and the amending bill removes the doubt by making unattached officers expressly liable to Public Service disciplinary procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of retrospectivity, as has been mentioned by the honourable member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), is a very important one, and it is one on which I have reflected at some length. The government itself in fact teased out the potential problem, rather than any particular case situation having arisen. If it had arisen, and if there were particular case 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="845"> situations involved, I would have reflected much more strongly about the position I would take in relation to supporting the particular bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, having examined what had occurred, and having examined the fact that the government identified what was a potential problem and now seeks, by way of legislation, to entrench the already established view that unattached officers are in no different a position from that of run&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;mill public servants, my view is that it does not affect the rule against retrospectivity. In all of the circumstances, while these issues are never easy and require the utmost care, it is my view in this case that this particular piece of legislation does not impinge upon that very well settled principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill, in my submission, is a good bill. In effect, it demonstrates the keen perception of the department to ensure that this particular area does not go unattended and does not leave a potential anomaly in the legislation. It is important obviously, as I said at the very outset, that these particular matters are tidied up and that an even approach across the board is exhibited in respect of matters of this nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said right at the beginning, it is entirely correct for the insurance and maintenance of a respected Public Service that provisions of this nature apply across the board and can deal with a potential situation as and when it might arise. For all of those reasons, and accepting the reservations of the honourable member for Canberra and others in relation to the bill, I am satisfied that this particular bill does not transgress the principle against retrospectivity.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Public Service Amendment Bill 1996. My colleague the honourable member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) has well outlined the reasonable case for the bill. I want to say that this matter arises here before us because we have a whole series of very detailed regulations. Whenever we have legislation and regulations that deal in great detail with prescribing the actions of individuals, the circumstances under which they work, the circumstances under which they can be disciplined or dismissed and the circumstances under which they can transfer from one operation of a department, group or defined organisation to another, we wind up ultimately with problems and anomalies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that the world's simplest law was probably written back in biblical times. Yet, if you needed to modify one of the 10 commandments or describe all the circumstances now that might apply to that commandment, I suspect we might have volumes instead of one sheet of paper that has writ large the 10 commandments that came down from the mountain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was told that the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), in his contribution on Austudy in the main chamber of the House of Representatives this morning, referred to remarks I had made earlier about some detail of Austudy regulations. Without going into detail on that bill, as that would be inappropriate because we are dealing with the Public Service Amendment Bill at this particular point in time, I point out to this chamber that the point about the Austudy bill is that it is an attempt to define benefits and to prescribe who is eligible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, it is laudatory that we have as an objective to help with their living expenses students who do not have the means to go to university. As soon as we create a defined benefits scheme, we have to create rules. The rules create anomalies, the anomalies create anomalies, and then we have to write rules to address the anomalies. The more complex it gets, the further away we get from actually targeting the benefit to the individuals who really need it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="846">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sometimes we confuse ourselves, but today we are addressing an issue about a complex set of regulations. Those regulations cover such things as whether an unattached officer, who is still in the employ of the Commonwealth, who did something wrong and cannot be caught under the provisions of that detailed set of prescriptions and regulations, should be able to be caught when he comes back to work in the Commonwealth public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Public Service Act is a very complex, detailed set of rules and regulations. I am informed by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith), who has joined us here today, that those rules and regulations are so complex that we waste tens of thousands of man hours and hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars every year in dealing with the prescription of the regulation rather than trying to get the outcome that we are trying to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the Public Service Act, the outcome we are trying to achieve is to make sure that employees are treated fairly and reasonably, that they have the opportunity to move from one employment opportunity when they work for the Commonwealth to another employment opportunity, without having to resign or retire or go outside and then come back inside&mdash;to give them a chance. That is fair, but surely we should be able to make it simpler. As long as it is as complex as it is we will be in here time and time again rewriting the rules and regulations in order to deal with the anomalies. It is the anomalies that create more rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Have a look at superannuation. It was simple 25 years ago, was it not? I thought it was pretty simple, with a very tightly confined act, and today it is so complex that I defy you to find a single person in this nation who totally comprehends all of the superannuation regulations and details of that act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Public Service Amendment Bill is far too complex. It deals with such complex issues as how individuals relate to other individuals, how they work together&mdash;a long string of procedures that must be followed before a person who has really done something wrong or is not doing the job at all can be asked to work for someone else somewhere else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We used to call it the civil service. Then we called it the public service, and sometimes I wonder if the emphasis is on service to the public or in fact the emphasis is on the public service itself. It is the detail in the prescription that bothers me. I wish that we could simplify these matters and simply allow people to work together to achieve, if you will, better outcomes rather than to achieve the detail of prescription that is required by these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Deputy Speaker, under all the circumstances I certainly support the Public Service Amendment Bill. I deplore the fact that it is necessary to create this particular amendment bill. Be that as it may: it is, and it is here before us today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate on the Public Service Amendment Bill. I think it is fair to say that the contributions from the members for La Trobe (Mr Charles), Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) and Canberra (Mr McMullan) have been colourful, controversial, comprehensive and considered. The full range of issues has been covered. The comments from the member for Canberra I think were particularly succinct in setting out the essential issues contained and addressed in this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst there are many complex issues in the Public Service Act 1922 and the government has a general policy prescription of moving to streamline the operations and processes within 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="847"> the Public Service itself, in respect of this particular matter there is a fairly concise and easily stated problem that this legislation attempts to deal with. The current form of the disciplinary provisions does not enable disciplinary action to be taken against an officer who was but is no longer unattached in relation to possible misconduct that occurred while unattached. The proposed amendment to the act seeks to permit disciplinary action to be taken with respect to a formerly unattached officer as if he or she were still unattached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Canberra said, it does not create an offence but it does address a technical obstacle to the prosecution of matters pursuant to those disciplinary processes. He also canvassed the question of retrospectivity, as he referred to it, in his remarks. It was a matter that immediately caught my eye in the initial briefings that I had on the matter. We have fairly exhaustively sought advice and satisfied ourselves that the course of action does not in any way breach the standards and the general view which has been expressed by many on both sides of the House on the question of retrospectivity as it has been raised on other occasions in respect of other issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think more generally it is fair to say that, when you consider the question of retrospectivity, there is not necessarily a hard and fast rule. There are many legislative enactments which provide or have some retrospective effect. In fact, when you think of it, there are certainly legislative instruments that have a retrospective effect which is beneficial to the persons affected, and obviously in most circumstances they have no problems. The honourable member also referred to one of the tests when it comes to retrospectivity; that is, whether or not an individual had an expectation of the validity of their conduct at the particular time, and he made the point that no&hyphen;one could have had such an expectation of the validity of their acts given the nature of the offences which might come within these disciplinary provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of retrospectivity was also canvassed in the Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, and I think it gives added reassurance to members that the conclusions that were come to on both sides of the House are reasonable and proper in all of the circumstances. Madam Deputy Speaker, I appreciate the support that we have had and the cooperation from all members, including the member for Canberra. I commend the bill to the Main Committee and then to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will be supporting the Crimes and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. The bill amends a number of minor provisions in various pieces of Commonwealth criminal legislation. The opposition is of the view that we should support those particular corrections and amendments. The Attorney&hyphen;General and Minister for Justice (Mr Williams), in his second reading speech, outlined a number of bills to be amended. I think it will be worth while, shortly, to go to some of those provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="848">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Crimes Act 1914 is to be amended, taking into account item 9 of schedule 1. It will increase the penalty unit of all Commonwealth offences from $100 to $110. This is in accordance with a CPI increase of 9.6 per cent during the period June 1992 to September 1995, the period since penalty units were originally introduced. So this mean spirited government, in many other respects, is now going to index penalty units. I wonder whether this is going to be a continuing thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition supports the amendments on this occasion but I put the government on notice that we will look at this in the future. I do not think it is good policy to be indexing penalty units or fines on a regular basis. As someone who practised as a legal aid solicitor, and a legal aid barrister, my view is that, in many instances, a maximum fine is not imposed and that magistrates and judges award something lesser.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only reason that we would want to change the penalty units is if it is fairly obvious that we need to look at a particular penalty or range of penalties that need a substantial increase. For instance, in New South Wales recently, we had the instance where people were invading the pitch at the Sydney Cricket Ground. It was felt that the penalty of $100 was too small and so for a deterrence effect it has been agreed by all political parties that that penalty be increased to $5,000. I think that is a better approach than the government coming back to the parliament every so often and saying, `Let's have a CPI increase for these penalties.' But, in this instance, the opposition is certainly not opposing that provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important piece of legislation being corrected, which we agree with, is the Extradition Act 1988. It is to be amended in two minor ways, which are outlined in the Attorney&hyphen;General's second reading speech, to correct deficiencies in present provisions. The Attorney said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first amendment will make it clear that, if a person makes an application for bail on the merits and fails, the person is not able to make a further application unless there is evidence of a change in circumstances that might justify bail being granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, where a magistrate remands a person in custody after the person has made an application for bail, the person is not entitled to apply to any other magistrate for release on bail during that remand. That would be unfair if the person's circumstances change such that bail would be justified but the original magistrate is no longer available, for example, if the original magistrate had resigned or retired. The amendment will overcome this deficiency while still achieving the purpose of restricting `magistrate-shopping.'</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I know that there is concern in the community about magistrate shopping, but also I think that those of us who have appeared in courts know that there are some magistrates for whom the standard is not consistent. There are magistrates, frankly, who have refused bail in certain circumstances where it was not warranted. That can be reviewed by appeal to the Supreme Court in New South Wales, for instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I am against magistrate shopping or forum shopping, we need to understand that there are different standards applied by some magistrates&mdash;there are some magistrates who are considered doves, and it is the same with judges. But it is a ridiculous situation if people are able to come back time and time again when there are no fresh circumstances in relation to bail. If a determination has been made, then so be it. But let us not be under the misapprehension that magistrates or judges always get it right. Sometimes it is beneficial, if there has not been any other change of circumstances, for people to come back if time has elapsed. The change of circumstances might be&mdash;and it can be picked up anyway&mdash;that trial dates go off or certain assumptions that a magistrate was acting under have not been followed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="849">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just raise that because of the assumptions we all make. Judges and magistrates are human. The community needs to understand that, just as we politicians bring our different experiences to the parliament, so do magistrates, so do judges. There is nothing inherently wrong with different sentences or one magistrate refusing bail, or one magistrate granting bail, and it is not alleging that the system is corrupt or whatever. But I do believe that I have seen some cases which illustrate what I am saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had such an instance with the allegations about Pauline Hanson being spat at by young Aboriginal children. I read the other day that, when one of those children came before the court, it was discovered that the offence for which they were kept in custody had been repealed, was non&hyphen;existent. That is not necessarily applicable to this, but what I am saying is that magistrates are fallible. One has to ask what was wrong on the first occasion. Why did the magistrate not go to first principles? That is something that I know that some of us who have practised always did, making sure that the charge was still alive. It is easy to criticise from the sidelines; all I am saying is that sometimes there is not a change in circumstances. The change in that instance would have been a discovery that the charge did not exist and you would have brought them back before the court. But I am straying a little bit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are minor technical amendments and we think that they should be facilitated, and facilitated quickly. We know that there might be some criticism. I notice that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alert</EMPHASIS> is critical of the retrospective nature of one of the clauses. That has to do with the War Crimes Tribunal's act, but we support that. That is being backdated to 28 August 1995, but those provisions, we understand, were inserted through a typographical error by way of the International War Crimes Tribunal Act 1995, which commenced on that day. That is an instance where we think the retrospectivity is warranted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of other amendments to the Australian Federal Police Act 1979, the Customs Act 1901, the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 and the Witness Protection Act 1994. All of those things the opposition supports. There is no hidden agenda here. Some of those things were not necessarily known at the time and it is only over time that the errors, be they drafting errors or whatever, have been discovered. So the opposition is happy to support this bill. I will be the only speaker; it is not controversial. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In following the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) in the Main Committee, I note that it seems that the proceedings in the Main Committee attract more lawyers than some of the proceedings on bills in the other place, the main chamber. The particular amendments to the Crimes and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, if I can summarise them as briefly as I can, relate to the aggregation and cumulative sentences imposed for corruption offences by Commonwealth employees and Australian Federal Police members and staff members, so that they can be brought within the scope of sentences which trigger the cancellation of employer funded superannuation benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sentences imposed as an alternative to full&hyphen;time imprisonment will not trigger the cancellation of employer funded superannuation benefits. The penalty unit issue has already been mentioned. The following are also dealt with: the Commonwealth being able to recover the costs it incurs in relation to storage and maintenance of confiscated goods such as vehicles and vessels used in drug trafficking; a requirement that a person who has been arrested, having escaped from custody, under the Extradition Act is to be taken before a magistrate who may issue a warrant authorising the return of the person to custody; provisions for extensions of time to be granted for the making of an application in relation to property restrained under 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="850"> the Proceeds of Crimes Act; making a defence of reasonable corporate precaution for offences committed by bodies corporate under the Proceeds of Crimes Act; minor technical corrections to the Proceeds of Crimes Act and the Witness Protection Act; and the requirement to obtain ministerial consent to institute prosecutions under various Commonwealth statutes being removed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as aggregate and cumulative offences are concerned, this deals with the amendment to the Australian Federal Police Act and the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act. Both these acts provide for the cancellation of employer funded superannuation if the offender is convicted of an offence and sentenced to more than 12 months imprisonment. The amendments seek to overcome the situation where a person may receive sentences on separate counts that individually are less than 12 months. In other words, prior to the amendments, the superannuation order would not have been made, would not have been capable of being made, in a situation where individual sentences are less than 12 months, for example, but over the whole are much more than 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the current practices of the court in imposing sentences, with sentences either being cumulative or concurrent, and the aggregate in some cases being over the 12 months, the amendment is in my view quite appropriate. Now the whole of the sentence is taken into account and the superannuation order may be made. Under further amendments the superannuation order may not be made if the sentence imposed is an alternative to full&hyphen;time incarceration, even if that sentence is longer than 12 months.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SK6">Mr TONY SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, the strings of amendments in relation to this matter are fairly extensive, but the effect of the amendment under section 45(2)&mdash;I think it is&mdash;is that a superannuation order may not be made against a person who is convicted of a corruption offence and receives a sentence, for example, of periodic detention, under subsection 20(A)(B) of the Crimes Act, even if the sentence is for a period longer than 12 months. I will have something to say about that shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a general proposition, offenders who are guilty of a corruption offence under the Australian Federal Police Act have, in reality, usurped their position to commit their offences and should not, as a matter of principle, reap the benefits of any employee funded superannuation entitlements. In Queensland, we had the notorious case of the disgraced police commissioner, Terry Lewis. There was considerable litigation over his quite massive entitlement to superannuation. Ultimately, as a result of that quite considerable litigation, he did not get his superannuation. I believe this particular amendment will clarify the matter more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, the employee, being a person who has used his office to profit by it, or to commit acts which are obviously a gross offence to the integrity of the system, ought not be given a handshake in another sense, as a result of his position of trust and so forth. It is true to say that, if people are minded to commit offences of this nature, the loss of their benefits would not necessarily be a deterrent. If they are caught for the principal offence they will go to prison, particularly if they are police officers. However, this provision ensures that they will suffer financially when they are released. Obviously, if the government does not have to pay the money, it can use the money for more appropriate purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A superannuation order may be revoked if the sentence is reduced or changed to a term not exceeding 12 months. The issue about the amendment that I referred to earlier is one that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="851"> needs some consideration, but does it go far enough? In these particular cases, the Director of Public Prosecutions cannot make an application for a superannuation order. Just because a person is given home detention does not mean that the crime committed was any less serious. Periodic detention and even a suspension of sentence frequently occur in cases of quite serious crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it would be very difficult to imagine that a police officer who had been convicted of official corruption would be given a periodic detention order or some form of a suspended sentence. Indeed, in what I would have called a fairly minor case of official corruption, a police officer in Queensland had a sentence of 2&half; years imposed. Obviously, this would vary according to the nature of the corruption but, at the very bottom end, I would think that the 2&half; years was imposed without remission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In determining sentences, the court takes into account many factors, not the least of which is the seriousness of the offence. In relation to mitigation, the court takes into account personal factors. I suspect that the operation of this section may need to be looked at again so that the courts are given a discretion. In my view, the court, and this is not a criticism so much as a suggestion, should be able to act of its own motion. In other words, it gives the court a greater discretion. I know that many judges describe the sentencing process as the most difficult part of their judicial life. I am perhaps compounding it even further but I think some element of discretion needs to be applied in this particular area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Banks mentioned penalty units and the CPI. I find it difficult to disagree with his general proposition. If this legislation were merely to increase the penalty units in accordance with the CPI, I think it would be stretching into flights of fancy. However, it is in conjunction with other measures and I do not necessarily say anything other than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of recovery of out&hyphen;of&hyphen;pocket expenses also, I think, requires a little bit of comment. This relates to the expenses incurred relating to the transportation and storage of narcotic related goods that are placed in commercial storage facilities prior to the goods being transferred to the official trustee for disposal. It is interesting that the amendment is limited to this extent. The amendment does not extend to full cost recovery for the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth will not be entitled to recover expenses of staff remuneration such as salary expenses, nor is it entitled to recover expenses that are an ordinary incident of its operation. Ordinary, everyday running costs such as office expenses, telephone and facsimile expenses, et cetera are not recoverable. Rather, it is the extraordinary costs such as the costs of transportation of narcotic related goods to a place of storage and the actual storage charges that are recoverable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There may be some circumstances, however, where additional costs, which arguably could be out of the ordinary, might relate to the travel of police officers. For example, a police officer who may be on secondment or what have you may necessarily be involved in extensive travel. Could it be argued that that is recoverable because it is `out of the ordinary' costs? I would hope so, because I think the net should be cast as wide as reasonably possible in cases such as this, particularly where the value of the security being held is well in excess of the cost incurred and where the value of the drugs involved is quite massive. There are a lot of comparisons, I would suggest, that ought to be made in relation to that particular matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Extradition Act has also been mentioned by my friend from Banks. The interesting comments that the honourable member made in relation to magistrate shopping were very true. It is the case that not all magistrates exercise discretion in a standard way. It is a discretion 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="852"> after all. It is true that going to one magistrate on a fairly pedestrian bail application is sometimes a very nauseating experience because the result is always foretold. You know exactly what is going to happen. But going to another magistrate, you know that, while you may not succeed, you will get the sort of hearing that one would come to expect in those sorts of applications. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that at common law, in fact, the very people going and seeking bail, which in effect is in the nature of habeas corpus&mdash;in a sense, you are seeking the release of a person&mdash;were able to go to different judges and shop around and do that. It was not frowned upon at all. Indeed, the Queensland Bail Act does permit that to occur. In practice, of course, the reality is that, if you went to one particular judge and then later that day went to another judge, I would not like your chances before that second judge once he was informed&mdash;as he would have been&mdash;that the application was refused before judge A. I sometimes wonder about the legislative notion about magistrate shopping, because the common law, in my view, had taken care of that fairly well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the restraining of property of defendants charged with certain offences, the amendment is sensible in my view. This obviously is a problem area. The previous legislation made it necessary for persons to get their application in before the court within the six&hyphen;month period, otherwise the court had no jurisdiction to hear the application. Obviously, that caused an awful clogging of the lists of the court. That could not really cause anything other than problems for the rest of the court lists. In other words, this is a very sensible amendment in my view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next issue is the defence of reasonable corporate precaution. This amendment relates to a situation where a company is vicariously liable for employees unless the company can establish that it took reasonable precautions and exercised due diligence to avoid the conduct of the employees. I do ask a question on this one. Is this an evidentiary onus requiring proof by the Crown to negative on the balance of probabilities that reasonable corporate precaution was taken, or is it a situation where the corporation must show&mdash;and, if so, to what degree is it on the balance of probabilities&mdash;that reasonable corporate precaution was taken? This is an area that I am not sure of and I ask the Attorney&hyphen;General and Minister for Justice (Mr Williams) to clarify that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Witness Protection Act amendment is also, in my view, a good one and I do not think I need comment further. The consent to prosecute raises a couple of questions. Originally the acts under consideration required the consent of the minister if a person wished to institute a private prosecution. I suspect, although I do not know, that this was introduced following the amendment that was made in Queensland in the late 1970s, arising out of the famous case of Plunkett v. Bjelke&hyphen;Petersen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That case was a private prosecution brought by a colleague, Mr Mark Plunkett, against Joh Bjelke&hyphen;Petersen in relation to the student bashing incident that occurred in Coronation Drive during one of the street marches. I suspect that that spawned a lot of legislation around the country in relation to frivolous and vexatious private prosecutions. I am not saying that that was a frivolous and vexatious prosecution but I am saying that that is probably where it started.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question I have&mdash;very quickly; I apologise for taking as long as this&mdash;relates to this particular notion. In relation to consent by a minister to private prosecution, obviously political pressure can sometimes enter in. But does the amendment mean that, in relation to the offences where these acts are involved, no private prosecution can be brought? In other words, are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="853"> people really relying on the Director of Public Prosecutions to exercise his or her discretion to commence a prosecution? If that is the case, that could be a matter that is not necessarily a good thing. I would be interested to hear the arguments in relation to that, because there is obviously greater political pressure that can be exercised on the minister than on the Director of Public Prosecutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a fairly complex and extensive series of amendments. In general I do not have a difficulty with them. I support the measures that have been introduced, save in so far as I have raised queries.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the proposed amendments are quite wide ranging, I wish to concentrate my speech today and tomorrow mainly on the amendment that relates to the Customs Act 1901 in which the Commonwealth will be able to recover costs associated with storage and maintenance of confiscated goods that are being used in conjunction with some form of drug trafficking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst other aspects of this legislation touch on the issue of sentences in relation to superannuation benefits in particular, I plan to speak specifically about sentencing in the context of the real need to impose harsher sentencing, most particularly for crimes associated with drug trafficking. As far as I am concerned, any legislation which addresses any issue of crime is highly important. I always take an interest in any legislation to do with crime and I welcome any opportunity to discuss this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, within my electorate of Cowan, crime is a major problem creating concerns of fear and uncertainty within the community. The community of Cowan has been very active in addressing the issue and I have made representations on its behalf to local police and the commissioner concerning issues within the electorate. I would also like to point out that I actively support the neighbourhood watch programs and in this small way support the community in its fight against crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although strictly a state issue, I believe that the issue of crime and crime rates has to be addressed as a whole community and addressed so that we can identify solutions for community safety, whether they be legislative, social policy  or judicial. I believe the federal parliament has an important role to play in this whole process. Last year, for instance, the federal parliament acted quite properly in addressing the gun issue and I believe the broader community is safer, whether actually or in perception. They are in fact much safer in perception for the action that we took as a government, supported by the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Crime is a community issue and all forms of the community have a responsibility for seeking solutions. The amendment to the Customs Act 1901 which we debate today is a small step. It will mean the Commonwealth is able to recover expenses it incurs in relation to the transportation and storage of narcotic related goods that are condemned and placed in commercial storage facilities prior to the goods being transferred to the official trustee for disposal. Narcotic related goods are, as I understand it, various vehicles or materials that may be used in drug trafficking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I would like to address some of the crime problems facing my electorate which it appears may be drug related and therefore impacted by this amendment. In my own electorate of Cowan, crime unfortunately is a major issue. It is a sad reality that many of the crimes committed can be related directly to drug problems.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="854">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only recently I received a letter from a constituent, saying that he heard gunfire within his particular suburb on an average of twice a week. Whether that precise summation is an actuality or not is quite inconsequential. My constituent was concerned and frightened enough to write to me and express a concern. This constituent, Mr Bell, a Vietnam veteran, wrote to me. I quote from his letter where he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We hear gunfire in this suburb on an average of twice a week (I have been on the receiving end of rifle fire enough times to know what it sounds like). These are some of your minority who like the thousands of others have escaped your tougher gun laws.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Bell does have a point and I believe we must turn our thinking towards the penalties for drug traffickers, in getting tougher and getting angrier about the people who deal in drugs. That gunshots occur within a suburb at all is a disturbing reality. This government has, as I said before, already gone a long way towards addressing that problem but it is obvious that gun related problems will take time to properly clear up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members may be aware that the electorate of Cowan covers some of the northern suburbs of Perth. In these regions there are substantial levels of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, which can all too often result in bored or young individuals turning to drugs and drug related crime. I have some statistics regarding drug usage which I will speak about later. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V5">Mr Williams</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) At the Australasian Police Ministers' Council (APMC) meeting on 10 May 1996, all State and Territory Police Ministers agreed that at the conclusion of the national compensation and amnesty scheme, each jurisdiction would have severe penalties for breaches for the firearms control laws. It was further agreed that, to the extent practicable, the penalties should be uniform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the national level, a public education campaign has commenced to persuade firearm owners to hand in prohibited firearms and to encourage compliance with the new firearms legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) At its meeting of 17 July 1996, the APMC agreed that jurisdictions may consider not applying any requirement for licensing or registration of collection firearms manufactured before 1900, and for which cartridge ammunition is not commercially 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> available. This is a matter for the individual State and Territory Governments to determine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The APMC agreed on 17 July 1996 that firearms manufactured after 1900 held in a collection must be rendered temporarily incapable of use by removal and separate secure storage of the bolt and/or firing pin or, if not feasible, by an appropriate trigger lock. Ministers further agreed that Category D firearms in a collection must be rendered permanently inoperable, and that jurisdictions may require Category C collection firearms to be rendered permanently inoperable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The APMC has not addressed requirements for hand grenade collections. This is a matter for-consideration by the individual State and Territory Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) There is no specific guideline on this matter. On 10 May 1996, the APMC agreed upon the following minimum basic standards for the secure storage of firearms and ammunition:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Licence Category A and B: storage in a locked receptacle constructed of either hard wood or steel with a thickness to ensure it is not easily penetrable. If the weight is less than 150 kilograms the receptacle shall be fixed to the frame of the floor or wall so as to prevent easy removal. The locks fitted to these receptacles shall be of sturdy construction;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Licence Category C, D and H: storage in a locked, steel safe with a thickness to ensure it is not easily penetrable, bolted to the structure of a building; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> all ammunition must be stored in locked containers separate from any firearms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The APMC further agreed that a firearms owner who wished to store firearms through other measures would have the burden of persuading the firearms regulatory authority that he or she can provide a level of security not less than that required by the relevant approved standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board ("the Board") has been involved in the development stages of the new firearms legislation in all States and Territories. The Board will continue to monitor the legislation to ensure that the APMC agreements are implemented and remain in place. As noted at the APMC meeting on 15 November 1996, the Australian Institute of Criminology has agreed to monitor and evaluate the new firearms controls. As 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="856"> part of this process, I have requested the Australian Institute of Criminology to prepare a detailed analysis of the State and Territory legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no common legislation as such, nor is there a "standard national firearms legislative approach". It is up to each State and Territory Government to decide whether to incorporate the APMC agreements into existing legislation or to draft new legislation based upon the agreements.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr Sharp</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) I am not aware of the specific comments reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Parkes Champion Post</EMPHASIS>  of 18 November 1996. However, the Government has closely considered the Inland Marketing Corpo 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ration's (IMC) proposal for the establishment of an inland international air freight facility at Parkes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)&hyphen;(4) The IMC has not provided any evidence of any intention by any international airline to operate services to Parkes. On the basis of current and projected freight flows and the economics of operating dedicated international freight aircraft, it is considered implausible that any international flights would operate to Parkes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The IMC projections must be balanced against the reality of the airfreight market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently there is approximately 9,400 tonnes per week of air freight capacity offered on outbound services from Australia. About 8,100 tonnes of this total (or 86 per cent) is operated in the belly holds of passenger aircraft. Of the nearly 700 scheduled international services per week to/from Australia, there are only 26 dedicated freighters operated and of these only 15 operate traffic rights (ie take on loads) out of Australia each week. The focus of operations of these dedicated freighters is to Sydney and Melbourne with Adelaide and Perth each receiving only one international freighter service per week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Brisbane and Cairns are two rapidly growing international freight gateways. In the year ended 30 June 1996 Brisbane airport handled 34,753 tonnes of exports and 15,948 tonnes of imports while Cairns handled 6,636 tonnes of exports and 578 tonnes of imports. Despite this level of business and being in close proximity to some of the most productive agricultural production and export regions in Australia, neither airport can attract dedicated international freighter operations. The freight is carried in the belly holds on international passenger services. Accordingly, Parkes is unlikely to attract dedicated freight aircraft when these major airports, with established freight operations and infrastructure are unable to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Transport has undertaken a detailed analysis of the IMC's throughput projections. The Department's analysis highlights that the IMC's export projections are based on attracting some 90% of the existing market of agricultural produce from NSW, Victoria and South Australia where its costs are competitive. This is considered extremely unlikely to be able to be realised.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr Howard</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) On 26 November 1996, the Government presented its submission to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (the ACCC) review of the authorisations for the newsagency distribution arrangements in New South Wales/the Australian Capital Territory, Queensland and Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The submission fulfils the Government's pre&hyphen;election commitment to support the home delivery system for newspapers. This system is currently authorised under competition law because the public benefits have been held to outweigh the anti&hyphen;competitive aspects of the system. The submission outlines the Government's views as to the benefits that derive from an efficient, low cost home delivery system for newspapers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The submission proposes that the present authorisations be allowed to continue for another 4 years. After that time, it is envisaged that publishers and newsagents would be free to seek new authorisations, which would be assessed in light of any structural change which has occurred during that time. The submission acknowledges that the Government cannot direct the publishers on the distribution channels for their publications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) No publishers are known to have expressed an intention to withdraw from existing distribution arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Advertiser Newspapers Ltd, publisher of the Advertiser in South Australia, has sought the ACCC's approval for revised distribution arrangements. However, the Advertiser has asked that a decision on the proposal be held in abeyance pending developments in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Subsection 101(1) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (along with Regulation 20 of the Trade Practices Regulations) provides that a person dissatisfied with a determination by the ACCC in relation to the revocation of an authorisation may, within 21 days of the date of the determination, apply to the Tribunal for a review of the determi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nation. If the Tribunal is satisfied the person has a sufficient interest, the Tribunal shall review the determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) In November 1994 the Australian Competition Tribunal considered a determination of the Trade Practices Commission (now the ACCC) in relation to revised arrangements for the distribution of the publications of the Age and Herald and Weekly Times groups in Victoria. The determination of the Trades Practices Commission was made in 1993 following a fresh application for authorisation of a system designed to replace the then system, which was authorised by the Trade Practices Commission in 1982. The Tribunal set aside the 1993 determination of the Trade Practices Commission. As a result, the system authorised by the Trade Practices Commission in 1982 continued to operate. The findings of the Tribunal regarding the anti&hyphen;competitive effects and the public benefits of the system in that matter led the ACCC to commence a formal review of the authorisation for Victoria and, because of the similarity of arrangements, those for New South Wales/the Australian Capital Territory, Queensland and Victoria.</PARA>
